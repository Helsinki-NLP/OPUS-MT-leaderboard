Last minute: Our Cosmic Visitor Giant Asteroids 2014 JO25
There are billions of giant asteroids in the solar system that could cause serious consequences when it hits.
These objects that can have closed or open orbits from the formation of the Sun can sometimes cross Earth.
The asteroid within 650 meters is a visitor like this at 2014 JO25, and today at 2: 24 p.m., it will pass by 1.75 million miles, which is the closest to Earth.
We've heard more and more of this kind of news every day.
The most important reason for this is observation techniques and development in surveillance devices.
So we have the ability to determine smaller-sized asteroids that have never been determined before.
For example, last January, an asteroid the size of a bus passed only half the distance of the Earth and the Moon (~ 250,000 km).
And even more interesting asteroid was determined only a few days before the transition.
So there could be other cosmic buses that are coming at us right now.
Imagine if you get word that an asteroid within 20 meters will fall right in the middle of your neighborhood, what do you do?
In fact, asteroids this size won't destroy your neighborhood, but probably all the buildings will explode.
This will be caused by shock waves from an asteroid that will explode in the atmosphere.
For example, in 2013, the asteroid that fell in Russia was this size, and it was enough to tear apart the windows of buildings in several cities.
But if you have a neighborhood on the target of a 100-meter asteroid, your advice is to go at least 50 km from your neighborhood.
Critics such as the size of the asteroid and the angle of impact are the factors that determine the depth of the crater and the damage to the impact.
According to the simulation of the European Space Agency, let's take a look at a few scenarios.
If a 100-foot asteroid hits Earth at a 45-degree angle at 60 km per second, it creates a crater with about 250 meters deep and 1,200 meters diameter.
The impact is equal to 6 degrees of earthquake according to the Richter scale, and even if you're 10 km from the impact point, you have a third degree burn in your body.
The ones that are about 50 miles away will be waiting for shattered window windows.
If an asteroid hits a mile wide, the situation becomes even more depressing.
If an asteroid like this hits Earth with the same angle and speed value, it creates a crater about 600 meters deep and 12 km across.
So a whole neighborhood turns into a crater and disappears instantly.
Even if you're 100 km from the impact point due to the heat, you get a third degree burn in your body.
Impact is equivalent to an earthquake at 8 degrees per Richter scale.
The damage to the asteroid depends not only on the chemical composition of the asteroid, but also on the rocky structure of the area where it's going to crash.
The values above were given from a scenario that occurred when a hard rock-like asteroid fell into a region of tortul rocks.
If the asteroid is mostly made of iron, if it falls to a surface formed by lava, the crater size will increase by three times, and the disaster that occurs depending on it will also endure.
66 million years ago, something worse happened to the dinosaurs, and they were exposed to a disaster caused by the impact of an asteroid about 10 km across.
Due to asteroid impact, 75% of sea and land creatures were immediately destroyed.
If such a large asteroid that destroys dinosaurs targeted Earth, I assure you, the strongest option is to leave the planet.
There are tons of materials falling from space to Earth every day.
Most of them burn down in the atmosphere.
Some asteroids that are big enough burn in the atmosphere and cause flashes known as star shifting among the public.
Let's end this with another piece of news that will make our writing more comfortable.
Studies show that over the next 300 to 400 years, a massive asteroid that will cause serious devastation is not expected to hit Earth.
As the average 70-year-old creatures, I'm sure you're relieved.
Flash claim for Medel: 10 million euros!
Gary Medel, who is determined to leave Inter, the name on the Black-White agenda, who wants to reinforce the Stoker area...
The 30-year-old footballer who went on vacation after wearing a uniform at the Confederate Cup in Chile and recently started working with Inter is waiting for offers to come to him.
Gazzetta dello Sport, a prestigious Italian newspaper, said Besiktaş made a 10 million-euro offer to Inter for Medel, who can serve both the stoper and the front liberal region.
The Black-White people who presented their offer to Medel said they were waiting for answers from both sides, while the Chilean football player was looking forward to living with his family in Istanbul.
Despite Gazzetta's claim, it is difficult to pay a price like 10m euros for Medel, the Black Eagle, which is an FFP limit.
There's a chance that black-white people will be able to move to Medel via rent, like in the Caner Erkin transfer, or bring the star player into the cast if they go to a serious discount in his bonservice.
Beşiktaş Negredo reported his transfer to the stock market
Human rights group has issued a travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for Progress of Colourful People has issued a warning for people who will travel to Missouri due to the state's separatist policies and racist attacks.
"The State of Missouri's NAACP Travel Promotion Declaration provides special attention and caution to African-American travelers, visitors and Missouri, as it has been stated there recently, as racial-based events have been happening throughout the state."
NAACP said a new Missouri law has made it difficult for people to win discrimination cases, but it is also effective for the group to target minorities without proportion of law enforcement.
"There are human rights violations that happen to people.
They are stopped by the color of their skin, beaten and killed, "he said, adding that the head of Missouri NAACP to Kansan City Star was Rod Chapel.
"We hear complaints that we've never heard before."
For the first time, the Association has issued such a warning for a state in the United States.
The group cited racial insults against black students at Missouri University and the death of Tory Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
At the beginning of this year, Sanders was arrested and killed under suspicious circumstances by the Missouri police after his fuel ran out.
The recommendation also points to a new report that the Missouri Attorney's Office shows that black drivers in the state are likely to be stopped by 75 per cent more than white people.
"The recommendation is for people to be awake and warn their families, their friends and colleagues that they will be in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People should be prepared to bring bail with them, to inform their relatives that they will pass through this state."
According to the latest figures in the FBI's hate crimes report programme in Missouri, 100 hate crimes were committed in 2015; that puts the state in line with 16 in terms of the number of similar violations.
The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law where a business is more difficult to sue for discrimination while renting housing or doing business.
Earlier, the American Civil Liberation Union (ACLU) issued travel advice for Texas and Arizona after local labor authorities passed immigration laws ordering people to arrest for immigration violations; ACLU says it will increase practices according to race.
Traveling warnings are usually published by the State Department for other countries, but recently, defence groups have applied to a number of laws and trends within the United States.
Demba Ba in Beşiktaş, over.
Demba Ba, who was transferred to Shanghai Shenhua for 13 million euros two seasons ago and was hired to Black-White in the last season, returns to Beşiktaş without price.
Last week, the Black Eagle asked for a detailed health report from the Senegal player, followed by the report from the star football player.
The Black-White administration, which began working for the 32-year-old player the Chinese representative didn't think about next season, knocked on the door of Shanghai's team.
Not on the list
Demba Ba, who was not listed because of his foreign status in China, told the administration that he wanted to go back to Black-White.
The Chinese team approved the departure of a 32-year-old player.
Senegal football player is expected to come to Turkey in the coming days and sign the official contract.
Castillo was operated on in Trabzonsport.
"Our post-op player, carried out by Prof. Dr. Uður Haklar, is expected to start training with the team within four weeks," the Bordo-blue club's website said in a statement on Istanbul Liv Hospital.
Castillo was injured by the right-hand island at the Dutch team Heerenveen prep match at Slovakia camp in the bordo-blue team.
The Colombian player, who was announced to stay out of the field for three or four weeks because of his treatment, was also scheduled to be operated on due to the meniscus problem he had before.
The referendum exit from Barzan!
Barzani held a speech at the memorial ceremony in Duhok for the 3rd anniversary of the attack on the Ezidians in Mosul district of the terrorist organisation.
"I regret to inform you that we have no hope that Iraq will be a proper and decent country," Barzani said in his speech, referring to the independence referendum IKBY wanted to organise on September 25th.
We've tried all the roads with Iraq, but we're completely helpless and desperate.
The past experiences with Iraq have put us in this position, and there's no guarantee that we can take our rights and be protected.
So in order to ensure life and security together, we all have to show the world that we can determine our destiny through the referendum.
And I have to emphasize that the referendum is not a goal for us, but a tool for us to achieve a larger goal.
Barzani, who reminded the Iraqi central government of making many promises to the Kurds after the collapse of Baas Rejimi, said a direct referendum was issued following the fight against the DEA.
"With documents, Iraq cannot protect or protect us like a state," Barzani said, expressing that the people of IKBY want to decide their fate peacefully and democratically for their own protection and development.
"He doesn't want us to move forward."
Barzani noted that the Iraqi central government did not give them weapons during the fight against the terrorist organisation, but that Hashdi Shabi, who was formed with a conquest in a short time, was immediately legitioned and all the weapons were provided:
In Iraq's defence system, Tezmerge has not been discussed.
The central government didn't do what he offered to Hashdi Shabi.
Tezmerge is considered part of Iraq's defence system, according to the constitution.
However, all possibilities have been mobilized by breaking laws when Hashdi Shabi has no presence in the constitution.
We're not saying we're against Hashdi Shabi.
Tahmerge and Hashdi Shabi fought on the same front, but why on the other hand, Hashdi Shabi is legitimized, while the existence and the struggle for terrorism are being covered up.
These are Our deep wounds with Baghdad.
On August 3, 2014, the terrorist organisation launched an attack on the Ezidians in Mosul's Sincar district and killed a lot of people including women and children.
By 10 minutes, he's back from the disaster.
According to the BBC, the Air France airline Boeing 777 was west of Hokkaido, north of Japan, while North Korea's missile was in the air.
The missile crashed into the area where the plane was 10 minutes ago, officials said the missile was estimated to be within 100 to 150 km of the plane.
Air France noted that the missile did not cross the course of the plane and that there was no problem with the flight.
"At this point, the information we have shows that the missile fell into the sea more than 100 kilometers from the plane's route," the statement said.
Ain't nothing sacred?
Trump's White House is now targeting the Statue of Liberty
The most precise sign of a regime change is that they start attacking statues.
The Americans know as much as any of them; as Saddam Hussein, who was carefully staged, was knocked over in the Firedos Square in Baghdad in 2003...
Stephen Miller, one of the key founders of the Trump regime, knew exactly what he was doing when CNN's Jim Acosta and the president were symbolizing the Statue of Liberty in a heated debate about the proposed strict restrictions on legal migration.
To be fair, Miller didn't attack the statue himself.
If he did, he'd have been lynched by a bunch of boat drivers and freedom imposter.
But he attacked his meaning, and especially in 1903, when the monument was completed, 17 years after Emma Lazarus' famous poem was added to the memorial floor, which meant it was attributed to him.
"I don't want to talk history all over this place, but the Statue of Liberty... is the ridiculous symbol of American freedom to the world.
The poem you're talking about is later added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "
Miller's right, but as he says, it's really not about history.
This is about the modern echoing of Lazarus's frightening words, not only does a state invite some old immigrants, but also the poor, poor, / clogged masses desire to take the breath of freedom, / the wretched unwelcome of snow. "
There's never been a time when "miserable unwelcome" was so visible on our screens.
Miller didn't bring literary criticism; these people were not welcome in Trump's United States.
The conflict about the meaning of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural war: it's actually a conflict about the meaning of America.
After Lazarus and his death, his friends who were campaigning to put his words on the bottom of the statue knew very well that they had taken a very political action.
The statue intended to celebrate the connections between French and American republicity by representing the arrival of freedom in the form of women with a stereotypical metaphor.
Lazarus changed that meaning: in his poem, the female figure was no longer abstract, he had a voice.
And he gives himself a very different name: the mother of the exiled.
The poetry's marriage to the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on the anti-American immigrant.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right-wing people have wanted to change it for a long time.
In 2010, Rush Limbaugh, a great Baptist John type for Trump's arrival, argued that freedom did not invite anyone in but that it was an early neocon that kept more American fire in the dark: "Miss Freedom is coming forward.
He exists to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not to illuminate the path to the United States. "
In a very unusual way, Limbaugh actually discovered something.
The meaning of the statue was all about perception.
Lazarus's wonderful creative act was to see it as it was seen after long and often terrible travels by exhausted, miserable but hopeful people on board of ships.
It was really about seeing the world through the perspective of people looking for shelter and wanting to improve their lives.
His statue responded to them with words of hope and a warm welcome they needed to hear.
Of course, it's not a perspective that Miller and Trump will find right in any way.
Not to guide them, but to incite them to hate, their only source of strength.
World Championship 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the Great Britain team
Eilidh Doyle remembers when only two Scots could join the Great Britain team.
Neil Black, director of the United Kingdom Athletic performance, says the 16-man Scottish group in the World Championship will "provide a huge contribution to the team."
The record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017, which began on Friday.
Black believes that something is developing in Scotland and that the United Kingdom athletic should learn from it.
"We accept it, and we try to understand it, and we will work until we get out of it," Black said.
"I'm talking to people at the Scottish Sports Institute and they think it's about what they do.
The Scottish Athletics think it's about what they do.
British athletics: He thinks it's about what they do.
So does the guy in the corner.
Whatever the combination of conditions is, it's absolutely wonderful. "
Laura Muir and many Scottish athletes, including Andrew Butchart, who will compete against Sir Mo Farah in 5,000 m, are competing for the medal, and Eilidh Doyle was chosen as captain by the staff.
"Eilidh is a little modest.
The captain's speech was amazing, "Black says.
"Scottish or wherever they live or train, a few athletes came out of that room very proud and really motivated.
The passion and true feeling that Eildh had naturally added was wonderful. "
The silver medal athlete from the League of Nations who will compete for 400 metres in the fifth World Championship calls 16 Scots "amazing" on the British team.
The best total number of athletes in Scotland's previous world championships was seven in 1983 and 2015.
Muir, the middle-distance runner who broke five British and two European records last year, is the leader.
He's going to join 1500 m and 5,000 m.
Chris O'Hare, who spent a very good season, including the British team trials and the New Year's Games, is another Scotsman running at 1500 m.
Doyle remembers his first championship, where the only other Scotsman on the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says that many of his countrymen will not only join the team but will compete for the medal in some cases and fight for the finals, and he is "very proud."
"The special thing about being a team captain is that it was already a great honor by other members of the team, but knowing that your teammates voted for you and chose you made it extra special for me," he added.
"Frankly, I'm proud of all the Scots who joined the team.
That shows how far we've come.
And they're here as self-proven athletes, athletes watching to get to the podium.
As for the captain's speech?
Yeah, I think it went well.
I took advantage of the fact that we were very lucky in this situation, and in the meantime, we have a World Championship in our house.
I mean, it's really just the effect of taking advantage of this inner field support and the fact that we're back at the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to get up there and fight, and there's gonna be such a great atmosphere. "
Preventing critics on Facebook: If you can't handle voters' criticism, don't run for state duty
Our country's father knew a little bit about being negative in the press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for the newspapers to start criticizing him severely from internal politics to political principles.
Of course he was disturbed by criticism.
But he didn't silence the critics.
Because in 1783, Washington said, "Freedom of speech can be eliminated and we can be dragged to the slaughter in a stupid and quiet manner."
This brings me to Larry Hogan, governor of Maryland, who needs more work to be like Washington.
Hogan's staff blocked and deleted at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
The American Civil Liberation Association sued him earlier this week.
The governor's staff didn't care about the case for its seriousness, and online comments were filled with "Who cares?" reactions.
A lot of people said, "It's just Facebook."
But it's important.
It's especially important when you're a Hogan.
This is a Republican governor who is surprisingly popular in a particularly democratic state.
He has the second highest representation rate among 50 governors in the country.
Hogan's not a reactionary nut gun.
He was a master of leadership and strict loyalty to principles.
He was also very skilled at using Facebook as a primary tool to connect with his constituents, as he presented his hairless head in a humorous manner after chemo.
So it's unnecessary and ultimately dangerous to block people who come to the page of the governor, which is officially described as a public forum and led by members of the public's tax dollars.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's female spokesman, Amelia Chasse, defended the governor's actions, claiming that obstructing comments is nothing more than regulating them.
But it's easy to use images of trolls or spammers or haters attacking online verbal.
The Post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are the real people who only talk to their elected leaders: a teacher, a business owner and a priest; not a troll.
They all said their comments weren't respectful, thoughtful and profane.
The priest quoted the Bible by addressing Hogan's Catholic faith in his share.
Lashmi Sarma Ramani, a lawyer from Maryland Bowie, wasn't hateful, but he asked about hate crimes.
"I have kindly commented on his hatred crimes and other recent news that I am disappointed in his lack of answers," he wrote in the report of The Post.
"I also don't like the idea of a lot of people being ignored as a collective effort by a large group of concerned citizens when they comment on the same issue."
Others will probably call it "idea advocacy," which the governor's personnel call "concentrated spam attack."
The Facebook period makes it easier for a message to be made available through the obstruction of a dissipator or the deletion of a negative message.
Much cleaner than the old days when staff were sent out to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles or arrest protesters and silence them.
But, even if it's digital, that's exactly what happened.
Hogan is not the first public duty to be criticised for neutralizing Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who are blocked by Twitter flow.
One of the decisions that could be a reference to this issue in the future came from Virginia last week.
The president of the Loudoun Administration Board of Directors has violated the First Amendment when US District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria banned an election on Facebook.
In Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (Republican) was visited by ACLU due to Facebook and Twitter use.
It shouldn't be that hard.
In Washington time, a reasonable-price mail age had quite a similar effect on the Internet.
Between 1775 and 1800, the number of newspapers increased to four, and the anonymous letter writers eroded his leadership.
Even then, Washington had unknown trolls.
All the people who use nicknames like "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius," and "Portius," wrote letters to the newspapers that put Washington's decisions under their feet.
According to the online George Washington Directory Project, which collected historical documents, he overwhelmed the office of petitions that criticised his stance on Friendship, Trade and Navigation Agreement with Britain.
But he didn't shut them up.
The statement is at the very core of our nation, freedom of opposition and opposition.
True leadership means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes his home will be comfortable at the Renaissence Club.
A former European number, Ronan Rafferty, hopes that in the next three days, the Renaissance Club in South Lothian will be at ease while hosting the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The North Irish, who went to the finals before losing to Paul Eales at Archerfield Links, feels committed to the new place, and acts as ambassador to the tournament in the name of Jerry Sarvadi, the founder and CEO of the club.
"I have watched the construction of the Renaissence Club and we see that it has achieved its glory along with this organization," Rafferty said.
The players will see the field in its best form, in an extraordinary situation.
Jerry did a remarkable job building this place.
He's an indispensable defender of this game, and he's proud of his success here.
This is a great show for this field. "
Although British Eales has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour, for the first time in his 32-year career, he will fight to protect a championship.
"This feels really special," the Southport-based actor said.
"I didn't get a chance to protect Extremadura Open because he was removed from the calendar after the year I won.
It's so nice to be back in this part of the world.
Great place to play golf.
The memories of last year come alive, and it was very special to me and my wife Sharon to win last year.
It was really special, and it was always a time for us to remember with love. "
At the beginning of this year, Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour, returns to the game in his own field.
This organization will be the first Scottish competition since Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a little more when you fight inside," Helensburgh man Orr said.
"You want to do well, but you also feel the extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again and played real golf.
I'm happy to be gone by now. "
Those who participated in this trio are former Masters champion Ian Woosnam and Senior Major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among six Scots on the field; others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
The turnout is free and the parking lot is paid £5 per car with one person and £10 per car with two or more people.

Got the answer.
Imagine a seat -- with its budget of 6 billion 867 million Turkish Cypriots, more than any one of the ten ministries, including Economy, Development, Energy and Natural Resources, Science Industry and Technology, Environmental and Urbanization, Health, Culture and Tourism Ministry!
The number of personnel is 117,378.
Turkey's largest propaganda base!
Yes, I'm talking about the Presidency of the Religious Affairs!
Yes, I'm going to talk about President Mehmet Gormez of the Religious Affairs!
For days, I've been looking for answers to the question in my head...
I wonder why Mehmet Gormez was taken out of his seat...
I read every article about her being sent.
No.
I can't find the answer to the problem I'm looking for.
At the beginning of this year...
Mehmet Gormez has prepared the 2017-2021 Strategic Plan of the Presidency of the DİB (DİB).
A $1 million "S" Mercedes has been towed by President Erdogan.
So he had no problem with Erdogan.
So what happened?
You can say, "Isn't it enough that he was on duty for seven years?"
The first DİB President M. Rifat Börecci served for 17 years.
Mehmet Nuri Yılmaz, who you all know, sat in that chair for 11 years.
So... the president's mandate is open.
I'm going back to my question: why did Mehmet Baymaz leave his seat?
We're in business...
Shii proximity
The source close to power said: "According to the traditional uletide, Mehmet Dirmez did not have the circumcision!"
The code for this sentence is that he didn't have the circumcision!
The person who put that sentence behind his back said, "Modernist found by traditional ulema!"
I mean, Mehmet Baymez was considered innovative.
What does that mean, innovation?
The answer to the question was that Mehmet Gormez was hiding on a trip abroad.
Date: December 27, 2015.
Mehmet Gormez went to Iran to join the 29th Conference of Savance -- which aims to zoom in on the Islamic sects in Tehran.
Iran's religious leader, Ayatullah Ali Hamaney, met with him.
And he was pure with the men of the Scripture, and he prayed.
And at the conference, he said, "The Psalms represent different ideas and beliefs in the understanding of Islam."
Each one of them has a goal of reaching the path to God.
Each one of them is on a journey to the main road, but their destination is the same.
It is never acceptable to mimic the cult or to see the member of the cult above the Islamic heritage.
It's a reflection of secularism, discrimination, conflict, taassubun and ignorance.
He was the most damaged religion in the ways that the sects were in the way of religion...
I'd like to reemphasize by underlining here:
The poems and the Sunnah are one community.
"No one can punish another because he understands Islam as he understands it."
A year later...
Only Caferi leader Selahattin Özgün from Turkey attended the 30th Savabet Meeting.
I mean...
It's not circumcision. It's Vehihahaz.
Mehmet Gormez's trip to Iran and his speech at the conference made him the target of "traditional stimulus."
This is why no one -- again -- representing the Turkish State -- represented the next Tehran conference.
Mehmet Gormez hasn't been invited four times since he was on duty.
It was obvious that Shii in DİB - anti-Iran "traditional ulema!"
Following the Iranian trip, Mehmet Gormez's seat began to be worn out from the beginning of 2016.
In the beginning, Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmuş was responsible for DİB!
Mehmet Gormez was so drowned, he asked him to connect to the DİB Presidency.
In essence...
There was a difference in the state in looking at circumcision.
Some of the theoretical worlds were created in Saudi Arabia and Egyptian media, "traditional ulema," by circumcision -- by the U.S. shadow - by Vehhabi-Selefism!
These were anti-Iran opponents who couldn't stand a trip to Tehran.
The words of the Dwarf Ahmet about Mehmet Gormez were not surprising: "There is no danger in Dievet."
"O my Lord! May He make the promise of the people to be a righteous man."
"Eclilignitis," they used it as a symbol concept of Iran's hostility.
A period of FETÖ -- CIA support -- was now running anti-Iran by new names.
And with the FETÖ emps...
A picture of a young man with whiskey was served to the media with a "Mehmet Gormez's son" lie!
Oh, what a coincidence!
Who made Mehmet Gormez the biggest opposition in the media: Turkey's newspaper by the US-led Sparklers Community!
After all...
- The one who refuses to bring circumcision to the Saudi Vehhabi-Selefi line...
- The one that doesn't fuel the separation of the grave...
- Modernist... a religious man, whose consciousness was destroyed by "traditional ulema" created during the Cold War...
US cultural imperialism continues to rearize Turkey rapidly (to make Vehhabi-Seleti).
Do not doubt that the President of the Future Country Affairs will be the representative of the Vehhabi-Selefi!
"We support Turkey's sovereignty"
Foreign Minister Mevlut Çavuşoğlu has gone to China to make an official visit.
Çavuşoğlu and Chinese Foreign Minister Vang Yi held a joint press conference at the State Guest in Beijing.
"We hope that Turkey will be more active in international matters," Vang said.
China will support Turkey in efforts to preserve sovereignty, stability and security.
"We hope to resolve the Palestinian issue with the international community, including Turkey," he said.
"Turkey is seeking close co-operation with regional and international organisations, and international organisations are not alternatives to each other, but complementary," Çavuşoğlu said.
Ruhani is officially starting his second term.
The presidency of Hasan Ruhani, who won the presidential elections in Iran in May, was approved by the country's leader, Ayatullah Ali Hamaney.
Hasan Ruhani, who was elected president for the second time in Iran, took an oath at the ceremony attended by the country's religious leader, Ayatullah Ali Hamaney.
In addition to top military and political names, Turkish Ambassador to Tehran Rıza Hakan Tekin attended the ceremony on behalf of foreign country representatives.
Ruhani, who will serve as president for four more years, will officially begin duty following his oath at parliament on Saturday (August 5th).
The ceremony is expected to be attended by Economy Minister Nihat Zeykök, representing Turkey.
Security measures at the Centipede Border Gate
Human aid, food, medicine, cleaning materials will not be allowed to pass the trucks in Reyhanlı district of Hatay.
According to information, due to the negative security conditions in the Babel Air Border Gate and its region near Turkey's border, the Cilvebek Border Gate has been closed to transplants other than human aid, food, medicine and cleaning materials.
And the exits of the help trucks from the Centipede Border Gate are allowed.
There was no information on how long the limitation would take.
In the Golden Land of Indonesia, poverty and death
Bardina Degei doesn't use a stove when she cooks.
In fact, he rarely uses a container.

Of course, working late can be dangerous: most men in the village are unemployed and most of them drink too much, and there are soldiers.
"No one walks around the village after 5: 00 p.m.," he says.

A current movement against the Dutch administration propaganda for independence has quickly directed its anger towards the Jakarta government, which preserves strict control over the region, prohibiting foreign journalists or rights surveillance organisations.
In 2003, the region was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, where independent Papua New Guinea would invade the eastern part of the island.

Let alone journalists, few Indonesia traveled here and almost no stranger ever traveled here.
Before the Christian missionaries arrived, he worshipped the Mee Pago Papuans, a god called Uga Tamee.
There have been other changes.
"We weren't used to wearing these clothes," Degei says, referring to her hand-touched blonde, dark shirt and her shiny skirt.
"We used to wear leaves on our bodies."
Papua is the poorest part of Indonesia, where 28% of people live under the poverty limit and have the worst child death and literacy rates in Asia.
But at the same time, this is Indonesia's golden land.
Grasberg, the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world owned by Phoenix-based Freeport McMoran, is only 60 miles from Paniai, which is a mountainous region in the size of New Jersey and is home to 153,000 people.
In 2015 alone, Freeport removed $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper from here.
In addition, Papua has estimated $78 billion in lumber reserves.
However, these riches, which are a source of misery for the Papuans, allow Indonesia's powerful army to maintain a suffocating presence.
In 2005, the New York Times research reports that Freeport paid local military personnel and units about 20 million dollars from 1998 to 2004, including the sum of $150,000 given to a single officer.
More of the Papuans' call for the autonomous threatens this golden-egged chicken and is mercilessly justified.
According to rights defenders, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed by the Indonesian army since 1969 and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned.
In the mountainous parts of Papua, mass massacres in the 1970s reached genocide numbers according to the Asian Human Rights Commission.
The Indonesian police only arrested over 3900 peaceful demonstrators in the region last year.
The Brisbane Archbishop's report, "We will lose everything" in 2016, includes the testimony of my mistress, such as last year's illegal executions, torture (according to another report), rape and electrocution, particularly popular) and the brutal crushing of peaceful demonstrations.
"It's hard to calculate the number of victims every week because of events," says Andreas Harsono, the Indonesian researcher of the Human Rights Watch Organization.
Since Papua's resources brought in settlers from other parts of Indonesia, the pressure has been increased.
The region's population of 3.5 million people are 83% Christian, but the demographic changes as Muslim immigrants from Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi come to economic purposes.
Java warung buffet sells gado-gado, served with fried chicken and peanut sauce mixed with vegetables.
The locals are having trouble competing.
"Immigrants sell chicken and vegetables cheaper than the local Papuans in traditional markets," explains Paniai, who moved to the regional capital of Jayapura for business, is 24-year-old Abeth You.
"This led to the loss of local Papuans, Papuan mammays (women)."
Joko Widodo, who is more known as Jokowi, pledged to solve the inequality and rights violations in Papua during the 2014 election campaign.
The old carpenter was on his way to the presidential palace in Jakarta, while 27 of Papua's 29 districts, including Panaia.
But so little has changed in Papua, and today the locals feel cheated.
"Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokowi with hope that justice will restore our hope," he said.
In fact, Paniai had the worst of her condition only two months after Jokowi started in October.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were outside singing Christmas songs in front of a bonfire in Enotartali, where two Indonesia military darknesses broke through the motorcycle.
The scared kids told them to turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers resented their principles and returned with four soldiers, according to local priest Yavedt Tebai.
Victims and witnesses say the soldiers who were drinking chased the group and beat them with their rifles.
Then one of the soldiers shot at the children's group.
One of the children, Yulianus Yeimo, 16, was beaten so badly, he went into a coma.
A few hours later, the nearby government electoral commission building was set on fire, and the next day, things went up.
About 1,000 Papuans men, women and children gathered to demand justice in a football field outside the local police station and military command center.
They were carrying ceremonial hunting springs, and they danced the waita dance of Papua's Mee Pago tribe (running in the form of a ring and imitating a bird song).
Some protesters started throwing stones at the police and military garrison.
The orders were sent to the soldiers through the internal radio as the nerves were more tense: "If the crowd shows more than three resistance, shoot them and kill them." That's what a formal document was saying by TIME that was not released to local media.
Yeremias Kayame (56), head of Kego Koto district in Enotartali, saw the approaching danger and begged the crowd to return home.
No one wanted to listen.
"When I turned my back, I was shot in the left wrist."
Kayama still doesn't know who shot him, but he says the bullet came from a military meltdown.
"It was crowded, multiple shots fired."
According to his cousin who witnessed the attacks, local Alfius Youw was shot three times.
"I ran to him, and I examined his body to make sure it wasn't him," Yomanes, known as many Indonesia, told TIME in a dark way.
"I saw him die... and I kissed him."
Papua Police Chief Inspector General Yotje Mende told reporters that his officers only "secured the station" because the police station was under attack.
"When people threaten to kill us, we have to defend ourselves," Papua police spokesman Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.
"This is a matter of life and death."
According to the Human Rights Monitoring Organization, five young protesters were killed and many were injured.
The news of the deaths reached Jakarta only the next day.
Jokowi spoke in Jayapura three weeks later, promising to share the pain of the victims' families and solve historical abuse in Papua.
He said, "I want this case solved immediately so it won't happen again."
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he set up an unforensic mechanism for historical human rights violations.
But the excuses started almost immediately.
"Most of the violations happened a long time ago.
Some in the '90s and some in the early 2000's.
The point is that we are determined to solve these violations, but we have processes to process, "he said.
Speaking to TIME on June 5th, Wiranto stepped back saying he had no plan to build a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, he said, "It will all be solved by the law."
The UN has already solved 11 human rights violations in Papua, including the Paniai incident, which the East Timor accused of "crimes against humanity" over 1,000 deaths during the 1999 bloody independence vote.
The families of the Paniai victims faced such allegations with a painful skepticism.
"I've been interviewed four times in the past three years, but there has been no progress," he says, Yohanes.
"I'm tired."
Years later, he says he's still living in fear.
He says, "I'm scared."
"I'm afraid of being arrested by the soldier, I'm afraid of being shot."
His brother, Yacobus, reiterates that the people in Paniai are afraid to discuss it.
He says he was beaten by a soldier after helping bury four of the victims.
"After burying the body, the soldier came looking for me," he says.
The attacks haven't stopped yet.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot at the villagers in the name of Deiyai, Paniai's neighbor.
One person died during a shootout between the villagers and the director of a construction company who refused to help transport a man who wasn't himself to the hospital, and 17 others injured, including children.
Ravianus Dow, 24, drowned in a nearby lake fishing, died on his way to the hospital.
The angry villagers staged a protest in front of the company's construction office.
The police said the villagers were throwing rocks at the officers, and they reacted by firing a warning shot.
But the locals say the moving brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) fired at the crowd and killed someone.
The 29-year-old Dominggu Badi, who lived near the hospital and witnessed the raising of the wounded, told TIME, "We were so panicked, we were afraid of revenge."
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiyai parliament has called for responsibility for the officers involved in this, and for the removal of the mobile police brigade from the region.
Paniai has always been a troubled area for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development feeds the discontent of Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes who live throughout Papua's green mountainous centre.
Many participated in the rebel army Free Papua Movement (OPM), which claimed the Papuans were protecting their rights from random attacks and abductions to the Indonesian soldiers.
Some top OPM leaders, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya, are coming from Paniai.
In response, thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested, and under the "protection of national sovereignty," he has been held in a state of joy by the military in recent years.
Some of them are never seen again.
Paniai is known as "a tragic and forgotten place" among the people of Papua.
The poverty feeds the displeasure.
A little rice on sale at Enotartali is too expensive for Indians to buy.
Bread is inaccessible.
The people here grow everything they eat: mainly the note, as well as some fruit and leaves.
Farming is the work of women who can handle four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They usually keep most of the harvest for the family, and they sell the rest at the local market.
Ten notes only make 10,000 Indonesia rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequality has grown between local Papuans and the new airlines at Naba Airport.
The less jobs usually go to the better educated and richer immigrants.
The Papuans rarely have the capitals or the necessary qualities to run their own business as competitive.
"Young people are not interested in staying in the village because there is no work or money here," says John Gobai, head of the Panai tribal council.
The isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
Other than that, the reporting restrictions for international media stand tight.
At the beginning of this year, French journalist Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported for lack of co-ordination with relevant institutions from Papua, despite their rare permission to shoot video.
According to Assistant Asian Director Phelim Kine, the Human Rights Watch Agency, Jokowi's election campaign has not been made to abolish and develop restrictions to increase transparency.
He said, "There are new dangers for foreign journalists who are trying to make news of Indonesia's restless eastern provinces, Papua and West Papua: visa rejection and blacklisted."
The lack of press inspections means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is mostly limited to its neighbours near Papua.
In March, six Pacific nations (Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Bağlu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands) encouraged the U.N. Human Rights Council to investigate "various and common violations" in Papua, including the Panaia attacks.
Same countries are historically supporting the OPM.
"The democratic system in Indonesia is still valid and free media, so it is difficult to cover the evidence in human rights cases," said Arrmanatha Nasir, a spokesman for the Endonesia Foreign Ministry, to reporters in Jakarta.
Local people want more foreign governments interested.
An official delegation from the Netherlands broke his silence with their begging for freedom, according to a source who attended the meeting and didn't want to be announced on May 4th, when he visited Jaapura as head of the country's human rights envoy Kees Van Baar.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papuans say it's unlikely they'll vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a man with good intentions but is surrounded by people involved in the Paniai attack," said Gobai, head of the tribal council.
Jokowi wants the people of Paniai to know that he is rolling in a disaster with the care and health services, except for the threat of the bully.
Gobai says the Paniai people like the other Papuans saw their vote as a "debt" to pay back to Jokowi.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite threats and threats, the families of the Paniai attack victims carried out one last symbolic resistance action: burying a victim's body in the field opposite the police and the military station.
They will at least make sure that those responsible remember their crimes, knowing that justice can never be fulfilled.
"A member of our family has been killed," says Yacobus, curled forward.
"What else can we do?"
The fire wrapped Dubai's' Torch 'skyscraper for the second time
On Friday in Dubai, a fire swept the world's highest housing towers and forced hundreds of residents to escape the 79-story structure of 337 meters long.
This is the second major fire in two years that spreads rapidly to the high building called the Torch Tower.
The building has been evacuated, no injuries have been reported, and there has been no explanation for the cause of the big fire.
"We were asleep, and we woke up on the fire alarm, and people were screaming.
We ran down the stairs and it took us about 10 minutes to get to the 50-floor floor. "That's how a resident spoke to Reuters, who named him George.
Dubai's civil defense authorities said the fire squad put out the big fire at around 4: 00 a.m. and that they were cooling the building.
The government has announced that they are trying to provide shelter for those affected.
This could bring up questions about the safety of material used in the outside parts of high buildings worldwide.
Following the fire in 2015, the Torch administration's investigation found that most of the damage was in the hull, which is in the outer panels used for decoration and isolation.
In the United Kingdom, the police said they believed that London's isolation and hull panel on the GrenFell Tower, where 80 people died, may have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire in June.
More than 4,000 chronic patients have the news of "social aid."
The Ministry of Family and Social Policy will benefit from the poverty-stricken social aid programme for citizens and families who are struggling with chronic diseases, at the first stage, 4,300 tuberculosis and SSPE patients will benefit from the first stage.
The ministry plans to provide more than two-thirds of the minimum wage with the aid programme, and will provide regular psychososal support.
According to information, details and applications from Family and Social Policy Minister Fatma Betul Sayan Kaya have been shown by the "New Social Help Programme for the New Families Against Chronic Diseases" that began a while ago.
The social aid programme, launched to support citizens struggling with chronic diseases in the Ministry of Health and in economic and psychological difficulties in the business union, is also the first in the world in many ways.
The ministry, which completes all necessary preparations for the launch of the programme, will provide not only cash for the families but regular psychososal support.
Thus, the poor citizens who have chronic illness and continue their treatment process in their homes are targeted not to be left alone both financially and spiritually.
According to studies, at the first stage, a brain disease caused by tuberculosis disease and measles will be supported by regular psychososis and transport to poor citizens who fight the Subakut Sklerozan Panencephalitis (SSPE).
In later stages of the programme, poor citizens who fight other rare and risky diseases will be included in the aid programme.
In addition to the support planned to be given at over two thirds of the minimum wage, there will also be additional payment for the patients of tuberculosis, which are determined by the health unit that they can't handle their medical self-care, maintain their lives as dependent on the bed, or the need to improve home life conditions.
In order to benefit from support, the monthly income per person in the house is required to be less than two thirds of the minimum wage.
Citizens who are also suffering from the SSPE need to find a health board report based on the methods and conditions of "Directions of the Health Board Report to the Sorcerity Measurement, Unification and Özgür."
According to the survey, more than 1 of the 5 US passengers are bringing banned materials to the plane.
According to the survey by airline passengers, more than 20 per cent were deliberately or unwittingly abducted from the US Transportation Security Agency's checkpoints, including at least 6 per cent of which carry banned knives or other sharp objects without knowing it.
Less than 1% claimed that later he realized he was traveling with firearms, ammunition, explosives.
The research conducted by a jet rental service called Stratos Jet Charters found that more than 1,000 people were more likely to break the rules.
Among the participants who admit to deliberately trying to fly with something banned by TSA, 19.7 per cent of them are from the Y generation, although less than 15 are X-generation members.
Food and fluids are the most common substances abducted deliberately from TSA agents.
More than 3% admitted that you were deliberately using sharp tools from security, while 2.2 per cent of female participants and 3.7 men agreed that they were carrying banned drugs to the plane on purpose.
The firm said how many people from airport security accidentally brought contraband and surveyed passengers across the country to find out how many people did it on purpose.
It's no surprise that it's the most likely people who are the most likely to have smuggled goods out of security on purpose or without knowing.
However, as the firm pointed out, the TSA rules are a bit complicated and confusing.
Most of the time, people are not sure which fluids they can carry or how much of them they can carry.
So it's no surprise that the largest amount of material confiscated by TSA was found as banned fluids.
For a while, people thought the TSA might be treating books as contraband.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but international ones are not allowed.
China has welcomed US statements
At a press conference in Beijing, China Foreign Minister Vang Yi said at a press conference, Tillerson said, "We are not looking for excuses for the regime's change, the collapse of the regime, the rapid reunification of the peninsula and sending our troops to the north of the 38th parallel."
Chinese Foreign Minister Vang said Tillerson reemphasized the Washington administration's principles on the North Korea issue, hoping the United States would implement these principles effectively and in a concrete outcome-oriented policy.
Stressing that the security of the Korean peninsula is their priorities, Vang stressed that the parties have been waiting for them to find a medium way to solve their concerns through equal dialogue, and that the Beijing administration has been insisting that the peninsula will be removed from the nuclear, maintaining peace and stability, solving problems with dialogue and negotiations.
EPA President Pruitt has given up on delays in the Obama term Emission Declaration Act
One day after he was sued by 15 states, the head of the Environmental Protection Organization, Scott Pruitt, reiterated the decision to delay the implementation of the Obama-era laws that dropped the air polluting emissions that caused the dirty smoke earlier.
Pruitt represented the change of his own organization, being more sensitive to the needs of state environmental regulators than the governments that have passed.
In a federal high court, he never mentioned the legal objection to his former position.
The issue is that states begin to meet October 1st, which is the end of the 2015 standards for the ground level ozone.
Pruitt announced that he would postpone compliance in June for a year to give his organization more time to work and avoid "interfering with local decisions or preventing economic growth."
Prior to being appointed by President Donald Trump, Pruitt, the state's attorney in Oklahoma, served as a trusted ally against long-standing environmental arrangements.
Since Pruitt arrived in Washington, he has moved many times to prevent or delay regulations against chemical and fossil fuel industries.
The sudden change on Wednesday is the latest legal defeat for Pruitt's remodeling agenda.
Last month, a federal high court in Washington ruled that the EPA manager's attempt to delay the implementation demanding that oil and gas companies, a Obama management law, inspect and reduce methane leaks, overstep the limits of his own authority.
In a statement published on Wednesday night, Pruitt said that the return of the ozone standards only reinforces the meeting of the EPA in time for new standards with states and through complex processes.
"Under previous administrations, the EPA often failed to meet the final dates of decisions, waiting to be sued by activists groups and others and remained on the solution of the dispute to set the timing for the decision," Pruitt said.
"We don't believe in prosecuting and we take the history of the term seriously.
We also take the law and the authority he has given us seriously. "
However, the EPA statement said Pruitt could use "the authority to delay at one point, and all the other authority that exists legally," to ensure that regulations are supported by "solid policies and the best information available."
The Republicans in Congress are pressing for a wider rewriting of the ozone laws.
A parliamentary bill approved last month is attempting to delay the implementation of the laws of 2015 for at least eight years.
The precaution has not yet been brought to the Senate for the vote.
Eric Schneiderman, the chief prosecutor of New York, who has been suing the EPA this week, said the group intends to continue the legal pressure.
"After our cases, the EPA's change of decision is an important gain for the health and safety of more than 115 million Americans, who are directly affected by the nasty smoke that flows directly into the new Yorkers and their communities," Schneiderman said.
He joined New York in California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and District of Columbia.
When automobiles, power plants, oil refineries, chemical facilities and other sources responding to sunlight in the atmosphere are released, the ground level ozone is created.
The nasty smoke that comes out can cause serious breathing problems in a quick group of people and contribute to thousands of early deaths every year.
Public health advocates and environmentalists applauded Pruitt's surprise decision change.
Lori Ann Burd of the Biological Centre for Distribution said, "It is disturbing that it takes so much pressure to get this sensible step from the person who is tasked with protecting the air we breathe."
"We must continue to fight against the ideological struggle of the Trump administration, polluting the environment and submitting to the interests."
Infection is the only home
Turkey, which caught the biggest increase in exports in July, drew unemployment 13 per cent in January to 10.5 per cent in April, and the economic trust index rose to the summit of 3.5 years, dropped inflation into one home.
According to data released by the Turkish Statistics Agency (TÜİK) yesterday, the consumer Price Index (TÜFE) rose 0.15 per cent in July, while annual inflation has been in one house since 9: 79 per cent.
As of the main spending groups, the highest increase in July was 1.75 per month, with restaurants and hotels, while the most declining group became 3.51 per cent and shoes.
The highest increase in year-on-year was in transport group at 15.24 per cent.
"In the moderate audience in inflation, food and clothing groups have the impact of the decline in prices," Muammer Coalıçıoğlu, who noted that inflation, parallel to expectations, has been reduced to one home.
However, the core indicators are rising compared to the previous month, unlike the headline.
"We don't expect any relaxation in the tight stance of the Central Bank," he said.
Despite the decline in the headline inflation, core inflation indicators have risen.
The B index, which the Central Bank closely monitored, increased from 9.07 per cent to 9.20 per cent from July to 9.60 per cent.
"Inver Erkan, deputy director of Capital FX Research, says inflation can be shut down at 9.3 per cent of the year," says Ever Erkan, who said, "inflation can drift up to December and fall into one house in December."
"As of the early months of 2018, the Central Bank may have a chance," he said.
Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek: inflation will close its year with one dynasty.
The tightening of the Central Bank will continue until inflation goes below 7 per cent.
At the nearby Food Committee, we will give reforms its final form.
Economy Minister Nihat Zeybekci: We are glad that inflation has fallen to a single digit, but it has to be permanent.
In the fight against inflation, food prices have to be reduced, as well as increased supply.
Minister of Development Lutfi Elvan: Due to the basis effect in the coming months, a number of upward trends can be seen in annual inflation, but from the early 2018 months, the decline in inflation will be determined.
We're guessing the annual inflation will go down even further.
I wish Fenerbahçe good luck in his next games.
Sturm Graz Technical Director Franco Foda said their performance in the second half was not enough to skip the tour at the third round of the UEFA European League.
"We couldn't use the wings in the first half," Foda said at a press conference after the meeting.
In the second half, we set the balance in the game.
We got a shot at the second goal.
I'm still proud of my team.
In the second half, they changed the course of the game.
We could have been a little better.
Little things in the game have been deciphering.
"I wish Fenerbahçe good luck in his next games," he said.
He said they felt very well as long as they were in Turkey and were happy with the hospitality they saw.
Fernando is in Istanbul
The Brazilian footballer Fernando Francisco Reges, who began the Galatasaray Club's transfer talks, arrived in Istanbul.
The Brazilian football player who arrived at Atatürk Airport, the fans welcomed it in a enthusiastic manner.
Fernando, where the yellow-red fans were cheering for love, took a private vehicle waiting for him under security measures and left the airport.
Fernando, 30, who began his career on the Vila Nova team in Brazil, plays for Estrela Amadora, Porto and Manchester City.
The Brazilian football player is expected to sign a contract with the yellow-red team after he passes health control.
Galatasaray, who continued his transfer work, has made a deal with Manchester City for a long time.
US flash Rakka move: Homeland Security...
Colonel Dillon, linked to the US Defence Ministry (Pentagon) from Baghdad, said the Rakka Homeland Security Force (IRGG), trained by the coalition, began to settle into areas that were cleared of the city's DEAS.
"The Rakka Homeland Security Force, mostly of the Arabs and anti-DEA volunteers, continues to prevent terrorists from escaping or coming back," Dillon said in the city.
"For now, the number of forces is 850," Dillon said, saying, completing the training of 230 others this week.
Dillon said the group was trained in basic weapons training, as well as first aid, armed conflict, scan and checkpoint operations.
Noting that the interest in the Rakka Homeland Security Force is very intense, Dillon said the coalition will continue to scan the applicants for education and employment.
The US-led coalition co-operate with the Syrian Democratic Forces, which constitute the main spine of the PYD / PKK in Rakka's removal.
The PYD / PKK terrorist organisation appointed a PKK terrorist named Leyla Muhammad as co-chairman of the Rakka civil administration council.
The PKK / PYD members are also alleged to be in the military force in Rakka.
Dillon also announced that the US-led coalition has collected heavy weapons from the opposition group Karyatahn (Şhuk) at El Tanif camp south of Syria, where it cut off its support last week.
"After meeting with the leaders last week, Shhuk returned the heavy weapons and equipment the coalition gave them, but some small weapons and light vehicles were allowed to stay with them," Dillon said.
Last week, the United States announced that they were out of the conflict zones they agreed on with Russia, patrolling and supporting him from Seoul for reasons that he was involved in non-combat with the DEA.
The group also wants to fight against the Bachelor Esed regime, as well as the DEA.
According to the leaked phone call notes, Trump pressed Mexico to pay for the border wall.
The notes of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia were leaked by the Washington Post.
In a phone call with Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto on January 27th, Trump urged him not to say publicly that he would not pay for the proposed border wall.
The president of the United States scolded the president of Mexico who held the wall open to the public and said, "You can't tell that to the press."
Trump started the presidential campaign on building a wall along the south border of the United States and promised Mexico he would pay for the project.
The notes of his first meeting with the Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, who presented a heated dialogue, were also published.
Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull that the deal on the United States taking refugees to Australia was "ridiculous," "rotten" and "stupid," and that after offering the US a ban on building a refugee, the deal under Obama would make itself look like a fool.
"This was the most unpleasant conversation I've had all day," Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull.
Patient relatives broke the doctor's nose.
Turkish High Education and Research Hospital doctors and employees left short-term work yesterday morning in response to the coup of a doctor's friends by sick relatives.
The crowd gathered in front of the hospital's main entrance with the "no violence in health" they carried in their hands reacted to the incident.
"No violence in health" slogan sounds inadequate to me, even to me. "
In health, violence can't be the place.
He said, "If this continues, this people will soon find no health group to serve itself."
Ankara Provincial Health Director Dr. Kamil Turkmen, Ankara First District Public Hospital Secretary-General Prof. Dr. Öner Odabaş, Turkey's High Education and Research Hospital Chief of Medicine Prof. Dr. Mustafa Pac and sick relatives in the hospital garden.
Pac, who condemned the incident, said:
Unfortunately, violence is increasing to the health workers.
One example of this incident yesterday (the previous day), we re-experience the impact of our cardiovascular surgical physician by a patient relative.
Even though we have taken the best measures we can as our government, our ministry and our governor to end these events as soon as possible, we demand that the sensitivity of our people be increased in this matter.
I condemn what happened yesterday for my hospital and my health workers.
"Unfortunately, this time has become a professional complication."
"We will take our own precautions, but most importantly, our nation has its own health worker."
"Our laws on violence in health have been effective enough," Turkmen said.
That's what the state's levels apply.
Right now, the police are working.
In the past, these were always available, but right now it's a direct civil suit, and the government is putting a lawyer in charge, following the case.
"There are heavy punishment samples that have been taken on this," he said.
After the statements, the workers continued their work.
The alleged incident occurred at around 5: 45 the other day.
The relatives of the patient who died in intensive care attacked Dr. Hamdi Mehmet Ozbek, who worked in the heart and Damar Surgery department.
While Uzbek was removed from the scene by doctors and assistants, the hospital was called to the police.
While Ozbek's nose was broken, the attackers were taken into custody.
One of the witnesses said:
When our friend went to his relatives to inform them of the condition of a patient who had lost his life, the sick relatives took charge of our friend and our two friends.
Our friend's nose is broken, he's bleeding.
Then we took our friend into the O.R. and hid him.
For 15 to 20 minutes, the security set pulled us in.
If the sick relatives had crossed that firewall, something much worse would have happened.
Heavy blow to the DEA at Gaziantep: 102 sacks...
According to an investigation conducted by the Gaziantep Chief Public Prosecutor's Office, the Gaziantep Security Directorate has taken over 102 grams of ammonia in an operation designed by the DEA-armed terrorist organization, which is located in the District of Kaiantuu in the area of the terrorist organization, according to the report.
In the operation where six people were detained, the suspects' residence, businesses, storage and top searches, also received $370 of weapons of 35 chargers, 2,370 of shells, seven chargers of this gun, two hunting rifles and one pala, 39, 705, 150,000, and $870), and 165,000 of which were taken into possession of their records.
In the search, four books were also found by the broadcast organs of the FETÖ / PDY terrorist organization and with a decision to collect.
Six people detained were transferred to the forensic authorities following their questioning.
Suspects have been arrested by the Justice of Peace, the guard they were transferred to.
The YPG raid in Syria...
The United States intervened
According to the local sources of the AA, the YPG terrorists raided the homes of the residents of Tel Semin, in the US military support, in the northern countryside of Rakka, where the terrorist organization entered on the grounds of fighting the DEA.
The reaction of civilians whose homes were looted and seized has become a conflict with the terrorist organization.
After that, US forces in the region entered the city in armored vehicles.
The "Cougar MRAP" types of armor, personnel carrier vehicles and Husky-type mine detection vehicles have been seen to form a buffer zone in the waist.
The terrorist organisation YPG does not allow civilians who have escaped from death in Rakka, under the anti-DEA operation, to enter cities under control.
The local activist network, "Rakka is being murdered quietly," announced yesterday only in July that 121 civilians were killed in the fire of artillery.
Let's not carry the old world fights tomorrow
The delayed perception of home and world facts can lead to a crisis of countries, not simple people.
One of the reasons why the backward East, which we call "singing," may be because they perceive the world's reality late, is that the reflection of these facts to the geographics of the East may be blocked by certain chambers or that it will be announced beyond reality.
Don Quixote and Oblomov also became subject to the world of literature whether to detect reality and change by delay or not.
Cervantes' "Don Quixote" is a hermit who still thinks he's a knight.
Or Gontekov's "Oblomov" is a lazy legacy that thinks everything can last the same way when it ignores the truth.
The Chinese example, for example, was shut down by the end of the 15th century, when China was an open and sovereign country in the sea.
It must have lasted long enough for the captains of boats that went out of the water in China to be executed.
We Turks, whose feet, eyes and ears are in the West, the other foot, the eyes and ears in the East, have been constantly divided into understanding the truth and change starting from Ottoman.
We tried to move a new chapter of us to this day, to understand this day with concepts that fit the old conditions, to think of yesterday tomorrow.
A section of us were able to act as fast as the focus of thought in developed countries to detect the facts of the country and the world.
This has been a source of constant clashes, tensions.
Medrese and the university, the innovation, the modern army, the conflict of doubt with faith, caused a dramatic dualism.
Progress is even worse, and in a period of time, new and advanced positions were not accepted that they would eventually be old and they would remain behind.
After a period of yesterday, the pioneers began to declare the new and forward, "Dangerous," and "Traitor," who tried to interpret the conditions of the country and the world in accordance with the current reality.
The most important lesson in the Ottoman community is that those who are late to understand the facts of the country and the world eventually dominate the thought and state life, the empire has broken down, and the people have fallen down and the people have become poor.
The most important lesson our Ottoman past passed to the Republic was the fact that the rapid detection of the world's conjunctive and change was an inevitable precondition for survival.
Since this lesson has been so well absorbed, we have been a model country of this geography that has managed to maintain its unity, integrity, stability from the 1st World War in peace.
And in order to get through the global change process that was entered into a different approach, we have to leave the memorials behind and stick to the facts.
In other words, no one will get any good from carrying meaningless camps and blood cases that led to our democracy's limp in the past.
And in today's world, the smallest mistakes lead to a huge and dramatic crisis.
The most problematic geography is the Middle East we're in.
Historical artifact operation in Muş
According to the governor, an operation was launched by the Provincial Gendarmerie Command teams on historical property trafficking.
"As a result of the work done, two gold coins, one silver coins, 20 bronze coins, two bronze rings, one shattered glass bracelet, four stone objects, one pink-white stone objects, one painting frame, one of which were broken, one of which was broken in a different color, and one of which was broken in a different color, and one of which was broken in a different color, and one of which was used to be a different color, and one of which was used to be used in a series of objects.
"For the peace and safety of our people, our operations in the fight against crime and criminals will continue with determination."
Turkish Wind
The global giants, who trusted Turkey's future, fought against the broken man in the wind plant tender that took place yesterday.
The World record was broken during the tender by the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources to reduce external dependence and provide a transition to national energy.
Turkey's bid to lower its energy costs has also opened up a $1 billion investment and close to 4,000 jobs.
By 2019, local production wind turbines will be inserted into the system.
The wind plant license tender opened by the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources (YEKA) included eight consortium including US, Chinese, German and Danish giants.
The tender opened financial bids to determine the first five bid owners to make the lowest offer.
After the first offer envelopes, the lowest offer was $4.19 / kilowatt.
Open reduction range is set for 0.01 cents.
After the tender began, Enercon decided not to participate in an open reduction of joint initiatives, including Gold Wind, GE, Senvion and Vestas.
In the open reduction, groups including Siemens, Nordex and Mingyang competed.
Following the withdrawal of the consortium with Nordex, Mingyang-First Construction and Siemens-Türkers-Kalyon remained in the final two.
MingYang-First Construction took 11 breaks.
The Siemens-Turks-Kalyon Energy consortium has never taken a break.
Energy and resources Minister Berat Albaşı: record day for Turkey.
Open reduction continued 30 laps.
The winner of the intense conflict between the two consortium was the Siemens-Turkers-Kalyon joint initiative group, which made the lowest offer of $3.48 per kilowatte.
Konsortium offered 3.49 per cent / kilowatt in the tender, while Deputy Deputy Alparslan Bayaktar requested the tender commission for the presidency to 3.48.
Turkey won a world record with the results of the two-hour YEKA tender.
3.48 / cent per kilowatt offered in the tender is the lowest number in the world.
The previous record was in the hands of Mexico with $3.84 per kilowatt.
"When we look at Turkey and Germany in terms of 200 years of historical co-operation, I think it will contribute to Turkey-Germany relations," said Energy and Natural Resources Minister Berat Albak, who held a press conference following the end of the tender.
Our targets are big.
Today's result reveals how strong and confident the economic and energy market is moving into the future.
No matter how many regional crises there are in the world, I am very proud to announce that Turkey is the head of the region and the most reliable investment countries in the world.
"All Turkey is our president, who has carried Turkey to this point, within the 15-year rule and leadership, in this picture, which we will be proud of as 80 million," he said.
"One of the most important steps of this has been, until yesterday, with a local contribution to the wind, the cost of 10.3 dollars per kilowatts per kilowatt, which fell on a historic record by 3.48 / cente," Albaki said.
I am proud of it, in the name of my people, in the name of my country.
"Hopefully by 2019 we will include our local production wind turbines into the system," he said.
The turbines will be set up in five designated areas.
The winning company will serve a thousand megawatts of power in each of these five districts, with a minimum of 50 megawatts of wind power.
The total investment of the Siemens-Turks-Kalyon group will be over $1 billion.
With local wind plants operating, the minimum will produce 3 billion kilowatts of electricity each year, and about 1.1 million houses will receive the annual electricity need from the wind.
The average amount of 1.5 million tonnes of CO2 / year emissions will also be provided through wind plants.
The winning company will build a factory with over 100 million dollars.
The factory will produce an average of 300 to 450 local wind turbines, at least 2.3 megawatts.
The consortium will work for the Ar-Ge for 10 years in at least three of the consortium, wing, generator design, materials technologies and production techniques, software and innovative dental boxes.
While the $5 million budget leaves every year for the Ar-Ge work, 50% of them will work with local engineers.
The factory will be built 21 months after the contract is signed.
The project's license time is 30 years.
"We plan to provide the financing of equipment from foreign sources and the rest of the equipment from local banks," Turkish Council Chairman Kazim Türker said in the project that domestic production will be around 64 per cent.
The tender reflects confidence in the Turkish economy, Türker said.
"Turkey's dependence on the outside has become a bid that will reduce its commitment to a thousand more megawatts," Kalyon Holding Energy Group President Murtaza Ata said.
"We're happy with the outcome," he said.
"We will do everything we can to lower the cost of electricity," Siemens Gamessa, Turkey's top manager, Hakan Yıldırım, said for 160 years.
The local rate of wind turbines that will be produced in the factory will be 65% minimum.
65% of the 8,000 industrial parts found in the wind turbine will be native (at least 5.200 parts).
Each of the five districts will be built at least 50 MW, a total of 1,000 MW facilities.
3.750 jobs are required for 10 years, and $5 million per year will be allocated to Ar-Ge activities.
1.000MW Wind Facility 65% of the Native States rate is at least 2.3 MWe power production of 300 to 450 local wind turbines.
Over $1 billion investment, 400 MW / year wind turbine production capacity over $100 million in factories.
Electricity production that will meet the need of about 1.1 million houses will be reduced to 1.5 million tonnes of CO2 / year emissions each year to produce minimum 3 billion kWh power.
Moore's Ford massacre: Activists Reanimate Racist Linc for Calling Justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury was passed through a group of viewers in the Monroe Georgia countryside, and went to the little Ford Bridge in Moore.
The car with four black passengers and a white driver stepped up to cover the path of a group of white men with guns before reaching the bridge.
The leader of the gang, a man in a medium-aged thin-striped suit, took a long breath from his cigar and stared through the windshield.
Inside, the residents were terrified.
He barked, "We want that Z-o-o, Roger!"
"Get him out of the car!"
As a young black man was dragged out of the front passenger seat, the screams pierced the darkness.
Fortunately, this terrifying scene played on June 22nd is just a reenactment.
But when a noose was thrown around Roger's neck, almost everyone from the audience breathed in a very realistic way.
Human rights advocates have been returning to the Ford Bridge in Moore since 2005 to reenact the lynching of two black couples (Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey) in 1946 by Ku Klux Klan.
So far, no one has been charged with murder.
Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize the reenactment, said, "Even though we see them in our communities, we know who they are, it doesn't seem to think that only one person has been arrested all these years."
"This is a stain in history but a burden in our souls."
Brooks became a 71-year-old former Georgia state congressman and a lifelong advocate for human rights.
For himself, this reanimation is a dramatic action call and a annual reminder to the Monroe community that injustice has never been corrected.
He said, "We want to prosecute, we want results, we want the wounds wrapped up, we want reconciliation, but we have to get justice first."
"We can't have the wounds until we get justice and reconciliation."
On July 27, 1946, the coroner puts a sheet on the body of one of the Ford pearl victims in Moore.
According to the FBI files obtained by NBC News, more than 50 male links from Monroe and the surrounding areas were suspected.
But not one of them was ever investigated.
While suspects remain fugitives for decades, human rights advocates say that the twin motivation of lynches is always known very well throughout the town: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a high court order made it possible for black citizens in Georgia to vote in the preliminary election at the end of that summer.
According to the FBI, about the same time as the election, black partner Roger Malcom stabbed Barnett Hester, a white land owner during a fight, apparently, about a woman.
Brooks said that the rumor in the town was that Hester slept with Malcom's wife, Dorothy, and that the baby he was carrying was not from his own husband.
According to the FBI, Loy Harrison, the leading white landowner on July 25, 1946, paid $600 to get Malcom out of jail.
Dorothy and her cousins went to prison with Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
But as they drove away from prison, when they came to the Ford Bridge in Moore, a lynch gang surrounded the car.
An FBI report concluded, "It turns out Harrison was the one who set up the murders and ordered them."
"Besides, there was obviously a secret agreement between state and local law enforcement forces that didn't just participate in the murder, they destroyed evidence and hid the identity of witnesses."
Brooks was shorter and more specific.
He said, "It was a massacre of the right to vote."
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this society: 'That's what happens if you register and vote.'
For almost ten years, Cassandra Greene has been running the reenactment of Ford Bridge lynches in Moore every year.
His performance puts all the details into consideration, remarkable and based on a deep kind of racism that many believe no longer exist in America.
It's hard to watch, and it's even harder to turn your eyes, but Greene says that's the point.
He said, "We don't want to talk about the lynch because it makes our division face the ugliness inside us."
"But if you don't listen to me or listen to what happened to me, I can't develop a relationship with you."
The rehearsal of this year's production began in June, and on the first day, close to 30 actors (a dozen white and the rest) swarming into a room, and when Greene entered the well-rehearsed general lines of the game, they listened.
Wade Marbaugh is a co-director of Greene's.
Over the years, President Klansman has played the role, but he says the role is never easy.
Marbaugh said, "I feel dirty because it's not me."
"But I think it's important to keep this past alive because we don't want to go back then."
Actors playing Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester throughout the room, Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona were rehearsing their own lines.
The game begins when Malcom screams Hester and pushes her out because he's so angry that he slept with his wife Dorothy.
"Z... i, get off my property!"
He's reacting to Rascona.
There's a shooting sound.
And then everyone's laughing.
Greene laughs the most.
Rascona asked, "What?"
She was agitated, surprised.
Too rough?
Greene said, "No" in the giggles.
"I just don't think white people used to call you z."
One of the black players threw a rock with a joke saying, "Yes."
"You must suppress the 'R'."
So the energy in the room changes and some kind of intimacy replaces unrest.
Everyone is dedicated to doing it right, not only for the sake of the game, but also for the memory of the four killed.
The scene begins again.
This time, Rascona says the word "N" and it's sharp and highlighted.
Absolutely no one's laughing.
Reanimating is rapidly and rapidly ending.
There's screams, gunfire, and then there's silence.
A woman dressed in black, standing on the bodies of actors, reading Billie Holiday's sad eulogy, "Weird Square."
One of the two words breaks his voice.
One hundred yards back, an average four-dozen audience wiping sweat and tears out of their eyes.
The viewer is almost equally divided, black and white.
A couple came from Ithaca, New York to see the performance, many from the road.
While Brooks took them on a sacred journey to the tombs of Malcomos and Dorsey, they were all based on the pressure moisture of Georgia for almost eight hours.
So far, the murders remained an anecdote, but now standing in the same place as the pearl means the weather is cursed.
While the final notes of the song are weakening, Greene invites the crowd to zoom in and examine the bodies.
Kids crouch on their hands, grab fake blood and immovable bodies and whisper to each other.
A little boy mumbling, like he reminded himself, "They're not really dead."
In a few minutes, Greene says thank you to the crowd, and suddenly it's over.
Actors throw their lynch rope and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh in a suit playing President Klansman.
Nick Rascona hugs two of his acting friends and tears come out of their arms, and the emotional cost of performance finally comes to him.
One of the women whispers, "It's okay."
"We know that's not what's in your heart.
You did it for a reason. "
Then the audience sits down with the actors.
At a table, the white couple from Atlanta are having a heated conversation about reenactment with a black couple.
Denise Duplinski is having trouble finding words about how performance makes her feel.
He said, "To hear these terrible, terrible words and those acts come out of people like you and do them because they look like you."
"What this does to me makes me think that lynches are still going on," he added, adding, "They are now only called police armed attacks."
At the end of the room, when Tyrone Brooks eats at his table and tells me about human rights memories, he becomes the center of attention.
He said he's already planning next year's performance.
He said, "Reanimating is kind of inspiring because it describes what we've endured, but it's also instructive."
"It's like if you don't learn from it, it could happen again.
Those who investigate their past and do not know their past are doomed to repeat it. "

EC Party to Congress special website
By the AK Party, 6.
For the usual process of Congress, the "accongre.com" website was set up.
The website included brochures, materials and visuals that the party service would use in the process.
In the site 'Communication Strategy' section, the rules needed to be followed in the Congress process were listed at 14 titles.
Speaking on the website, President and EC Party President Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned the agency members to comply with the party's institutional identity during the congress.
"Now we begin a new phase of breakthrough."
To achieve their 2023 goals with stronger steps, we must be remodeled and refreshed.
"We have to keep working hand by hand, shoulder by shoulder, just like yesterday."
Pearson laid off 3,000 more jobs to reanimate the operation, cut off his profits.
British education group Pearson said that as he began another reconstruction programme to overcome the pressure the company faces, he would do 3,000 more jobs on Friday and reduce the profit share by 72 per cent.
According to Chief Director John Fallon, the layoffs, mostly the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019, will be added to the 4000 positions lost in the previous reconstruction.
In May, Pearson announced a plan to save another 300 million pounds (394 million US dollars) by trying to get the digital learning back on track with a third cost reduction programme.
The company, which agreed to sell its share of the Penguin Random House to his partner Bertelsmann last month, said there was no change in the perspective of this year after reporting its basic sales by 1 per cent in the first half.
Metin 2 took him back to his death!
According to the M.E. 's preliminary report, Hakan's preliminary autopsy report showed that his death was suicide.
In a detailed examination, there were no signs of any trauma and algebra in the child's body.
The reason for the suicide is that the elastic bandage he wrapped around his neck was bored, and he was asphyxiated.
The cloth, which his family described as a bandage, was also determined to be the elastic bandage used in the injuries.
After the detailed report on the child's death was prepared, the report from Newspaper Çalıyar reported that it would be sent to the Public Prosecutor's Office who conducted the investigation.
While police are investigating the child's suicide with all the details, the computer that was seized after the incident continues.
The police will appeal to the testimony of Hakan's friends as well.
It also states that information from the computer of Hakan, which relatives call "cleansed," can be accessed by third persons or a gang.
The police are considering that a gang may have driven Hakan to suicide.
The certainty that Hakan committed suicide turned the eyes into a violent Metin2.
Metin2, who was banned from the Antalya Governorship last year for the cause of addiction and violence in children, was again introduced in 2009, with the murder of 13-year-old "tiny hacker" Metin Kang.
To play Metin2 in Korea in 2005, he has to go into his website and make a member record.
Players are trying to provide peace and justice in the world with the dragon god in the game.
There are wars when you do it, and the dose of violence is increasing.
In the game, the line, the sword, the machete, the axe, the shooting, the piercing weapons, as well as the images of people being torn apart by wild animals and eaten by their flesh.
The player buys characters with money to get stronger.
The family that buried their children the next day, after the incident at the house of Esenyar Stability, Köknar Street, continued to claim murder.
"We don't think he can harm himself or anyone else because of the game," said Father Mehmet Ekinci. "They wrapped the elastic bandage around his neck and tied it to the side."
That's how it was found, son.
We certainly don't think our son could hurt himself and anyone else because of a game on the Internet and commit suicide.
We knew you were playing a game like this.
It wasn't a game he played.
Let's just say when he got a little bored, he quit the game.
Anne Gülizar Ekinci said, "No one gets in or out of the building."
They say my child broke into the house at a certain hour.
None of them match.
When her brother came home, there was only one chair.
"But when his funeral was found, there were two chairs next to the computer."
Could have been involved in the gang.
Families don't usually pay attention to that.
They look like, "My child is home and whatever's going on."
The boy is communicating with a lot of people through games.
There could have been a loan-borrowing situation or a blasphemy.
Or maybe he invited one of the guys in the game to come home, and there might have been a problem between them.
He may have had an impact on problems with other people he contacted over the game, not directly from the game.
The kid may have thought the game was real, the visualization, the fiction.
The trauma that drove him to suicide could be about blackmail.
If the child is facing a family complaint, there's also a depression that he can't solve.
He couldn't have committed suicide because of the game himself.
There's also a chance the kid might be involved in the gang.
He could have been involved in the gang.
There's nothing that the child could have done alone.
Information systems consultant Fusun NEBL: Families should know how to interact with their children.
We can't say games are harmful.
Research says games are useful for the development of children.
What matters here is that parents pay attention to what their kids play and online how they talk to actors.
Families need to know how children are affected by the contents and take precautions.
In Turkey, there are only two children who are said to have died due to the game.
Which means that it's not just the game that a child ends his life.
I wonder what pushed this kid into this.
We need to find out first.
You need to look at sociology and psychology around the kid.
The stock market held up to 50 per cent in Istanbul, eight months' income.
The BIST 100 index continued its escalation train in July 2016 and carried its rise to the 8th moon above.
So the index has gained 45.3 per cent since July 2007, while the first eight months in a row.
With his performance since the beginning of the year, Germany, the United States, the United States, the United States, Japan, the BIST 100 index left behind the world's major markets, and in July, it left no leadership.
With 2.54 per cent increase in the BIST 100 index, which completed July to 7.06 per cent, the Dow Jones index in the United States followed the FTSE 100 index in Britain with 0.81 per cent.
In Almaya, the DAX index and the Nikkei index in Japan completed the July month with value loss.
As of January-July, the BIST 100 index was seen to perform a higher performance than both the main world markets and the developing country stock index.
According to the 2016 closing this year, the BIST 100 per cent, with 10.76 per cent increase, the Dow Jones index, 5.55 per cent value gain, the DAX index, and the Nikkei index, with 3.21 per cent increase, followed by the FTSE 100 index.
The MSCI EM index, which is shown on developing country markets, provided 23 per cent.
Based on the historical process of the BIST 100 index, it has seen similar performances in the past.
The BIST 100 index, which completed the last eight months between December 2006 and July 2007, had increased by 38.3 per cent at this time.
In addition, the BIST 100 index completed eight months between August 1996 and March 1997, gaining value in nine months between May 1997 and January 1998.
Meksa Investment Research Director Eren Can Umut told the AA correspondent that the BIST 100 index has continued to rise for eight months, saying the rise has exceeded 37 per cent since the beginning of the year.
The MSCI said that the developing market index of the (EM) index recorded 23 per cent rise, and that even when we look at these rates, there is positive separation:
The funding flow to developing countries continues since the beginning of the year.
In particular, the funds in the search for higher income prefer countries that give higher interest.
In this case, domestic markets are affected in a positive direction.
Of course, he has a very high appetite for risk on the global scale.
So the stock index, which is at risk status, is overflowing.
In the United States, we see new record levels tested almost every week, parallel to the fact that the S & P 500 index has increased by 11 per cent since Christmas.
At the beginning of the year, he stressed that the US Central Eye (Fed) has stressed the estimated markets, but that Fed has successfully eliminated the uncertainty using the verbal guidance policy, adding that Fed has an insensitive market for increased interest.
He said inflation in the United States is not yet at the desired level, and that Fed will not be hasty about increasing interest and that his expectations for avoiding radical moves are very effective in current prices.
"As fast as Trump's faster-growing prospects for the US economy are positive for the stock markets, the commitment to growth and faster inflation will be strengthened by the fact that the failure of US President Donald Trump to cancel health reform known as" Obamacare, "he said.
He noted that 2016 is a year of many negativity in terms of Turkey's markets, and is attempting to close the difference according to the similar BIST 100 index, which has been negative and oversold.
He reported that they did not see a strong recovery through domestic news flow, adding that the current outlook could be interpreted as a boost in the appetite to take risks abroad and triggered the desire to close the difference according to similar domestic markets.
He said that he watched some profit sales in the BIST 100 index, which tested new records by technically 108.600 levels:
The 109.500-110,000 region is a critical threshold in the short term.
It's normal for snow sales to happen after approaching these levels.
In the short term, we think a local or global new story should be created for prices of 110,000.
For now, the downside of 107,500 support could trigger snow sales.
In that case, even though we follow 107,000 intervals, I think we can see the relaxation of 106,000 to 105.500.
In particular, the breach of 105.500 support can bring back the withdrawal from 104.300 levels, which corresponds to 50% of the increase from 100,000 to 108.600.
Both the Fed and the European Central Bank (ECB) decisions will be at the focal point of global market, Umut said, adding that expectations for Fed are already clear, but the probability of increasing interest in September FOMC may trigger strengthening in US dollars.
"What is important is what the ECB is going to say," he said, citing the developing country (GOU), which is in the short-term overpurchase shadow, could trigger snow sales in stock index.
Following the July monetary policy board meeting, ECB President Mario Draghi said they would discuss the track of money policy in the fall, and that said that the euro / dollar password would rise above 1,1700 levels.
So the statements that the 60 billion-euro supply programme could be reduced or terminated will mean that the post-Fed liquidity will be reduced by ECB on the global scale.
"Therefore, negative prices can be addressed for the country's markets, which are required to open high-rent and access to foreign funds such as Turkey," he said.
Gedic Investment Investment Advisory Director Erol Gürcan said in November 2016 that after Trump was elected president in the United States, there was a very serious rally for global stock markets.
The main element that triggered this rally movement is possible, he said, saying that it is possible to say that there are developments that boost global growth prospects -- especially Trump's commitments to tax reduction.
The market was the head of the emerging markets in the global rally in Istanbul.
One of the most important reasons for this is that the BIST 100 index has been pretty competitive in recent years compared to similar developing country markets, but it helps to say that the steps taken by policy makers to support the economy and financial markets have also played a serious role.
In particular, we can say that the credit guarantee (KGF), which has become active with the reputation of March, has a serious impact on the rise that has been observed so far in the index.
In the rest of the year, Georgian reported that positive developments have been significantly reflected in prices and that the KGF, which has a significant role in this rise, has gradually reached the gratification, has said that although the BIST 100 index is still stable compared to similar country markets, the search for a new story for the rest of the year could slowly come to the front.
In particular, he said that the 180-day action plan, which has been expected to be shared for a while, could be a positive contribution to the development such as the recent tax reduction, such as boosting the limits of the Credit Garanti Fund.
"For developing countries, Fed, ECB and the Central Bank of England (BoE), the main development of the country's central banks will be among critical risks for developing countries," stressing that "Fed is likely to start the development of the process of bilanco-reduction, which is likely to result in the recent development of the EU's development of the EU, which is likely to start the development of the EU as well as well as a result of the development of the development of the development of the development of the EU."
In the next period of possible corrections in the index, Georgian said the increase trend since the beginning of the year and the 104.150-104.600 support zone in response to the 200-hour moving average are critical, adding that if this support area is broken, the reform movement could continue at 101,700, 100,000, 99.200 levels.
He said the index could rise to 110,000 to 112,000 if the current trend of ascension is protected and the current historical summit level of 108.605 resistance is broken.
Kabul convoy attack: NATO was killed in a military suicide attack
According to authorities, an suicide bomber in Kabul, the Afghan capital, attacked a military convoy, killed a NATO soldier and injured several of them.
NATO statement said five soldiers and a translator were injured.
Unconfirmed local sources say three civilians have died in the incident in the city's Karabak region.
The bombing was the last act of violence in Afghanistan this month; more than 30 people died Tuesday in a mosque explosion in Herat.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
A joint patrol mission with the Afghan army was attacked by a personnel-driven manual explosive, NATO announced in the explosion Thursday night.
The statement said that all wounded were well and were under treatment at the US military hospital at Bagram Air Base.
Reporters say the Taliban's increasing power and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in Karabak is an important concern for NATO forces, which are spoken near Bagram.
According to the United Nations, Afghanistan witnessed the death of at least 1662 civilians, average 20% in the capital, in the first half of 2017.
At the end of July, a suicide bomb car in Kabul's mostly Shii area killed at least 30 people.
The Taliban said they carried out the attack.
On 31 May, a massive bombing in the centre of the city killed over 150 people in 2001 in the most deadly militant attack in the country after US-led forces expelled the Taliban from power.
The violence emphasises the instability security situation in Afghanistan, while US President Donald Trump weighed down the number of US troops helping the country's military and police.
Reporters say recent weeks of suicide bombings in Kabul have caused a crisis in the government, its policies, and especially in public security for President Ashraf Ghani's reputation.
The EPA has given up the dirty air rule after the trials
The US Environmental Protection Organization has returned from the decision to delay the law that demands that the states prevent the emissions that cause dirty smoke, which is an Obama-era law, with 15 states suing its organisation on this initiative one day later.
The EPA announced late Wednesday that the organisation has shown its determination to work with the states, saying it will continue with the "2015 Ozon Decisions."
"We believe in dialogue with our state partners and to be sensitive to them," EPA chief Scott Pruitt said.
In June, Pruitt announced the EPA's intention to delay ozone decisions by October 2018; the current dirty smoke pollution is measured in various parts of the country, and the decision is to make a cut in order to meet more difficult air quality standards.
15 states, mostly Democrats, and Columbia County, filed a lawsuit Tuesday saying this effort was illegal.
President Donald Trump administration continues to seek out Trump's search for a wide range of environmental arrangements that were implemented by former President Barack Obama as part of a wider agenda called reviving economic growth.
But these efforts led to the reaction of the Democrats and protecting groups who are concerned about the impact of more emissions on public health.
EPA's website says the ozone air solution can "reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms like asthma."
The forest gave me the good news...
Stoper and the wing transfer!
Beşiktaş President Fikret Forest has announced to Bein Sports about Dutch footballer Jeremain Lens and Stoper transfer.
The Fikret Forest said...
There's no surprise in the transfer.
We're not looking for much transfer, we're shooting points.
Now we're going to transfer a cooper and a wing.
We have the Champions League games, and hopefully we'll draw a good lot.
We have to transfer wings.
10 million euros is easy, but we don't have that kind of budget.
If it comes to what we call budgets, we transfer, and if we don't, we don't die.
There's no way I'm going to tell you until I'm clear about the Lens.
We're a public firm.
Peace is the end of patience.
The threat of the ICID is only for August 30th, isn't it for the festival?
The Ankara Governorship continues to ban all public events, including the sitting action, the memorial meeting and all such events during August, on grounds of "ISIS threat."
The governor's restraining order includes "all public events," while 7 in Ankara.
The International Grand Ankara Festival continues.
"There is no question that August 30th is affected by the ban," CHP Group Vice President and Ankara MP Levent Gök told SÖZCU.
He's got some serious confusion.
Even the governor is hesitant about which decision to make...
The government's duty is to create areas where the holidays will be celebrated.
CHP Ankara MP Murat Emir said, "All Ankara has a security problem, only Göksek's organizations have no security issues."
Ankara Independent MP Aylin Nazlıaka carried the ban to Parliament.
"Doesn't this ban make clear the republic and Atatürk hostility of the AKP clear? How do you intend to prevent millions in areas to celebrate August 30th?" Nazlıaka, who suggested the Prime Minister's response.
"I learned myself from Edwina that I was deceived."
Demet Shener, who continued the divorce trial with Abraham Kutluay, was present in the previous day with his attorney, Asli Hatemi and his fiance.
Şener filed a civil suit against Edwina Sponza, who claimed to have destroyed her home, and presented photos of Sponza and Kutluay as evidence to the court.
"Demet has obtained my personal photos illegally," said the socialite beauty Sponza.
'I don't know what I'm talking about. '
After this recent development, Shener met with his lawyer in Decatessen, the fiancé, and went out of the place when he saw the journalists.
When reminded of Edwina Sponza's claim to the photos, Shener laughed, "God, I must have entered her house and taken it."
Aslı Hatemi de Sponza said, "There is a complaint like this, but its contents are not true."
"We have everything; we have submitted it to the court," he said.
"Everyone recently knew about your wife's relationship with Sponza."
"How could you not know?" she was shocked by the question.
What?
How?
"I swear I didn't know," he said, "Am I going to believe in my husband or the rumor of my son?"
After journalists insisted on asking, "Haven't you heard it?" he said, "No," he said, "I didn't hear it, of course I heard it the first time."
But I never believed in anything like that.
Everything was normal, it was in its place; I had nothing to suspect.
Ma'am, when I put everything in my hand, I learned it all, so it's new...
"Was the person who sent the evidence Sponza?" Shener answered the question, saying, "Yes," and the photos and correspondence he presented to the court were confused by the fact that Sponza himself sent it to him.
Sponza claimed that his correspondence with Abraham Kutluay was a montage.
Beşiktaş will sign with Negredo tomorrow
The Besiktaş Club will officially include the Spanish footballer Alvaro Negredo tomorrow.
The signing ceremony will be held at Vodafone Park for Negredo, which Beşiktaş agreed on the transfer of Spain to Valencia Club.
The signing ceremony for the club president Fikret Forest will be held at 12: 00.
Meanwhile, the Spanish footballer will pass his medical check tomorrow morning.
Qatar: We broke the embargo in hours thanks to Turkey
Qatar Economy and Trade Minister Ahmed bin Jassim Al Thani said they want to convey their gratitude to the people of Turkey.
Al Thani: "Thank you very much for your honorable attitude and the support you gave us."
I also give greetings to my brother President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of the Qatar order.
The Qatar economy has proven its resistance.
In many countries, economies are negatively affected, while our economy remains intact.
In order for Qatar to become independent and powerful, we must work with our power.
In hours, we've broken the embargo against us largely because of Turkey.
We're not missing anything right now.
Our natural sources, natural gas exports, are giving great support to Qatar's economy.
We were not affected by Turkey from the brutal blockade against us and against the law.
Today Qatar continues to produce worldwide at natural gas and LNG again.
"After what happened, we had a 30 per cent increase, not a drop in our natural gas exports," he said.
"There was a $554 million volume in the first quarter of the trade volume between us," Al Thani said, adding that the work continues in all areas with brotherly relations between Qatar and Turkey.
In this, recent decisions have played an important role.
With Turkish products proving themselves in the Qatar market, it is very important for us to speed up the entrance of goods from all sectors from Turkey, to make investments in many areas.
"Thank you very much for your constructive attitude towards us," he said.
The cost of recent disasters is $300 million
TSB President Can Akın Çaklar said that after the flood raid on 18 July, the insurance companies were reported 116m euros in damage, and that a 12 million lira of damage was reported in the Gokova earthquake on 21 July, and that on 27 July, there were 25,000 damage reported in Istanbul.
"The damage caused by the stock in terms of Kasko insurance is 3,500 lira per vehicle, and the glass damage is around 1,000 lira."
"In the earthquake, average housing damage is $6,000."
Stressing that economic losses are working hard as a sector, the Canağlar said that three out of four people do not have housing insurance, and two out of each two businesses do not have helmet insurance. "The risk of natural disaster is increasing due to climate change."
Due to the low level of insurance in our country, the risk of facing serious damage costs for our citizens and institutions is growing every day.
All these costs must not be left on the government.
Insurance policies aren't as expensive as they think, insurance isn't just a damaged sector; it's also a risk management consultant.
Increasing insurance awareness and insurance rate is very important to our people and our country.
"Kasko insurance says in general that the insurance should report their damage within five business days, and that time is over yesterday."
"Is there going to be an insurance victim?" he answered: "Even if there is such a time in general, the statute of Commerce takes two years."
"Besides, this is a natural disaster, so no insurance needs to panic, no company says I don't pay."
That's how the German media saw the giant tender!
Turkey's first Wind Energy Rerenewable Energy Resources (YEKA) won the tender for the German Siemens during a period of problems between Turkey and Germany.
The German media announced this development "The German Siemens won the giant tender in Turkey."
"Consortium will invest over $1 billion in wind plant investments," DWelle Turkje reported that the YEKA tender was won by Siemens-Turkers-Kalyon consortium.
"The tender for creating the capacity for a thousand megawatts wind energy is the first YEKA tender in Turkey," said the number of companies competing from 8 to 2 today, while Chinese Mingyang and German Siemens consortium were facing 30 rounds of consortium.
After the tender, Minister of Energy and Natural Resources Berat Albak made dramatic statements about Turkey-Germany relations.
The tender resulted in the victory of the German company Siemens, and we can tell that this picture is an important message to the region and the world.
And as we look at Turkey and Germany in terms of 200 years of historical co-operation, I think it will contribute to Turkey-Germany relations.
No matter how many regional crises in the world, I was very proud to announce that Turkey is the head of the region and the world's most reliable investment countries.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko are meeting for the first time, discussing a possible competition.
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who will intercept the most satisfying boxing match in the near future for £147, met each other for the first time on Thursday.
The invincible World Boxing Council Light Cycle Champion Garcia was in separate rooms in Los Angeles until the World Boxing Organization walked down the hall and greeted the super-feather coin champion Lomachenko.
In Showtime on Saturday, with the vote union, the former world champion Adrien Broner in four cycles, after Garcia defeated him, both fighters are among the top five members of the list.
Garcia reached out her right hand and said, "How's it going, champ?
Good luck to you. "
Lomachenko will defend his belt against Miguel Marriaga at ESPN at 7: 00 on Saturday night.
While posing for photographs, Lomochenko's manager Egis Klimar noted that a potential competition between fighters would be "the perfect size."
Garcia made the "I'm an old feather fuck" reminder.
"I went up for the Broner (140 pounds), but I'm not that big.
I'm little for 140.
I want to get on the lightweight.
He has to go to a light coin, so we can fight.
That's what the fans want.
Let's give them this. "
Lomachenko joined.
"Boxing needs this fight."
Klimas asked if it should be in Pay and Watch; setting a date with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockout) next summer and fighting Lomachenko in a 135-pound opening match this year is part of her strategy; Garcia shows interest in the Jorge Lines-Luke Campbell match for the light coin title in Forum on 23 September.
"Pay and watch," Garcia said, "because all the fans want it," and then whatever channel offers the best financial package is open to him. "
We're the real names.
No other name would create that kind of attention.
Whenever they're ready... "
Garcia said she appreciated Lomachenko as a "great fighter" and could join her Saturday's match.
But Lomachenko hesitated to give Garcia a lot of credit and said that he thought the three coin champions from Riverside looked "too slow," and "Sorry, Mikey... you wanted the knockout."
Garcia said the focus was to show the fist power first and then boxing.
They both said they felt that momentum was created for their own encounter.
"This is a fight that needs to be fought.
Another fight doesn't create so much attention and gossip.
Garcia said, "I'm so happy to deal with it."
Lomachenko said, "I've waited for the best fighters and he's Mikey.
It's gonna be a great fight. "
Turkey from Russia to America
The White House does not consider implementing sanctions that affect Moscow's pipeline construction, but sanctions for Russia can increase the cost of these lines.
And that's because the debt cost increased.
Kremlin, who was worried that Western investment partners would consider pulling out of projects due to sanctions, accelerated the construction of the pipeline as a response.
The Swiss company Allseas Group, who built the Turkish Stream line, which is scheduled to reach Turkey under the Black Sea, has accelerated construction on Gazprom's request.
Reuters said Gazprom began construction of a second line parallel to the Turkish Stream in a hurry to export more gas to Europe.
The new results of Sweden's inflammatory age assessment test have been announced
The latest results of the evaluation tests of refugees who were subjected to a new medical age assessment in Sweden ruled that more than 80 per cent of those who participated in the test were over 18 years old, but not everyone trusts the accuracy of these tests.
Sweden's National Medical and Medicine Agency (Rättsmedialverket) began testing earlier this year.
The tests were designed to make the age assessment more accurate in the refugee process after criticizing the failure of some refugees who claim to be underage (Migrationsverket).
So far, Migrationsverket has sent the 6880 cases to test, and the Bureau of Forensics and Medicine have announced the results of a total of 2481 from March to July 31, 2017.
80% (2002) have been ruled 18 or above, while in 25 cases the Forensics and Pharmaceuticals have ruled that the subject is "probably 18 and above."
In 432 cases, the result was that the person was "probably below 18."
The tests were only conducted in cases where the age of one was suspicious.
According to Johan Goransson of Forensics and Medicine, the results are consistent with past months.
"According to the past months, we see no big difference in statistics, the numbers are pretty consistent," he told the Local.
The height of cases that are ruled to be over 18 doesn't mean refugees are lying about their age.
In May, the apartment announced the results of the 581 test and said "there are 442 cases" where people who were investigated were 18 years old or older.
When Svenska Dagbladet reviewed the results of the 581 cases, he found that 243 cases were clearly 18 this year.
The medical age assessment of 20-year-old teeth is criticised in some circles, including taking X-rays and doing MRI scans of knee joints, then analysing them to dentists and radiologists.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus, the endocrinologist of the Karolinska Institute, who evaluates the biological maturity of people who work on cloud age sooner or later.
"I have reasons to think about it, and I don't think that's the kind of measurement that should be used.
It's very suspicious to decide biological life that way.
If we can't say it for certain, we shouldn't pretend it is, "said the Metro daily.
However, Gözansson from the Bureau of Forensic Medicine and Medicine advocated the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you may say that a child is a grown-up is a minor risk.
The biggest risk is that the person is just below 18, so the risk is about 10%. "
The mosque of Star Hamid opens today
In 1885, the mosque of Star Hamid, which was built by Abdulhamit to the architect Nikolaidis Jelpullo, will be opened today with his prayers on Friday after his restoration.
Regional Director İrsel Yellow said the restoration work started in June 2013 and that the mosque was ready for opening.
Yellow gave me this information: "Restoration has been conducted in 2 locations."
Part one was the repair of the mosque, the main building.
The second part was environmental regulation.
In the first part, about 16 million dollars, and about 11 million dollars for environmental regulation.
First, the bullets of the wooden dome opened, and after they were remodeled, the outer walls, the outer elements, were removed from the rust.
The drainage of validation has been made.
There's a lot of rich decorations, as it turns out, when we get into the mosque.
It's a work with star motifs, and it's very rich in pencil work.
There's a karma slope here.
"Selcuk marks are also seen in the Ottoman and 1885, and the baroque has become a factor in architecture."
ABBOLHAMIT HAS A MOTHER
"The chandelier found in the middle of the mosque is the German Emperor 2."
He had partial malfunctions, remodeled and hanged.
It's a very valuable and important piece.
There are wooden cages on both sides of the mosque, which are symmetrical, called salutes.
We know these were made by our supreme judge, Abdulhamit Khan, who personally built the mosque.
So we have information that he personally did it with his own hands and that he was mounted here.
They're still standing here in their original form.
He said President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is expected to attend the mosque's opening ceremony.
Pantic claim in Göztepe
Ukraine's press wrote that 25-year-old Serbian football player who failed to make it to the staff in Dinoma Kiev could be hired to a yellow-red club.
Football country Pantic, which began on Serbia's Red Star team, wore Vilarreaal, Cordoba, Eibar and Alaves in Spain.
Pantic signed Dynamo Kiev during the last season.
The governor of West Virginia announced that he would change his party.
The Democratic Governor of West Virginia Jim Justice announced on Thursday that he will change his party at a rally with President Trump.
"Whether you like it or not, the Democrats left me," Governor Justice said.
"Today I will tell you with many prayers and thoughts... today as the West Virginia, I can no longer help you as a Democratic Governor."
Miting is drowning in cheering.
"So tomorrow I will change my record as a Republican," Justice added.
"If I were a coach, I'd tell you it's time to start a different game."
Mr. Trump promised to make an important announcement at the West Virginia rally earlier.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia with 42 points and the Democratic candidate Justice did not support Hillary Clinton.
According to Forbes, Justice, the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes says he owns coal mines in five states in the coal business he inherited from his father.
His presence is about $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Congress announced on Thursday that "Governor Justice's change of party was another blow to the Democratic Party, who preferred to work to prevent it instead of making our country big again."
"With the control of 15 governors and at least a number of state legislature in history, Governor Justice's announcement is only the last rejection of a party that is completely headless and cannot find a positive, unifying message," RNC woman spokesman Ronna McDaniel told CBS.
I'll do what's best for Turkey
Olympic third, Turkey's record player.
He was born in Cuba, but he documented Turkey, which he came for the F.Baht, his own homeland...
In 2013, he became a Turkish citizen and wore the national uniform...
First he became the European champion, then the Olympic third...
Now it's one of Turkey's most important medals at the World Athletic Championship.
Yasmani Capello, who competed at 400 meters, spoke to the SABAH before the championship today.
When they were young, they didn't want you because they didn't like their degrees in Cuba.
You've improved your trainer grip.
Then they called, but this time you didn't go.
Some people think you chose Turkey for money.
What are you talking about?
The last thing I remember about Cuba was leaving the national team.
From that moment on, I've drawn a line to what I've been through, what I've been through.
Then I came to Turkey with the invitation to the Fenerbahçe Club.
The National Team initiative was because of Fenerbahçe.
They offered me an offer for backup.
I've turned over a new leaf with Turkey.
I had a lot of injuries in my youth, but after the opportunities presented to me in Turkey, I made significant achievements in Rio and Amsterdam.
I can't wait to do the best at the World Athletic Championship and win a different title.
You've been crying at a press conference lately.
Can you tell us why?
Every time I get a question about Turkey taking care of me, I think about my childhood, getting kicked out of the Cuban national team at 23.
And of course, people in Turkey are coming to me.
When I won the gold medal at the European Championships in Amsterdam, I felt the same way when the Stability March was stolen.
I couldn't hold my tears.
And thank you very much for giving Turkey the opportunity to fulfill my dreams.
I'm so glad you belong to the Turkish national team.
I'll be here until my legs run.
You said you might have a Turkish lover before.
You're with a Turk now, and you went to Cuba with him.
Would you like to share what you've been through?
The biggest increase in being with a Turk is calm...
When I compare it to Cuban women...
The Turkish girls are having an affair.
Your girlfriend is also your assistant trainer.
You guys have been together all day, like, getting involved in your diet?
He eats more sweets than I do.
I don't actually have a very tight diet, but sometimes it gets mixed up in what I eat.
My trainer, Massimo Matrone, often gives harsh warnings with my phrase, but I know that these are for my own good.
How are you with Turkish food? Does your boyfriend cook for you?
Turkish women cook very well, but my boyfriend does it better.
(Laughter) Dry beans and rice are my first choice.
_
My trainer in Cuba didn't believe me.
He replaced me with other young people.
After winning medals for Turkey, we met in Cuba.
Looking at my face, he showed me to the young athletes next to him, and he said, "Look, I raised him."
I just laughed at her.
_
Your glasses you wear in the races are curious...
I'm just using it for concentration.
As soon as I wear the glasses, I cut off my relationship with the world and build a wall on both sides of me.
I'm just focusing on the finish line and I don't see anything else.
When we say "Tokyo 2020" for TOKYO, what's the first thing that comes to mind?
Felix Sanchez...
He won a gold medal at the 2012 London Olympics at the age of 35, 400 metres disabled.
If he can do it, I can do it in Tokyo at 33, why not?
TURKCELL TREATY
"We strongly believe that Yasmani Capello will succeed in London and that Yasmani will represent our flag in this championship."
We wish every athlete to compete in London.
"We will continue our support for further development of Turkish athleticism and greater success for our country," he said.
Coe praises Russian 'sincere' apology 'for the doping scandal
According to the doping scandal, Sebastian Coe, the boss of global athletics, praised Russia's sincere apology, but stressed that the time for the country to be accepted into sports is not right.
Russia's athletic boss Dmitry Shylakhtin told the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Athletic Championship that its country is right to be banned from sports and that he is determined to fight doping.
He said he apologized to all the athletes whose gold and silver medals were forcibly taken from them in the competition.
Despite his assessment, the ICAF Congress voted in November 2015 that the ban should continue after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I think today is a very sincere response, a very intimate presentation," IAAF chief Coe told reporters.
"The entire council and the entire Congress are pleased that the Russian Federation has accepted itself, that it has survived the most turbulent days and that it has done everything possible to ensure that the Federation is restructured..."
Coe also said Russia is happy to accept its readmission criteria.
"I think it's a very constructive day, and I think it's being led, but Congress supports the suggestion that the task force is not the right time for Russia's rights to be returned," Coe said.
"In the next few months, we must do everything we can to normalize this situation.
Our guiding principle has always been to ask to separate clean athletes from the flawed system, "he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes who meet the strict IAAF criteria will compete objectively at the World Athletic Championship in London on Friday.
The head of the IAAF task force Rune Andersen said on Monday that Russia has yet to meet many criteria for the extradition of its rights.
After a presentation to the IAAF Council in London, he told reporters that the drug test is still insufficient and that banned coaches are still working freely.
Don't deny the US 'YPG' to the tank 'news
The US Ankara Embassy has announced that no tanks have been given to anyone who fights in Syria.
Hundreds of trucks were sent to the YPG with tanks and guns were denied.
"An explanation for the wrong news in the media about the trucks going to Syria," the embassy quoted him as saying in a statement,
In a series of media reports in the last few days, the United States has allegedly sent hundreds of trucks full of tanks and weapons to support the YPG.
These reports ignore some fundamental facts about the current situation in Syria.
The United States has not given tanks to any group fighting against Deasha in Syria.
Most of ABDIN's military aid, primarily light weapons and ammunition, supports the Syrian Arab Coalition (SAK) elements within the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDG).
The Syrian Arabs, including the SAK, are fighting to clear the Dede out of the region and reunite their homes.
TYDTA President Ermut: Direct foreign investment will be over last year
TYDTA President Arda Ermut said 55 per cent of the investment that came last year came after July.
"Perhaps there would be more increase," Ermut quoted Ermut as saying because of the coup attempt of July 15, FETÖ as saying.
Maybe without these conditions, without some regional developments, we could have seen more of the impact.
That's why we have more hope for next year.
I hope it's going to be a brighter year in terms of direct investment.
As of the first five months, we're going up by 11 per cent for the first five months of last year.
But we don't find that enough.
"We hope there will be more."
"It does not concern us whether global or regional developments," Ermut said, stressing that they are trying to diversify investors.
Ermut reminded me that 75 per cent of direct investments came from Europe by 2010:
That number's down to 66 percent.
Again, Asia's share came from 2% to 7-8%.
Russia's share has increased.
While we were trying to do that, the Gulf countries had some issues among themselves.
Turkey has a good relationship with all of them; especially Saudi Arabia and Qatar are two key actors.
But the problem between these two countries makes us sad and thus allows investors to delay their decision a little longer.
Not only in terms of investments in Turkey, but because of that, we may have some delays.
Arda Ermut reminded me that there have been some incidents about Germany last week, but that the government, especially President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has shown a clear and conclusive reaction to this situation.
When they discussed the investors of the most violent political crisis, President Erdogan's reaction said, "Look, problems happen among governments, absolutely not among the peoples."
Second of all, these people came and invested in my country.
These are no different to us than Turkish companies.
On the contrary, they'll come to us when they have the slightest problem, and we'll figure it out.
"We will not allow them to be victims," Ermut said, adding that they continue to support all investors with the comfort of it.
"We can guarantee that in the coming period."
You'll see that no German companies, no political problems in any way, are going to be a problem for investors from the countries we've had.
On the contrary, hopefully, we will do our best to increase investments from these countries.
We think the investments from here will continue to increase.
Of course, political developments can sometimes affect perceptions about the investment environment.
"But we will do our part at this point, and we will do our best with the aim that our investors and our investors will not be affected by the perception of the investment environment."
TYDTA President Ermut told me that Turkey began to receive great interest in China after a single generation of one-way strategies, but if problems in the Gulf are resolved, they expect the largest investment from the Gulf.
"In relations with Germany, we had trouble with these relationships, we had investments because of this incident, we ran away," Ermut said, adding that there were companies coming and following.
"10% of the projects in our portfolio are close to German companies," Ermut said.
So almost 10% of the companies we've been seeing around the world are German companies.
Some of these are companies with already invested in Turkey.
The guy's going to raise his investment or something, and we're going to be open as a project.
"Therefore, German companies are still a significant part of our daily business flow," he said.
Stressing that all state institutions should be careful during the time of their perception operations to Turkey, Ermut said the issue is sensitive and could be affected by the slightest bad communication.
Ermut explained that what happened in the past two or three weeks was a good lesson:
Investors and politicians always have different agenda.
We've always seen that economic relations always allow political developments to form some sort of path.
Germany will remain an important business partner and an important investor.
Because they already have a lot of investments in Turkey.
And unfortunately, the election agenda in Germany increases that kind of rhetoric.
I think they'll get a little better once they're gone.
In Saudi Arabia, both countries pay attention not to have negative explanations.
After all, an investor in Turkey is targeting all environmental countries' markets.
So, not because of Saudi Arabia, but because of the uncertainty in the region, there have been some slow processes.
But we still have our talks with these investors.
My personal opinion is that investors are waiting for a decision they might get faster.
'In a negative sense, I see uncertainty because of the crisis between Turkey and Saudi Arabia, 'said Saudi investors.
On the contrary, we have Saudi investors who still live in Turkey, who are meeting with us while we're on vacation here, following all their processes.
Arda Ermut reminded Turkey last year that international direct investments (UDY) are 12.3 billion dollars, and said, "I think we'll definitely beat it this year.
"But how long we will pass, these regional developments will affect global uncertainty," he said.
"I hope that if there is no bad progress, we will certainly close the end of the year better than last year," Ermut said, hoping that the impact would be a little more limited.
Ermut noted that some of the major investments will continue to be real estate, logistics, health, fintech, IT, petro-chemistry, food, energy and production could be seen.
"We may have an investment announcement recently," Ermut stressed that they will have new investments to make in the coming months.
It's not a billion dollars, but it's a big investment.
"There may be investments in interesting countries," he said.
Operation in 9 provinces to 4 wine companies: 55 detention
İstanbul Anti-trafficking Department teams have detected that the foil covering the fungal deed that the four wine companies sold on was not glued to the bottle, and that the TPDK bands were collected after the product was sold on the plank were sold, and were bartered by the newly produced wine.
The Montenegrin teams say the state has lost $20,000 in tax due to the use of the suspects' bandages over and over again.
Police teams launched a co-operation today at 55 addresses between Istanbul, Edirne, Tekirdağ, Bursa, Balıkekir, Manisa, Aydın, Denizli and Nevşehir factories and warehouses.
In the operation, 55 people were taken into custody, with a total of 15,000 on sale, 52 thousand 480 used bottles of wine filled with TPDK bands, 12,890 TPDK bands, 3 guns and bullets, 992 cases of illegal cigars, 698 bottles of alcohol, and 10 different kinds of alcohol.
55 people detained were brought to the Anti-trafficking Department on Vatan Street.
Suspects are being processed at the police station.
Their team's operation in the factory, storage and businesses was reflected in police cameras.
Police teams have been monitoring it by removing the hoodies found on wine bottles ready to sell in a warehouse.
A police team survey of bags full of TAPDK bands collected from used bottles has been recorded.
How does the financial rules of football affect Neymar's departure to Paris?
The rules to prevent unlimited spending of European football clubs will not prevent Neymar from transferring the world record to France's Paris-Saint Germain from the Barcelona of Spain.
From the prestigious Champions League tournament, the management unit that controls the European game, Paris Saint-Germain, could have any results.
The Financial Fair Game rules, released by UEFA in 2011, mean that in front of the PSG, he will have to show that Neymar has finally financed his transfer without massive losses.
Barcelona was paid 222m euros (262 million dollars) just to buy the Brazilian out of its contract, and Neymar will rule a salary that will find tens of millions of dollars a year.
Some financial aspects of Neymar going to France are:
Given the team's money from the energy-rich Katari family, the PSG can certainly pay Neymar to sign and add it to the other star galaxy.
The clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money to buy players, but they have to balance it with legitimate revenue sources, including the fact that they're handling their football business.
The FFP was designed by Michel Platini after he was elected head of UEFA in 2007.
The former French player believed that the clubs that were behind the success were effective fraud, and that if banks or owners pulled their support, he was at risk of bankruptcy.
In 2011, FFP began to watch their losses instead of focusing on the debt of clubs.
The change meant that Roman Abramovic first used a model in Chelsea in 2003 (buy a club with potential), spend a lot to improve the team and make a global brand.
During the 3-year FFP evaluation, which continues until 2018, clubs can be damaged by 30m euros.
Although Platini was dishonorably removed from the presidency in 2015, his successor at UEFA, Aleksander, is still determined to give up his family without excessive spending.
Andrea Traverso, who runs the FFP at UEFA, told the Associated Press last week: "FFP is definitely not dead, and we will surely strengthen the rules by moving forward."
Although PSG will pay for Neymar's purchasing clause in mass, it may extend the amount to a contract period for accountability reasons.
Neymar signed a 5-year deal, so the transfer fee can be shown as a 44.4m-euro cost in the annual accounts of the next 5 years.
The first wave in 2014 saw the implementation of the heaviest contributors to Manchester City, owned by PSG and Abu Dabi.
The PSG was then sentenced to 60 million euros (then $82 million), which were reduced to 20 million euros, and was ordered to limit the 2014-2015 season with 21 players instead of 25.
The UEFA is in contact with clubs that can try to cheat financial regulators by infecting its income through companies associated with the owners of the club.
Although a folded company can sponsor PSG, if the value of sponsorship is thought to exceed standard market values, UEFA will not allow it to be considered a legitimate income.
In 2014, when the UEFA ruled that the Qatar Tourism Authority's PSG sponsorship was blown up, that's what happened.
Some of Neymar's earnings from PSG could come through the payments of Qatar's 2022 World Cup organising committee.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 denied that Neymar would become the World Cup ambassador, and such a move could be easily uncovered by UEFA regulators.
The sanctions to the PSG in the past mean that UEFA will be more careful against the attempts to bypass the rules.
UEFA is not in a preventive meeting with the PSG about Neymar's transfer, according to those who are concerned on Tuesday.
Since they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation, they spoke to The Associated Press in the condition that they remained hidden.
Recent accounts show that PSG made more than 10 million euros with 542.4m euros in 2015-16.
Last fiscal year's accounts haven't been published yet.
The PSG expects Neymar's arrival to contribute to sponsorship agreements, gift and form sales.
The club expects to increase at least 30 per cent of the cycle after the signing.
The Spanish League, clearly disturbed by the departure of one of the greatest players in football, tried to prevent Neymar's departure from claiming that PSG violated FFP.
"This is an open financial doping case with the club and its state," La Liga chief Javier Tebas told the Spanish newspaper AS that Qatar is the absolute owner of the PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsenal Wenger, whose club belongs to an American sports giant, shares his concerns about the financing of La Liga by a state.
Wenger said on Thursday, "This is a result of ownership, and in the last 15 years, it has completely changed the entire floor of football."
"Once a country has a club, anything is possible.
It would be hard to respect Financial Fair Play because for a country such a great player representing a country could have different methods or different interests.
Insurance company 'ceiling price' rebellion
According to TSB data, the insurance sector has been damaged since 2006 at the traffic range.
In 2015, the sector, which damaged 2.35 billion dollars, gained only 19 million euros in 2016.
The stock market is being processed in Istanbul, including Activities, Anatolia Insurance and Sun Insurance.
The 11-year damage in traffic insurance has reached 7.3 billion dollars, the loss of the sector with the ceiling prim applied to 2.3 billion dollars this year, estimated the estimated damage rate to 125 per cent, he said at a meeting of the first six months of the TSB's initial results in 2017.
"This means that by financing the bad driver, we increase the price of the citizens' housing policy," Çağlar said.
"75% of the sector is foreign, and our partners abroad are financing the bad driver in some sense," he said.
The ages continued:
We don't expect any money from traffic, but given the past 11 years, we can't show that we've made any profit for any year.
"We accept that, but in a reasonable environment, we continue to hope that we can carry that damage with other policies," he said.
"In 2012, about 30 per cent in traffic cigarettes have increased prices, almost doubled in 2015, and we have written the greatest damage to our history," he said.
"Even in an environment where prices are so high," he said, "At the end of 2016, our wife was only $19 million in traffic."
"In the free recipe, we will reduce the price of the good driver and give the bad driver a high price."
"But the Treasury is looking at the general direction, and the final word is in the Treasury," he said.
The rise in mandatory traffic insurance premiums from 2015 affected a large part of society, the Treasury Undersecretary said, adding that from 12 April, the maximum prim (roof price) applied.
According to this, the maximum premiums for mandatory traffic insurance policies have been determined in the area of the city groups, which have been determined by the size of each car group, step and traffic density and accident statistics.
On the other hand, as of July, the damage frequency for mandatory traffic cigarettes was implemented for high-level or vehicle groups "Risky Insurance Pool."
Prim and damage related to traffic insurance policies within the pool will be shared among insurance companies.
These fuses will be detected by the Treasury Undersecretary.
In traffic in the first six months of 2017, the prim production decreased by 11.5 per cent in traffic, while the number of policies increased by 4.9 per cent by 4.6 million by 4.9 per cent, according to inflation, the reduction in traffic policies reached about 30 per cent, he said.
"With these ceiling prices, this damage cannot be sustained.
How much longer can the sector carry this damage? "
"Why do foreigners finance the good driver, why my thousands of shareholders finance the bad drivers in Turkey?" he said, saying, "When all companies in the sector are funded by 9 billion dollars, only 2.3 billion dollars in traffic is damaged in three years."
He said, "At this point, we're trying to explain our problem to the Treasury."
Following these developments, the Çağlar said, "They haven't reached that point yet," following a question about whether foreigners have reached a weight reduction point in the Turkish insurance sector.
They expect to invest more in Turkey because it's 1.3 in Turkey, as the average six policies per person in the Netherlands fall.
"Therefore, Turkey is really a place to bend," he said.
So they didn't give up.
But even though the company has a reasonable profit every year, it uses it to grow up by leaving all the profits in its system.
According to TSB data, the production of prim in the sector in 2016 was 40.5 billion dollars, while the first half of this year increased by 12 per cent compared to the same period last year, 23.1 billion dollars.
The ages predicted that the sector would not complete by 15 per cent growth in total prim production, he said.
A thousand chronic patients with social aid news
The details and applications of the "New Social Help Programme for Cronic Families" which began a while ago, according to Minister of Family and Social Policy Fatma Betul Sayan Kaya.
From the social aid programme to start for poor citizens and their families, 4,300 tuberculosis and SSPE patients will benefit from the first stage.
Patients will also be provided with monthly support over two thirds of the minimum wage, as well as regular psychososal support.
The ministry will also pay additional payments to the patients of tuberculosis, identified by the health unit that they cannot repair their medical self-care, maintain their lives as dependent on the bed, or the need to improve home life conditions.
Payments will be made via PTT through Social Services Cards.
Those who can't make money for geographic conditions, disease, disability will be paid at the door.
In many ways, the program has a first feature in the world.
One of the 10 companies to invest is still German
German companies in Turkey, Arda Ermut, head of the Prime Minister's Turkish Investment Support and Programme Agency, said political tension between the two countries did not reflect on the business world.
"In relations with Germany, there is no investor who says," We have suffered from this situation. "
"About 10% of the projects in our portfolio are German companies."
Some of them have investments in Turkey.
"The Germans are creating an important part of our daily business flow," he said.
Ermut said it was a good example for Abraj Group to share with the logistics company Netlog.
"We invested $1 billion in Turkey," Abraaj Group partner Omar Syed said.
Özer is on his way to becoming the Last Ottoman
The veteran football player, who the administration has given two weeks to find a club, has agreed with the Ottomans, and will sign an official contract in the coming days.
At the beginning of last season, Ozer Hurcı signed a contract with the green-black club, which was four hours before the end of the transfer until 2019, while wearing a jersey at 29 leagues, 2 trophies, contributed to the team with five goals and 4 assists.
The administration, which blocked its way back to Ozer, replaced this player yesterday with the Brazilian Sergio Antonio.
The transfer of the century has come true!
Barcelona announced that Neymar was transferred to Paris Saint-Germain for the price of 222 million euros.
Recently, the transfer development, which the football public has been excited to follow, has been officially released.
The PSG paid the Catalan team for the Brazilian player to pay 22m euros for the player's release, adding it to the star name cast.
Neymar was the most expensive transfer in football history along with this bonservice statement.
Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) of the France 1st Football League (League 1) announced that he signed a five-year contract with Brazilian star Neymar.
Neymar, 25, who came to be the world's most expensive football player, signed a contract to wear a form at PSG until June 30, 2022, the club's website said.
"Since I started my football life in Europe, the PSG has always been one of the most competitive and ambitious teams," Neymar said after the signing ceremony.
The reason I came to this club and joined my teammates was to get a lot of trophies, as our fan would like. "
The PSG will pay Neymar 45m euros for every season.
Thus, the cost of the star player will cost the representative of France over 400m euros.
Marine workers' strike ended with a raise
İzmir Metropolitan Municipality's company, IZDENİZ A.Ş. and Turkish-Business Union (TDS), were unable to agree on the increase clause in the Turkish Marine Union (TDS).
After that, union member IZDENIZ workers were on strike on July 12th.
The strike that lasted close to a month ended today at 3: 00 p.m. after raising workers.
According to the collective business contract signed, the salary of the black staff within the ICDNAZ will be increased by 12 per cent.
IZDENİZ, whose fleet has been renovated, has been transferred to the International Ship's Record, along with the exemption of revenue tax, and the increase rate accepted for personnel in the status of a ship man with a 25 per cent increase in wages is 5 per cent.
The IZDENİZ General Directorate announced that the flights in the Gulf would continue with a normal description, and the flights to Yasicaada would begin on Tuesday, and the flights to Foca and Urla will begin from next weekend.
TDS President Hassan Pekdemir said they locked the transport with their 23-day strike, saying, "The people of Izmir will relax."
As a result of the strike, improvements have been made to our workers who work on land and sea.
We leave the table happily.
An average of 28 per cent in the sea pocket, and 20 per cent on land.
We also had friends who worked minimum wage.
We've made serious improvements in their salaries.
Nostalji, with "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
Well, for the characters' bright days in the '80s, for the season of the' 90s (when brains like David Wain and Michael Showalter made the MTV comedy "The State"), and for 2001, their stars Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd continued with bigger things, this version of the story is nostalgic for all of them.
As a cultural product, this is both objectifying and objectifying our permanent historical Facebook period.
But as a series, it's like it's running out of time.
"First Day of the Camp" was unexpectedly successful, and it wasn't just because of the absurd humor (in which there was a story about the origins of a box of talking plants, which were performed by H. Jon Benjamin.)
By focusing on the real humor (the playing of middle-aged actors), he made it impossible to recapture the past part of the joke.
It's now more random, including the monologue for the "Ten Years Later" and the '90s stalker movie "Shake the Cradle Hand."
At some point, the character confuses an Apple Powerbook, some single wheel skates, and "lots of other things from 1991."
Most of the real stories are the same.
The soft-hearted Coop (Mr. Showalter) is now a writer who has failed to forget Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) hasn't lost his virginity yet.
And now there's another crazy traitor plan that Ronald Reagan (Mr. Showalter) is involved in, which has been relegated by George H. W. Bush (a very well-placed imitation by Michael Ian Black).
The best part of the series, as usual, is the intermediate words.
It's so nice to see young Mr. Rudd, who's always got Matt Dillon's mouth-to-mouth beard in the Bachelors, who, in particular, looks like Andy, the most popular kid in the old school, is now an old man.
There may be random moments of insanity that give power to this series (such as "Seven Up!" series) that reiterates some kind of "Seven Up!" -- until they reach what I think is a logical result: "Wet Hot American Tails: 20 years later," and in the last scene, the company crew goes to see the premiere of "Wet American Tails."
Meanwhile, "Comrade Detective" in the Amazon refers to a different type of nostalgia: "The Americans' Cold War resurrection," the film "Blonde Bomb" and even the East, "GLOW" with its iconography against Western wrestling.
It looks like the comedy directed by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, which was directed by Rhys Thomas: a Romanian police drama in the 1980s, where the two Bucharest police officers fought for the real, atheism and Marxist-Leninist road.
The leading roles are played by the wolf Gregor and the idealist Iosef, Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, and their dialogue's English dubbed Channing Tatum (as well as the lead producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
That's a brilliant idea.
But that's nothing more than an idea.
There are some nice visual funny things (while Americans watch football, cops spend time watching chess on TV)
The famous voice-singing artist staff, which includes Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny, is a good material for "Who knows who" game.
But "Comrade Detective" is so dedicated to the realization of a clumsy propaganda drama (including a killer wearing a Reagan mask), mostly playing just like him.
Six long episodes can't pass, and comedy isn't fast enough or often enough.
Gregor and Iosef were always visiting the American embassy with two fat men eating a bunch of hungry wolves in his lobby, and if "Comrade Detective" was cut to a shorter length, he could do better with propaganda.
The message to the imaginary communist observer is that Western culture can turn anything into a mass-eaten meal.
The fictional Romanian creators were not wrong: we are doing this to our own close history and even theirs.
The Ancients of FETÖ
The British government has seen that our family is loyal and miserable by 50 years of experience.
The high authorities of the government have acknowledged that this family has been deeply committed to the British government and has been in great service.
It is necessary for the British government to be wise and careful about this elephant with their own hands, to investigate everything and decide carefully.
While trying to understand FETÖ, the beginning point is the organisation of the Hashhashis, but the forgotten principle is that the FETÖ is an organization that appears in the imperialist era and moves with colonists.
They are the 'leading movement' that needs to be dealt with in this minivan.
In the English praise of the entrance, the man who described himself as "the fidan by the hands of the British government" is Mirza Gulak Ahmet Kalaidei, founder of Kalathianism.
"On December 1, 1888, Allah ordered him to take a pledge from his followers and form a separate community," said Mushız Ahmed, a small town in the province of Pencap, India.
He went a little further and said in 1891, "Jesus Christ, according to his revelation and inspiration, that Mary died in death, like other prophets, and that God sent her as a sanctuary and sanctuary, which Christians and Muslims were waiting for."
According to this, the same person the Muslims are waiting for is Mirza Gulak Ahmed Kaidei.
(Islamic Encyclopedia, TDV)
After the 1857 Sipahi uprising, Gulmak Ahmed, who wrote books against the oppressed Muslims in India against Hindus and the Christians, reminds the Gülportre of the opposition to the Communist Association in Erzurum, which later appeared to be the President of the Partnership for Communism and Islam.
Like Gülen, the most popular idea of Gulmak Ahmed is that "jihad" is a struggle with Islam itself, and that if you can live freely, imperialism has no dimension to fight.
In fact, if you remember, Gülen went one step further, and praised the attacks of the Crusades, which were still open in our history, in a sermon last year: "It is not too dangerous for the Crusader to invade your country.
Because there are red lines between you and them.
For once, they don't touch your woman, your daughter.
They don't touch the mabedine, the untouchable Crusades!
The idea that Mehdi and the messiah will be the savior of Islam, aside from the fact that the concept of jihad means fighting only against the FETÖ, the way that it spread was generally in the field of education and civil society.
The total centres of the Kabathians, which are said to have exceeded 2 million ', are 1869, and the number of countries where the emergency aid agency "Humanity First" is officially recorded is 23.
Also, 36 hospitals in 12 countries, 650 dispensaries in 55 countries, eight matbaa of the Kalathians in Africa; 505 educational institutions in 11 countries and about 16,000 mosques on Earth.
Given that "the first Muslim scientist" who received the Nobel Prize, "Prof. Abdinsalah, the president of the United Nations Court of Justice," the Muslim actor "Mahershala Ali," who received the first Oscar award, we can see the depth of global forces' approval for the Kacademans.
Let's note that last week's meeting with 30,000 people in England has been shined as a body show.
One of their slogans is a short look at their history to understand that "Love everyone, don't hate anyone" means "love your invaders / colonists."
Hulasa is possible to use the origin and motivation of structures such as FETÖ or Tahir-ul Kadri to the Kalathians, and all of these organisations are supported as a means to imperialism and to serve colonialism.
He came out of the cargo "his last wish."
Emily Pomeranz (50), who spent his last days in a hospital in Washington due to pancreatic cancer, expressed his longing for coffee and chocolate mixed milkshake (milk drink) from a restaurant in her hometown.
A friend of her contacted the owner of a restaurant called Tommy's.
For 47 years, Tommy Fello, who runs the same restaurant, put his drink on dry ice, and sent it to the hospital, which cost $123 ($435), and sent it to the hospital with a "fast delivery" cargo.
Two new projects from Ahmet Kul
To date, Ahmet Kul Construction, İstanbul Mimaroba, Dia Mare, Bodrum Yalıkavak, released projects of Solse 7, which have carried out important projects such as Lavinia Park, autopsy, Vetro City, Ginza Lavinya Park.
The Dia Mare geometry of the project, developed by the architect of Camoglu Architecture, was developed to receive maximum benefit from the sea.
A total of 188 housing sites and 17 commercial units are located in the Dia Mare, located on an 11,000 square metres area.
The project, which completely ended its rudeness structure, will begin to be handed over to its new owners on March 2018.
Dia Mare has a number of circles that change from 2 + 1 to 5 + 1.
In 2018, the company, which will activate two more new construction sites in Mimaroba and Bitez, is preparing to sign two major projects in Topkapu.
He transferred 753 million to neighbouring companies
Peace Corps said a lot of programs were done outside at the TRT where 6,760 staff work, and they were paid for high prices.
CHP deputy said, "TRT 2016 has also relinquished the tax of the people to AKP companies."
He said, "This is a robbery..."
The source the TRT transferred to neighbouring production companies was generated by data obtained from official documents.
The official response to the application by CHP İstanbul MP Peace Ycik under the Information Edination Act reveals how TRT's resources were spent.
The TRT, which 6,760 people work for, said it was transferred to neighbouring companies in 2016 through programmes under the name of foreign production, although there are all technical possibilities.
The CHP deputy used the statement, "That means a hit."
"The production companies of AKP journalists and businessmen are raiding TRT."
He said, "Millions are paid to make products that are untraceable or unaccounted for."
"The 7,000 staff institutions have returned to the AKP's harp," he reminded companies that money was collected from public taxes.
"What programs did these companies sign that 7,000 people couldn't do, so they took this money?"
He explained that TRT's commercial income in 2016 was 224.456.182, and that the advertising revenue remained an ear in the camel, when it took into account personnel salaries and other expenses.
"The TRT, which became the AKP's voice, can't get a commercial because it's not being watched."
Feeding journalists are getting paid by TRT, screaming for the AKP.
He said, "People are pulling their loads."
"TRT pays personnel 660m dollars a year; but gives all jobs to foreign producers."
From TRT, the public's pocket, 753.5 trillion followers have been pulled in pursuit.
That's a real mess.
He gave up suicide, kneeling in front of his wife, apologizing.
The incident occurred today at noon in a parking lot located in the neighborhood of Eyüpoglu, the mill street.
According to information, local residents who saw the citizen hanging from the 4th floor of the parking lot reported the situation to fire and medical teams.
Firefighters who arrived at the scene opened a tarp in the area where the person was found, while the paramedics were standing by.
The 34-year-old father Yunus G., a 34-year-old who refused to commit suicide after his efforts to convince the scene of the crime, apologized to his wife, N.G, who watched him in tears.
On the other hand, on the street where Yunus G was committed to suicide, about 100 people were watching the situation on the sidewalk, while some citizens recorded it with cell phones.

Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
Soon, interest rates will not change, after Bank of England has reduced speculation that slow economic growth and moving inflation will be an increase.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth will continue "slow" due to the narrowing of family revenues and keeping their interest rates stable.
The decision makers at the Bank's Paral Policy Committee (MPC) voted 6 to 2 votes to keep interest at 0.25%; thus, after slow economic growth weakens support for increased growth, less members this month wanted to increase.
The bank has drawn growth estimates to 1.7% in 2017, 1.6% in 2018, warning that inflation will continue to narrow down the income of the households due to still rising near 3% in the spring.
However, in the next few years, he pointed out that interest increases are necessary to regulate the inflation that Brexit has fueled, and said that debt costs may have to increase more than expected in financial markets.
The members also voted to withdraw part of the massive economic healing package that was launched a year ago after Brexit.
The bank will end the annual Function Plan, which offers cheap financing to banks from next February, but it expects a total of $15 billion (115 billion).
"The central estimate of the MPC is slow in the short term, with the domestic remission (GDP), with the decline of domestic real income continuing to be a burden to consumption," the bank said minutes after the decision of interest was issued.
In the interest of interest, he stressed that "a little reduction in money policy would be necessary for the reduction of inflation and that the market would be" slightly higher than expected. "
The markets still estimate that the first increase will be in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
But the bank emphasises that any increase would be "step by step" and "limited."
According to estimates in May, the bank's estimates of reduced growth this year and next year are compared to 1.9% and 1.7%.
The bank protects its estimate of 1.8% in 2018.
Sterlin lost value to the dollar and the euro after the news.
Pound dropped 0.5% and dropped 1.31 US dollars and 0.4% and became 1.11 euros.
According to 0.3% of GDP in the second quarter, the decision came after the recent growth numbers that were disappointed in the previous three months reduced expectations of increasing growth.
Growth will probably be 0.3% in the third quarter, but according to the bank, it will be slightly increased by the end of the year.
When the bank says the narration will get worse before it's fixed, the latest inflation report leaves little joy for the household population, which has been shot by increasing inflation and pensions.
The bank said the monetary policy cannot prevent "the shooting of revenues" in the next few years, but expects the salaries to improve significantly towards the end of their three-year estimates.
The increase in demand for British property as a result of weak pounds will stabilise some of its declining consumer spending and support the economy.
The decision comes a year after the shock leading the pound upside down was dropped to 0.25% of interest last August after the EU referendum vote.
The bank estimates it will probably take four years to fully influence prices and economies.
Prior to the latest interest decision of the bank, there was a demand for increased inflation pressure on the people of the difficult households and a rise of interest by 0.5% of the three policy makers in July.
The inflation rose from July to 2.9% to 2.6% last month, but the bank said it was expected and will increase once again in the next months.
According to their 2% target, the bank said the vaccine was all about "weak pound."
"Given the recent decline in trade rates, the loan holders will be more competitive once again, with the demand to do business and close the year positively.
Sunday is particularly good for those who approach the end of their existing contracts, with many free options and low interest, becoming more popular than ever, "he said in remortgages.
NHS will prescribe controversial HIV drugs for 10,000 people
In the Supreme Court, after a struggle to finance the drug in NHS, patients will be able to access the 'HIV prevention treatment' from September.
The NHS announced that the pre-exposure profile (PrEP), which was shown to reduce the risk of infection in high-risk individuals by 86 per cent, will be provided by approximately 10,000 people through a three-year preliminary trial.
The Supreme Court agreed to finance the experiment following the approval of the Court of Appeals last year. The decision was said to have the power to pay for the PrEP, despite allegations that the NHS would finance local authorities.
This move was announced on Thursday by Simon Stevens, head of the NHS Britain, while National Aids Trust (NAT) described it as a turning point.
The sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first to record the people, and more clinics will be fully implemented throughout England by 2018 April.
Pre-exposure profilasis (PEP) is a series of HIV drugs that reduce the risk of getting HIV before sex.
Experiments showed that the PEP significantly decreased HIV transfer among those at risk of infection.
Getting a PEP before sex means enough drugs to prevent HIV infection in one person's body.
These kinds of drugs can be taken every day or two hours before they have sex.
The ones that are suitable for treatment are gay or bisexual men, transsexual people and HIV-positive partners, and they can't be treated successfully.
The clinics will determine the appropriate participants from men, women, transsexual individuals, and the HIV situation, which has been controlled by an anti-retroviral treatment.
People who live in England and are registered to a pratician physician will also be able to register for potential participation in the participating local sexual health clinics.
The program will hold £10 million and NHS signed an agreement this week to provide the drugs with an international bid.
The trial was designed to assess the full potential of the PEP by collecting clinical evidence on how the PEP was targeted, carried out and applied on a large scale.
"This new and serious intervention will contribute to broad and increasing successful efforts in the prevention of HIV.
This is another milestone in my 30-year-old development to overcome one of humanity's major health problems. '
Deborah Gold, head of the NAT (National Aid Trust), said: "This is a turning point in fighting HIV.
If it is aimed correctly at those who need it and those who are at risk, the PrEP offers the possibility that it will transform the HIV epidemic in England.
From September to September, people who are at high HIV risk will reach a new and powerful vehicle that is actually controlled by the NHS in England, which is not open to negotiations with a wife; that will lead to a lot of life's recovery.
We welcome this announcement in a warm manner. '
"The priority should be to ensure that the experiment is presented quickly throughout the country and that no one at risk of HIV should be left behind.
We are on our way to protect more than 10,000 people who are now at risk of HIV, as the PEP experimental drug is now provided. '
Shadow public health minister Sharon Hodgson said: "We welcome the beginning of the 'ProEP experiment," and it is late for months of delays and then with the government standing up.
Evidence shows how transformative this drug can be to end the infection that changes life as part of our view of the prevention of HIV.
The experiment will bring us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of the PrEP.
It is now important that this experiment be presented as quickly as possible to protect those exposed to HIV and end the spread of HIV in society as possible to bring us closer to one step closer.

Two secrets of death
Former Industry and Trade Minister Ayhan Cilingioğlu's daughter, Umit Makbule Çilingiroğlu (51), was killed from the 19th floor of a business centre used as a hotel at the Istanbul Levent.
Coach University student Melis Salihoglu, 24, was also found dead in his home.
It was said that Salihoglu hanged himself.
Two secrets considered suicide by police have been launched.
_
Turkey's first Industry and Trade Minister Ayhan Çilingiroğlu, who served in the Nihat Erim government in 1971, entered the Hotel Le Meridien in Etuk on August 1, when his daughter, Umit Makbule Çilingiroğlu, was born in Washington in 1966.
An ambulance and police team were called to the scene after a Kuwaitan tourist who settled in on the 19th floor and saw the lifeless body of Çilingiroğlu who was not heard from for a while.
The medical team has determined that the Chilingeglu, who fell on the ground from the 19th floor, has lost his life.
"She's been depressed lately."
On 31 July, he arrived from Ankara to Istanbul.
I have a grandson with leukemia from my other daughter.
He said, "This was interested in my granddaughter and she was negatively affected by my granddaughter's illness."
Cilingioğlu, whose funeral was lifted to the Forensic Institute, is expected to be buried in Ankara.
They're investigating whether the locksmith was fired by someone or committed suicide.
_
Another suspicious death in Istanbul occurred in Sarıyer Zeceriyaköy.
Melis Salihoglu (24), who studied at Coach University, was found dead in his home.
The father of the young girl, allegedly, went to her home near school, where she couldn't hear from her cell phone, and she couldn't reach her cell phone.
Dad, at home, he met his daughter's lifeless body.
It was said that he hanged himself in the house of Melis, whose family, his close environment and friends loved him very much.
The death of Melis Salihoglu has engulfed his family and relatives.
After Melis, a friend on social media said, "A bright sun was shining on our faces."
Under our feet, we were enjoying the green grass, your best friend Jack, and your sister, Eysan, chasing that little plastic ball.
He shared the message, "To die now."
Living life in luxury: hanging floor and smart design numbers have transformed this little Earls Courts apartment into a spacious house.
Former banker Joanne Leigh, who had a passion for real estate renovation, went from a large house in Knightsbridge in 2014 to shrink into an apartment in Earls Court.
It's the first floor of a dazzling Queen Anne comb and proof of a new design that Joanne was convinced to pack without packing.
"Before this, I lived in a much bigger area in Knightsbridge with my ex," Joanne says.
"I was looking for something similar to my price.
The apartment at Earl Court was shown to me and they had the same high ceiling.
I fell in love with him and made an offer that day. "
After the first sight, the 1,000-foot circle was remodeled from top to bottom.
In the beginning, it was a one-room and complex property; you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom, and Joanne wanted to add a hiding space and a vine floor to maximize the generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows and lots of light.
That was my condition. "
For this purpose, Notting Hill based architecture and design studio hired Erfan Azadi from Duck & Shed to benefit from the 12.5 ft ceiling and create a place where Joanne would live, not just a structure.
The ceiling wasn't high enough to add two areas in a row, so the architectural challenge was to create a vine floor that you could stand in.
Erfan had to think in a creative way to solve the matter.
"Steel skeleton is pretty complicated."
"We had to adjust the gaps so that they could collapse without needing to lean down on each other.
It wasn't just to build a simple platform, but also the steel would bend so high that they would be at the right height according to the function above or below. "
This arrangement brought many additional dramas to Erfan to get two full rooms above each other.
The old copper light window from Retriuvius for the vine floor is looking at the magnificent habitat below.
All the gold furniture in the mirror, the silver highlights and the old Serge Mouille lighting all determine the style of design.
Using mirrors plays a role in the addition of space, space and light.
The mirrors placed at both ends of the short corridor make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the mirror ranger panel gives me the feeling of a window opening into another room.
Miraculous units in the exercise provide for Joanne's entire silverware and storage space.
The beauty of the living room, which creates a more spectacular sense of space, is to close the kitchen when it's not in use.
The open-and-shut cuisine is not new.
And what's original about that is that there's a garage door that can be lifted up in style.
Erfan explains the door to the MDF with steel-reinforced wax, "We used some engineering on it."
"Balance weight, so when you push the door up, it really skips."
With the smart use of the field and the containment field, Joanne added 16 meters, an extra bedroom and a improved session plan.
"At the end of the day, there is something you will sell, or that your property is valued," Erfan says.
"As a clue, a real estate agent will go in and do an account on the basis of the session area."
They've managed to use quality material that gives the area a luxury view as they increase the ground field here.
"The materials are objects that you touch, so that it can help you build an emotional connection at home," Erfan said.
"At home, you don't fall in love with the power lines on the wall.
These are important, but they do not shake the strings of your hearts. "
This is proof that through good design and increased square feet, an apartment can turn into something quite spectacular from a standard thing.
In fact, like Joanne, you can choose not to leave.
In Beşiktaş with the Jeremiah Lens Bonservice
At the end of a month and a half, he was transferred to Beşiktaş with the Lens bonservice, which was originally considered a rental.
After a week of concentrated talks, Lens signed with the black-and-white team in exchange for the price of 5 million euros of service.
Five-year deal-making Dutch player will receive 2.2m euros a year.
Beşiktaş is expected to make an official statement on the transfer of Jeremain Lens.
Wedding photos of famous couples
About four years in an indentured relationship, the model Çala Chikel and actor Emre Altuğ entered the world house in Sortie.
The couple immortalized the wedding with the photo they call "the most special moment of our lives."
The couple decided to leave after seven years.
The brothers are fighting over $500 million in property empire.
Two brothers are at war for one of Victoria's largest real estate empires, worth more than $500 million, 40 years after the house of Italian families.
Former Carlton Football Club director and contractor Colin De Lutis live three doors away from his younger brother Paul, who gave himself to the Supreme Court about how to share property and business assets in a mansion in Toorak.
Paul has wanted to get out of the family business since 2014, but the Supreme Court for dismemberment continued to argue hard.
With their mother Anna, the brothers are owners of 38 properties that have been worth more than half a billion dollars since a store they bought in Collingwood in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans and raised him to a chain with 160 retail sales centers.
Sold for $85 million in 1999.
This money was deposited in the property, and De Lutis' portfolio currently includes city offices, Brunswick and Sorrento contractors, Gold Coast and Mt Buller apartments in the suburbs.
As part of a deal with their deceased father, Colin (described by Paul as "an important propulsion and a dominant personality" in the De Lutis family) has two thirds of the company assets, and Paul has one third.
A court file says that Colin has $316 million and Paul has $176 million worth of property.
Sharing property and cash for Paul turns out to be a controversial issue.
In 2015, he wrote in his first sworn statement, "The partitions proposed by Colin were leaving him with the property I always called the best."
After many failures last Friday, the first Supreme Court hearing was held.
The brothers are also fighting over who will control the current job; Paul claims Colin left him out of it.
Colin claims it's not true, but he's accusing Paul of running some property incompetence.
Colin says in an affidavit at first, he hopes to resolve the conflict.
"My Italian roots dictate to me that the family is the most important priority."
Hundreds of pages of affidavits, e-mails and Allan Myers, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, are increasing in the case with senior legal advisors held by both sides.
Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were an Italian immigrant family who ran grocery stores and deli stores from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They pawned Colin's property to buy Collingwood property, where the family opened the first jeans store.
Colin says that when I was a little boy in high school, Paul founded Westco there.
Anna De Lutis says Luigi, who died in 2012, hopes to leave his property friendly to his sons.
"Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to fall into court."
The other two brothers Mark and Luke are no longer part of De Lutis companies; Colin says that when he quit, he paid Mark $10 million and Luke $26 million.
According to Paul, both Luke and Mark were "dissatisfied with the terms of their financial separation."
According to Eddi McGuire, the best friend of the television star, in 2015, Colin tried not to draw attention to an old AFL club board member.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and his lawyers on Friday.
Just because Colin was in court with a brief message, he said, "I can't say much."
"It must have been very, very sad that my brother Paul chose to sue me and dragged our family's name into court," he wrote.
In the middle of 2016, Colin wrote in a court application that he was trying to meet his brother's demands.
"Our father would not want Paul and I to fall into the current dispute," he added, adding that he is still hopeful about the solution.
This hope seems to be lost on Friday.
"Our problem will be solved by the courts in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump's new special pen plans to limit the president's media diet.
Others tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly could really do that.
If that happens, it'll be the first time.
Politico says his new White House special pen will limit President Trump to the flow of information (including news media reports), hoping to keep the boss stable.
Little information from reporter Josh Dawsey:
"The new White House special pen John F. Kelly met with senior staff on his first day at work, summarizing a fundamental problem that President Donald Trump planned to solve on the White House: bad information in the hands of the president.
Kelly told the staff that information should flow on paper or briefings itself, because the president would be able to make better decisions when good information was given.
Kelly's diagnosis makes sense, but others tried to tame Trump by controlling the media diet and failed.
President Trump's relationship with TV goes back decades, and now he's in the White House, and he's still in good shape to watch TV.
"If candidate Trump is upset about not being fair in the media, showing him that he was a fair place in convincing media institutions was increasing efficiency," former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg told Politico in February.
"According to six campaign officials, the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control was to ensure that personal media consumption contains a stable praise flow," said Tara Palmeri of Politico at the time.
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit is under control at any time is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign officials know something that the rest of us don't know, like Trump's tweets would be much more provocative without their own interference.
We'll probably never know anything about the tweets Trump didn't send.
If his people managed to get him out of danger a few times, then his efforts were valuable.
But no one could stop Trump from constantly causing controversy.
Some of the problem was that the White House was made up of factions competing with each other, which are people who were trying to move their own agenda with the materials they presented to Trump (they could be trusted or unreliable), and that made their own world views clear.
In May, Politico reported that the advisors had a strategic tendency to deliver questionable information to the president throughout this whole story.
One of the examples that reporter Shane Goldmacher described in detail was this:
"Current and former Trump officials say that Trump has reacted intensely to negative clippings from the press, especially the leaks with bad influence, and has become obsessed with finding out where they are being caused.
At the end of February, it happened when someone gave the president a printed copy of an article that accused the internet producer Charles C. Johnson of GotNews.com of being the source behind a series of leaks in the White House.
It didn't matter that Johnson was banned from Twitter permanently because of harassment, or that he didn't offer any concrete evidence, or that he had filed false charges in the past, and that he had returned from them.
Trump read the article and started asking the staff about Walsh. "
Goldmacher added that he was attempting to install a system that was "managing and documenting documents that were taken by the White House secretary of the special pen, Reince Priebus and the White House."
How did that work out?
Kelly's trying to do the same thing in three months.
Maybe he'll come out as a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still in his own way, and his associates are still competing for influence.
These constant factors will make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Krypto released FETÖ artists with a special template
İzmir Cumhuriyet Prosecutor Berkant Karakaya completed the investigation launched by the secret witness, "Sarmaşık," as part of the investigation into leaking some information from the "military espionage investigation," as well as saying that the Chief of Staff of the Navy Commander of Staff, Tumahat Yıldık, was a FETÖ member. "
The review stressed that TümaAdmiral Ayçi was not a member of the organisation, but was active in the fight against FETÖ.
According to the so-called martial law order in the coup attempt on July 15th, the decision pointed out that the Navy Command was attempting to be pacified, underlined as of the first day of the coup attempt, underlined an effective struggle against FETÖ.
"It has been understood that the publisher has been working on the detection of members of the crypto private services class, with a special template for the detection of members of the FETÖ and a special system created by the 64 basic criteria of 209 sub-criteria," the decision by Karakaya said.
In forensic investigations, a specific and stubborn effort has been observed, except for the fact that the secret witness has shown no evidence of it, as opposed to an active terrorist organization, which has a major contribution to it, has been decided that there is no way to evaluate it with our chief prosecutor.
The Commander-in-Chief has been charged with defamation before.
And it turns out that there are other FETÖ men behind it, and the alleged crime is a conspiracy.
Former Air Pilot Staff Colonel Hakan Dinc, complaining that the publisher insulted him, has turned the complaint only in the form of information into a document, the former Adana Incirlik 10.
Tanker Base Commander Air Brigadier General Bekir Ercan Van, former Chief of Staff Chief of Staff Colonel Muharrem Köse, former Chief of Staff Chief of Staff General Mustafa Özsoy, former Judge General Erkan Ağun, former Lieutenant Necmesoy, who issued the warrant for prosecution, has been appointed as a witness against the Chief of Staff, and as a witness against the President of the United States.
Some of the members of the organization, including Tuncay Opçin, the FETÖ fugitive, turned out to be targeting Ayçi with their shares in social media before and after the coup attempt on July 15th.
Travelers crossed the ditch, went back to the rich neighborhood.
Some of the richest hosts in the West Midlands are fighting again with the ambitious travelers who have been dug up by the council to retrieve the area outside their own mansion.
Travelers parked their 20 caravans outside a area called the "rich neighborhood," where Solihull was on the street at its time.
They returned after they were fired in May, bringing horses, babies and loads of cargo carts from the ditch that the council dug to cut their current.
The smart-moving group found a hole in the defense, and smuggled their vehicles in on a roadblock-free passage.
Angry residents said it was "useless to solve the problem," criticizing the Solihull Council.
An anonymous resident said, "They came there Monday night after they were sent to Bentley Heath, where they threw rocks at the passers.
The council should be ashamed of their actions because they're useless to solve the problem.
The travelers were there in May, they were sent and now they're back.
More came last night, possibly more will come today. "
He added: 'The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with long suspension decisions to protect its parks.
I live in Streetsbrook Street, and I'm not happy to keep paying my taxes when the council can't even stop it. '
A local resident who didn't want to give up his name said, "Like a joke, we just saw the last group of travelers split up, and we were immediately devastated by a new group.
Their numbers increased this time, and a horse even grazed in the parking lot. '
A woman from the Solihull Council said: "We are aware that there is an unauthorized camp on Streetsbrook Street, and we are starting the legal procedures necessary to send them out as soon as possible."
To support our collection of evidence, it is important that most residents call 101 and report any anti-social or criminal behavior to the police.
When we present our case to the court, it will help bring out a picture of the situation so that the court will consider it. '
Galatasaray reported Ndiaye to the stock market
The yellow-red club will pay 75,000 euros for the price of the football player's bonservice to Osmanillispore, if it plays a total of 25 games in the Cup, and 50 more euros in Europe, according to Galatasaray Sports Test and Trade Investments sent to the Stock Exchange in Istanbul.

In addition, Ndiye will be awarded 5,000 euros for each score of the yellow-red team during the TFF Super League and UEFA competitions.
The statement also announced that the player had a single-sided right to revoke the contract in exchange for 18m euros, starting on June 15, 2019.
The last day rush!
They rushed to the fire station.
Thousands of vehicles were damaged in Istanbul along with the storm and hail last Thursday.
Many of the drivers who received reports from the firehouse to meet the damages by insurance companies, while drivers who have not been reported so far have lined up for the report.
The drivers, who had a helmet today and didn't report it, came to the fire stations today because it was the last day of this declaration.
Today is the last day
The drivers first took pictures of their vehicles to the fire department to determine the damage to their vehicles.
The drivers who were damaged by their vehicles later reported to the staff.
Hassan Erol, who came to the fire station for the report, said, "I'm going to take a picture of him."
When I got here, there was intensity.
He said, "There was damage to the windshield."
Driver Erbil Kılıç, "We've come running."
We're in line.
We took the picture.
"Now we wait for the report," he said.
The skyscrapers with the sea and the land walls don't give a shit
"The expert report on the case clearly says that these structures will not withstand an earthquake at six degrees," CHP MP Nadir Ataman said.
The stakes on which the solid rock is 25 to 30 meters below were not dug so deep, it says.
Istanbul Ataköy left the county breathless at high-level hotels and residence that built a wall between the sea and the land.
CHP Mayor Nadir Ataman, a member of the municipality of Bakırköy, reacted to huge mall, hotel and resonance projects in the district.
"About 80 years ago, those who planned according to the wind created the Atatürk Forest for Florence.
80 years later, whatever urban sense was achieved, they planted giant skyscrapers in the wind corridors and changed the climate.
He said, "There's no breathing in the county."
"The temperature is feeling 10 degrees higher because of the skyscrapers," Ataman said, expressing that building rising like a wall on the coast of Ataköy has changed the balance of climate.
These buildings need to be built according to the direction of the winds.
But our skyscrapers are rising above Istanbul's wind corridors.
The wind can't get into the county.
These structures are disrupting the balance of natural life.
Ataman said these skyscrapers, who hurt the environment and human health, also cut off the link of the people of Bakırköy to the sea, will apply to the Committee of Monuments on the issue and go to the judiciary.
He can be treated without surgery in a turn of hair.
In cases of phenol applications, the success is up to 83 per cent.
In this way, the infected tissue is effectively cleaned and the tissue cavity is filled with an agent who kills hair roots.
Without surgery, one of the treatment techniques is the laser method.
With various lasers, hair roots and surrounding tissue are burned by circular radiating rays, and during this burn, the tissue is constricted to close.
Due to these two non-surgical procedures of regeneration disease, patients can soon return to social and business lives.
Dr. Mert Atak said that excessive weight, inactive life, long-term sitting, heavy hair and body hair, and lack of hygiene, caused a hair turn, and that there were problems such as pain, apse and swelling among the symptoms of the disease.
Italy hardens its approach to the NGOs' migration rescue boats
Italy warned NGOs operating an immigrant rescue boat in the Mediterranean that if they do not follow new rules affecting their operations, they will not be allowed to continue.
"If the NGOs do not comply with the new charter, it will be difficult to see that they continue to operate," Interior Minister Marco Minniti told Torino daily La Stampa.
Minniti's warning came a day after Italian authorities were seized by German aid agency Jugend Retet, suspected of actively co-operating with human traffickers, making illegal migration easier.
The aid agency, which has only been active for a year, refused to comment on the content of detailed imports directed against them by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"The saving of human life for us is our most important priority, and it will be, so we're very sorry that we can't work in the search and rescue zone right now," the agency said in a statement on social media.
"We can only evaluate the charges that are being made now, after we've collected all the information and made the assessment of the situation."
Italian authorities have been monitoring Jugend Retet's boat, Iuventa, since October.
The crew is suspected to have taken the rubber boats full of immigrants delivered directly to them by human traffickers and allowed smugglers to flee on boats to be used again.
According to the files of the prosecutor published by the Italian media, at least one such meeting took place at least 1.3 miles off the coast of Libya.
The crew is under suspicion of disregard for the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, which has been monitoring rescue operations in the region for more humanitarian efforts than any other purpose.
According to the charter, boats like Iuventa were supposed to be an Italian police officer on the deck, clearly monitoring their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to comply with the charter so far: Save The Children, Malta based MOAS and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The last one said on Tuesday that new rules are unnecessary but acceptable because they will not cause any serious changes or obstacles in their own rescue operations.
Among those who refuse to sign, the Nobel Prize-winning organisation includes Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Meanwhile, Minniti said that the sharp decline in the number of immigrants who came to Italy after the rescue in the past few weeks was indicative of efforts to strengthen Libyan coast security and co-operation with local governors.
"We've been seeing the light at the end of the tunnel lately."
This month, he announced plans to make more talks with Libyan governors about economic development initiatives and to take measures to reduce the number of immigrants who left Chad, Niger and Mali in hopes of reaching Europe.
Last-minute punch!
In Moscow, Russia's capital, in its celebration of "Paratrooper Day," the watermelon-eaten vodka was smoked as every year.
Russian NTV TV television correspondent Nikita Razvozjayev, who participated in the event and was living in a Russian Gorki Park that overdosed alcohol.
The reporter who posted the developments of the day on the air warned the man who appeared suddenly and said, "We will hold down Ukraine," warning him, "Please shut up."
The drunk man, who was identified as an ex-paratrooper, punched him hard on the reporter's warning.
The reporter, who was stunned by the punch stroke, tried to get away from him.
Millions of people watched the shock moment live on the air.
The Economic Coordination Board has gathered
The Economic Co-ordination Board (EKK) has gathered under the presidency of Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek, responsible for the economy.
Following the change in cabinet in the government, the first EKK meeting in the head of Lightning opened at Çankaya Mansion at 6: 30.
The meeting will address Turkey's macroeconomic outlook.
The meeting was attended by Finance Minister Naci Ağbal, Science, Industry and Technology Minister Faruk Özlı, Labour and Social Security Minister Julide Sarıeroğlu, Customs and Trade Minister Bülent Tuffci, Minister of Development Lütti Elvan, Treasury Secretary Osman Çelik, Central Bank President Murat Çetinkaya and the bureaucrats involved.
It's possible to get rid of the lumbar hernia in 45 minutes.
"According to the patient's examination and imaging results, the first step is rest and drug treatment," he noted.
"If all these methods are not achieved, if there is no success, then surgery becomes mandatory."
The Karaumensons also say that the "full lumbar hernia surgery that minimizes the risk today" has allowed inconclusive patients to reduce their concerns about the surgery, adding that it is possible to get rid of the hernia disease in 45 minutes:
Although the results are fairly good compared to microscopic surgery and open surgery, there may be some complications such as long recovery after the operation, condensation to the spinal cord, recurring hernia, and future infection.
Most of the time, microscopic surgery is defined as "closed surgery," but microscopic surgery is applied with the same approach as open surgery.
In the exact case of a closed hernia surgery, the environmental tissue is protected, so these risks are eliminated.
Full lumbar hernia surgery only takes 45 minutes.
Private commission at work
The commission will include CHP MPs Mehmet Gökdağ, Cemal Okan Yüksel, Peace Ygur and High Discipline Council member Turan Aydoğan.
The commission is İstanbul 14 on 4 October of Berberoğlu.
He will also follow his trial at the Heavy Criminal Court and applications for the Constitutional Court and the District Court of Detention.
CHP Secretary-General Kamil Okyay Dendir and Vice President Bülent Tezcan signed "Justice is indispensable," CHP Secretary-General Kamil Okyay Deniz said in a statement, "The fact that the judiciary is independent and impartial, and that it is not ordered from anywhere outside the law."
"Our MP, Mr. Enis Berberoğlu, has not requested any special status, he has not taken refuge in the immunity armor known to parliament, he has sought to protect his faith in the independence and neutrality of the judiciary."
The trial process has been suggested that the court prefers to implement political orders rather than judge.
Despite the Constitutional Court's decisions that found the arrests wrong, the decision to arrest without a conviction was clear evidence that the court was under influence.
Michelle Carter was sentenced to death by messages encouraging Conrad Roy to commit suicide.
A Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through messages and phone calls.
Currently 20-year-old Michelle Carter will be serving 15 months of her sentence behind bars and five years on probation.
Carter was convicted of the murder of Conrad Roy, who killed himself on July 13, 2014.
Mr. Roy's father said at Thursday's trial: "My family's heart is broken.
My son was my best friend. "
Carter has been allowed to be released to be open for insubordination.
Although he faced a maximum 20-year sentence, his legal team argued that he was suffering from both his and Mr. Roy's mental illness.
Carter, wearing red pants and a cream-colored blouse, was struck by the punishment, with old eyes, clamped hands and eyes facing the ground.
"His actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
He ended his life to heal his own.
"He refused to accept responsibility."
"He never showed remorse."
But Carter's lawyer said, "It was a terrible situation that he regretted completely."
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said he did not see "age, maturity, even mental illness have any significant impact on his actions."
A prosecutor read a statement by Mr. Roy's mother Lynn Roy: "One day, I will not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I've overcome everything, and I am trying to stand by his sisters with all the pain we will carry forever. "
Mr. Roy's sister, Camlyn Roy, testified that his brother would never attend his wedding or that he would never be able to be with his children.
"The fact that the person you've been with every day since I was born is no longer a pain that will always be with me for the rest of my life," he said.
It seems that a Massachusetts law that makes it a crime to tell a person to commit suicide will create a civil suit.
When Mr. Roy was found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014, Carter was 17 years old.
The case drew national attention when it discovered that Carter's short messages encouraged him to end his own life.
While he was on vacation with his family, she sent many messages two weeks before his death, saying, "Hang yourself, jump off a building, stab yourself, I don't know, there's a lot of ways."
In the moments before his suicide, he wrote, "You have to do this, Conrad," and "All you have to do is open the generator and you'll be free and happy."
Judge Moniz instructed that he would not be allowed to take advantage of this case through the press, saying Carter wanted attention through Mr. Roy's death.
The case has interrupted legal views.
Among the minority defending Carter was Amanda Knox, convicted of killing her British roommate in Italy two years ago before he was cleared.
"Michelle Carter deserves understanding and help, not jail."
Estimated dramatic growth from Mehmet Simsek
He said inflation in Turkey should descend to low single-digit figures and that food inflation creates a "risk zone."
The Deputy Prime Minister predicts inflation will descend under 7 per cent in 2018.
In the lightning speech, he said:
The next 12 months are critical in reducing uncertainty.
The greatest incentive is to reduce uncertainty.
There's a strong government.
No political ambiguity.
Hopefully, the uncertainty in our nearby geography will also decrease.
By increasing our resistance to shocks with some reform, I believe we will put Turkey on a growth train over 5 per cent.
I told you months ago.
It's because the worst is behind us.
Slowly, we don't want our energy to be in those areas anymore, but we want our energy to grow to be conservative, and we need reforms to increase employment.
So the next 12 months are critical.
On one hand, reform, on the other hand, when uncertainty decreases, there is no political uncertainty.
Hopefully, we'll get lucky, and the problems in our close geography will be reduced.
Many of our classic markets are down whether we like it or not.
Like Libya, Iraq.
We're not just losing Sunday, we're dealing with over 3.5 million migration waves.
When we look at the last 15 years, Turkey has grown 5.7 per cent despite all these shocks.
Turkey, which means we have strong problems with our foundations.
Now, by increasing our resistance to shocks with some reform, we will further reduce the question marks on investors' heads and replace Turkey into over 5 per cent growth policy.
Let me be clear, we have such a generous retirement system here.
I think it would be reasonable if I told you our retirement companies didn't make enough effort.
For once, performance will be strong in auto participation.
Why?
Because we took precautions.
Corporations don't have to go out and make a living.
We studied how to allocate global assets to what investment areas by observing these concerns, considering the lack of performance.
You know, the stakes are high.
For once, there will be a performance in addition to 25 per cent of the state's given.
And the rest of it is mostly on treasure paper, where the risk is low.
When we look at the big picture, I think the interest will increase in the coming period.
Because they'll see the performance.
There's no failure in the other field, there's success.
We restructured the BES in 2013.
There are 6.8 million participants, a savings of 70 billion pounds.
Give him credit, the system has succeeded.
There are 2.6 million participants in automatic participation, 775 million dollars in savings.
We want more work from the companies.
Let them do some advertising, tell me about this system.
We're working on a cooling period.
Maybe if we stretch him a little bit...
We'll see, we're working.
Maybe citizens see the revenue, see the savings and stay in the system.
It's 38% from the system.
Almost half of the break-ups are volunteers with individual pensions.
You don't want two individual retirement accounts.
What are you doing?
You're breaking up with the auto.
We were actually waiting for a break around 10%.
Which means we were very optimistic.
Once the system works.
We brought a roof to the prime.
Insurance companies sometimes explain one-sided.
They've increased their rates very quickly.
When we asked what was going on, they said the judicial decisions didn't pay attention to the current regulations.
We've made a new clear arrangement.
And we said, "Do what you need to do."
They said no, we wait for judgment.
So we said, "That's not how it works."
We have a disagreement here.
Of course, when this ceiling went to prim practice, some companies invented it.
We've made a new arrangement.
We built a pool of risk insurance.
Let me tell you something, I'll repeat it.
I prefer this system to work through competition.
So I don't think this ceiling price app is right, they forced us to.
I'd like to see this in three dimensions.
Consider the system we built.
Two, the system works normally, a price on that path.
In addition, the charges are heavy, and the tax cuts of almost 30-31 of every 100-pound bonus paid to him are going to the SGC.
I'm working now, so we'll talk to our finance minister.
Third of all, technology is evolving rapidly.
Now, over time, traffic accidents will be severely reduced.
But it's mandatory traffic insurance.
SABAH's headline saved his leg
From the age of adolescence, the Buerger disease was once seen in men, but today women are often seen in women.
One of these women is a 36-year-old Mehtap Dursun.
The pain that started two years ago was chronicised on the foot floor.
When the young woman who was forced to walk faced with the risk of losing her leg, the hospital went to the hospital.
A friend of his proposed Prof. Dr. Yusuf Kalko.
"Azerbaijan, the headline in SABAH, has saved the life of the Minister of Emergency."
So it turns out that Dursun, who went to Kalko, was struggling with the Buerger disease.
Prof. Dr. Kalko has the young woman in emergency surgery.
Shortly after, Dursun is recovering from his pain, and now he's being treated for oxygen.
While auto manufacturers face Reverse Response Audi 850,000 diesel vehicles will Modify
One day before Audi's announcement, BMW said it would offer software upgrade in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The head of the BMW board said he believed that the BMW had "more intelligent options than driving restrictions," including Munich, which is considered to be the centre of the BMW (forbidden or limited to diesel vehicles).
Daimler said on Tuesday that three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe would modify it to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies described these moves as recall.
European car manufacturers strongly encouraged diesel tools to help meet carbon dioxide emissions in Europe and the United States.
But nitrogen oxide, which diesel engines reveal, is called cancer maker and can cause asthma.
The cost of equipment that automobiles have to wear to neutralize the dirty smoke produced by diesel vehicles makes it harder to keep the price of automobiles competitive.
The government of Chancellor Angela Merkel was accused of indulging powerful car companies and ignoring the orders of the problem, while German car manufacturers were facing investigations.
The companies are trying to avoid repeating Volkswagen's mistakes in normal driving conditions, which hide the device known as a misleading device and adjust emissions to regulate while a car is tested.
Many Volkswagen managers have been charged in the United States and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
In Audi's motor development last month, the former president of thermodynamics was arrested in Germany.
Former Director Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is an Italian and therefore not protected against extradition and may be tried in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi was dragged into a German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen; after authorities accused Audi of putting a system in order to avoid emissions in Europe, they expanded the US-based investigation.
Audi's involvement in the investigation may be heavy on Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer has an excessive stake in Volkswagen's profit.
Don't jump every time you see it
The head of the Turkish Neurosurgy Association, Prof. Dr. Yusuf Merýş Çağlar, warned that no fishing from 2 meters to shallow places, which are not certain.
Thousands of people face the risk of paralysis every year due to a broken neck and spinal injury due to shallow water.
The neck fractures are often developed in the cervical vertebrae of 5 or 6.
The quality of the fractures is that it affects the muscles of arms and legs at this level, as well as the nerves that feed the respiratory muscles.
"The cervical vertebrae, which are our most valuable organ in these accidents, are severed by the broken vertebrae or out of function," Prof. Dr. Çağlar said.
"The wrong first aid in spinal injuries is not only increasing the damage to the survivors, but it can cause death," he said.
Floating into the water is ranked fourth in spinal injuries.
The average age of wounded is 20-29, and most of them are male.
Prof. Dr. Çağlar should not jump into unseen water.
He said, "No matter how well he dives, there may be a severe injury to the branch."
Prof. Dr. Çağlar also reminded me:
Depending on the spinal level of the damage to the fishing dive, the arm and legs can be paralyzed at different levels.
You may be able to swim, but water can be deceiving.
The place that looks deep to you could be shallow.
Due to signs of warning placed on the coast of the United States and Australia, a 70 per cent reduction in shallow water jumping cases has been reported.
"Although there is 28 provinces of sea coast in Turkey, unfortunately there is not a single warning sign in places outside Istanbul," Prof. Dr. Çaklar said.
"Every province has to be carefully kept under the health management, schools and social awareness project, under the beach and pools, or information panels," he said, concerning these kinds of accidents that make life dark.
Prof. Dr. Kadir Kotil, chairman of the TÜRK Neurocurism Association Spinal and Periferic Neurgery Group, suggested that these should be done in case of injury:
The first thing to do at the time of the crime is to call 112.
The neck must be held as steady as possible, not moved, detected by a solid collar.
The airway must be provided and the patient must be relocated on the opposite side for the water that runs into the lung.
He shouldn't be held by legs and dangled to drain the water.
The shape disorder in the patient's neck shouldn't be tried to fix it.
His neck vertebrae may be broken.
But if the spinal cord hasn't been damaged yet, first aid and an inappropriate position to be given during the patient's move could cause broken bone fragments to pressure the spinal cord and cut it off.
Provence lavender under threat of climate change
It had become a symbol of Provence in South France, but there is a warning that it was under threat of climate change.
Lavanta has fallen due to drought-like conditions and disease-carrying insects, and it causes a major headache for scientists and farmers who are trying to find a solution.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Provence-based agricultural research institute, said: "The lavender in Provence is effectively in danger because in recent years, the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change that brings rain much less and most of the fall.
It affects the life of the lavender.
There's also a small cicada with a leaf damage that transmits microbacteria, and it's a lot of them in the dry air. "
And a lot of things are in danger.
He goes after a lot of lavender oil for perfume and cosmetics as much as he takes the vacation people.
Eric Chaisse said, "With a few large flowers, we have smaller, smaller, less developed or not-at-all or weak headers.
So we have less esanal oil. "
Among the revised solutions include better water distribution and slowing the vapor from the soil, but there is also a protective mixture of mud and water to the plants and developing more resistant species to dry conditions.
Journalist's murder underscores the growing threat in Mexico
The weekly paper, Riodoce's staff, often meets Wednesdays to review the latest mayhem, lawless officers and plans for endless drug wars in the province of Sinaloa.
But today, in the shadow of their own tragedies, they met to discuss their safety.
They were told it was important for them to change their routine.
Two senior journalists see what makes them feel safer: bringing their children to the office with them, which is the target of a grenade in 2009, or leaving them at home.
Security experts have written three words on the blackboard outside the room: violations, neutrals, allies.
They ask reporters to offer names for each column; there is no need for evidence, perceptions and internal voices.
Journalists suspected of drug traffickers, politicians, business people, government or cartels tying up a salary are the bad guys who made a list of Mexico's chaos dangerous to write in the paper.
No more bodies around the country, and more journalists are journalists: according to the Committee for Protection of Journalists, at least 25 people have been under federal protection since President Enrique Pena Nieto took over in December 2012; 589 have been under federal protection since the attacks and threats, and so far, seven of them have died in seven states this year.
Among the last dead are writers and inspiration sources of Riodoce founding partner Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist," Valdez writes in one of his many books on narcotics violence.
His absence is deeply felt, but his presence is hanging on the front of Riodoce's building with the word "Justice," and two reporters in their 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wearing his smile, his glasses, his panama hat.
It happens two months before his death; reporters talk about common trauma, nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
In 2010, a private federal prosecutor was created to address journalists' cases, but according to the Committee for Protection of Journalists, he only prosecuted two.
Like most of the thousands of murders linked to drug trafficking and organised crime every year, journalists' killers are rarely brought to the front of the law.
In Riodoce, even though their hearts are broken, they insist on addressing violence in Sinaloa, although the ground is now more deceptive.
Without knowledge of murderers, without justice, it's very little use to discuss security, Ibarra says.
"It's stupid to waste my time in this study," he says.
"You don't trust anyone unless we know why."
On the morning of May 15th Valdez left the Riodice office in Culiacan, state capital.
The Red Toyota Corolla was only able to drive a few blocks before it was stopped by two men; it was forced out of its vehicle and shot 12 times for the name of its newspaper, which was supposedly translated as the 12th River.
The guy with the gun got away by getting in his car, and he hit the car nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
His wife and two grown-ups left.
Rumors tend to roam freely in Culiacan.
But there's almost nothing more about Valdez than silence.
After Guzman's arrest and extradition to the United States last year, the rival groups fought to fill the void, Sinaloa became one of the country's most bloody battlefields.
Never mind that a man or a lot of people were shot and killed on the street in Sinaloa, or that the cemetery was filled with fancy, two-story houses that were meant to live.
For a minute, forget about "calm" when only one cartel controls precious ports and drug trafficking routes for the United States.
However, even though Valdez was deeply aware of the dangers of his work, Riodoce's founding partner and manager, Ismail Bojorquez (60), was guilty of failing to protect his friend.
He believes two mistakes contributed to the murder.
The first was an interview with Damaso Lopez, leader of one of the rival cartel groups who fought Guzman's sons in February.
This article may have pissed off the sons; possible gang members bought every copy of the raid as soon as they were distributed to the newsstands.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after being seized by another newspaper with the same story.
Valdez was a legend outside Mexico and abroad, and his murder was seen as a turning point in Mexican violence against journalists.
He survived for so long, his friends and colleagues assumed he'd always be there.
He was an experienced reporter in Noroeste in 2013 when he joined his five colleagues by selling $50 shares in Riodoce's discovery.
"It was impossible to do journalism without talking about narcotics in Sinaloa," said Bjorquez.
Over time, the newspaper won its reputation with its brave and honest news and the sales increased.
Reporters loved to publish vital research without fear of censorship, and the readers were caught in a broadcast where they could read stories that no one else dared to communicate.
Riodace won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot award for journalism in Latin America eight years after its establishment.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Journalists for encouraging me not to let go of the Mexican drug story.
He admitted to being clearly afraid.
During the CPJ awards, he said, "I want to keep living."
In an interview with Rompiento TV, he said that drug trafficking in Sinaloa is "a lifestyle."
"As a journalist, you must accept your duty to play this or the fool.
I don't want to be asked, "What were you doing in the face of so many deaths... why didn't you tell me what was going on?"
Riodace staff misses Valdez; the joker who curses like a porter, his friends who are generous in hugs and advice, his teachers who know how to survive.
They trusted his routine.
He always wore his hat.
He used to go to a bar across the street from the office called El Guayabo and always sat at the same table.
They ask: "Is his love for their routine fallen down?"
His death forced them to question their own assumptions about how best they could do their jobs and survive.
"If you deal with their women, their children, their clean jobs, secret airlines they use to transport drugs, they don't like it."
"These things were beyond the border," he said.
The result was a high-level hitchhiking and self-preservation, even at the best of times.
Trust your own instincts.
If it smells bad, stay away.
"The smell is a deceiving sense... and what happened to Javier happened to him," said Andres Villarreaal, editor of Riodice.
He and others say that the old rules in Sinaloa are not valid; as in other states, including Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero, and a toxic mix of snow smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials...
The floor changes all the time.
In the room where the Riodace staff met for security training, no cell phones are allowed; it turns out that only days ago, spies sold to governments were used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Two police officers outside wanted to get rid of the temperature of 104 degrees in the shade of a tree.
They were allocated by the state government to protect Riodoce's office in a four-story building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.
Some of the reporters, half-serious, were wondering if these officers were cops within 50% of what the governor himself said were unreliable.
Reporters have gone to the mountainous countryside where drug gangs control it as a verb.
In this week's count, Riodice is resolving three main stories.
There was the murder of former great boxer Julio Cesar Chavez's brother in Sinaloa.
In addition, government spending focused on the governor's country had a revelation.
And there was a group abduction at Culiacan's most expensive restaurant a block from the D.A. 's office.
There was no official explanation for who was kidnapped or how, so when it came time to write down what everyone in the city knew, the restaurant was the eye of drug traffickers and authorities.
A reporter found out from official records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a corporate revolutionary party (PRI), which dominated almost every level of politics over the past century.
A lot of PRI governors have been charged with corruption in sensational events lately.
Villareal asked the reporter to write about earlier events, including the escape of one of the sons of "El Chapo" Guzman at that scene.
They only read it months ago, looking around Valdez's corner for the best source on the abduction.
"Vilareal (46), called" El Flaco, "said Vilareal (46)," We already knew what was going on before. "
"All communication channels with our resources are down now."
The staff are being reused as a storage unit for a banner and stickers that protest journalist murders while turning into activists in the name of the press they never expected.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez got some cards and went to the show the next morning for another journalist in the local prosecutor's office.
Salvador Adme disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the district of Michoacan, west.
A burned body was found, and DNA tests show that the official officers said it was him.
Journalists across the country have expressed their opinion louder by writing "help to the press" to the sidewalk and buildings in organised protests.
Today, Principal Bojorquez is trying to provide international support for justice in the case of Valdez, far away in Washington.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez was killed, Ramirez accused authorities of spying on journalists and getting them killed for telling the truth.
From that day on, he wanted to be assigned to another mission other than government news, thinking his anger damaged his neutrality.
Valdez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are "surrounded" by organised crime, accomplice, official officials and a reckless society.
In his last book, "Narko-journalism," he wrote that journalists were being killed not only by drug gangs, but by orders of politicians and security forces in co-operation with organised crime.
Media observer group Articulo 19 linked more than half of the attacks on journalists last year to police and official officials.
"You die in Mexico because they want to shut you up," Ramirez said.
The murders clearly took a cold shower.
No one forgets about the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
His body was found with a note signed by the Zetas cartel: "I'm here because of my news."
A computer keyboard and an earpiece, folded next to his severed head.
Following the murder of journalist Miroslava Breach in Chihuahua, the northern border state, several publications such as El Norte chose to close.
As El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after their principal was killed in 2004, others continued.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad called to the drug cartels with this headline on the front page of Juarez: "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists escaped from their own states, even the country.
It's a twisted decision.
It's hard to find a job in exile, and they're still searching the streets waiting for danger.
Sometimes, three months after escaping Veracruz, four women and a photographer who was murdered in a building in Mexico City in 2015, they were captured like an understanding of Ruben Espinoza.
It's a dance every day with high-risk decisions for those who stay behind and continue to work.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, says it scared her to report drug trafficking.
"Mexico goes to hell, and that's why I became a reporter."
A recent Saturday at midnight, when the final number was being prepared to finish, the Riodice writers sat on the sidewalk outside the office, drinking beer, and started stealing phones at the same time.
A series of armed conflicts involving rival gangs and security forces near Mazatlan, a beach resort, led to 19 confirmed deaths.
As promised in a series of cartel messages around the area, the war continued to escalate.
They put it on Riodace's website through cell phones on the sidewalk.
The front page would have to be replaced the next day.
The sirens are starting to sing nearby, there's another shooting around.
Bjorquez quickly took a look at the police officers who were on guard to see if they were on alert.
If they were scared, they wouldn't show it.
Under the enormous portrait of his newspaper's defeated founders, his middle finger was displayed to see all Sinaloa, Riodoce's staff following his footsteps.
"How can you think about closing up," said Bjorquez, "the day Javier was killed, when the intern asked me to send him out to tell me on the street?"
He used camouflage to avoid dinosaur enemies.
It looks like a statue at first glance, but a terrible one.
Now, researchers have explained that the first findings of an incredible creature found by a Canadian miner are well protected, experts describe it as "the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs."
It was so well-guarded that they could see that stamp skin was red brown, and they could say it was a troubled past.
The report in Current Biology magazine described it as "one of the best protected armored dinosaurs and one of the best dinosaurs in the world."
The fossil is a newly found nodozor species that lived between 110 million and 112 million years ago in the middle of the Kretase period.
The extraordinary well-preserved situation has baffled researchers who describe it as "truly wonderful."
According to reports in National Geographic, the plant-eating armored fossil is the best preserved fossil of its own kind.
Shawn Funk was found in North Alberta Canada on March 21, 2011 digging the Suncor Millennium mine near Fort McMurray.
According to the rock around him, he hit something that looked weird and decided to take a closer look.
The fossil discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology Museum.
For the next six years, they spent 2500 pounds (1100 kg) exposing the wild animal from within the pile of soil.
After such an intense study, the complete result is now ready to be revealed.
Caleb Brown, the chief writer at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature was displayed, said, "If you lower your eyes a little bit, you might even believe that you're almost asleep."
'One of the most beautiful in science history and the best protected dinosaur species will be the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs. '
By examining his skin, researchers found that even though he was covered in armor and looked like a walking tank, whoever ate this plant probably faced a serious threat from the meat-eating dinosaurs.
The dinosaur, which was heavily armored, used its red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a protective technique used by many of the animals of the day, known as contrast-shading.
Experts say it has been hunted by larger dinosaurs, allowing it to blend in better and overcome its enemies.
The creature from the 110 million-year-old family of nodozor appeared in the headlines in May, and is currently exhibited at the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology Museum.
The researchers have finished their work now and called it Borealopelta Markmitchelli to a museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of the teams who spent more than 7,000 hours trying to expose him.
The extraordinary preservation of the species has made it possible for Dr. Mitchell and the international scientist team to document the shape of the stamps and the armor on the body.
They discovered the shadow of the contract, which is a common defence method in the animal world, which means the top part of the creature is darker than the bottom.
Although the contrast is common to my shadow, the findings are surprising because the size of Borealopelta is far beyond the scale of animals that are living today.
It means that dinosaurs are under enough pressure by meat-eating dinosaurs, and they prefer to face hiding as a way of survival.
But the most modern animals (such as deer, zebras or armadillos), for example, are much smaller and much more likely to be a prey, which means that the Nodozor faced a serious challenge to survive.
"Strong hunting for a massive, heavily armored animal shows how dangerous dinosaur predators in Kretase can be," Brown said.
The chemical analysis of the organic compounds in his stamps also revealed that the dinosaur's skin was red brown.
Scientists continue to examine the animal for clues about his life, including protected intestinal content, to find out what he ate at his last meal.
When the dinosaur dies, they believe that he fell into a river and drifted into the sea, where he sank to the surface of the ocean on his back.
At that time, Alberta was as hot as South Florida was today, and probably rivers and oceans spread far more inland than they are now.
"Nodozor is truly remarkable that the original shape of the animal is preserved in 3D," Brown said.
'The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as it did in the early Kretase.
You don't need much imagination to rebuild it; if you lower your eyes a little bit, you might even believe that you're almost asleep. '
The cretase was when the giant theropod, the meat that stood on two feet, was roaming the globe.
Although he was king of all, Tyrannosaurus rex lived millions of years after the armored dinosaur Borealopelta, which could have been hunted by a number of great ancestors.
Among them is Acrocanthosaurus, a monster of 38 ft (11.5m), six tons.
Scientists in Current Biology believe that Borealopelta was dragged into the sea after his death and embalmed in the mud.
The creature was discovered by Shawn Funk on 21 March 2011, digging the Suncor Millennium mine near Fort McMurray in North Alberta Canada.
According to the museum, this is the best-preserved armored dinosaur, including leather and armor, and from the nose to the hip.
The creature is approximately 18 ft (5 meters) and weighs up to 3,000 pounds (1300 kg).
He has two 20 inches long horns coming out of his shoulders.
Investigators believe that until this armored weed is dragged into the open sea by a river carrying oil, it is now in the western Canada where it is.
But the dinosaur's tomb under the sea preserved its armor in perfect detail.
The fossilized remains of this particular species are so well preserved that the skin fragments still cover the tumultuous armor layers along the dinosaur's skull.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a measure is as rare as winning the lottery.
The more I look at him, the more incredible it is.
The fossilized skin fragments are still covering the bulging armor layers in the dinosaur's skull, with a dot point in it.
His right front leg lies next to him, reaching up five fingers.
I can count the scales on the foot floor. "
Don't be your teeth when you want me to make it white.
White teeth and a plastic smile are every man's dream.
While people seek ways to whittle their teeth, President Nühet Berk, president of the Oral Laser Application Association, warns that they should stay away from products sold on the market or on the Internet.
"The whitening of teeth can be provided by chemicals that are used by dentists, or with tiny porcelain surfaces attached to the surface of the teeth," Nükhet Berk said, saying that he drew the surface of these substances that were sold, and that the teeth were colored in no way to return.
He noted that the protection of dental health has prevented many diseases, and that plastic applications are important for both dental and dental health and a good laugh:
Young people usually have white teeth unless there's a disorder in dental structures or genetic factors.
The teeth are darker over the years due to the frequent consumption of aging, dental mines and cigarettes, abrasive or dark drinks.
The whitening of teeth can be provided with chemical substances being done by dentists, or with thin porcelain surfaces that have been done with minimal or no abrasions on the surface of the teeth.
Never get teeth whitened with products sold on the market or on the Internet.
Because these substances draw the surface of the mine, and the teeth are colored so that there will be no recycling again.
Keçeören Municipality, 2011, gives the elderly, disabled and bedridden citizens "Home Dental and Mouth Health Service."
"My wife has heard of this service by Keçeören Municipality, 65-year-old Koksal Güngori, who has lived in bed for 24 years."
We called the city, and they came immediately.
He said, "I'm already paralyzed from my neck, and thanks to this service, at least I'm not neglecting my dental care."
"My mother has been addicted to bed for 7.5 years."
When I got to the city hall, I saw the posters of this service, and I called right away.
We've been getting this service regularly for four years.
I have a problem with my teeth, and when the doctors come, they look at me.
He used "very happy" statements.
There is no need for any health security for a completely free service.
The Turkish army incident of "seniority."
My dear readers, at the High Military Shura meeting the other day, very interesting decisions have been made especially for the Navy.
The commander of this Force was brought not an admiral, but an admiral.
It's an almost unprecedented procedure in our army.
And how did that happen?
The Commander of the Force, Admiral Bülent Bostanoğlu, had expired, he would have retired already...
And it happened.
Now it was time for the commander to come to Veysel Kösele, the only admiral.
Veysel Pasha, who was the victim of the compas in the past and who was under arrest for a while, was supposed to be the commander in the regular ranking.
But the government didn't want him.
I'm trying to make it very clear that if we start at the top of the Navy, the commanders 1, 3, 4 and 5 were not promoted.
In that case, there was only one admiral left in the Navy.
He was supposed to be brought to my desk: Admiral Veysel Kösele, number two, Navy Commander.
So what happened next?
The sixth rank, Admiral Adnan Özbal, was appointed by the government.
Now look at this painting!
Admiral Veysel Kösele is standing there, but instead a lower-ranking commander is being appointed!
A senior is being brought to your superiors' service.
I wonder what happens next.
An admiral who is superior to rank does not serve or do so under the command of a general who is inferior to him.
He doesn't take orders from her, he doesn't take them.
In that case, Veysel Kösele will not tolerate this hurtful situation, but if he has not been sent to retirement, he will resign today or tomorrow.
And that is the hurtful message given to him by the government: "Goodbye, Veysel Pasha!"
The news that he resigned yesterday afternoon, but the situation was not officially announced.
Now let's look at this again!
The government opposed Veysel Kösele for this reason or so, and forced him to resign, and brought a sixth-row admiral to the command, instead, and damaged our army's traditional concept of "The Blur."
There must be politics involved, but we don't know the back of the curtain.
Maybe if someone tells us soon, we'll all know!
My dear readers, I've tried to make it very clear upstairs, especially in the Turkish army, the subjective event is very important.
Not just in rank.
For example, the officer who finished Harp School in 10th place is more senior than the 11th.
He is more senior than the first-class general, the second-ranking.
We've experienced concrete examples of this subjective incident in the Stability Harun.
Ismet Pasha, commander of the Garp Front...
You have two armies at your disposal.
Army and 2nd Army.
In 1922, our armies will perform the great assault and fire the Greek army.
At this point, there are valuable names that are expected to be assigned to the military commander.
One is Safet (Bele) Pasha.
He's being offered military command, but he says, "Ismet is without me, I can't take his command."
Another name is Jacob Shevki.
Atatürk's teacher at the Harp Academy...
A worthy and senior commander, who he loved, cared for, called "Master," in various wars.
In 1919, soldiers and civilian Turkish intellectuals were captured and driven to Malta Island by the British.
When he returns home, he is reluctant to command the army, and he says the same thing: "The commander of the Western Front is no more than me, and I cannot take orders from him."
However, Atatürk has convinced him of a request of gratitude, and Jacob Şevki Pasha accepts the command of one of our two armies.
The third is a very colorful name...
Ali İhsan (Sabis) Pasha.
A soldier who talks a lot, criticizes it all the time.
A commander who fought in Iraq, Kafkas, Iran and various fronts.
He's being banished by the British to Malta, and he runs away from there and comes to Ankara through his siege.
When he is offered military command, Ali İhsan Pasha says the same thing: "I cannot fight at the command of Ismet, who has failed me..."
But he's being persuaded...
But look at the bride, who has been constantly arguing with Ismet Pasha, commander of the Garp Front, who has taken charge of the mission, and makes the army restless...
And shortly before the great assault, he was dismissed and retired, replaced by Nurettin Pasha with a beard.
After that, Ali İhsan never gets better with Atatürk.
In the Turkish army, the problem of shortages is not only in war, but in peace.
Of course he has to leave.
Veysel Kösele is the last example of this.
How did an activist have to learn the answer to "Who's The Streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was deeply shaken.
The day after he came to New York City, he sat in the bed of Airbnb, where St. Louis hired a native, and he started on Facebook on his phone.
It came from someone in high school.
"Police just killed an 18-year-old boy and he's still lying on the street."
He was surprised when he realized that no one else shared that information in the content stream, he turned off Facebook and turned on Twitter.
A user named TheePharoah was constantly tweeted in his content stream.
The rapper from St. Louis County tweeted Michael Brown's death alive, killed by an unarmed black white police officer in Ferguson Missouri.
He shared a picture of Brown's lifeless body lying on the street for four hours.
Ferrell thought to himself, "This is brutal."
But death was nothing new to him or his society.
He left his phone to go back to tweets about people gathering at Canfield Drive the same night.
There were pictures of a man who claimed to be the father of the police, the screaming people and Brown, who had a banner that said, "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
A police officer watched a live broadcast with a dog barking in front of a group of protesters.
In another video, another cop, he said, set the trigger on his rifle and shouted, "I'm going to kill you all... animals."
Ferrell remembered saying, "This isn't unusual."
"'This is not the kind of murder we're used to, and it's not typical.'
At that moment, I felt a chill.
I was angry and crying. "
He booked a return ticket and went home the next day.
After he landed at 11: 00 a.m., he took his six-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided to go with her to Ferguson the next morning.
A new documentary called "Who's The Streets?" will come to the movies on August 11th, what happened to Ferrell and Ferguson three years after that.
This is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, power and resistance, from the perspective of people who live in that society and fill the streets with answers they seek.
Ferrell was driving his car to Ferguson with a girl wearing a flower dress and wearing a crown that fit her, and they went back to talking about the "experiences of black people and the condition of black people" they had done over and over again that morning.
"Do you remember when I taught you that black people should fight because they believe?"
"We're going to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn't true.
I couldn't keep it, "Ferrell said later.
"What happened here today... is the result of what happened in the past.
He needs to know it, see it, and grow in it.
It must not only improve in activism and organizing, but also know the layers of black experience and the black state of freedom and what we must do to liberate ourselves.
Even if I were lucky enough to give him an experience that he couldn't experience rough racism personally, he'd be no different than any black woman-child.
I feel like I will be doing evil to him by protecting him from them. "
When they arrived in Ferguson, their first stop was on South Florissant Road, which was across the street from the police station, where they were waiting to talk about the matter that ended with no crime being committed to Officer Darren Wilson, which turned into some kind of campground for activists.
There Ferrell and his daughter have contacted local business owners who are preparing food wrapped up.
They packed bags and helped get them to the protesters.
For Ferrell, a new form of action was slowly shaping up.
When I was a student at Missouri State University, he said that he was head of the minority students' Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health in the black community, and said, "My action has completely changed since 9 August."
"I had no experience in organising.
It came from itself. "
After weeks, Ferrell met with Sabah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film in one of his performances.
Folayan said that Lucas Alvarado-Farrar, who himself and his own image director, "wants to document what's going on."
Ferrell had a question: "Do you want to document it or do you want to find a story you can use?"
This skepticism was reported by countless people, mostly white people, who came to a society and took advantage of his pain and resistance...
As Folayan explained in an interview nearby: "We heard that the voices of people born and growing in Ferguson could not concentrate, and we decided to do it differently."
Folayan had already made contact with regional artist Damon Davis, known for his actions on prisoners who were sentenced to death.
His participation brought Ferrell to the project, as well as six other local residents, followed by the years after Brown was shot.
David said, "This documentary is not someone talking to us or talking to us; it's us."
"That's what was really important to me, how to represent these people because this is how to represent me."
"The goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experiences, but it proved that the move was not about a metaphorical leader, it was about society getting together," Folayan said.
As a result, "Who are the streets?" is surprisingly documented of Ferrell's personal aspects of his life, as he fell in love and married his wife.
"I felt like I was naked," Ferrell laughed at the first time he saw the product.
"But when I did this job and made black people human, I knew there might be some sensitivity."
Ferrell's story also solidifies and replaces the role of black gay women in the Black Lives Matter movement.
After the murder of black young Trayvon Martin in 2012, two of the three founders who produced the BlackLivesteter slogan in social media define themselves as gay.
"Black gay women in the leadership generally kept moving," Ferrell said, and that's because we're always at war on many fronts.
Black gay women have to carry all the weight of it. "
Folayan added, "The move is really being held up by black women and many gay black women."
However, Ferrell insists that "when there is nothing to do with the kind of action that is expected" and that it is not chosen because of their identity.
He says, "He was the one that activated this energy."
"But it's not a coincidence that she's on the front lines, because as a black gay woman, there are a lot of things you lose by living a life in these intersections.
You can feel his energy on the screen. "
Meanwhile, in Ferguson, the news cameras have already gone, but there are alarming racial links between society and the police.
Ferrell is under two and a half more years of surveillance due to blocking the highway during a demonstration.
The socio-political atmosphere in the area he calls my home, it literally describes the atmosphere as "chaos."
Still, he hits the song he carved in his memory three years ago, where he went out on Ferguson Street.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our job to win.
We have to love and support each other.
We have nothing but chains to lose. "
Kyrie Irving: The world is not round but straight!
"The world is not round."
The world is flat.
People get used to things like this by giving them fear.
Oh, man, don't ask too much.
Because the more information you solve, the more information you get.
This is crazy.
Is the world straight?
Or is he circling around?
I think you should look into it.
I'm telling you, they're lying to our faces.
They're lying to us!
Irving, "I believed I wanted to believe for years."
And I thought the world was round and round.
You really think we're back in the solar system?
Nothing they send back.
He's not coming back!
The information they gave us is inconsistent.
The truth is here.
You just have to look for the truth.
He said, "Do you understand what I'm saying?"
Kyrie Irving, who claims the world is flat, fights 24.4 points and 5.9 assists with Cleveland Cavaliers this season.
A suitable likeness: the artist uses Chelsea Manning's DNA to create portraits
In the middle of the room at the New York Fridman Gallery, there are a lot of faces hanging over the ceiling wires, white, black and brown, each showing almost unknown similarities.
These 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg, who was sent to her by Chelsea Manning by ear rods and cut hair.
As it is known, former intelligence analyst Manning, who served 35 years in prison after leaking classified diplomatic messages through WikiLeaks website, sent his hair cut out from Fort Leavenworth prison.
The new exhibition opened on August 2nd is called an appropriate resemblance.
This is a product of two years of correspondence between a trans-woman and a leading opposition, Manning, who has been pardoned by Barack Obama for three days to end his mission with Dewey-Hagborg, who combines discipline in technology, computer science and art.
Dewey-Hagborg, who created 30 portraits of what a person with this gene data could look like, was not only able to interpret the processing of DNA data, but also revealed his identity with a strict, maybe a little brain-based interpretation.
Manning, born Bradley Edward but clearly described himself as a woman in adolescence, was convicted of 20 crimes in 2013, including six of them, computer fraud and theft.
His image was pressured by the prison, so there was only one photograph: a sand, black and white selflessness, where Manning was sitting in the driver's seat, which was widely disturbed, wearing a platinum-yellow wig that was unique to him.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg was successful in his 2012 project with the enormous calm of the Weirdest Premonition.
In this, the artist produced portraits of DNA from the ruins of forensic pieces such as cigarette butts and gum to create a picture of what these people might look like.
He received an e-mail from Paper Magazine at the same time.
"They were doing an interview with Chelsea Manning in prison, and they asked for some kind of portrait that could be accompanied by this article," Dewey-Hagborg explained at the press preview of the new exhibition.
Meanwhile, there was no visit, no photo, so they reached Chelsea and asked if she was interested in making a DNA portrait.
The artist and his imprisoned inspiration became unexpected letter friends in two years of exchange.
In fact, they even discovered the Repressed Visions, a comic book that was illustrated by Shoili Meygo, where the president forgave Chelsea's punishment and she could see the exhibition personally.
Obama really wanted Manning's release a few days after the book was released, which was kind of a happy coincidence after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas.
While Donald Trump has found new, tweetable ways to fuel the sharp divisions that are needed to fight and repair transsexual soldiers, there is also something deep and powerful about this exhibit that is now being opened.
"Things happen for a reason," Dewey-Hagborg said.
An artist written on the walls of the gallery, which Manning's signature in large dimensions is below that (the point of "i" in his last name) was called to end "gender, race, gender and culture-based" auto discrimination. "
Across the wall is his mitochondrial DNA sequence: many C's, G's and A's written in pencil...
Dewey Hagborg, including the 200 letters (or the sophisticated language of the artist), wanted to explain how surprising we all look alike, at least as biological creatures.
"What I hope people will get out of this is how clear our genome is to comment on who we are and how subjective the genetic genius is," said Dewey-Hagborg, who was performing his video work in 2007 as a display of Copytes Memories.
"DNA data can tell a lot of different stories, and that's 30 of these stories."
The last piece of the exhibition held in one room is a page from the short comic book that was mentioned earlier.
It's shown here that Manning, King Kong style, the United States of America, is coming out of Discipline barracks with a speaker.
It says, "Once they shut up your speech, they win."
"So don't ever shut up."
"This came directly from a letter he wrote to me," the artist from Philadelphia said.
"I still get goose bumps when I talk about it."
Manning has yet to personally see the exhibition (as it was foreseeable from the comic book), but when he sees it, he will be greeted by masks of his own genetic imitations, collected like a group of protesters in the middle of the room.
Like everything in the exhibition, genetic prison groups were made especially until Manning's height (5 "2, Manning's height), written with a pencil.
"I used to put them on the wall in the past, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," Dewey-Hagborg said.
"I wanted this to be perceived as a mass movement shaped by Chelsea, like the movement behind her freedom."
Northwestern training officer and Oxford University employee Wanted for Murder
Police say a nationwide manhunt has been launched for Northwestern University trainers and Oxford University employees, wanted as suspects, after being stabbed to death in a luxury apartment in Chicago.
Cook administration records show on Monday that they were involved in the murder of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56), without bail, were released for the first degree of arrest for murder.
Documents say Cornell-Duranleau (26) died after being stabbed many times.
A warning issued by the Chicago Police Department said a body was found on July 27th.
Officers received a phone call, reached Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several deep cuts in his body.
Official sources say Cornell-Duranleau was reported dead at the scene and that the police were investigating stabbing as a murder while searching for two suspects actively.
Lathem has been a doctorate in microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, vice president of university relations, said Lathem was on administrative leave and was banned from entering Northwestern University camps.
"This is a criminal case under investigation by necessary authorities and Northwestern University co-operation in this investigation," Cubbage said.
Warren is a senior finance assistant at Oxford University.
"We are in contact with the United Kingdom police and we are ready to help US investigative authorities in any way they need," said a spokesman from the University of Somerville and University of college.
I was also told that Warren's colleagues were in shock and wanted him to surrender.
Chief of Communications from the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guglielmi, said he strongly encouraged suspects to surrender to the authorities.
"The police have an idea of where they are, but our efforts to detect it are intending," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities helped find the suspects.
Guglielmi said the police received a phone call from the Grand Plaza building manager, who just received a mysterious clue that something has happened in apartment 1008.
The police have described the crime scene as a terrible crime scene.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether it was July 27th.
Lathem and Warren were confirmed by security cameras.
"We believe that the victim was involved with Professor Latham," Guglielmi said.
"The police are still working on the victim's timeline and past and are investigating a series of salads -- a possible domestic event," the administration staff at Grand Plaza said to residents.
Italy has seized the German ship
Italian police announced yesterday that the ship, Iuventa, which was in search and rescue of refugees in the Middle East, was seized on Lampedusa Island.
The police, who also shared the records of the phone calls that the organisation claimed to belong to two members, announced that this operation was part of the investigation launched by the Trapani Prosecution in October 2016.
Jugend Retet members, who were suggested to operate in favor of illegal migration on the Libyan-Italy line, say they brought refugees directly from Libyan human traffickers' boats to Italy at least three times.
Jugend Retet, who was questioned in the prosecution, also claimed to have committed this crime with some of the members of the Libyan Coast Guard.
The organisation said that their priorities would continue to save human life, and they were considering the charges against them.
The Italian Coast Guard and the European Union (EU) mission include ships, as well as about nine international NGOs in search and rescue of refugees in the Mediterranean.
The Italian government prepared a 13-point form of behavior rules for these organizations to comply, and required that this be signed.
Last minute: The five buffets of Banyi who attacked Greyershen have been sealed
The police detained him after the attack on Eskişehir Metropolitan Mayor Yilmaz Önerşen, and sealed him by the five buffets hired by the TCDD by retired police Mahfuz Banlı, who was arrested by the court.
According to Habertürk, several police and armed forces have accompanied the municipal teams.
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko: "In the short term, we will complete the WADA road map"
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it would not take long to implement the remaining World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) criteria to re-operate the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
"A certain phase has been completed in meeting road map criteria, and has earned the right to plan and test in co-operation with RUSADA, UKAD (United Kingdom Anti-Doping).
The WADA road map was updated in that context, "Mutko said on Thursday.
The prime minister was evaluating the second part of the WADA Directive Path Maps, describing criteria that recently published on the institution's website that reenacted the RUSADA.
According to Mutko, it doesn't contain anything to worry about Russia.
"Everything has been announced, all will be applied.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee [IOC] and WADA in the near future, "he added.
However, a criteria on the list suggests that Russian anti-doping officials have to publicly accept the results of the state-sponsored doping investigation, which was allegedly reported by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, which was approved by WADA.
"While our anti-doping system accepts a failure, we are conducting the investigation.
All measures have been implemented.
But there is no government program, and we will not accept anything that does not exist. "
Mutko's words repeated the events of Vitaly Smirnov, president of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
Speaking to RSport earlier today, Smirnov agreed to his past problems in the anti-doping organs of Russia, but added: "We have told him that the report contains positions and regulations that are counterproductive.
No one plans to accept the report unconditionally, "Smirnov added.
RUSADA was suspended by WADA to do doping controls within Russia after the doping scandal in November 2005.
However, under the supervision of international experts and the United Kingdom Anti-Doping (UKAD), this June was allowed to plan and co-ordinate.
In July, after a visit to the general centre of the institution in Moscow, WADA Director Olivier Niggli explained that the RUSADA "is moving in the right direction" to get back to work. "
100 million people watched!
The video, including "Come to Beşiktaş," which Beşiktaş announced the transfer of Negredo, soon reached 100 million people from 18 countries.
The video, decorated with the dialogue of Quaresma, Pepe and Negredo, was also shared from the web sites of important newspapers such as Marca, L'Equipe, La Gazzetta dello Sport.
The President of Galatasaray won't come empty-handed
Galatasaray's former president, Faruk Sören, criticised Bucharest and President Dursun Özbek, who went to Ankara for the transfer to Ndiye, to convince Mircea Lucescu.
Here's a special statement by the legendary president for the SABAH readers:
Lucescu-Uzbek meeting: "We were finishing when we left."
The President of Galatasaray will not go for nothing, nor will he return empty-handed.
Ndiye transfer: Galatasaray President does not go to the football player.
Football player comes to the president's feet.
Of course they do, whether they kiss your hand or hug you...
But no matter who the player is, the president won't stand up to him.
You're giving 9m euros to the player the Ottomans bought for 300,000 euros...
It's not 7.5 million, it's 9 million with bonuses!
You've already invested a lot, of course you will, and it will be 7.5... 9...
Ozbek's actions: I don't want to worry.
But it's obvious.
The G.House values are being erosion.
It's not just football, it's all wrong to approach.
And what changes that is the Court Council and the General Assembly.
But as far as I'm concerned, the members are happy!
Start-up to help your company not be the next Uber.
Amy Errett wanted to measure her happiness at the trade start-up, but the polls weren't working.
The answers were often vague, unhelpful or even worse deceiving.
Even if he committed anonymity, some employees didn't trust him as long as they did.
"There was no consistency or objectivity," Errett, who ran a 75-man e-trade company in San Francisco.
So he called an outsider for help.
A new kind of human resources appear to start-up to make companies understand how their employees feel.
These allow companies to create a software that is specifically intended to measure the occupations of employees, to conduct a series of questionable surveys, to target certain teams and demographic groups, to present anonymous and complaint lines to employees, and in some cases to the board of directors, and to be allowed to go directly to the board of directors to work to promote an insubordination.
"Now there are tools that watch your health like Strava and Fitbit," said Jim Barnett, the founder and head of the Glint, measuring the busy work by the software analyses companies, "Jim Barnett." Where is your company Fitbit? "
Errett says he understands what his employees think and feel after three years using the Glint.
It provides a heat map that shows which parts of the company are the most complaining and which principal is the lowest-rated points; thus, their reasons can be tampered with.
In order not to be the next Uber, companies have begun to understand that businesses need to know about culture; Uber has been in a scandal since he described a harassment environment that has been punished by those who clearly say what an old employee is thinking in a blog.
For starts like Glint, this request for surveillance means a very profitable business opportunity.
According to financial technology insight website Let's Talk Payments, the global administration, regulation and compatibility industry could be worth $118.7 billion by 2020.
The interest and event of Denver Colorado-up Convercent, which helped companies detect and prevent bad behavior, increased between the debate of Uber's disloyalty earlier this year.
Convercent has about 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber was recently registered as a client.
Convercent, like Glint, allows companies to make personalized "pulse" polls, collect real-time secret responses, and remove heat maps of the problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous distress line that employees can report bad behavior.
If the president is charged, the complaints go directly to the board.
"The public court has taken over the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and president of Covercent.
Quinlan said: If a company treats its employees badly or is not ethical, even if the regulators are not involved, consumer boycotts may face expensive results due to the work-poor or cases.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees in 500 positions, has been using Convercent for over a year to keep his employees informed of principles and procedures and provide easy access to the company headquarters.
When an employee asked to report a problem earlier, he had to find a phone number or e-mail from the company center, and he made an official complaint and hoped that he would be taken seriously.
Ruby Tuesday's chief legal advisor, James Vitrano, said they were mostly intimidating and disturbing experiences, not a good way to follow employee complaints.
But now that the company uses Convercent, problems can be detected and solved faster (such as discrimination, harassment or unfairly paid) from executives who have been hiding from the office, city or state-wide.
Vitrano, who runs Ruby Tuesday's risk management group, said, "I can get closer to this business experience by a whole, 360-degree perspective."
"Besides, we protect our shareholders against business cases."
In 2002, after accounting company Arthur Andersen went down due to the violation of ethical values caused by the Enron scandal, companies discussed more serious relations with ethics, values and employees in 2002, Quinlan said.
But after "social media comes to its senses," the companies realized they couldn't stop their dirty laundry from being viral.
"Before technology was used to control the ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent provide software as a service and receive repeated fees for the use of their products.
This is a business model and opportunity for investors who support both start-ups.
Convercent received $10 million in funding from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital and raised his total capital to $47 million in February.
Glint provided $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners and raised his total financing to $60 million.
Given the nature, culture and risk capital of companies linked together, these investments are not surprising.
Increased research shows that today's employees expect more from their workplace than before.
High salaries and interesting projects are just minimum requirements in competitive markets like Silicon Valley.
Employees want to feel accepted, valued, and giving their time to a company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy to be in a company, they feel their voices heard, and if their work is satisfactory, they are more sincere to making that company successful."
Investors earn money when their own portfolio companies do good work; companies do good work if their employees are sincere and they feel like they belong to the company.
It's not surprising if third party analyses are promising to increase the sincerity and the feeling of employees.
It's important for business culture experts to have data on their working commitment.
But the data is useless if the company's respondents don't act.
In fact, if a company wants feedback from its employees, it can create a expectation that change is coming.
And if the expectation doesn't come fast enough or never, it can disappoint and make the workers feel like they're cut off.
"If you want 4,000 proposals, you have to be prepared to talk 4,000," Russell Raath, a consultant at the Business Management company Kotter International, saw that the companies made a mistake of trusting too much data collection.
"Because if you do not follow, the workers will think," Have you heard me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why should I? "
According to Errett, Madison Reed, who conducted monthly surveys, was able to act on the same day when a problem was reported at Glint.
And after collecting feedback from workers who were fed up with the speed of decision-making mechanism and communication quality, he was able to reorganize various teams within the company and add communication training to solve problems.
In Ruby Tuesday, the company gets new insights about its own employees, and in the long run, it hopes that it will become more likely to hire workers in a industry known as a high-powered entry.
"If you are not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you will lose people."
"And if you lose people, you lose customers.
And when you lose customers, you lose companies. "
It's a long day for Bruins to lift two practices every day by NCAA.
He comes to 11: 00 at night, and a bunch of UCLA football players hang out to chat on the side of a new training field in campus.
Some of them have grazed their uniforms, unearthed their backs from the sweat of the first day at the training camp.
For an important part of the team, these empty minutes are the middle-of-the-day break.
After three hours of training, players registered to summer classes will return to their homes and study the final exams before they return to Wasserman Football Center for the meeting at 6.30 the next morning.
Just before the Bruins coach Jim Mora returned to Tuesday, he said, "The next three days is torture for these men."
The NCAA lifting two practices a day to lift the burden on the players, at least until the finals are over on Friday, actually extended their days.
So UCLA's first three practices were programmed to start at 7: 15 p.m. to adapt to the players' tight schedule.
In exchange for not having two practices a day, Bruins takes the start of the camp closer to a week last season, and during summer school, Mora has been training in summer school for the first time during the six seasons in Westwood.
In September, they plan to practice 18 training until August 20th before the official game preparations for their opening against Texas A & M.
Mora said the players added new pens to the intensive work programme, but the NCAA supported the rule change.
Mora said, "For three or four days, we put a giant load on them, and it's very challenging."
"And they've been through it recently; they're working, great kids.
I think when we get to Saturday, we'll have more time, it'll be really awesome. "
The UCLA will stop their training when the camp is over; it's not easy to think that the luxury hotel, the Luskin Center, which has been rained on by the parking lot and adjacent to it, is lying on the line of view of their fields.
The players from the Bruins are scheduled to move into the hotel from the beginning of this week, but Mora agrees that there may be a problem with the evacuation of these rooms during the season.
"We'll have security," Mora said.
"It's a real concern, and it's not crazy to think that someone's gonna rent a room and sit there and film a practice.
If a practice has a video record, it's a pretty good thing.
But we'll have security there, and we'll have security upstairs at the parking lot at 8: 00.
With what we have, we'll do our best.
I won't worry too much about it.
We have a plan. "
Facebook raises story verification power to fight false news
The Facebook third party will send more potential false articles to the storytellers and will show their findings under original sharing; the world's largest online social network said on Thursday that he was trying to fight the pseudonyms as false news.
In a statement on the company website, he said they would use updated machine learning to detect possible frauds and send them to storytellers and potentially show the story verification results under the original article.
Facebook is criticised for being one of the main distribution points of reports known as false news, which many think affected the 2016 US presidential election.
The problem has become a major political headline in Europe, with French voters dropping fake news before the presidential election in May and Germany failing to move hate sharing to pre-September social media networks quickly.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new story verification feature is being launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to seeing what stories were discussed by the third party storytellers, people want more resources about what they read and shared," Facebook news director Sara Su said on a blog.
He added Facebook will continue to test its "relevant article" feature and work on other changes in the news stream to reduce false news.
Creating comic books: the story of a Fortress in England
In his recent past, the tiny Scotney Castle appeared in a Squeeze music video and became a sanctuary for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But right now, Scotty, who inspired a comic book written by Jamie Rhodes of Yorkshire, with broomstick hair, historical documents, witnessed a 700-year-old turbulent history from his comfortable seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent.
"I find it very nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says, in an effective way.
"How personal it is to keep this letter in my hand."
From Edward to the Middle Ages in England, a Castle (Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg) is a different artist named after each story from the United Kingdom.
This is not Rhodes' first book based on an archive: he also wrote Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories in 2014, an unexpected project inspired by stories from the Library of Britain.
"Even my eyes were full of fingerprints on the edge of a letter written in the 1700s by a double agent working for King James fans," he said.
"That was his thumb!
And the letters always smell like work because then you used to light a fire for light.
For 300 years in the future, it feels like he's there too.
Oh, I love archives! "
As a lover of old papers, it seems a little too good to get support from the National Trust and the British Art Council and to stay in a castle for almost four months ("to be honest with you, I've outdone my warm welcome.")
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian castle, scanning the archives and working on many treasures and antiquities, such as hundreds of bottles of hyena heads and ditches that have been mounted on the walls of the mansion.
Talking to the Rangers, the gardeners, and sometimes the artists who work on the illustrations of his book, they went around the old castle's lands and ruins.
And then at night, he'd drink whiskey and write.
The full access of the National Trust is unknown to Scotland's detailed history, as the last heir Elizabeth Hussey was able to reach when she died in 2006.
When Rhodes came in ten years later, the staff only started taking over the archive, which he described as "centuries of aristocrats said," Oh, throw him into the attic. "
Letters from the days of the British empire, maps that determine the limits of who has what, "You think the territorial disputes will be boring," Rhodes said, saying, "But there was a birch tree where two families fought over it.
Forget it, guys! "
Some stories in the collection, including The Labourer, who left the newly built castle to join the village rebellion in 1381, use the castle as a stepping point to make a wider entry into British history.
"In this book, the Knights Family of Kent and Sussex, there is a record of a riot in the castle in 1380," said Rhodes.
"The village rebellion started around here, and I thought a rebellion could be a good starting point.
Maybe these two are connected? "
Other stories are closely linked to the history of the castle, such as The Priest, who told the story of the Darrell family who hid a Jesuit priest for seven years during the British Islahahs.
Or the Smuggler (which was found to be the 18th century smuggler, Arthut Darrell, who stuffed a coffin with stones and staged his own funeral).
The Darrell's top Scotney family said, "These guys look pretty tricky, they always go into debt and spend money on things they can't afford.
In different generations, Darrell men have solved their debt crisis by marrying rich old women; I imagine them as a group of handsome men who are capable of courting female heirs. "
Rhodes, whose mission ended in the castle, is searching for other singular writing experiences.
Fin completed a two-week job for a comic book about a comic book, which has been repossessed by nature since the early 20th century.
But Scotty keeps a separate place in his heart.
He says, "I was sorry to leave."
"It's like: 'Ah, now I have to go and face the fucking real life.'"
'Mayo 'reaction to Meral Akhener
The nationalist Movement Party Secretary-General Ismet Grorakaman has written a statement on recent allegations of resignation in social media and media related to the MHP.
"The nationalist movement has been applied to games and desks to prevent the existence of the nationalist movement under the MHP roof following September 12th," he said, using "a grudge against the MHP from the corners of some former musket Marxist."
Your magnification said:
"The history of the Turkish nation, which does not compose the historical existence of the Turkish nation, has no record of the Turkish country being able to attract its country, no matter how many criminal files are swollen, whose idea is blurred, confused, they rub their hands."
"They have now left" 410 members of the MHP Kocaeli Göncük County Agency and 215 people have resigned in Yenişehir district of MHP Bursa. "
250 resignations are misdirected by unfounded news, such as 300 resignations.
The newspaper columns have grown and the deception is deepened.
As we don't have a resignation in this number, the number of informants in these places do not pass one hand's fingers.
The public has been tried to misdirection and to conduct perception management with polls he calls "allegedly" again, he said.
"These will counteract propaganda and campaigns aimed at creating perception against MHP," he said.
MHP says the Turkish policy is an important and indispensable actor, MHP Secretary-General Greenkaman said:
The MHP has no power over the former Marxist swordsmanship to destroy the site of the Turkish nation's conscience.
A dirty account lies behind all the comments, the methods of perception management.
Because politics and media have been staring at the MHP base.
It means nothing to us now that those of us who have not done any good work and effort for the sake of our party will resign.
Those who can't take advantage of our party on their own account, what's my grief?
Even though their lives have not been good to the MHP, they have not shared our memories, they have not understood our countries, they have not joined our struggle, but even if they join, they must find another occupation with their minds, their heart-hardened community.
The efforts of the nationalist Movement Party to discredit those who can't afford unity and integrity are a futile effort.
And if he turns away, he will surely turn to strike his master.
The nationalist Movement is the last stronghold of the Turkish nation, despite heavy devastation.
"Political counterfeiters," he said, saying, "political clamps," for those he claims to be targeting MHP, "the nationalist movement is not without ownership."
"The root that feeds across the ocean will not reach their goal, no matter what the cost of the external altar inside," he said.
"The draft traitors will go crazy and burn in the fire," MHP said, adding opposition parties and terrorist organisations together: "From CHP to HDP; from there to Perinslusses to PKK, no matter what they do, they will not be able to operate on Turkey's own destiny."
Yesterday we resisted the new tactics and games of Turkish planners without MHP; the government without MHP, the people who wanted the Parliament without MHP fought to the end.
Now we're gonna break the games, we're gonna ruin the players.
"The patent of nationalism is in MHP," he said, referring to Meral Akhener: "I will take the Maho villagers to Germany, like in a former Greek film," as he said, "I will take them to the truck vault for days, and then I will bring you to the edge of the revolution," as Istanbul had left you on a mountain slope, as they had left you on the edge of the cliff. "
That is their concern, but all we ask of the poor is that they are new to their destination.
Kjaer signed Sevilla
Kjaer, who was transferred to Sevilla at 12.5m euros from the yellow-blue team, signed the official contract, which was the most expensive defense transfer of the Spanish team.
The Danish star will wear uniform number four in Sevilla.
It's a lot easier for a family with babies than THY.
According to the THY Press Convention, the national airline, which presides its passengers' flight comfort and satisfaction, continues to develop new ideas for a perfect travel experience, which works to make them feel more comfortable during the flight.
In this direction, the "baby travel kit" prepared by examining the needs of 0-2-year-old babies and their families began to be presented to pregnant passengers traveling across the continents from August.
In a custom-designed bag, the kit includes subchange covers, single-use food scrubs, baked cream, bebe lotion and shampoo, wet cotton handkerchief and breast pads.
Paraben, products that don't contain harmful chemicals with alcohol, paint, were produced based on the sensitivity of the baby skin.
Washington, changing Green Card Rules
According to the media, President Donald Trump said there will be a new US immigration plan that changes the Green Card rules.
He envies reducing legal immigrants to 50,000 degrees a year, restrictions on more strict rules for temporary work permits and visa for family.
The new rules were proposed by Republicans and supported by the president.
The draft law will be discussed on both sides of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, increase salaries and save billions of dollars for taxpayers and do it by changing the way the United States gives Green Card to other country citizens.
The law will reduce the chain migration and replace the current regime.
This new application process will help the English-speaking candidates, self-sufficient financial resources and skills that will help our economy, "said Trump, according to the American media.
Writers interpreted the Fenerbahçe-Sturm Graz game
For two seasons, the excitement and glory that I couldn't find, and I couldn't see again, Kadıköy...
Aykut was on the field to make a "stay behind" deal with a team of "barbecued" groups, which Big put out in the absence.
We can bring criticism to your game, positions or performances, but I haven't seen a game that's been working and looking for it in a long time.
He showed up at the first game, but yesterday he put his apolets on his shoulder; and now Valbuena, the commander of Fenerbahçe, is on the field.
His age was a problem when he was transferred, but Big had the phrase "character that wouldn't give up."
30 years ago, we gave Reza Çambay the name of the atom ant.
If he can handle it, it'll be the best comment for the French player.
He's been all over the field, joining all the rust organizations, taking responsibility and scoring a goal, and making it look like a huge show.
Alper's front game, second forvet position, left the Sturm Graz team "limited" in the long field.
While Fenerbahçe defeated the circuit without a corner, he kept searching for a formula to cross such a hard wall.
They control the ball, but they can't produce effective passes in the rival penal field.
This image may bring a "Santrfor needs" comment, but we're dealing with a game that hesitates to pass to Ahmethan, which can't put the only centriform in position.
Either the team didn't trust the young player or his performance needs to be improved a little bit.
After score 1-1, they couldn't take advantage of two clear opportunities.
It was important for them to pass the tour, but it would make the night even more beautiful to stand up to this fan who applauded the players' struggle as a "goal."
There'll probably be more than 1 or 2 new transfers by Monday.
But the truth is, Fenerbahçe needs number 12...
We're on the verge of a very bright and pleasant season with this game that carries the heart of those who are trying to play in the front.
Aykut Big's machine is setting up its zembler, he needs more time.
They're good with physical quality.
Game quality will also improve.
And you can see clearly that all the football players on the field have increased confidence.
They need a lot of applause for a new page last night.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we need to worry.
Just when you think 2017 can't get any weirder, there's a new report about technological development in the sex robot sector.
Yeah.
Sex robots are a big deal right now.
Recently, the Executive Robot Science Agency (FRR) issued a report looking at the development of sex robots over the next five to 10 years.
According to Noel Sharkey, a retired professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University, and founder of the FRR, we must take them seriously.
Customers can choose the robot's eye color, the nipple shape and the nail type.
Mr. Sharkey said, "People are laughing at them, but the companies are actually pretty much moving and we'll see more of them."
Modern sex babies evolved into robots that had silicon skin, artificial intelligence, particularly reactive to human beings, with a warm touch of the inflatable similarities.
Users can also personalize their robots to match their own blood by choosing everything from the robot's eye color, nipple shape and nail type or color.
But with so many robots that make a Stepford Woman look innovative, it becomes even more disturbing.
Modern sex babies evolved into silicon-skinned robots.
For example, the ReaalBotix robot allows users to personalize their own robots based on character properties (such as inhibitions) that they find attractive.
Then there are Roxxxy Gold sex robots developed by True Company, including "Frijit Farrah" and "the adventurer" with pre-programmed personalities.
True Company's website is booming: "Roxxxy Gold has as much personality as possible for your personality as possible."
I mean, she loves what you like, she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
They also have their mood in the day, just like real people.
He can be sleepy, willing to talk, or he can be "in full mode."
There are many disturbing sides about the rise of sex robots: not only the replacement of real human relations but the most obedient female personality features, the most intriguing of the rapes that approach Frijit Farah.
On the website, True Company makes Roxxxy look like a vibrator, but for men.
"If she can have a vibrator, why shouldn't men have Roxxxy," she says.
But these sex robots aren't just fetish or sex toys.
Their emergence and growing complexity points to something darker and deeper in our culture, a retreat towards sex lust through the submission of gender equality, an optimal plugin of gender equality.
Many men will naturally not have sex robots, and while the FRR points out their growing popularity, they are now in the outer layers of consumer culture.
But those who leak from the ends can be highly instructive about the course of our time.
Most people are not weird or aggressive until the free market gives them the right to be.
With a president bragging about sexual assault on women in the White House, it's no coincidence these sophisticated sex robots showed up at a time when women's rights are threatened worldwide.
The most creepy part of The Handmaid's Tale TV series is not the depictions, the illustrated bodies, or the carved eyes, but how realistic the image feels.
The Republic of Gilead is a sudden change, but it doesn't feel like such a big change right now.
The goal behind these sex robots is to create as many physical similarities as possible to real women as possible (of course, in the proportion of porn movie stars).
Their creators want them to feel human when they touch and imitate the movements of a real body.
But when it comes to their personality, robots clearly can't represent real women.
They can't leave their wives or leave them.
There are no activities or past stories, nothing to expose their independence or disrupt their total slavery fantasy.
In other words, they're exhilarating slaves.
Or, in the terms of 2017, the concubines.
Assault on the American military convoy: the dead and the wounded...
Foreign military forces operating in the country were targeted in the suicide attack in Kabağak district of Kabul, Afghanistan.
In the explosion that killed 1 NATO soldiers and 3 civilians, the wounded were injured, 5 of the wounded were American soldiers in the convoy, and 1 was a translator working with NATO forces.
The NATO support forces in Afghanistan (Resolite Support) have been detonated by the suicide bomber during a joint patrol with the Afghan National Army.
The injured personnel have been admitted to treatment at Bagram Airport American Military Hospital.
No vital danger to the wounded.
Local media says the suicide bomber is a Taliban member.
Trump's great skill?
To make Mitt Romney look like a common sense.
The micro-scale family division of the political division that polarized the US voters became the reality of the Trump era.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, newspapers in the United States were full of how to deal with the family nightmare that voted for Trump.
We're all trying to blow up our own filtering bubbles.
The less spoken about is Trump's power to bring the families together.
I'm talking about it because my cousin, who lives in Chicago and is a left-handed poet with a bad relationship with the Republicans in our family, is visiting us in New York this week.
It reminded me that joining against a common enemy could be a powerful influence.
Everyone that Trump has known, including his Republican brother, who he's been arguing about politics with in the White House for decades, is suddenly and strangely on the same side.
It's a good thing at the dinner table, of course, but it seems to me that in a broad context, these are the key risks.
Left was played by Trump, but the distortion of his presidency created the power to push to the right for all of me.
When we talk about normalcy and Trump, one day we're talking about the terrible possibility that his strange behavior may not shock anymore.
In fact, there's a more terrifying long-term scenario where Trump "normalizes the right Republicans who oppose their own standards," and all of a sudden they look like a symbol of logic.
I find myself experiencing nostalgia about the bizarre version of Mitt Romney's madness: the dog on the roof of the car, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like), which is very light crimes for Trump.
When Trump is gone, the next Republican candidate must only be sane to assess that he has achieved unmeasurable progress.
When my cousin was in town, we took our kids to the carousel in Central Park, the biggest and the best three bucks you could spend in the city if you don't need caffeine and carousel run by the New York Parks Department.
The horses are huge, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder (all the clowns and animals that make strange faces turn to look at their shoulders with fear), and the music that rattles is strangely exciting.
In other words, most of the clichés of a city can be disappointing: the views of high buildings are starting to sound boring, the horizon begins to become too familiar to create too much excitement, and the reality of the city does not reach its fall.
Thirty-five years ago, and I still haven't been able to overcome the day when I discovered that Swiss Cottage was a large circle in North London, not actually a Swiss country house.
However, the merry-go-round in Central Park is still a strange magical experience, so that two people, one 11-year-old, and two women in their 40s can go here and they can all have a very good time.
If I could give a note to the merry-go-round, I'd give him a full note, but thank God no one asked.
On the other hand, before I passed my credit card at a bonmarchet this week, I was asked to assess my "process experience" between 1 and 5 stars.
Same thing at the coffee shop on the corner of my soda, and the option to match the note to a 15% tip, for what was bought from the counter...
The effect of this is not only that it slows down what needs to be a neutral trade, but that the server is pressing to create a personality for an event that has no need.
While the poor woman in Bonmarch stood up and grinning like an apology, I gave her five stars in my experience of giving credit cards to her hand.
When the temperature went up to 41 degrees, they wore the bathing suits.
In Tunceli, where one of the hottest days of the season, the people rushed to Munzur beaches.
From noon to noon, when the temperatures had been repressed, the young, young, old, women and men who entered the beaches by Munzur tea tried to cool off in icy waters and protect themselves from the heat.
The beaches on the side of Munzur tea were filled with beaches, especially because Turkish citizens living in countries such as Germany, Holland, France and England spent their holidays in their homes instead of Ege or the Mediterranean.
"I didn't want to spend my vacation in the West, cooling off in Munzur, staying in our own land," said Suna Tosun, among those who cool down at Munzur Beach.
"Munzur's icy water is nowhere in the world, and at these temperatures, Munzur is cooling us off."
Hasan High, who came from Germany, said they preferred Munzur tea in Tunceli instead of the Fountain or the Basement Coast, and that's why they don't regret it.
Oscar Pistorius was taken from prison to the hospital with chest pains.
This is the second time Pistorius left the prison for a hospital visit.
Last year, he was taken to the hospital to treat the cuts on his wrists, which he said occurred after he fell in prison officials' cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after an accidental protest against the previous decision to kill a man by the prosecutors.
In the early days of Valentine's Day 2013, he killed Steenkamp at his house in Pretoria, shooting several times towards the door of a toilet cabinet.
Pistorius claimed to have mixed his girlfriend up with someone who was hiding in his cabin who broke in at night.
Prosecutors have announced that they intend to object once again to the six-year sentence of Pistorius, which they think is very light this time.
The National Evasive Mercii said he would object to the South African Supreme Court, and the objection can be evaluated this year.
Pistorius will face 15 years of punishment if prosecutors succeed.
There's no death penalty in South Africa.
The first pilgrimage has been announced
Haji candidates to Saudi Arabia, with the organisation of the Directorate of Dioranet Affairs, were sent to the Atatürk Airport Foreign Line Terminal with prayers and tears.
Before the move of the first pilgrimage, citizens and nearly 200 pilgrims attended the ceremony at the Foreign Line Terminal, as well as relatives.
On the other hand, Turkish Airlines (THY) has delivered roses to pilgrims who fly on a plane to holy land.
The Hac caravan in Ankara was released from Esanbull.
In Kafile, there were also martyrs and veterans who took advantage of the application of "unruly pilgrimage" for the first time this year for veterans and martyrs.
Two Bulgarian arrested in Greece for illegal camping
Two Bulgarians were arrested in Greece for illegal camping, according to the State Department's statement and BTV quoted.
A group of illegal campers, including two Bulgarians, were arrested by police on the morning of August 1st in Sithonia.
They were left on the same day as the investigation continued.
The foreign ministry reported to BTV that Bulgarians were later released.
Greek authorities have tightened their control over camping for free and are still serving serious penalties for those caught resting in undivided places for that purpose.
The controls will last through the season.
The ministry said the court could file a sentence.
We're not going back to Holland until we find him.
JOEY Hoffman (22) went to Turkey to travel with two friends in early July.
Joey Hoffman, who drove Adana and Mersin in their rental car, disappeared in Silifke on July 8th.
His friends, who he came with, couldn't reach Hoffman despite all the calls, informed his family in Holland.
As the police moved to find the missing tourist, his brother Robin Hoffman and his friends Angelo Durei went to Jaimy Gewald Adana.
_
Robin Hoffman, who applied to the police here, pressed missing flyers to find her brother, handing them out in Adana and Mersin.
The last time they heard from Robin Hoffman's brother on July 8th, he said, "We applied to the police in Holland first."
Then two of my friends came to Turkey and we applied to the police here.
So far, we haven't heard anything, and we haven't found a clue.
"We will stay in Turkey until my brother is found," he said.
Second of all, congratulations to Ayşe Ceren from the minister.
At the 2017 Palette Swimming Youth Championship in Russia, the national athlete Ayşe Ceren Greenhead became the second world over 400 metres of water.
Youth and Sports Minister Osman congratulated Ayşe Ceren Yeşilbak, who won a silver medal with the message published by Love.
On the first day of the 2017 Palette Swimming Youth Championship in Russia, Ceren Greenhead became the second world over 400 meters of water.
Ceren took his place in the second row with eight finalists, while taking his place with only 27 sales of gold.
In 400 meters, Elena Lopatina from Russia won the gold medal at 03.18.73 minutes, while Ceren won the silver medal at 3.1900.
Turkey represents eight men and eight women athletes in the championship.
His last words were, "I think I'm dying, goodbye, mother."
"I don't want to die, Mom, it's not fair," among those who died in the GrenFell Tower fire in London, which has been announced to be 30 so far.
"Thank you for everything you've done for me," said the Italian Gloria Trevisan and her lover.
Among the dozens that were unheard of after the fire were Gloria Trevisan, 26, who lived on the 23rd floor of the 24-story building, and her Italian lover Marco Gottardi.
Maria Cristina Sandri, the lawyer of the Trevisan family that lives north of Italy, has announced that both young men have lost their lives, according to their information from the British authorities.
The lawyer, who said the young families were suffering a great deal, also asked journalists not to insist on making a statement about it.
I think I'm dying. Bye, Mom.
Attorney Sandri said Gloria called her mother Emanuela Trevisan on her cell phone shortly after the fire came out, and she cried herself when she heard these last conversations your mother recorded.
According to this, Gloria Trevisan spoke to her mother several times over the two hours after the fire started at around 1: 00 local time.
"Mom, bad things are happening here, there's a fire."
We're stuck, we can't get out.
There's some smoke, but don't worry, we're waiting to be saved.
"We tried to open the door, but there was too much smoke and the elevator wasn't working."
After the fire grew, the last words of Gloria Trevisan grew concerned were:
Mom, my whole life goes by my eyes.
I think I'm dying.
I had a life ahead of me; it's not fair.
I don't want to die, and I want to help you financially.
I'm sorry I won't be able to hug you again.
Thank you for everything you've done for me. Bye, Mom.
I'm going to heaven now and I'm going to help you out of it.
This is the fault of the Italian government.
Both trained in architecture, Gloria Trevisan and her boyfriend Marco Gottardi, had trouble getting a job after graduating last year, moved from the Veneto region north to London in March.
Gloria Trevisan, who had only found 300 euros paid jobs in her country, soon began to work in a business with 1800 pounds a month (about 2060 euros) in London.
"Gloria went to London to help her family."
Unfortunately, our young people have to leave the country to save their future and find a job.
"The government must resolve this problem immediately," he said.
The drama of Italy, which can't provide jobs for its young.
And Gloria's father Loris Trevisan said, "This is the fault of our government, which forced our young people to flee abroad to find a job."
The unemployment rate in Italy reaches 12 per cent, while the rate between young people is over 40 per cent.
In addition to increasing this problem, many Italian young people have begun to migrate to many European countries, especially England.
Only last year, the number of young people who had to leave Italy because of unemployment was over 110 grand.
The Italian media commented on the certainty of Gloria Trevisan and Marco Gottardi's death news, saying it was the drama of a country that could not provide jobs for their young.
Red meat, dairy and chocolate can ease IBiH
Sounds like a nightmare for your red meat and chocolate digestive system.
But a new study claims the opposite: a rich diet of meat-based protein and dairy products can help alleviate symptoms of those suffering from inflammatory intestinal disease.
1.3 million in the United States and 300,000 people in the United Kingdom are affected by untreatable health conditions, stomach cramps and swelling, recurring or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Although it is often recommended that patients skip meat and milk products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at the University of Washington found that protein helps develop immune cells that develop a strong intestine.
Chief researcher Dr. Marco Colonna said immune cells patrol the intestines so that microbes hiding at dinner don't sneak into the body.
The cells that are capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that protect sensitive tissue without harm.
If the balance goes too far towards inflammation, the inflammation can be caused by intestinal disease.
Experiments found some kind of immune cell that encouraged stamina in rats carrying specific bacteria in their intestines.
And bacteria need triptofene, which is one of the building blocks of protein to trigger the release of cells.
Professor Colonna: 'We have connected with the development of the cell population that encourages endurance with the species of bacteria, which is part of the intestinal microbioma.'
Rats with more triptofan in their diet had more of these immune cells. '
If the same thing happens in humans, he said that a richer diet in terms of L. Reuteri and triptofan could develop a more resistant, less inflammatory intestinal environment.
While Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas was working on some kind of immune cell that developed resilience, she discovered that a group of experimental rats had these kinds of cells, but another group of people who were held in a different place.
He suspected that the difference was related to rats' intestinal microbes, or the bacteria, viruses and fungi communities that normally live in the stomach-bowel canal.
The rats' intestines had a DNA sequence, and the rats with immune cells found that six species of bacteria were missing, but they weren't.
Since they were looked at in a sterile environment, rats who lack a bowel microbial and do not develop this type of immune cell have been given L reuters and their immune cells have emerged.
To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, researchers raised L. Reuteri in liquid, and then transferred him to less than this liquid, which is not bacteria to the immature immune cells taken from rats.
The immune cells have become the cells that encourage resilience.
The active component turned out to be a byproduct of the triptofan metabolism known as indol-3-lactic acid when it was removed from liquid.
When researchers doubled the amount of triptofan in the mice 'nutrients, the number of cells increased by about 50 per cent, but when the triptofan levels were lowered by half, the number of cells fell in half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan said that people have cells that encourage the same resilience as rats and that most of us have L reuters in the stomach-bowel canal.
Triptofan products from L. Reuteri are not known to develop as in mice in humans, but the disorders in the genes related to triptofan are found in people with inflammatory intestinal disease.
"The development of these cells is probably something we'd like to encourage because these cells control the inflammation of the intestine.
Potentially, the high-level triptofan causes the spread of this population in cases where L. Reuteri exists. "
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United signed a genius with Nemanja Matic.
After his first game against Sampdoria on Wednesday night, Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United signed a "genius" with Nemanja Matic.
The transfer of £40 million from Chelsea began with a 2-1 win in Dublin before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday at the last season game of United, and filled with the position of Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira in which he was in charge.
However, Matic, who was left out on the pre-season Asian tour, had a serious game contract short, and he only took 45 minutes; he confessed that this should be improved before the start of the Mourinho Premier League season.
"He needs a valley, but his experience, his intelligence, his thinking genius... he's thinking about football," he said.
"We'll help him get ready sooner."
As Mourinho began to shape the first 11 for the beginning of the season, like Matic, his new transfer friends Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku de Aviva Stadium.
The Independent found out that Mourinho still wants three more transfers this week, but the club has already insisted that he perform three of his four top transfers and does an "extraordinary job."
"I thank the club for taking three out of four," he added.
"I'd be happier if they took four out of four, but they made a great effort for me."
Last year 197 people were sent to the hospital
According to the ISVEC Social Welfare Agency data, the diagnosis of gender discontent for 1 person in 2005 increased to 8 in 2015.

The British inventor put himself on a microchip to get into his house and car with a hand move.
A British inventor became the first person to hang out with a microchip in the country to open his front door, access his office and even run his car with just one hand move.
Steven Northam (33) transferred the tiny chip between his thumb and his finger, and he's offering this service to people and his company BioTeq, who want to make their lives easier with technology.
To ensure that the implant procedure could be implemented in medical standards, Winchester joined Dr. Geoff Watson, a consultant anesthesiologist at Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Hants.
Technology is similar to the microchip transferred to cats and dogs, and it only lasts 30 seconds.
Mr. Northam's company will also change the locks in houses and vehicles, 300 pounds a lock to match the chip.
This technology is stuck in the house and BMW Z4 of the man who's married and has a child's father, and his car works while his hands are behind the wheel.
The White House Show has cost the taxpayers thousands
According to the TIME military records, the White House's decision to fly a Marine helicopter to the southern grass last month for an organization that led to American production cost taxpayers $24,000.
When the president arrived, the green and white Sikorsky VH-3D, also known as Marine One, was the center of attention in the organization that introduced American construction programmes in the White House on July 17th.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officers have traveled through products produced throughout 50 states.
The helicopter in Connecticut, a yacht from Main, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi.
According to the records of Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the White House Bureau requested the presence of the helicopter with an exclusive order (FRAGO) only 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the southern lawn for the "unusual" organization.
The commander of HMX-1 sent an e-mail to the Marine Corps Aviation Commander the day before the organization, saying, "I just wanted to make sure you were aware because this is an unusual high-visibility organization."
The message said that the helicopter would come to the southern grass at around 7: 00 p.m. for the 3: 00 in the afternoon and will remain there until the grass is cleared between 6: 00 and 9: 00 p.m.
The note added that if the exit from the White House is delayed, a second flight team will be required for the return flight due to the time limit.
While unit security personnel were on the ground, the original flight crew was in the helicopter during the organization.
From the records provided to the TIME, a second flight crew can't tell whether or not it's necessary.
The Hatch Act forbids federal employees to use state property for political purposes.
Records show that HMX-1 investigated whether the organization violated that condition.
"A question we asked was whether or not he violated the Hatch Code and we were told not to."
"Looks like you're locked up," the Deputy Commander answered.
The "Made in America" organization has been designated an official organization by the White House and does not include the Hatch Act.
But even official organizations have political implications.
In the organisation, the president then addressed the ongoing health care reform efforts in the Senate and praised the efforts to regulate government regulations.
Using aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One is not exactly a new event for politically favourable purposes.
The presidents have to use them to travel.
But it's unusual for them to be officially used for a chance to take a picture.
In February, Trump noted that the presidential plane went behind the stage of the first campaign rally in Melbourne Florida and that the predecessor of the Twitter account was full of messages about the use of the presidential plane.
"The White House is excited about the 'Made in America' exhibition, where there are products made by American workers from all 50 states," said Deputy White House press spokesman Lindsay Walters.
The HMX-1 crew often takes training flights in the Washington area and exercises to leave the President of the United States in the south grass with a point-blank shot at the White House.
While Trump was in Germany for the G-20 summit at the beginning of July, HMX-1 performed 58 exercises at the White House.
An official said the flight for the Made in America organization was considered the need for the air crew to train within that month.
Unit helicopters flew for additional 11 hours that day for "support missions that had nothing to do with the presidency."
The White House said the taxpayers didn't charge for any other number involved in the organization.
A spokesman from Sikorksky said their companies did not participate in the arrangement of the launch of the helicopter in the southern grass.
HMX-1 does not keep budget records for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost by the organisation.
But according to the DOD's hourly rate for 2017 financial years, the DOD's rate of meeting VH-3D is $24.340 per flight hour.
Unit records record the flight time of the air transport from Marine Corp Air Faculty Quantico Virginia for 30 minutes to both sides.
The White House claims that the real business cost of the helicopter is far below that.
"It is very tricky to make a profit based on the estimates of tax taxpayers," Walters said.
"This ratio estimates the cost of sinking within personnel, care and annual expenses."
According to a RAND research in 2015, the DOD costs do not include personnel costs, but includes fuel, maintenance and contract expenses.
At the time, former White House press spokesman Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter for this organization.
"The idea here is to display things done in America this week," Spicer said.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of their contributions to our national security, and I think that even without thousands, hundreds of people's jobs depend on it.
And I think we're all proud of the helicopters and other military equipment that many Americans like most Americans have worked so hard to make.
Therefore, of course, it is appropriate to bring it forward. "
It's not clear if Trump was interacting with the helicopter while traveling the southern grass for the organization, but he stepped into the driver's seat of a fire truck.
In the White House, Trump joked with the media about the company products in his own fleet and called to Sikorsky representatives.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said, "I have three of them."

The investment in McVitie's Glasgow factory concerns GMB
A union wants to be assured that a long-term commitment to production in Glasgow by the directors of the biscuit manufacturer McVitie's.
GMB Scotland said the company remained silent about the future of investment in the Tollcross region.
In addition to other products, more than 500 people work in the factory where Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits are produced.
Pladis, owner of McVitie's, said they've invested more than 5 million pounds in the region over the past few years.
If their operations change, employees and union representatives will be "first informed."
In a letter to the company's plant manager, the GMB demanded that Scotland, McVitie's, "no funds are being provided for modernisation of production bands."
"It concerns our members deeply that we cannot see any clarity about business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross," GMB senior organizer Drew Duffy said.
For generations, families work here, and are heavily employed in local society and in the suburbs of Glasgow, the critical basis for sufficient employment in a field of high unemployment and social absence.
According to the work, salary and prosperity perspective, Brexit needs an immediate production presence in the eastern tip of Glasgow's McVitie, against increased living costs and chronic production reduction. "
"The facility manager at Tollcross received a letter from Scotland yesterday and the company will respond directly because we value our commitment to workers and union representatives.
At Tollcross two months ago, we had a regular meeting with employees and representatives of the GMB, where a few problems were clearly discussed.
So we've told our employees that we've been constantly reviewing our operations, like all companies who work in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic environment, to stay competitive, which is valid for all our jobs and facilities.
"In recent years, we have invested more than 5 million pounds in the Tollcross facility, especially production bands and operational development.
We know Tollcross's legacy as a production facility, and if there is any change in our operations at the facility, the employees and their union representatives will be the first to know. "
Necip and Utku are four more years in Beşiktaş
The Beşiktaş Club extended the contract of Necip Civilized and Utku Yavakurak for four years.
The Turkish Football Federation (TFF) included data on football players on the website, while Beşiktaş extended contracts with two players until 31 May 2021.
Necip, who grew up in the infrastructure of the black-and-white team and made his first professional contract on June 19, 2008, began wearing a jersey for the 2009-2010 season.
Up to team captain, the 1991-born player played in a total of 254 official games with the Besiktaş form.
The TFF website also noted that Besiktaş's contract was signed until 31 May 2021, last season, with the bonus of the goalkeeper Utku Yuvayak, who was hired to join the staff.

Did the PSG warn Barcelona three years ago about Neymar's departure?
The La Liga side may regret their interest in Marco Verratti.
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up his pursuit of Neymar after offering an offer to activate the 189 million-pound release clause, but did they warn Barcelona to publish a world record three years ago?
As the League 1 team was ready to break more than twice the world transfer record for Paul Pogba's return to Manchester United last season for £89 million, the sensational offer moved the summer transfer period.
With the PSG offering 500,000 pounds a week after taxes, Neymar will be the most expensive player in the world and will also be the most profitable professional athlete in the world when the transfer is completed.
Although a source close to the Katalans' administration insisted that the club had always done its best to keep an eye on him from coming from Santos in 2013, Barcelona was known to be angry about the proposal and the way Neymar tried to break up.
So, was the football world warned by the PSG president about this landscape three years ago?
When Manchester City expressed his interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelehii gave a harsh warning to all clubs who wanted to sign one of PSG's top players.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we'll be against them, we'll contact their players," Al-Khelehii said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to get one of our players to sign, they will suffer the consequences. "
At the beginning of this summer, the Spanish club Barcelona appeared to have crossed that line by expressing its interest in PSG middle-field player Marco Verratti.
The PSG has indicated that they will not allow the Italian nation to leave on any condition, and Barcelona feels strongly about losing Neymar from its greatest values.
The punishment for preventing the reading of the raft has been broken
The defendants, who were allegedly trying to stand up to Şeşce Gültepe Mosque Imam Mustafa Baki, who read and selah, were allegedly trying to stop him from being a member of Kenan Gülshen and Nait Yilmaz, but were not a member of the organization, "deliberately and willingly helping the organisation," for the charges of "resisting" and "insulting."
He was tried by the High Criminal Court.
According to the defendant's complaint against Gülshen for "defaming the public official for his duty," the court has sentenced him to $7,000 in fines, and the defendant Yilmaz, who has been prevented from doing it for a year, considering the importance of the crime date and the time of Turkey's future, for which he has sentenced him to "not to do the job."

By the Heavy Criminal Court, when the defendant Nait Yilmaz reads and leaves the mosque with the imam Mustafa Baki, he says, "You are neither a pitchfork nor a flood, but you are putting people out on the street."
The president has been taken.
"This is over," he said, saying, "This is over." He stated that his actions, which he tried to hit, were made up of "resisting" because of the fact that the victim imam had been unable to read the grain and the salad that he had to read at certain intervals.
Although the local court has stated the reasons for the action have been carried out and the victim has been informed before the mosque, the agency has said that in a concrete case, there is no mission that the victim has begun or continued, and that the defendant has not been charged with creating an attempt to hurt the victim because of his public duty, and that the victim has been forced to prevent further duties.
The defendant's lack of criminal record, the circle explaining that the victim had no concrete financial damage, said that the moral damage would not prevent him from implementing the dismissal of the sentence and that the victim had given up his complaint.
The defendant, Nait Yilmaz's lawyer's attorney, saw that the verdict against the defendant has been broken and the file has been extradited to the first degree of court.
