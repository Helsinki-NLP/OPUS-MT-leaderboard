28-year-old cook found dead at San Francisco Mall
A 28-year-old cook who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local mall this week.
However, the victim's brother said he didn't think he could be someone who wanted to hurt him. He said, "In the end, things were going well for him."
San Francisco Coroner's Office said the body found at Westfield Mall Wednesday morning belonged to a 28-year-old resident of San Francisco, Frank Galicia.
San Francisco Police Department reported that the cause of death was murder and that the investigations were ongoing.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously worked as a kitchen chef in Boston, began working as the head of the San Francisco Sons & Daughters kitchen department six months ago.
The Sons & Daughters official said that this death "makes them shocked and deeply sad."
"We are a small team working here like a tight family, and he will be very missed," he said.
In this difficult time, we would like to point out to Frank's family that they are not alone and that our prayers are with them.
Louis Galicia stated that Frank had stayed at the hostels at the beginning and said, "It was finally going well for him."
Louis Galicia said to KGO, "He had an apartment and he was dating a girl."
Louis Galicia said he didn't think there was anyone who might want to hurt his younger brother.
He was a kind person with a big heart.
The way to bond with the family was to always make us a plate, to cook for us," said Louis Galicia.
He didn't like to argue.
My brother would adapt to any situation.
He said, "When everything else in the world went wrong, it was that uncut diamond that glowed every day."

Assistant doctors on strike: New call for work slowdowns
Representatives of assistant doctors have asked their unions to allow them to slow down work in connection with a dispute over a new contract.
The British Medical Association (BMA) Assistant Doctors' Committee (JDC) has called on the general council to support more work-slowing action from the beginning of September.
JDC said the ministers could not resolve concerns about the contract.
The assistant doctors and medical students voted against the contract with BMA.
This was rejected by 58% of the voters.
In an article published on Twitter Thursday night, JDC chief Ellen McCourt said the government remained "silently silent" about the problems causing the contract to be rejected.
"In light of this, the JDC Board voted to completely reject the proposed new contract and called for an official debate on concerns again," he said.
In response to the government's silence, the JDC administration has made an official request to allow the BMA Council to allow a programme to increase business slowdown from the beginning of September.
The dispute led residents to participate in six strikes this year, including the first total cuts in NHS history.
Dr. Johann Malawana, the assistant doctor at BMA, resigned after BMA had voted against the terms of the contract.
During meetings before 54,000 residents and medical students voted, he told the members of the BMA that it was a good deal to accept.
Following the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said the contract would be implemented in a way that applies to doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: An alliance of incompatibles?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met Tuesday to announce the official end of the eight-month war with words and economic sanctions.
However, Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish counterpart in the fancy hall of St. Petersburg Palace, and I was under the impression that Ankara was the one who wanted this compromise most.
Shake hands, yeah.
However, Mr. Putin's smile was very weak, and his own limited standards were not exactly spreading any warmth.
On the contrary, Recep Tayyip Erdogan has repeatedly mentioned his "good friend" Mr Putin, five times according to one report.
I've lost count.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to a pre-crisis level, but to a much higher level.
The next day, a newspaper here reported that Mr. Erdogan acted as if nothing bad had happened.
I think his excitement showed the opposite.
However, Mr. Putin's cold impressions have shown that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the first thing he mentioned at the opening was the crisis: Turkey shot down a Russian fighter on the Syrian border.
At the time, Russia's reaction was full of rage.
Mr. Putin accused Ankara of stabbing Moscow in the back by making a strong exit.
The resentment was much greater, thought to be friendly.
Trust will be hard to rebuild, perhaps impossible.
The Russian people have also changed their minds since November.
For months, the state-controlled media targeted Ankara in a shocking and aggressive manner.
Suddenly, the Turks are to blame for everything.
The most serious of these were accusations of high-ranking officials that Mr. Erdogan's family had profited from illegal oil trade in areas under the control of the so-called Islamic State in Syria.
He denied it for sure.
But the official message from St. Petersburg was that it was time to move on.
After all, the reason for this meeting was that Mr. Putin received the apology he had requested from President Erdogan.
Russia might see it as some kind of victory.
The benefits of calling for a truce for Ankara are clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs friends after a failed coup last month that almost brought him down.
Repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have also affected him greatly.
And economic reasons are also effective.
Russia's sanctions hit hard, especially the ban on private expeditions that carry several million Russian tourists to Turkey's coastal regions every year.
That number has dropped by almost 90%.
In Russia, tour operators and rental companies were certainly relieved that the flights would continue.
They're counting on the end-of-season density in the Mediterranean.
And this week, state television predicts a reduction in fruit and vegetable prices as Turkish agricultural products are allowed again.
To quote a story in the Vedamosti newspaper, "Tourists there, tomatoes here."
However, the visit had a different political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West that it is not satisfied with the response to the coup attempt.
Mr. Putin, who wants Turkey's ties to the West and to benefit from the coldness, is also being added by long-time anger over the progress of talks on joining the United States at the speed of snails.
The Russian leader is clearly sympathetic to Ankara for calling for support of elected officials following the coup attempt.
Let's not forget, this was an inevitable attitude for Moscow, which had a profound fear of regime change.
This summit, held in this flashy palace by the sea, represents an "incompatible alliance" that Russia and Turkey have explained to me by an analyst: the two countries that the West rejects and behave badly join forces.
Yet, despite this display of reconciliation, they are quite different from each other.
One of the most important things about Syria: Russia and Turkey support different sides, although Moscow considers itself a mediator.
After nearly three hours of first talks, the two presidents say that the issue was not mentioned at the press conference.
While Turkey's President clearly avoided answering a question about these differences, Mr. Putin chose to highlight them.
There is no clear consensus on how to determine the common ground in Syria.
But after months of open hostility -- and given the absolute disaster potential of Turkey's shooting down a Russian fighter -- it's certainly a good development when two leaders at least start talking.
The Royal Bank of Scotland is disappearing for customers outside Scotland.
According to the president of the bank's executive board, the RBS brand will move into the back office position.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be destroyed for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told the BBC Scotland that the RBS brand is linked to the bank's global goals.
Eight years ago, he had to withdraw and give up because he was almost in a sinking state.
During that time, brand strategists used RBS to protect other consumer financial brands.
This was supported by millions of pounds for sponsorships from the Six Nations rugby championship to the Wimbledon Andy Murray champion.
However, it has now been decided that it is appropriate for more national brands to step forward.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used by Scottish customers, but no new beginnings will be made.
In England and Wales, all references to RBS will be changed to NatWest, except for the status of central and stock markets.
The Ulster Bank is already used for clients in the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland.
There are smaller brands that will be much more dominant for individual banking; Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr. McEwan gave an interview on a tour of Inverness-shire for customers and staff.
The BBC told Scotland: "Since from now on we will be a bank of more brands, the RBS brand will no longer be our brand of investors and staff employed."
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
It's not global anymore, I'm saying we have local targets.
Each of these brands will come forward in a slightly different way in his community, and our staff will work under the names of the customers and these brands.
RBS announced that the Six Nations Championships would not continue to sponsor and that different brands were improving their profile on sports sponsorship.
"It is time for us to start understanding the brand bank (we were asking ourselves) because how can we make it a better bank for customers?" he said.
Three years ago, I would have found it ironic if we had stated that we would be a great bank for our clients and that we would be presenting these brands.
But I think you're going to see a lot of changes in the work that we're doing, and not in ourselves, but in the way that we're focusing on the needs of customers.
We can reboot these brands, so I think this is the right time.
Frankie Dettori won the 3000th victory in Newmarket with Prediction.
Dettori popped champagne after his 3000th victory with a double success in Newmarket.
The jockey Frankie Dettori won his 3000th victory in England in Newmarket on Friday.
At the local track, he won the second victory of the night with prediction, trained by John Gosden, reaching this milestone.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach this milestone in the Unstoppable Run.
Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
"It's a special occasion," said the jockey, who previously won three championships in Ghayyar.
I'm so touched that my parents are here.
I'm really happy that this is Newmarket, where I started 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not a Royal Ascot -- it's just another Friday night with 20,000 people.
I feel relaxed and relaxed.
Dettori accepted the cheers by bringing Predilection after victory.
In the obstacle course, there were two jockeys who reached this milestone: the champion, Richard Johnson, and the 20-time champion and retired jockey, Sir Anthony McCoy, who won over 4400 in his record-filled career.
Lester Piggott, who won the Derby nine times, has 4493 victories in his career.
Frankie is one of the greatest jockeys of our time, and it's not surprising that only a few people have reached a milestone before him.
He's a man of style and power, but the key to the scale is his tactical mentality.
He represents the race of horses in an extraordinary way, and with his excitement and charisma, he's drawn people to this sport for years.
A few weeks ago, at Epsom, I told Frankie that if he wasn't just a jockey racing on weekends and big races, he might have made his 6000th victory.
To be serious, Frankie spent most of his 30 years in the UK with victories, which is great to see.
He's a very exciting character, and that's a very good quality for English racing, but beyond that, he's an extraordinary jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated this milestone as a symbol of a jump-off from the horse.
Frankie Dettori has been a symbol of British unstoppable running for 20 years, with many moves from the races he's been jumping from horses to landings.
It was a bumpy road.
In 1996, he survived a plane crash and was banned from following a drug ban, while winning several major races, including the famous 'Big Seven' victory in Ascot.
Three years ago, during the return of these six months of suspension, he suffered initially, but showed that he had the strong character needed to wrong those who suspected him and return to his best self.
And it could go on for a while; Dettori had already stated that he wanted to continue competing until he was at least 50 years old.
Russian President Putin dismissed his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly relieved his chief of staff, Sergei Ivanov.
Mr. Ivanov was part of Mr. Putin's close circle of trust for many years.
At 63, he has now been appointed special representative for environmental and transport issues.
In a statement from the Kremlin, Mr. Putin stated that "Ivanov has decided to terminate his position as Russian executive," but no reason was given.
Anton Vaino, who has been acting as proxy for this position since 2012, has been assigned to Mr Ivanov.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in Tallinn, Estonia in 1972, he graduated from the International Relations (MGIMO) department of the well-known Moscow State Institute and served at the Tokyo embassy.
Later, he was interested in presidential protocol and management of government personnel; this is the expression on the Kremlin website (Russian).
After his appointment, he told Mr. Putin: "Thank you for trusting me."
I think the administration's most important task is to support your activities as head of state in terms of enforcing law and monitoring the implementation of instructions.
On Friday, Mr. Putin announced to the Russian television station that he had asked Mr. Ivanov to step down and recommended Mr. Vaino to take his place.
Are the smiles convincing?
This is an astonishing move in Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov had been working as one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies for a long time, and Soviet security forces like him had served the KGB.
As a chief of staff, he was one of the most powerful people in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin on public television, they both stated that the chief of staff had voluntarily resigned.
However, despite the smiling poses given to the cameras, few are convinced of this, especially at this time of the parliamentary elections.
Is this a disagreement stemming from some kind of power struggle?
No one knows that yet.
However, the official statement that a person who could become president suddenly wanted to direct Russia's environmental policy was met with great doubt.
According to a quote from the Kremlin website, Mr. Ivanov made this statement to Mr. Putin: "It is true that I want you to trust me for four years for this challenge -- or even problematic -- in a conversation in early 2012.
Well, it looks like I served four years, eight months as chief of staff.
Mr. Ivanov took over this mission in December 2011.
He had previously served as deputy prime minister and defence minister.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB state security forces, such as Mr Putin.
In the late 1990s, Mr. Putin served as head of the Federal Security Forces (FSB), replacing the KGB, while Mr. Ivanov gave him power of attorney.
When Mr. Putin came to power, he made Ivanov one of the five people he trusted most.
Since Mr. Putin's presidency was unconstitutional in the third term, Mr. Ivanov was thought to be president after Mr. Putin's second term.
However, this mission was transferred to another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Mr. Putin became Prime Minister three and a half years later, before returning to the presidency.
Thomas Gibson, star of Criminal Minds, was fired after hitting the producer.
Gibson was involved in a physical altercation last month on the set of your show in Los Angeles.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, producing the show, announced in a joint statement that they had fired him.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, published an apology on Tuesday prior to the annulment announcement.
There were differences and disagreements about creative issues on the set.
"I regret that such an event has happened," he said in a statement.
In a statement by ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, the character Gibson plays will be given detailed information on how to remove it from the program following a group of FBI agents.
The 54-year-old actor, previously part of the Dharma & Greg sitcom, has been on the show since the first season in 2005.
Gibson said in a statement published on Friday, "I love Criminal Minds, and for the past 12 years, I've worked with him, giving him my heart and soul."
I'd like to stay until the end, but that's not possible anymore.
I just want to thank the writers, the producers, the actors, our great team, and most importantly, the best supporters a program could have.
The programme is expected to return to the screens on September 28th for the 12th season.
The mystery of the fish in the Banff garden
A person living in the Banff region applied for help to identify fish that appeared in Banff's garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 fish may be sand fish carried by a sea hose.
Bain, who lives 500m from the sea, published the images on Periscope, hoping that someone could shed light on the arrival of two inches of fish.
Queensferry Pass: The bridge is now connected to Fife
The project worth £1.35 billion must be completed by May 2017
Engineers have merged north of Queensferry Pass and the viaduct, which means the bridge is now connected to Fife.
This is the first of the four closings between the "contamination fans" that are about to be completed around each of the three towers of the bridge.
The bridge's cut from Fife is 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It consists of 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 support cables.
The project worth £1.35 billion must be completed by May 2017.
Economy Minister Keith Brown visited the facilities today and became one of the first to walk from land to bridge.
He said: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Pass.
We're all witnessing an epic scale of engineering using over 30,000 tons of concrete to build just this part of the bridge.
Despite the extraordinary size and weight of the bridge that covers the gap between the viaduct and the bridge table, this is a delicate study that requires extremely sensitive tolerances for harmony.
In general, almost 79% of the total bridge table is in place, and the concrete cast of the first section of the table will be held today in Rosyth, which means the entire table will be ready to be raised on the bridge.
"In all bridge projects, the first closure is always an important milestone, " said Michael Martin, director of the Forth Pass and Bridge Contractors project.
In this extraordinary project, this closure represents pioneering in civil engineering.
We had to seal the gap on the north side, or the land side, after the last highway was placed and connected to the expanding North Tower level.
This was done when the north viaduct retreated about 700 millimeters south.
It was a very big, but also a very delicate procedure.
The reason it's big is because it's 222 meters long, weighs almost 6,000 tons, and has to be drawn at about 3%.
And the reason why it's sensitive is because the team's tolerance levels are so low that they need to match only a few millimeters on either side.
Fortunately, everything went well.
Moelfre Bay rescue team: Three men are lucky to be alive.
Three men were "lucky to survive" after they fell off a fishing boat in Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI lifeboat station set off an alarm Friday at 13:20 p.m. at British summer hour, following the crew's sighting of the case in the Gulf of Moelfre.
The three men were struggling to swim into a secure area while their boats continued on their own.
"We saw the boat going in circles towards them, and we got worried," said Moelfre, captain of the lifeboat control.
"It was fortunate that he had gone away with strong winds until we were on our way to them."
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third 60-year-old man was found exhausted holding onto a buoy without a life jacket.
They were all taken to the lifeboat, which was headed ashore, and brought to the lifeboat station.
Mr. Jones said: "Three men who fell into the water are lucky to be alive and unscathed.
There was an emergency-stop cable on the boat engine, but when the boat capsized, it must have been severed from whoever was driving the boat.
Someone was watching these three men today.
A valuable kind of hunting for health and happiness, Pokémon Go
It's amazing to see how the world has changed.
The fact that young people and children no longer go out to play, prefer to spend their free time looking at screens was a situation most people have been sad over the past decade.
Pokemon Go encourages people to get off the couch and move.
The time spent looking at screens has spread over time to video games and finally to smartphones, especially when it was limited to television.
So it's really great to see that technology and moving around in the open air aren't the elements that exclude each other.
Of course, I'm talking about Pokémon Go, which was originally created for video games in the '90s, based on characters based on cartoons, playing cards and other side products.
Like many phenomena of popular culture, this new game was stirring when it was presented in the United States, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
Later, the presentation was postponed in other countries due to intense interest in servers that caused the overload.
Within days, Pokémon reached more users than Go Tinder and almost the same number of users as Twitter.
So how does it work?
In short, players take their smartphones, go looking for Pokémon, followed by GPS, and can take pictures of what they find (by taking screenshots on the phone) or "catch them."
A generation playing the game at a younger age left the couch to join the madness.
In the United States, the game has given a significant increase in the number of steps a person takes every day.
Cardiogram, an app developed for Apple Watch, followed by 35,000 users, said the number of people he followed within two days of being presented to the Washington Post increased from 45 per cent to 53 per cent every day.
The company doesn't know who plays Pokémon Go; it can only see raw data at the level of exercise.
Most public health campaigns, which encourage people to "take 30 minutes off the couch" and "to be active every day," have been ignored because most public health messages are boring and seem to be delivered by people who seem to be miserable.
But the importance of exercise, however, is minimal.
The probability of cancer or depression decreases for people who exercise regularly.
It provides assistance in matters such as exercise, weight control, high blood pressure, and diabetes, and has a list of advantages that are too long to be listed here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that he takes people out to do something they enjoy.
In this way, all three basic elements of health are met: movement, fresh air, and fun with sunlight.
Some can even make new friends during the hunt.
As usual, there are some grouchy party poopers looking for something to complain about.
And, of course, someone could walk into a door.
What difference does it make?
A great innovation has been offered.
Smartphone applications like Fitbit have followed our movement, but have given us no reason to exercise like this game.
The effects of innovation will wear off, and the use will fade over time.
However, because of Pokémon's success, many games will be produced to help those who go hunting through the integration of applications and virtual reality through real - world activities to become more active, fit, and healthy.

Simone Biles won the gold medal in the female gymnastics general assessment.
Forget the pressure.
Forget the excitement.
Simone Biles is immune to all this.
It's dynamic about jumping.
He's comfortable with the balance device.
It's amazing on the ground.
Perfection from head to toe.
And now he's an Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast completed the overall assessment on Thursday, making it clear at the Olympics the difference between him and the rest of the world.
The total score was 62,198 points, silver medal winner and friend of the "Last Five" team, Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
Simone Biles of the United States performed on the balance device Thursday at the women's artistic general assessment final at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Summer Olympics in Brazil.
Biles became the fourth and fifth American woman to receive the general assessment award in a row and announced her name as the best of her generation and perhaps the greatest of all time.
When the final total was published, she burst into tears and ended her long journey to reach this moment.
This success has brought the sport to the same level as athletes like Michael Phelps, who can be seen once in a generation, bringing it to new levels:
Biles spent the last three years as one of the most successful in this sport, with 15 world championship medals -- 10 gold medals -- and a dramatic combination of ambitious and sensitive routines that led Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton, 1984, to call herself "the best gymnast I've ever seen."
In Brazil, a final test was waiting for him, and this competition was more between him and the other people in the field than it was between them, and the burden of great expectations.
His return to the family home in Spring, Texas, with less than a handful of gold medals, would be seen as disappointing.
Simone Biles of the United States, on the left, and Aly Raisman, after receiving gold and silver medals in the general assessment of artistic women at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Summer Olympics in Brazil, Thursday, respectively.
Biles won the first Tuesday, when he served as an exclamation mark at the farewell party of Martha Karolyi, the national team co-ordinator who retired.
Although Biles insists on never looking forward to his long run towards the summit, that's not entirely true.
The section of the floor exercise, including the circled transition of the routine, is prepared with Latin music that will fit exactly on the street just outside the Rio Olympic Arena.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl who was adopted as a child by her grandparents and was discovered by Boorman's mother on a trip to a gym where Aimee Boorman coached.
Since the summer of 2013, he has lost none of the general assessments; this is a winning streak that must continue as long as Biles wants.
Mustafina took the lead on both rotations, but it was temporary.
Biles had not yet taken on his world championship balance tool and ground exercises.
He took the lead with 15,433 points on the balance beam and crowned it with 15,933 points on the floor exercise.
While Raisman waited for the final score, he gently hugged him, and his vision that Biles had once written in a sketch book came true, and tears appeared around his glowing red, white, and blue eye makeup.
Raisman's performance was a rematch of the performance four years ago, when he shared fourth place, but later lost the bronze medal to Mustafina.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, the one the Americans call "nana," took the lead.
From time to time, he sent a kiss to the crowd after the exercise where he overcame a suspicious return.
For the 19-year-old Biles, he posted a very shared tweet earlier this week, saying that he now has a whole new meaning:
Police: Three victims were shot in a serial killer case while listening to music in a car.
In the first serial killer case in Phoenix in ten years, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot Thursday in a police report while talking in the car and listening to music.
Authorities say Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot in a car parked on a driveway on June 12th.
According to the report, the gunman fired eight shots while standing on the passenger side of the car and drove away in another vehicle.
Police say these three murders didn't appear to be a robbery, because the assailant didn't take the adult victims' handbags or $2,900 in cash.
Deputy Chief Inspector Jonathan Howard, spokesman for the Phoenix police, stated that the investigators of the armed assault had led them to investigate whether this was connected to the previous four attacks.
In a four-month period, a total of seven people were killed and two others were injured in nine attacks in Spanish-based neighborhoods.
At the beginning of this month, Howard announced to CBS's attending KPHO, "This happened in the settlement in front of a house."
The suspect was thought to have used a model in the late 1990s, including a brown Nissan, a black BMW, and a white Cadillac, or Lincoln, in a model in the late 1990s.
Researchers refused to reveal evidence that the attacks were related to the same killer and that they were carried out by the same killer.
Ellis (33) was hospitalized for injuries and later died.
Liner (31) and Ellis' daughter Maleah died at the scene.
A witness told police that it was not unusual for these people to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
Authorities also issued a police report on the shooting that targeted an empty truck half an hour before three murders.
Researchers found shell casings, pulled a bullet out of a seat, and found bullet fragments in the engine compartment.
The mother of a 6-year-old microcephalitis patient: "It's getting better."
Like most six-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto also loves singing, toys, and, of course, his mother.
Unlike his peers, Edmund has microcephalitis - a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picciuto, did not know existed during her pregnancy.
When you first came home, my first thought was that I couldn't do it.
I can't do this.
I didn't ask for this.
It's not true, of course you want it."
He and his wife Vincent were told that Edmund might never know or even survive.
Some doctors have gone too far to offer to put him in a nursing home.
"My first reaction was to say that I didn't think people did it anymore," Picciuto explained.
Edmund can walk with a walker.
Edmund couldn't sit up or crawl until he was three years old, and he still can't speak.
But he's slowly reaching some milestones.
He can walk with help and ride a bicycle.
Besides, he likes to play and sing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth is showing Edmund the sign language he made up to say, "Please sing to me."
Picciuto told CBS News, "We're teaching him sign language."
But it's not sign language as we know it, it says Edmund made up his own signs.
Microcephalia can arise due to a number of different conditions; a genetic condition like Edmund may exist, and it can be caused by infections such as measles and Zika during pregnancy.
Symptoms and the course of the disease can vary greatly.
It's too early to tell how the lives of people with Zika infections will be affected.
Picciuto remembers the emotional burden of the uncertainty of his future.
I kept asking what was going to happen.
What's it gonna be?
And he still doesn't know it.
Actually, I haven't asked you a question about the course of the disease in a long time because I didn't expect anyone to tell me.
However, Picciuto is able to offer hopeful advice for the mothers of infants who were born to apologize for Zika.
It's getting better.
You know it'll be better for you.
You will love your child, and your child will love you.
In Louisiana, Mississippi, heavy rains and floods have mobilized rescue teams.
In Louisiana, heavy rains and widespread floods led the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with more rain expected by Saturday.
National Weather Service reported flooding in numerous rivers in the northeast of Louisiana and south of Mississippi, which poses a widespread threat of flooding after heavy rain flow.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards stated that state officials have been in constant contact with local authorities and support for affected neighborhoods is on the way.
State Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Prep, spokesman Mike Steele, said there have been demands for high-water vehicles, boats and trenches.
Steele stated that only tons of trenches were required for the Tangipahua neighbourhood.
By Saturday, there will be a flood in most of southern Louisiana.
Weather services have said that an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain may fall into the area in a statement.
There was a flood on Saturday, as the rain continued in the Mobile region of southern Alabama.
Both are expected to reach record levels during the week at the Comite River near Baton Rouge in Louisiana and the Amite River near Denham Springs.
The forecaster, Alek Krausmann, said that both rivers could flood many houses in the suburbs near Baton Rouge.
He also said that water flow in Ascension neighbourhood was a threat, as the hailed rivers were slow to flow to Lake Maurepas.
In Liverpool, Louisiana, just south of the Mississippi state line, the Tickfaw River had already reached the highest level measured at 9:00 a.m. Friday.
Rescue teams continue to rescue people from floods of Amite and Wilkinson accidents in southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those rescued near Gloster on Friday.
Hansford (62) said the water from Beaver Creek, normally 400 feet away from home, rose rapidly during the night.
He stated that another son-in-law who lived nearby warned him.
"We woke up and the water kept coming," Hansford said.
It was right up to my waist.
His wife told Hansford that this was the highest level he'd ever seen in the creek during his 48 years here.
Hansford stated that he and his family members were disabled and that he was the only one who could swim.
Hansford said he rescued all three emergency workers in a large military-style truck and took them to the fire station in Gloster, where they took shelter on Friday.
Krautmann said that as heavy rains continue, the floods "are spreading with speed" and authorities are considering issuing an evacuation order.
Krautmann said an observer near Livingston reported that it rained 13.75 inches from midnight to Friday morning.
The floor has been highly satisfied since Wednesday, Krausmann said.
Authorities say the streets under heavy rains and floods have provided the need for rescue of residents of Tangipahoa neighborhoods and for school holidays in five school districts.
CBS's WWL reported that a female city councilwoman in Tangipahoa said 200 houses were flooded.
The residents were evacuated to two churches, but these are under flooding.
Local Head Robby Miller said authorities saved 72 people and seven pets trapped by rising waters.
There are shelters in Amite town and Hammond city for those who have been evacuated.
He said, "When the waters begin to retreat, they will be allowed to return home."
In Hammond, Tangipahoa neighborhood, nearly two dozen streets were closed due to rising waters, and trenches were offered by residents trying to keep the water away from their homes and businesses.
"The last major flood we had was in March," said Lacy Landrum, city manager.
This seems to be a similar event.
In Mississippi, Harrison Accident Emergency Manager Rupert Lacy said the rain continued steadily on the Gulf Coast.
Several homes reported floods on Tuesday, but so far there have been no reports for Friday.
Keith Townson, director of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has lived in this area for 40 years.
Townson said, "I've seen water where I've never seen water before," and he added, "And it's still raining."
6-year-old Mahaj Brown, whose body was riddled with bullets, survived the Philadelphia attack.
Police have announced that a six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, the second shooting in the city this week of a six-year-old boy.
CBS identified Mahaj Brown as his grandparents for Philadelphia.
His grandmother and grandfather said that Brown had multiple gunshot wounds in his body, including the groin area, leg, arm, and abdomen, but was conscious when he was brought to the hospital.
Her grandmother, Delores Melendez, explained to the station that she had suffered too much and her tiny body had been riddled with bullets.
I can't believe this.
The boy was listed as one of those who maintained his critical condition in the hospital, and he went through some surgeries.
The family told the station that he was expected to recover.
She was going to start her freshman year at the local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown area.
Two of them were 29, one was 32 years old, both men were shot.
CBS Philadelphia stated that one of the 29-year-olds was critical, while the other two victims were stable.
The station reported that the child was found shot in the front seat of a car along with one of the 29-year-old men in critical condition.
The other two victims weren't in the car, and the police are looking into whether one of the wounded was an attacker.
Detectives have stated that multiple gunmen may have shot each other at CBS Philadelphia.
The scene was filled with shell casings, assault weapons from different assault weapons.
Looks like there was definitely a long-term conflict.
There were shells on the street and on both sides of the sidewalk.
This shows that more than one gunman was found and both were active," said Philadelphia Commissioner Anthony Ginaldi to the station.
Multiple houses and vehicles in the area have been damaged.
No arrests have been made, and police have reportedly examined the security cameras.
A six-year-old girl was shot in the arm on Tuesday while playing outside her house in West Oak district.
He's in recovery, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Simone, the reason we need Gabby and Laurie.
That's what I call the Women's Olympic Gym team this year, and there's more than one reason.
First of all, I've been to all the Summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been so dominant.
Second, this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspire many girls with different ethnic origins.
The structure of this team brought together by Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocian makes everyone proud.
The team finally looks like America.
It also strengthens the presence of black and Latin women at the highest levels of this sport.
In the past four years, the first female gymnast has always been an African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were in the first and second rankings.
It's a powerful thing.
In the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic champion and America supported him.
Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, now three world championships all over the world, will be able to witness extraordinary performances of their unexpected but masterful gymnastics routines.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American in a row to win gold medals in the general assessment of women.
And his teammate Aly Raisman won the silver medal.
We recognize the best times of this sport, but that's not what it looks like in gymnastics courses across the country.
Simone, Gabby, and Laurie took the same route as Aly and Madison to join the Olympic team.
The reason they're the last five is because there will only be four gymnasts on the next Olympic gymnastics team, and this is the last year Marta Karolyi will coach.
In reality, however, gymnastics is a very costly sport and gymnasts who work primarily in private gymnastics clubs, which are supported by parents' education, travel, form, competition, hotel fees (for trainers, gymnasts and families) and with many other fees.
Most of these gymnastics clubs are located in wealthy suburban neighborhoods that can support these businesses.
These clubs are the only place that gymnasts can train, and it requires a costly and long-term commitment to the families of gymnasts.
Simone Biles coach Aimee Boorman and Laurie Hernandez coach Maggie Haney have been training these athletes since they started gymnastics.
For countless young girls affected by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, we don't offer communities a more affordable and accessible gym education.
I started my own gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
In my establishments, we coached more than 15,000 young people in the city (first black and Hispanic) for free and low-cost gymnastics, both national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (where I grew up) to provide quality gymnastics training for young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this wonderful Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops the strength, flexibility and coordination of the body, and provides mental hard work, discipline, and determination.
This combination offers long-term advantages in health, school, and business.
This team will be inspired to lead thousands of young girls to gymnastics, and it's a wonderful thing.
Participation in sports is especially important for girls.
We're going through some really exciting times.
Thank you for bringing the gold medal to Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison as the Olympic team, to show "Girls' Power" clearly, and to motivate many young girls with different backgrounds to become healthy, strong, successful young women.
After Jeremy Hunt's offer was rejected, residents decided to continue the strikes.
The ministers hoped that the dispute would end after the agreement was reached with British Medical Association officials, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 residents who participated in the vote rejected it.
In July, Mr Hunt announced NHS plans to impose sanctions on the contract, stating that "no one has property" and that further delays would harm personnel and patients.
The first group of residents has been transferred to a new contract, which includes changes in working practices at night and weekends, to improve care outside normal hours.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, head of the BMA's assistant doctors' committee, said in her statement last night: "Asistan doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, especially because they think it will trigger the current labour force crisis and will not adopt an equal attitude towards all doctors."
This process is only eight weeks away from getting the first group of doctors transferred to the new contract, and time is almost up.
BMA's efforts to resolve the dispute by talking were met with the government's reluctance to interact and in some cases deafening silence.
This is an improvement despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that his door will always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt needs to act immediately, lift sanctions, and listen to residents' concerns."
The assistant doctors have made it clear that they are prepared to increase their work-slowing actions if he does not do so.
During the last strike in late April, nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments were postponed, nurses and consultants had to replace the doctors on the strike line.
The ministers hoped that the dispute would be over after the agreement was reached with British Medical Association officials.
BMA wants to improve the weekend fees for 54,000 residents.
The executive director of the NHS Employers, Daniel Mortimer, urged assistant doctors not to implement any strike.
"Grev doesn't solve anything, but it causes anxiety, discomfort, and distress for patients, babysitters and their families by putting pressure on the already busy crew and services," said Mr. Mortimer.
For the past two months, we have continued our talks with the Assistant Doctors Committee, and together with the Ministry of Health and other officials, we have been positive about their concerns about the Watchership Mission and Reporting.
Employers were hopeful that continuing positive communication regarding important issues -- distribution, educational flexibility, breaks in their careers, additional education costs, mutual understanding of curriculum, educational leave and the difference of wages between genders in medicine -- was a sign of how serious it was taken by employers, British Medical Education and Health Ministry, in line with agreements reached in November, February and May.
Two pounds a day is a drug that can eliminate the danger of a heart attack.
Thousands of heart attack patients will be able to benefit from the cost of £2 a day after authorities have suggested that they be given more for a longer period of time.
Ticagrelor, which prevents clotting, reduces the risk of repeated seizures for people with heart disease.
The drug was given for 12 months following the heart attack and was reducing the risk of paralysis or otherwise.
The NHS observer, NICE, suggested that it be given to people for four years to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems further.
But now, the NHS observer, NICE, has suggested that it should be given to people for four years to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems further.
Each year, around 140,000 people in England have heart attacks and a quarter of them suffer from another stroke or stroke.
The cause of heart attacks and strokes is that fats build up and produce records on the walls of arteries.
If your record is shattered, it could cause a heart attack by causing a blood clot and preventing blood from going to the heart.
And if the clot dislodges, it'll cause a stroke if it moves through the blood flow to prevent blood flow to the brain.
People who have had a seizure before are more likely to have another attack.
Ticagrelor, created by the United Kingdom firm AstraZeneca by the name Brilique commercially, reduces the risk by reducing the possibility of clotting.
The draft of the NICE manual, published today, recommends giving people 90 milligrams of ticagrelor for 12 months and then doing 60 milligrams per day for three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE health technology assessment centre, said: "Though secondary prevention treatments are available, more than a quarter of those who have heart attacks suffer from another heart attack or stroke, and their results are often devastating."
Fear of a relapse can have a very negative effect on the quality of a person's life.
Evidence shows that the use of ticagrelor along with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of heart attacks and strokes that have been repeated in people who have had a heart attack before.
With the temporary recommendation of Ticagrelor, we are pleased to have increased the options for treatment for thousands of people who are waiting to benefit from it.
More than three years of information on the effectiveness and safety of the Ticagrelor are limited, so the manual draft does not recommend treatment after this period.
PC culture increases vote corruption in Muslim regions
Former Tower Hamlets mayor Lutfur Rahman was suspended last year for corruption following government report
As the devastating government report presented today showed, political accuracy culture has led to the disregard of widespread vote corruption in Muslim communities.
Former Cabinet Minister Sir Eric Pickles scolded police, election observers and municipal court for ignoring evidence of election abuse due to "excessive sensitivity to ethnic origin and religion."
The former secretary of the community and the anti-corruption Tsar of today said that the adoption of voters on religious grounds is so bad that the police must be allowed to draw lanes outside the voting booths in order to protect the frightened voters.
He suggested that voters keep their identities with them to prove their identity when they voted.
In the current case, it's enough that the voter has a name and address.
The report even recommends permanent ink on the finger during the voting process to prevent people from voting twice.
Sir Eric said those who called in need better protection.
He called for better access to the press on board documents and the decisions of informal committees or working groups.
"It is not only to provide protection against fraud in the elections, it is also to protect the local government from the culture of corruption and financial fraud that is holding hands with it," he said.
The report was drafted by Downing Street following the Tower Hamlets vote scandal in East London.
Last year, a special election court decided that after repeated corruption and illegal practices, mayor Lutfur Rahman would be relieved of his post.
The court has found that Rahman "has abused the religious feelings of the Muslim community" and silenced his critics on charges of racism and Islamophobia.
It was stated that the Rahman "run his campaign on the basis that it was a religious duty for Muslim believers to vote for him."
Up to 300 votes were a result of suspicious use of false identity, or voting as if it were someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country.
He specifically warned about corruption in voting through mail -- where the elderly members of the Muslim community were alleged to have been pressuring the candidate they chose to vote for.
Sir Eric has made some suggestions for the organisation of the voting system, including the identity of individuals, to prove who they are.
His report included the following statements: "There has been evidence that some ethnic minority communities, especially women and young people, have been pressured to vote in accordance with the will of the elderly, especially in communities of Pakistan and Bangladesh.
"There were concerns that state institutions ignored such behavior due to the extreme sensitivity of ethnicity and religion, due to political accuracy."
Sir Eric has proposed 50 proposals to regulate the system in a way that includes preventing political activists from processing voting documents in the mail for the purpose of "getting votes."
The report, reviewed by Theresa May, also calls for a tightening of registration controls to prevent the election register from being used for immigration and welfare fraud.
The option of conditional identification of voters before voting is considered.
Permanent ink on a person's fingers after voting to prevent anyone from voting twice.
Systematic controls on the subject's nationality are being conducted to determine the ability to vote.
A three-year limitation on requests for automatic mail voting.
The ban on political campaign officials and activists from processing the ballots sent by completed mail and the ballots sent by post.
The police are authorized to draw lanes around voting booths.
Under the 1983 Public Representation Act, the amendment of the law to facilitate the accusation of scaring people.
It's illegal to take pictures in voting booths.
Only English is required in voting booths (except the Gals).
Enhancing the staff's training to enforce the rule that voters enter the cabinet alone.
Sir Eric brutally criticised the Police Department for the absence of any charges in the Tower Hamlets case.
"The election court has ruled that there is no room for blame for repeated corruption and illegal activities for Lutfur Rahman and his representative," he said.
For a number of reasons, he was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt -- based on the nature of the criminal evidence.
He also criticised the municipal court's non-effective "marking controls" in the electoral register departments.
Sir Eric said: "Tower Hamlets' court ruling last year was a warning alert.
Although our nation has the pride of forming the mother of parliaments, the spread of these worrying and secret election corruption and rejection by some institutions may damage that good reputation.
Crazy about Kate's bicycle-like and other famous counterparts of the Rio Olympic Players.
This week, fans of the Rio 2016 Olympics went wild for French biker Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who proved to be impressively similar to the Duchess of Cambridge.
However, the 24-year-old Olympic athlete is not the only athlete to draw attention to his resemblance to celebrities while fighting for the gold medal this summer; at least that's what social media thinks.
So, in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous faces we've seen on our screens, your F names have made a list of Olympic athletes who look more like them than look like Hollywood celebrities.
Hunter and wolf: United States Men's Archery Team Brady Ellison (left) has been greeted by Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood
In addition to Kate's likeness on the bicycle track, many online individuals have shown that an archer can be as much like Leonardo DiCaprio as his twin.
Brady Ellison, a member of the U.S. Men's Archery Team, rocked Twitter after pictures of him showing his resemblance to the star of the movie Moneyhunter.
And the archer admitted that he had been told that he had looked like Leo since he was a kid.
Brady told the Huffington Post, 'I don't think there's much resemblance except for hair and beard.'
'He's a handsome man, so I guess that's a compliment.'
One of London's most popular comparisons of 2012, and there is also, without a doubt, more remarkable this year: the amazing resemblance of British long jump athlete Greg Rutherford to popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina, with her big and meaningful eyes, has been described as the exact likeness of the Cuban-American artist Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Glee's star Matthew Morrison for years.
Change: This user describes Nathan's opening movie star as an "atletic version"
Tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett have been compared for a long time because of their thick eyebrows and the resemblance of their lips.
The Russian team's silver medalist, Annalynne McCord, has the same bronze skin and blond hair, while his fans say that Nathan Adrian of the US team "reminiscent of the athletic version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt."
Hard women: Football star Hope Solo (left) and Dexter's star Jennifer Carpenter (right) have similar facial features and eyes
Not alone: A Twitter user is very pleased that others have noticed this resemblance
A theory that remains in the air: This user thinks there might be a reason for this couple to be similar in appearance.
A Twitter user has moved his happiness over "the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are twins."
In fact, the American football star and the actress in Dexter have similar facial features and eyes.
Other popular comparisons include Kerri Walsh-Jennings and actress Laura Linney's almost identical smile and the big smiles of Gabby Douglas, another gold medalist and Gabrielle Union, star of Youth Fire.
The CBC Olympic announcer apologized for the Chinese swimmer's comment that he died like a pig.
An analysis of Byron MacDonald's 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth time in the 4x200 m free race has angered those watching CBS's live Olympic broadcast on Wednesday.
The Canadian broadcaster CBC was forced to apologize for commenting that one of her announcers, a 14-year-old female swimmer, had been wiped out like a bad smell, and had died like a pig in the race.
The announcer Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was turned off when women started explaining their ideas in the 4x200 m free relay final.
It was heard that MacDonald, who was included in the CBC's announcer's team's 'color', said: 'The 14-year-old Chinese has failed heavily, baby.'
He was overexcited, wiped out like a bad smell and died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
China Swimmer Ai Yanhan (14) finished the second leg of the relay race at 1:57.79 p.m., allowing Canadians to be 1.61 seconds behind the Canadian Taylor Rack to close the gap between China and China.
Canadian audiences quickly moved after surprised by the tone and language used
"Did Emmett Macfarlane just tweet that a 14-year-old swimmer died like a pig?"
The idiot didn't realize he was still on the air.'
The Chinese Ai Yanhan was described in the 4x 200 m Free Flag Race as: 'The 14-year-old Chinese has failed heavily, baby.'
On Twitter, criticisms about Byron MacDonald were published very sharply and quickly, and many of them were self-proclaimed.
Twitter users couldn't help but notice how insensitive Byron Macdonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: "Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada, and you make us all look racist.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who was running the CBS broadcast, apologized for MacDonald's comment: "We apologize for the comment on the swimming race.'
Those were really unfortunate words, and we're sorry that such an incident took place.'
In response to the comment, CBC had to apologize to people who tweeted at least 90 times more.
Another reporter, Scott Russell, was forced to apologize on MacDonald's behalf.
CBC later copied and pasted this apology to over 90 Twitter users who had reported MacDonald's complaints about his comments
The network quickly issued a statement apologizing.
We would like to express our sincere regret that these statements have been made and that they have been put on the air.
Last night, we quickly apologized to our viewers on the air and on social media.
We'd like to explain that Byron's comments were not about the swimmer's personality, but about his performance.
However, these were highly inappropriate and unfortunately chosen words, and Byron is deeply upset by what he says.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald also apologized on the air and attempted to defend his statement by saying he did not wish to engage in a personal attack.
He said on the BBC Olympic broadcast, "I want to apologize for a comment I made last night after the women's flag race."
'I wasn't referring to the swimmer's personality. I was referring to his performance.'
'There's no need to say too much, I didn't mean to be disrespectful, and I'm very sorry.'
The Primark client threw up anger at the woman in the middle of the store who tried on reckless underwear.
Customers didn't know what to do when a woman took her clothes off in the middle of Primark to try on panties on the store floor.
Even worse, she looked at how it looked on her, took it off and put it back on the shelf.
He continued to look and then tried on four pairs of underwear at the Bouverie Place mall in Folkestone.
Before she put the panties back on the shelf, it was the Primark store at the Bouverie Place Mall in Folkestone.
Jenny Davidson, the mother of two children at the store at the time, said that after trying on the mystery woman's underwear, "she got dressed again and left the store without buying anything."
He said: 'People couldn't believe their eyes.'
He stood in the center of the store and took a pair of panties out of the window, took off his pantyhose and pants and put them on.
'He didn't try to find a special place to do it, he was standing in the middle with all the disrespect.'
'Everyone was looking at him when he took off the panties, and it seemed like he didn't like them because he put them back on the shelf.'
He tried three more laundry until he decided he didn't like anything, and then he got dressed up and left the store.
'He didn't seem to care about the people watching him, and he didn't think about the person who would buy the panties he was trying on later.'
Mrs. Davidson (33) in the town of Kent said: 'How disgusting it is to think that someone else is wearing uncleaned panties and someone is going home.'
This incident took place Tuesday afternoon.
Mrs. Davidson added: 'I think the staff took the clothes off the market after he left, which is a good thing.'
'When I went home with a new pair of panties, it would be really bad to think that someone else had worn them and came to me without washing."
A Primark spokesman said: 'Prmark is aware of the incident that took place in our store in Folkestone on Tuesday (August 9th).'
The relevant product has been removed from the sale.
How can you defend yourself against armed attacks with Krav Maga?
The outside world is very dangerous, but this video from Dailymail.com can help you to be safer.
We met with Rhon Mizrachi, head of the Krav Maga Federation in New York City to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
Whether you're being approached from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to turn the situation against the robber.
Mizrachi says when you're approached from behind, the first thing you need to do is turn your face around and see the attacker and clear the fire line.
Then you put the gun between your forearm and your shoulder, and you hit him in the face with your empty elbow.
Then, when you knee him in the crotch, the pain will double, and at this point you'll take the gun away from him, and you'll hit him in the face with the barrel of the gun, and the back of the gun will stay up.
When a gunman approaches from the front, a similar technique is applied; you draw your body from the line of fire, grab the gun and turn it in a way that the attacker can't fire.
At the same time, you put your weight on the gun, you punch the attacker from the chest area, you take the gun from him, and you point the gun at him and you back away.
Does that sound tricky?
Take a look at the video to see how Mizrachi does it.
But remember, if you're not a Krav Maga master, the safest way to avoid every robbery is to give your money to the robber.
Traveler Ian Wright put his tongue in the dirtiest places in Europe for his travel guide
The British traveler licked some of Europe's nastiest and nastiest places and tested his immune system and gag reflex through a serious test.
The host and travel writer, Suffolkian Ian Wright (51), used his tongue to prove the power of the immune system, a Euro bill, a Piccadily Circus banister, a flush button of a train toilet, and a pay phone in Russia.
Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he was involved in.
However, the experiment, which will be transformed into a film called The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, yielded some surprising results.
Although the idea of licking the flush button on a train used by thousands of people is extremely disgusting, there are actually a lot more bad bacteria in the kitchen sink.
During his trip to Europe, Mr. Wright met with doctors and medical experts regarding increased stomach bacteria and health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked had any effect other than the bad taste he left in his mouth.
Mr. Wright has been known to travel the world and eat strange and wonderful things and test his stomach's endurance.
From the general banisters at train stations to the toilet flush buttons, this task, at a wide range, has definitely tested the immune system.
In the film about this, he said, "I haven't been very careful with my health since I was a child, and I've put a lot of things in my mouth from the ground to the worm to the muddy water."
During the film, he proved precisely why he was famous.
The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
Reptile sample showed over 4,000 units of luminometer count.
In comparison, this number has to be under 60 in newly washed hands.
However, under 60 in newly washed hands, when the luminometer count rose above 4,000 units, it became a Russian public toilet that he refused to lick.
Mr. Wright and Fin dairy producer Valio produced The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, which showed the number of bacteria in different places, such as the bathroom.
He said in the movie, 'This is about to be one of the worst things I've ever smelled in a toilet.'
There's nothing dirtier than that!
I'm not gonna lick anything because it's disgusting in there.
The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was prepared with the Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio.
The company provided Mr. Wright with lactic acid bacteria, as well as Valio Gefilus, which includes vitamin C and vitamin D, which helps strengthen the immune system and stomach bacteria.
"We really wanted to offer the consumers something new, " said Senior Vice President Niko Vuoronmamaa of Valio's Snacks, Fruit Waters and New Categories Department.
Something impressive to watch and also explain the benefits of probiotics.
We've finally had a lot of crazy brainstorms where the idea of "let's call Ian."
They claim that interest in stomach health has become a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put products in a much larger context -- everyday good and bad bacteria around us, the importance of stomach health, and the connection to the immune system.
The interest in stomach health becomes a global phenomenon, and we would be able to give consumers more interesting information about this situation.
I also think the movie shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: "Let me tell you, if Ian had licked some of the things that I wanted him to lick like the dirty Russian toilet shown in the movie, I would have lost respect for him.'
Naturally, it was easy for Ian to lick things, but some of them were very difficult.
I'm glad we're recording some of these dirty licks.'
In 2015, a survey conducted by Valio said 84 per cent of respondents associated lactic acid bacteria with stomach health, and 58 per cent said they used at least intermittent products containing lactic acid bacteria.
The Maganda family destroyed Saltash, Cornwall's social home before the evacuation.
A family of gandas has left 50,000 pounds worth of damage in a social home where they've been evacuated for scaring their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her husband Shaun Trebilcock were kicked out of their residence in Saltash, Cornwall, following several complaints.
When they were forced off the property, housing officials were surprised to see that the property was irreparable.
There were big holes in the walls, floorboards ripped out, garbage scattered on the floor, graffiti written on the walls.
The family is now suspended from the dwelling and is thought to be taking advantage of special housing options
Donna McEvoy, director of Cornwall Housing housing, expressed fear that the situation would be unrescueable.
He said: "This is really a nightmare for the people here, and I don't think people should have to live like this.
He has a lot to attend to because this property will now be known as a very unpleasant part of Cornwall.
This family has a bad reputation and a bad reputation.
The family had three sons living on the premises, and according to the police, the family adopted many frightening behaviors including fighting with a baseball bat on the street, scaring the locals, drug use, drug dealing, and excessive shouting, arguing and swearing.
In June, an antisocial behavior decision was made for Skeldon (47), whose name was in the lease.
Old garbage was found in many rooms in the house where it was supposed to be destroyed.
The floorboards of the property used to sell drugs in the past were removed.
Neighbors said they saw them fighting in the street and the police were often called.
Cornwall Housing forced him and his wife to leave the premises this week after knowing him for 11 weeks voluntarily extended to move.
The evacuation was welcomed by relaxed neighbors who said their lives had become nightmares.
One person said, 'They didn't care about anyone.'
We've been living next to them for 20 years, and it's always been bad.
You wouldn't believe how many times we've seen cops here.
'This morning, we couldn't sleep.'
We woke up because it was so quiet; we're not used to it!
They're finally gone, and everything's gonna be great now.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Cornwall Housing's neighbouring executive, stated that the family did not co-operate with the local administration.
The family had been living in this house for 20 years, and the property was often called by police.
Trash and old toys were thrown on the side of the social home covered with plants.
He added: 'It is truly embarrassing that the renter and his family have not taken any responsibility for their evacuation; the evacuation has always been the last option Cornwall Housing has applied for.
Since behavior was extreme and their actions were too frightening for the neighbors to bear witness to, it was a very difficult case.
I appreciate the efforts of my team, Devon and Cornwall P.D., and members of the community who bravely stepped forward to inform us.
I hope that this development will help the neighbors relax a little bit and be understood as a message that antisocial behavior will not be tolerated.
Mr. Fitzpatrick said he had three sons living on property at different times, but they were in their 20s.
A dirty bed left on the floor in one of the bedrooms of the house after the evacuation.
Housing workers will have to clean up the trash that surrounds the house
In 2014, police raided the property and found over 70 grams of marijuana, scales, private items and £1700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined for possession of drugs after admitting Class B with intent to sell.
He claimed to use the money to buy a tombstone for his son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After being homeless, it turns out Tanya and her husband now reside in a private residence in Plymouth.
Most of the house had graffiti on the walls.
Police said they would work to evacuate tenants who violated the rules of rent.
Angela Crow of the Devon and Cornwall Police Force said the evacuation was a warning to other tenants who continued to violate the rules.
He said, "This is also a message for those who think that they can act however they want without being accused, and that their conduct will be in vain."
Devon and Cornwall police forces, who will continue to work with their partners to protect society, will never tolerate crime and antisocial behavior.
Tourists in Portugal were terrified as the low-flying military plane flew right over the beach.

Portuguese Air Force P-3C Orion is flying extremely low
The air force said it was a training flight, but insisted there was no risk of safety.
This is the moment when tourists start panicking as they fly over a beach full of low-flying jets.
Dramatic images show military aircraft approaching almost at the level of contact for sunbathing on sand in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
Without seeing what was coming through the clouds, the vacationers stood up in a clear way because they were concerned about the noise of the jet engines.
It happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the few vacationers who posted the video of dramatic close flight on social media, said: 'Two times he went really low and it seemed like he was about to crash at some point.'
Nuno Arroja added: 'I was surfing and I swear I felt like the plane was going to fall on me.'
The tourists on the beach in Aveiro were horrified when the plane that flew out of the darkness began to fly at a very low altitude.
The Portuguese Air Force announced today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight to identify fishing boats on the beach and had to go so low since it was the only way to control them.
Due to the heavy smoke from the fire, the nearby extinguishion said the jet flew lower than usual, but the air force insisted that no one's safety was compromised.
This summer, the unresolved fires destroyed certain parts of the Portuguese mainland, causing the deaths of four people on Madeira Island.
The Portuguese air force said today that the pilot must fly low due to conditions that make the view difficult (intensible fog and smoke due to fire)
The plane was on a training flight, and as part of the exercise, the pilot was asked to identify the fishing boats.
London girl student who joined ISIS killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of the three English girls who left London last year to join ISIS, was reported dead in Syria.
Attorney Tasnime Akunjee said his family received information about his death in Rakka, Syria a few weeks ago.
ITV News reported on Thursday that he was thought to have died in a Russian air strike in the Rakka region, where the group was strong in the country.
Sultana was 17 years old, and according to her family, she died planning to flee the war-torn country and return to Britain.
"We hope that this situation will stress that it is really risky for others to go to war zones as a gravestone and a will, and that people will be discouraged to make this choice."
In February 2015, two girls from Sultana and East London boarded a plane to Turkey and then a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family was told that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria and was widowed within months.
Reid said he would not give up Garland as a Supreme Court candidate if Clinton was elected.
In the Senate, Democratic leader Harry Reid said he believes he will nominate Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court if the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton is elected president.
Republicans in the Senate have been blocking Garland's approval process since President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
Mitch McConnell, majority leader of the Senate, said the new president would choose the replacement of former Supreme Court Judge Antonin Scalia.
In a video talk Thursday, Reid said he believed Clinton would choose Garland and "had reason for it."
Later, a spokesman on behalf of Reid said he had spoken directly to Clinton and speculated on whether he would nominate Garland.
He praised Garland and said Clinton's team didn't want to "break up the current situation" by making a new choice.
Garland is the chief judge of the U.S. Supreme Court of Appeals in the state of Columbia.
Reid stated that the Republicans who prevented Garland from being nominated were Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's "partisans" and "partisans."
He said Trump wasn't fit for the mission.
Treats said he favours a naked calendar for women as well as for men.
Treats magazine is working with photographer David Bellemere to publish a calendar inspired by Pirelli of the 1970s for 2017.
Instead of being famous and naked, however, they are working to find new-generation top models for the 2017 NU Inspired Fairies calendar.
Treats' president, Steve Shaw, said earlier this year that this magazine, which had a high nudity rate, was different from the former Playboys, because "Playboy is for men."
I do it for women.
He obviously believes that's the calendar.
"We have to go back to displaying unfashionable, classic nudity, so that women, like men, can look at these images of the female body as an inspiration," Shaw said in a press release on the calendar.
Women will want to be part of this project because it's a beautiful work of art.
Models can send photos online or participate in open talks in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinyl target: who actually buys records?
Middle-aged, lonely men love viniles.
Let us say that this statement is based on real data before we go to the comment section to make great insults under the nickname.
According to YouGov, the return of records, which are a highly mentioned subject, is not the result of the Y generation, but of middle age nostalgia, which is the innovation created by a physical object.
The recently purchased vinyl albums are mostly between 45 and 54 years old.
In fact, the 18-24-year-old group is the least likely.
It's not just a collection of curious people; it's also emotional; older vinyl buyers are usually those who like to keep their feelings to themselves (56 and 53%) and people who enjoy being alone (69 and 66%).
And the results of YouGov are correct?
If this blog were a news story on TV, the camera would watch Soho walk on a crowded street in a modest gray suit, display a lot of gestures before they stop and open my hands and say something authoritarian like this: "Let's take a look at it."
Well, let's take a look.
While Soho's center gradually loses its magic and unusual weather, there are still a number of expert record stores (the buildings where former independent vendors are now filled with hotels, Eats, Prets and Paperchases).
I'd probably want it to stop from the camera for the next part, and I'd be standing near different men in some of these stores, trying to learn about their age and emotional condition through observation.
Sister Ray (data count: two young women, three middle-aged men) spend the afternoon in London, looking at stores for a few empty hours, followed by eight middle-aged men, probably a woman in her 20s.
I'm asking if he's a collector.
He says, "I think I am."
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These albums, which are located above, are decorated in the living room walls (which he e-mailed me, which I didn't follow him home).
The reason he collects so many albums and singles is that he can now buy records that he can't afford when he first comes out and buy back what he sold when he was young and broke.
"Most of what I bought was in the late '60s, early '70s, things that came out when I was only 11 or 12 years old; I was too young to buy."
He agrees that record buyers are likely to be introverts who like to be alone, and added: "I don't smoke, I don't drink too much.
That's my bad habit.
Most of the clients he met in Wez (25), working at Sister Ray, think they fit the YouGov profile.
However, he also noticed that a new wave of media ads has formed, and those who have heard that this trend is coming back need to buy old records back.
In my interviews, I realized that normally in 1998 or 1999, people were selling out their collections.
Customers who sold their vinyl to buy CDs at first now sell their CDs to buy them back."
This could explain the increase in people of a certain age who reanimated the vinyl.
What about the alleged emotional significance of records?
In a store like Phonica, it takes you a few seconds to realize that record stores offer a relaxing community of similar personalities.
According to Wez, some older clients were particularly offended by the non-contact payment system.
Some vinyl enthusiasts may want to take refuge in the stability of their familiar record covers, which are overwhelmed by the digital world and reminiscent of memories of calm youth.
Wez says, "Sometimes it's because you fill a void or you see material objects as some kind of comfort."
And since I'm a collector myself, that's what I have, and I think most people have.
That's an easy way to fill your head.
"We're like social servants," says a colleague who comes out of a stack of records.
A April poll revealed that 50% of the vinyl album recipients had not yet heard the album.
The poll also found that 41% of them had a record player that they never used, and 7 percent bought vinyl even though they didn't have a record player.
At this stage of the news, I'd probably have a very anxious look at a series of bossa nova compositions.
The "reward" aspect of this return is also noticed by Jonny (42), who works at Sounds of Universe (tax count: three middle-aged men).
"I don't have a record, but I want to buy a Radiohead record to put on our shelf," he said.
This does not represent a large percentage, but it certainly reflects the situation.
More product, less music.
There are people who say, "I don't have a record player."
These aren't old people, they're young, they're late tens, they're new people.
By the time I get to Fopp, which now has separated almost an entire floor for vinyl, I see that the mass is quite variable.
There are couples in their 70s, tourists taking pictures, young boys and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is spreading from the above stores (the last part of Wild Beast) and from the speakers, less still and less soothing jazz, sex-based pop is good to see diversity among customers.
None of them seem particularly lonely, but it's hard to resolve psychological trauma that bothers them by standing next to someone for more than 30 seconds.
Elanora (27) has been wandering the Fopp for several minutes and is looking at records on sale.
Instead of spending money, he just went out to look at the windows.
He says he doesn't have a choice to collect records because he doesn't earn much.
It's too expensive.
It's easier to listen to music on the computer or in other ways, but the beauty of the vinyl goes away, sighing like a lover.
I don't know how to explain it, it's really unique.
My last stop is a shop that is said to inspire a new generation of vinyl enthusiasts: Urban Outfitters.
As I pretend to study jeans, I observe a group of young girls gathered around Polaroid cameras for a while before a father and daughter argue about buying a Crosley record player.
On the left is Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse, and Fleetwood Mac's records with a stairwell full of records; records that are essential for an average collection; a mixture of modern and classical.
Nobody's looking; maybe it's just for decoration, some of them too high to be touched.
This is purely "artificial vinyl."
But curiosity about these items can mean that the industry will earn more money and send fewer customers into the depths of Soho; there are no more issues to complain about.
No wonder a demographic group with more money and more time than most spends more money on more luxury items like vinil.
But my findings show that YouGov's results are at least correct in Soho record stores; they don't account for female collectors and vinyl passions, which are numerous in reality, in record stores or online forums.
These people probably work hard at school or offices.
They certainly don't spend Thursday nights wandering around record stores on Berwick Street, studying records, and avoiding the look of a 30-year-old fake television host looking over the shoulders of middle-aged men who don't know anything.
Greenland shark, world's longest-lived vertebrate animal - video news
Scientists have explained that Greenland shark is the longest-lived vertebrate on the planet.
Working on sharks, Julius Nielsen said the record belonged to a female who was thought to be between 272 and 512 years old.
French court rejects proposal to destroy shops in the Jungle refugee camp
A court in France rejected a proposal made by Calais officials to destroy dozens of construction stores and restaurants at the Jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
During this week's court hearing, Calais officials argued that a total of 72 sediment stores in which the government sold many products, cut their hair, or sold from basic foods for 50 cents (40p), should be destroyed.
The governorate of Calais argued that these places should be destroyed because they created a parallel economy that was untaxed and were at risk for fire and hygiene.
The charitable groups told the court that stores and restaurants are vital, that free food provided by state-sponsored organisations and other groups is not enough for the growing population in the camp.
They argued that chop shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food for the needy.
A court in Lille said that there was no legal basis for deportation of the people who ran the 72-square store, but that the Governor of Calais's concerns were "clearly understandable."
Judge Jean-Francois Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants play a much greater role than simply feeding people who live in "very dangerous conditions."
He stated that these areas provide comfortable meeting points for refugees and volunteers.
For non-profit Jungle Children, one of the places in danger of collapse, the Book Cafe offers 200 meals a day, teaches English and French lessons, and advises hundreds of underage refugees in the camp on asylum.
Over 170,000 people have signed petitions to protect this cafe for children.
A letter sent to the Guardian stated that the closure would be "a disaster for these children, some of whom are only eight years old."
Two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that the population at the Jungle camp rose above 9,000 (the highest number so far) after increasing summer arrivals.
After the gold in Fiji's master class, Britain was satisfied with a silver medal in the rugby seven championships.
Great Britain's impressive progress in the Rugby 7th Championship ended Thursday's final with Fiji following the 43-7 defeat at Rio Deodoro Stadium.
To win the first Olympic medal of every color, Fiji taught a mastery of grip, rust, side step, support, running lines and muscle strength.
After the defeat, Britain received the third silver medal of the day as a consolation prize that wasn't so bad, and can now be proud of their efforts in the Olympic 7 opening tournament, where they defeated New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
At the beginning of the day, he may have found them in the final after the South African team, which they crushed 7-5 times in the semifinals.
But still, a Fiji this fit could beat a team of 15 people.
While it may not be very believable, Great Britain may find comfort in the idea that at least one Britannian will be wearing a gold medal tomorrow: Fiji's head coach, Ben Ryan, an Englishman from Wimbledon.
This has been a very difficult journey for Great Britain.
Eight years ago, when they worked with Ryan, they lost every game at the Adelaide Seven Championships.
This time, they only lost one.
Although this defeat is painful, the progress is truly astonishing.
Fiji made a fascinating start, and the players bounced over Great Britain's attempts to get the ball.
It was like running between a series of moving buses for Captain Tom Mitchell and his team, and when the World Series champions, Osea Kolinisao, took the lead from the corner, it was 5-0.
In the fourth minute, Jerry Tuwai crossed the right wing with another curved number.
The match was 12-0. And Great Britain had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's great intervention prevented the mountain-like Leone Naharawa from throwing out the third, but that was just delaying Fiji's number.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua scored from the right corner and Great Britain fell 17-0.
With only one minute left until the end of the first half, Nakarawa made another point from the beginning.
Vatemo Ravovou then flew through some tough British intervention to the line for the score.
Between this point and the half, the score reached 29-0.
When Fiji was a team for the 7th Championship, Great Britain seemed to be trying to learn the basics.
That's pretty much it.
Great Britain made great changes during the halftime and closed the Fiji dam for exactly four minutes, which was a good development for the first half until Josua Tuisova came out with the perfect Fiji play.
Dan Norton made an attempt for Great Britain, and even though he tried to score from the left-hand corner to make the score 36-7, the players were in the hands of the South Sea Islanders who sang, waved flags and danced.
It was really hard not to admire Fiji's entirely cheerful approach.
Maa Vilimame also worshipped the latest additions to Fiji's play, which was not necessary for decorations in the last few minutes.
When the whistle blew, the Fijians began celebrating, and Great Britain, devastated, headed for the locker room.
At the beginning of the day, Fiji defeated Japan 20-5 in the semifinals, and Great Britain faced South Africa in a difficult semi-final match; Britain took the lead by one point.
Kyle Brown led the South African team in the first half, but Dan Norton took the lead in his dizzy foot movements with the numbers he took in the second half.
With the wonderful intervention of Anthony's brother Marcus Watson, who was in England's first 15th, victory and silver were guaranteed.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning, inspired by their trainers' fight against cancer, raced to victory on the shovel.
There will be no more emotional gold medals in these games, and that means something.
From the first move to the last, 220 painful breaths followed by Helen Glover and Heather Stanning realizing that the moment when they won gold in Estacio da Lagoa could be much more meaningful.
Although there were two people who rowed, there were three voices on the boat; the voice of their trainer Robin Williams was echoed on the boat as they advanced to the second gold Olympic medal in Britain as the first women to reach such a level this year.
Their domination was quite clear; it was the 39th race of their unprecedented series of invincibility.
Although we see two great athletes floating on the surface in the swan's grace, this image does not reflect the exact nature of victory.
Behind each oar gold medal is a battalion of willing hands that make this difference, and no hand was as effective as its trainers, who didn't know if they would live to see it 30 months ago when they were diagnosed with cancer.
Like he said, they touched and left.
I got the kind of bladder cancer that could be operated on, and that's what they did.
If they don't, he's going everywhere.
That would be a pretty bad situation.
It changes your view of life a little.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
He was very lucky to start treatment at the beginning of the season, at the beginning of 2014, and in such cases, it's hard to tell if there's an accurate expression, but that way distractions can get to a minimum.
I had to get paid, so I had to heal fast.
That was an incentive for me.
I was in the hospital, and even though they said it was enough for me to take a few steps, I was walking in the garden about six, nine, 15 meters.
That's how it started.
Rowing's a journey on its own, but it makes it a little bigger.
After the victory, Williams was the one who had a tense morning of talking a little more than usual to overcome his own concerns.
"I was emotionally devastated this week, maybe it's a little extreme, but it really means a lot," Stanning, who was a captain of the Royal Gun Association, who had been to Afghanistan before.
This once again emphasizes what this means to me and how hard Helen, me and Robin worked.
I spent three wonderful years with Helen and Robin.
If it wasn't for Robin, we wouldn't be here, so I'd like to thank her for being the best coach in the world.
I couldn't find a better person to work with or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost a race in five years.
The two have got a tough beat that their opponents can't reach.
Even in the last 500 metres of New Zealand and Denmark, the power of Stanning and Glover had not been exhausted.
We got caught up in that moment.
Helen was calling out, "Follow the process, follow the process."
It's really important not to get carried away.
We got off on the right foot, and we weren't trying to do anything incredible.
We didn't expect the fireworks to go off today, we just wanted to win the race that we rowed so well, which we did.
The two will take a year off before deciding what to do in the future.
Glover has a wedding to attend next month, a wedding for himself and television adventurer Steve Backshall.
He just wants to enjoy this moment for now.
I didn't mean to say this was my last race.
It was going to be a lot of pressure.
It took me six months to realize I was an Olympic champion in London.
It was so new and I was so stressed.
Here, it took about four minutes.
That's a much better feeling."

Bulgaria Explains First Defensive Inflation Values for 8 Months
According to national statistics, Bulgaria's monthly inflation was at 1% in June.
This is the highest value seen in years (since June 2012) but is the first value seen above zero since October, following the positive 0.2% value last year.
The average annual inflation measured by the CPI for the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) was 0.8% compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015).
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10.0 percent, so monthly inflation was 1.0 percent.
Since the beginning of the year, the inflation rate (the comparison between July 2016 and December 2015) was 0.2% and the monthly inflation difference between July 2016 and July 2015 was 0.2%.
Compared to the previous month in July 2016, prices increased in the following consumer products groups: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transportation (1.8%), entertainment and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), various goods and services (0.3%).
Prices have dropped in clothing and shoes (2.2%), furniture, household equipment and routine care (0.5%) and health (0.1%).
Alcoholic beverages and tobacco products, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels remained at the same level in communication and training groups.
Snapchat "Anime" Effect Criticized as Asian Caricature
Snapchat says it's inspired by animes for this filter, but some observers say it's racially insensitive.
Snapchat allows about 150 million users to manipulate their identities on absurd levels by changing reality with the lens tool every day.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or a character out of a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
Lenses are reckless, character-altering tools that generate over 30 million self-improved selfies every day.
The missteps are quickly digged into the public's memory.
Snapchat lenses have come across accusations in the past that the practice had supported black classification or that whitened skin tones were ideal for beauty.
Therefore, because of the lens that they presented this week, which made users gook-eyed, bad teeth and swollen cheeks, some critics criticised the company as a "Asian mask" that caricatured Asians.
And they wondered if these repeated conflicts were pointing to a larger problem with the company's diversity.
News and anger spread with news from The Verge and Motherboard on Wednesday, and a day later, Snapchat announced it removed its feature.
The company issued a statement: The lens was prepared not to caricature Asians, but as a tribute to anime characters.
But for observers with experience of racism, this lens reminded me of the stereotypes that hurt.
Other people generally refused to compare anime.
Grace Sparapani, an American art student of Korean origin, said in an e-mail the lens was "pain and discomfort with the slightest expression."
"It is difficult to argue when it comes to comparing the effects of the bad Asian cartoon and the filter side by side.
This suggests that the filter is not only an Asian mask, but also a humiliating Asian mask.
Snapchat isn't the only company that's outstripping cultural trigger mechanisms.
American culture seems to be in endless conflict over diversity and coverage in many areas, from the meeting rooms of institutions to Hollywood and all the devices we carry in our hands.
And what Snapchat is talking about is a broader young group, which is more diverse than any other opponent, can be interpreted as expecting a higher sensitivity.
In an interview Thursday, 25-year-old Katie Zhu said that when one of Snapchat's lenses creates a humiliating image for a user, "it is much more difficult not to notice such actions as they used to."
On Thursday, Mrs. Zhu, a product manager and engineer working for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account, and called everyone on it.
In an article for Medium and in a phone interview, he said he believed that racial conflicts reflected a lack of diversity in recruitment practices in Snapchat.
Ms. Zhu criticised the majority of the white male leaders and ended her article with a label: #SnapchatiSilin.
"Either different races among their staff can make these kinds of decisions because they do not have enough diversity, or they do not feel safe or comfortable enough to talk to themselves, even though there are people who work there and are from different races," said Mrs. Zhu, a Chinese American.
Other observers share his views on this complaint that Snapchat left largely unanswered.
The company does not share numbers on diversity among its staff, stressing the private company situation.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to share the racial origins of his staff, but according to one spokesman, the company recently included a recruitment officer in an effort to focus on the underrepresented populations and to increase integration efforts.
Mrs. Zhu, in her own way, said she'd keep her Snapchat account closed and added, "I wonder if she needs more users like us who can say that's not true."
Congress panel says military authorities are disrupting ISIS intelligence
A congressional panel reported on Thursday that the Central Command Officials of the United States have falsified intelligence reports to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than in the field.
An intermediary report by the Court's Armed Services Committee, Intelligence Committee and the Subcommittee's office, consisting of presidents of the Republican Council of Defence Payments, has found "a dissatisfaction" among Central Command intelligence analysts who say their superiors have changed the assessments of the State of Islam.
Central Command, known as Centcom, is a military headquarters in Tampa, Fla, which oversees American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The intelligence results approved by senior Centcom leaders are typically drawing a more positive picture of US terrorism prevention efforts than the facts in the field show, and constantly provide far more positive results than the analysis of other members of the intelligence community," the report reported.
California Republican Representative Ken Calvert said, "What happened at the Centcom is unacceptable; our combat troops suffer while poor analysis is presented to senior decision makers."
The leadership failures at Centcom have reached the highest levels of the organization.
The 10-page report also gave details of the permanent problems of 2014 and 2015, which were included in the US's analysis and analysis of efforts to educate Iraqi forces by Central Command.
Although there is no conclusive evidence that senior Obama administration officials have ordered the reports to be changed, analysts have been pressured by Centcom leaders to provide a more optimistic view of the threat created by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS and DAES.
"In the first half of the year 2015, many Central Command press releases, declarations and congressional statements were significantly more positive than actual events," the report said.
For example, a Centcom official stated publicly that a major military attack on Mosul could be carried out as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still under the control of the Islamic State.
In a statement, Kansas Republican Representative Mike Pompeo said, "After months of research, this matter has been made quite clear."
From mid- 2014 to mid- 2015, the senior intelligence leaders of the Central Command of the United States have manipulated the commander's intelligence results so that the threat posed by ISIS in Iraq could be considered insignificant.
Republicans have formed a workforce after learning that analysts have expressed concern that intelligence about the Islamic State has been manipulated.
As further reviews continue, the report published on Thursday will follow much more comprehensive findings.
There is also another Centcom intelligence investigation conducted by the D.O.D. General Inspector.
The Democratic members of the Palace Intelligence Committee published their findings Thursday, which participated in some results from the Republican labour force.
In a statement, Representative Adam B. Schiff, the Democratic President of the Committee, said that "from 2014 to 2015, he created a very narrow-minded process in intelligence assessments of Centcom, DAESS and the Iraqi Security Forces."
According to Mr. Schiff, this process "has delayed the publication of the intelligence results" led to a moral breakdown among analysts and "has not given enough room for opposite opinions."
However, Mr. Schiff and the Democrats have stated that the White House's Centcom analysts have been pressuring the results to "predict or fabricate a political narrative."
The preliminary results of the congressional review were announced by the Daily Beast on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times announced that a general review of a Pentagon inspector was available following complaints filed by Centcom analysts.
Senior Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, as a Pentagon spokesman, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on the congress report during the ongoing investigation of the general inspector.
However, he said, "the experts may disagree over the interpretation of complex data in some cases, and the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence support the healthy dialogue regarding these important national security issues."
The study will echo beyond the question of whether the US-led bombing operation in Iraq and Syria is continuing (an argument brought forth by more and more defence officials every day).
However, last year's accusations have raised the question of how much President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis points.
Critics on the reflection of Islamic State intelligence began as Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote an article saying that despite the objections of many analysts, President George W. Bush's administration had held a small force in Iraq and had not thought long enough about the post-accession in 2003, and has been discussed for more than ten years.
Mr. Hooker also played an important role in the uprising of Islamic State intelligence.
Officials have concluded that despite Mr. Hooker's team's public statements last year, air raids against the refinery held by the Islamic State have built temporary refinerys to sell oil on the black market, which has not affected the terrorist group's financial resources significantly.
However, as The Times stated in September, this finding did not leave Central Command.
Centcom's commander at the time, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised last year for being viewed by many lawmakers as a very positive assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April and replaced him by General Joseph L. Votel at Central Command.
U.S. Women's Grass Hockey Team Prepared to Face Britain Wins Fourth Victory Back
The day after Katie Bam scored three goals in a 6-1 victory against Japan, the United States scored the first two goals of women's field hockey team in the United States on Thursday, when Americans beat India 3-0.
Although five goals appear to require a memorable feat in two games, Bam (27) said he was not sure if he had ever done the same before.
He said, "I have no idea."
I'm not one of those people who keeps track of their goals.
What he knows is that Americans lead 4-0 in the Olympic tournament and share the first ranking in the group with Britain, which is undefeated after defeating Japan 2-0 on Thursday.
Britain and the United States will face each other on Saturday for the final game of the first round.
Both teams have won the quarterfinals, and the match will determine who will finish the six-team games first and second.
The first team to finish the band's games will not be facing another strong Dutch team, the leader of another group, for a little longer when the quarter finals begin.
After Saturday's match, however, the Americans were sensational after the London Olympics, where they came last of the 12 teams.
Bam was on this team.
He grew up in Blue Bell, Pa. He was three years old when he first picked up his field hockey stick (his twin sisters were interested in this sport at Drexel) and became the youngest player on the team to join the national team at the age of 16.
He missed the 2008 Olympics because he didn't make it to the last cast.
Then came 2012, when most things didn't work out for him and his teammates.
The following year, a British coach Craig Parnham was appointed and things began to change.
Bam says, "A cultural change, a mental change, a physical change."
We don't work like we do in London anymore.
We've been completely transformed.
Thursday night, Bam scored the first issue of the first half with a close backhand.
India hadn't won yet in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough enough to keep the score 1-0 until Bam's third quarter.
To the left of the field, he made a long run with the ball, and then he curled up and threw the ball into the fort and put the Americans 2-0.
Melissa Gonzales scored the final goal in the middle of the fourth quarter.
This was the first time in the first three victories that U.S. goalkeeper Jackie Briggs didn't score in the tournament.
He got lucky.
So does Bam.
Parnham said, "We're in a good place right now," but how good this place is depends on the outcome of Saturday's game.
Trambolin Order in the Middle of the Olympic Growth
No matter where you are, no matter what time it is, the Olympics continue.
The events in Rio de Janeiro represent an ambitious competition and work, as if it will never end or be avoided.
The Olympic torch itself is like a flaming baton from swimmer to gymnast to triathlonist.
You can't watch TV, read the newspaper, or listen to what your neighbor says in a café without hearing anything about the conflict between Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And there's Logan Dooley.
Mr. Dooley, who attended the Olympics for the first time, could be sponsorships and TV ads that encourage you to feel good, a dimpled heartbeat ball, such as a swimmer, gymnast or fencing, could be one of the names shown during prime time.
However, Mr. Dooley (28) from Lake Forest, California is fighting for the gold medal in the trampoline at the Olympics.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event equally.
There are spores that are partially unrecognizable in the shade: air rifle shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We'll always have the frogry, and I hope it lasts a long time.
But, personally, I'd like to point out the secret magic of the trampoline.
Although the trampoline has been known as an Olympic event since 2000 when it was introduced in the Sydney Games, few in 16 years have realized it was an Olympic sport.
This could be regional ignorance.
The United States has sent athletes for its competition, but has never won a medal on the trampoline, and has never had an ever-greatest contestant to the finals until 2012.
The men's prizes were the Chinese and the Russians', the women's, the Chinese and the Canadians'.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will try to protect the gold medals they received in London this year.
The trampoline, however, points out that it is an extremely oppressed event, which may be partly because the unconscious ears think that it is worthy of clown school rather than Olympics.
I have to admit, I'm not an expert here, I'm just interested.
It has a funny potential, but it also reflects the elegance of gymnastics and diving, which is basically the two sports that it brings together.
The word "tramboline" comes from the Spanish word el trampolin, meaning "tramplen."
Champion candidates jump almost 30 feet above the air on a large trampoline and are asked to make a series of moves (burkma, pike and salto) before they land on their feet.
According to the official Olympic programme, they are assessed according to execution, difficulty and "time of flight."
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries in Rio, 16 men and 16 women, will fight.
The most common progress in the Olympics is directly advanced.
Those who hope to receive a medal must, in some cases, go back and forth to the end of their search for gold, and in some cases, move further and further, faster and higher.
They're not just after the finish line or the starting wall, but there's also another tough line on TV; the world or the Olympic record.
This tenacious effort is noble, envious, and even extreme, enough to make even an audience burst into tears.
But that's exactly what I find a little exhausting watching the games.
The trampoline allows you to take a break from all this.
The ones on the trampoline move upwards.
Their goal is not to move forward.
It jumps up, looks weightless like an astronaut, goes up, goes down, and goes up again without effort.
Of course, it's not a competition or a challenge, but during the routine, there's no fevered work to achieve results, there's no getting lost at a distance, just the elegant suspension of time and gravity, like imagination.
The more still an Olympic race can be, the more still it can be.
Women's rankings and finals will then be held Friday afternoon at 1 p.m. Eastern time; men on Saturday at 13 again.
NBC will broadcast the finals in the afternoon, starting at 2:00 p.m.
In the middle of the Olympic craziness, they promise a quiet and wonderful moment that can be ignored in general conflict.
And we can say that Mr. Dooley is waiting for his new fans, if consciousness, as The Wall Street Journal recently suggested by the United States male gymnasts, is going to increase by simply offering male athletes to eyeball and objectify them.
"In a Generation Protest" in Ethiopia, a longtime Allied to the United States.
Violent Protests in Ethiopia
Protesters demanding political change in Ethiopia faced severe government resistance.
Witnesses say several protesters received fatal gunshot wounds in a police shootout.
Is Ethiopia about to collapse?
Over the past decade, he has been one of Africa's most stable nations and a strong ally for the West with his rapidly growing economy.
However, anti-government protests over the past few months have shaken the country, spreading more and more throughout the region.
Only last week, thousands of people went out to the street and demanded basic political change.
According to human rights groups, the government's reaction was pretty brutal.
Witnesses said police officers shot and killed several unarmed demonstrators.
Late last year or early this year, protest footage shows security officials whipping young people who had to keep their hands up against a wall.
The top UN human rights official wants a thorough examination now.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country together and it will be much harder to move forward," said Rashid Abdi, project director of the Somali Peninsula of the International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia, after Nigeria, the population of Africa is one of the highest nations, and its stability is appreciated by the West.
US military and intelligence services have been working closely with Ethiopians to deal with terrorist threats in the region, particularly Somalia, and there are few countries in Africa that have this much help from the West.
Ethiopia's economy is growing dramatically.
The infrastructure has been effectively improved; there is even a new suburban train in the capital, Addis Ababa.
And their streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Although the best example of democracy was not exhibited in Ethiopia (human rights groups constantly refer to the government's oppressive stance) the domestic opposition was very limited, the opponents were effectively silenced.
Many were exiled, imprisoned, killed, or banished to the furthest corners of the desert.
However, that may be about to change.
Seyoum Teshome, a university professor from Central Ethiopia, said, "If you drown people and offer them no choice but to protest, these events will happen."
Youth is in full protest.
A generation of protests.
There are many complaints from land use to pressure from the ruling coalition on power.
After last year's election, the ruling party and its allies also took the last seat filled by the opposition, and now they can control 100 per cent of parliament.
At the same time, tensions are increasing at the border with Eritrea, the sharp and controversial line that led to the war, which killed hundreds of people in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, will be rearmed by exploiting this turbulence in recent years.
There are a number of factors that explain why the pain that has been boiling beneath the surface for years is now exploding.
The first one looks innocent: smartphones.
As cheap smartphones became common and the Internet service was provided, only a few years ago, a large number of Ethiopians began communicating with social media.
Even when the government shut down access to Facebook and Twitter, especially as it often did during the protest, most people were able to communicate through Internet proxy servers hiding their positions.
A few young Ethiopians said they were gathered in this way for protests.
Second, solidarity has also increased between the Oromos and the Amharas, two major ethnic groups of Ethiopia.
Oromos and Amharas are not normally allies.
For a very long time, the Amharas had been taking advantage of oromos, mostly Muslim and flatlands, who had been dominantly Christian in the mountains of Ethiopia, leading to politics and business.
But that's changing.
Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of Oromo, said, "We are gathering under an umbrella and moving forward to co-operate."
The largest protests have been seen in Amhara and Oromo regions.
Many of Amhara and Oromo believe that Ethiopia was unfairly dominated by members of the Tigrayan ethnic group, which constitutes about 6% of the population and dominates military, intelligence services, trade and policy.
The third reason behind the unrest was the death of Meles Zenawi.
Former rebel leader Mr. Meles served as Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died of an unexplained disease in 2012.
He was thought to be a tactical genius who saw that everyone couldn't see.
Analysts say he is particularly expert in identifying first signs of unrest and calming and neutralising rivals.
"The current regime does not have that basic information," said Mr. Abdi, a combat analyst.
Hailemariam Desalegn, the new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, was chosen in relative uncertainty to replace Mr Meles.
Unlike Mr. Meles from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam is from the south.
Analysts say he has failed to gain the confidence of security services controlled by the Tigrayans.
As a result, more blood was spilled with more fear.
Ethiopia's latest experience in this kind of confusion was a protest by thousands of analysts after a sloppy election by the government in 2005.
In the following measures, many protesters have been killed less than last month, and this period of confusion has passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new suburban train, and for significant progress in fighting poverty.
However, it is clear that this does not stop the growing hatred of the Ethiopian government.
And it's becoming dangerous and ethnic.
Last month, protestors in the Amhara town of Gondar attacked businesses owned by the Tigrayans, and Tigrayan hatred also increases in social media.
The protests left other allies in the United States and the West in an awkward position, analysts say.
The U.S. government used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighbouring Somalia, but it was recently reportedly shut down.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally to be torn apart in a fragile region.
Mr. Abdi said, "It" and added, "It's like walking on a very thin rope."
Donald Trump Explains Obama's Accusation About ISIS
On Friday, Donald J. Trump insisted several times last week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were "founders" of the Islamic State terror group and tried to eliminate the latest conflict around his campaign, claiming it was not serious.
This statement raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate's ability to communicate openly with the American people.
It also puts it in a strange position when they try to explain that that's not what they're implying, and that's not what they're trying to do to defend him in the process that created this turmoil.
After making this suggestion at a rally Wednesday night, Mr. Trump insisted Thursday that the president and Mrs. Clinton actually implied that ISIS was founded by the president and Mrs. Clinton in interviews by further strengthening his thesis.
But early Friday morning on Twitter, Mr. Trump said he made a sarcastic statement.
In a series of interviews, the post showed that Mr. Trump had taken a full step back from the day before, when he expressed that he was serious about this accusation.
A conservative radio programmer, Hugh Hewitt, reminded Mr. Obama that he wanted to destroy ISIS, and when he tried to help Mr. Trump soften that comment, the Republican presidential candidate said he didn't believe it.
Mr. Trump, after the polls went down, the latest chaos arose as he tried to change the focus of his campaign.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton had a conflicting conversation about economics in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr. Trump wanted to get back to it.
He spoke on Twitter again, expressing that Ms. Clinton's proposals would increase taxes and that he found his speech boring.
Mr. Trump has used his sarcasm defense before.
By the end of July, after showing an appearance of the Russians suggesting that Ms. Clinton attack on her e-mails, she said, "Of course, I said it sarcasticly."
This approach allows Mr. Trump to push the boundaries of political speech and step back where necessary.
Ruth Sherman, a telecommunications expert who follows the language both candidates use, said, "It's a pattern that tests how certain messages are reacting by those who support her, and that allows her to "explain" in some way, depending on the reaction.
But at the same time, he makes these statements on purpose, and he knows that from different lenses, it's vague enough to filter.
Mr. Trump has adopted a far more aggressive attitude, rather than softening the mood for the general election audience, as he has recently fallen in the polls.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist survey published on Friday showed that Mr. Trump was way behind Mrs. Clinton in North Coraline, Virginia and Colorado, and that there was a tight race in Florida.
Although Mr. Trump usually refrains from apologizing for the provocative things he says, he accuses his critics of twisting his words or not understanding his humor.
However, Mr. Trump's jokes, which have been subjected to much more scrutiny in the last months of the presidential campaign, have left his loyal supporters in a position to support him in public, no matter how provocative his comments are.
Former mayor of New York City Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of Mr. Trump's most prominent supporters, did his best to defend the candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
When asked about the veracity of Mr. Trump's thesis that Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton founded the Islamic State, Mr. Giuliani said, "I think he's making a legitimate political criticism."
In some sense, before Obama, ISIS was an unknown, small organization, those who found them adorable were completely wrong, and that happened because of the withdrawal of soldiers from Iraq.
Most prominent Republicans are trying to argue that Ms. Clinton's foreign ministry, the Obama administration, failed to deal with the situation in the Middle East aggressively and caused ISIS to grow.
Prior to Friday's meetings in Pennsylvania, Trump continues to accuse the news media of twisting every word on Twitter and being biased against him.
He made fun of the "poor, pathetic" television experts who were trying to figure him out and said, "They can't do that!"
Some Democrats mocked Mr. Trump's alibi, saying it was evidence that he was not fit for president.
Once Again With Us in Cafe Greenpoint, Who Can't Deal With Prices
In Williamsburg, an old cash-only place, Verb Cafe Wi-Fi, did not offer a connection, but served a great cup of coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, he couldn't handle the prices at his store on Bedford Avenue.
Soap Cherie sells cupcake-shaped soaps that replace Verb in the summer of 2014.
Local residents complained that it was the last loss of the well-concerned city.
"New York is a change, I know that, but I still can't believe CBGB is gone and the Chelsea Hotel has been evacuated and Verb is now a soap store."
But New York is the city of re-invention as well as change.
Last November, a fresh Verb Cafe opened in Greenpoint less than a mile from its original position in the north.
The new Verb Cafe has a Wi-Fi connection and accepts credit cards, but it maintains some former employees and similar simple air.
Coffee's still good.
The new Verb is led by Cisco Rodriguez, the long-term employee of the old cafe, the owner and general manager of the new place.
He joined Verb in 2001 and stayed until the end.
When a client offered him funding for this new place, he said he'd be thrilled to do it.
Mr. Rodriguez (36) left most things the same.
Verb uses the same distributor for bagels and bought an espresso machine from the same model.
In fact, the old Verb's lights were reused here.
But Mr. Rodriguez said he'd like to offer a little variety of experiences.
He added new materials.
Bacon-egged-and-cheese sandwiches are on the menu, and they're served like capapi and sautéed onions.
They have brown rice bowls.
The cafe doesn't serve beer anymore, but it serves fresh juice.
Nine months later, Mr. Rodriguez said he noticed that the former regulars had begun to arrive decisively.
He said, "A lot of our former clients couldn't handle the prices in Williamsburg."
Last Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was one of the customers.
Mrs. Oliveira (34) lived in Williamsburg and often went to Verb.
Even after he moved to Greenpoint, he didn't stop going down that road.
He said he stopped drinking coffee for a while after Verb closed.
He said, "I realized what I like is coffee and culture in Verb."
Now he's drinking coffee again, but the other day, instead of his regular iced coffee, he chose a new combination of chia.
Another regular, Tom Rosenthal, has been to Verb regularly since 2003.
He'd go there before work and order the same thing all the time.
He said, "Every day at a quarter past seven, I'd walk in without a hitch, and they'd make my daily order of butter bagels."
The photo, Mr. Rodriguez, said he wanted to make a change and added new ingredients to the menu.
These days, Mr. Rosenthal is still taking his usual order, but sometimes he changes it a little bit by adding bacon, eggs and cheese to his daily order of bagels.
Mr. Rodriguez said he wasn't offended by the soap store that replaced the old place.
As a matter of fact, Soap Cherie's owners offered to make a special soap for Verb using the cold brewed coffee from the cafe.
Mr. Rodriguez said, "I think we can still take that offer."
And the traditional Polish inhabitants of Greenpoint adopted this cafe.
One of the new customers translated the menu into Polish, and Mr. Rodriguez said his new neighbors would soon find a place to display this menu to make them feel better.
There are other advantages to the new position.
The local juice store wants to bottle and sell cold brewed coffee.
There's a possibility that the cafe will expand to the adjacent building.
For most customers, it's enough to have a new Verb that they can find their old favorites.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer, and he was very upset after the place was shut down.
When the new place opened, Mr. Whitt said it made him feel at home that he could go in and get coffee.
He said, "I had to smell this."
In the book "A Square Deal"
In March 1933, just after his seat as president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down to lunch in the Oval Office.
President Roosevelt, a man who was fond of his throat, loved food like foie gras and maryland turtle soup.
The menu on that day was much more modest: boiled eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and prune pudding for dessert.
Jane Ziegelman said, "This was an act of solidarity with those who were in distress over food."
His wife Andrew Coe added: "It was also a message to the Americans about how to eat."
Couple from Brooklyn Heights, food historian.
Mr. Coe's latest book, "Chop Suey," was about Chinese cuisine in America, and Mrs. Ziegelman, in her book "97 Orchard," described life in slums in the Lower East.
The new book they worked with, "A Square Meat," which will be published by Harper on Tuesday, describes the history of American food during the Great Depression.
They also showed solidarity over food and met with a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg Sandwich Bar in the Flatiron region, which has existed since 1929, the year the crisis began.
Mrs. Ziegelman (54), while ordering cream cheese and olive sandwiches, Mr. Coe (57), chose to place turkey, mashed potatoes and vegetables.
The couple found the reporter's meatloaf order appropriate to discuss crisis-era meals.
Mrs. Ziegelman said, "The nuts were very popular."
It had peanut nuts, liver nuts, dry bean nuts.
These were made from something cheap, which spreads material with material.
Imagine eating enough peanuts for dinner.
Mr. Coe, he's got a sour face.
He said, "He must have been sitting in your stomach like a bullet."
In the years before the crisis, especially in rural areas, the dishes in America were like buffets.
Women cooked for men who worked on farms and served freshly baked pies for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
In World War I, Americans were sending food to starving Europeans, and "A Square Deal" explains the history of how the nation is not suddenly the center of prosperity.
While Mr. Coe explained the reason why he and his wife wanted to write about it, he said, "This was a period when food became a central concern for Americans."
The new budget regime was equally alarming: mysterious foods such as nuts and casseroles became a basic consumption product, which Mrs. Ziegelman said was "a great way to evaluate the remaining foods" so that the cooks could hide the low appetite concealing ingredients with a cream sauce coating.
Fresh fruit was replaced by dried fruit, which was cheaper.
Over the years, the meat found at the center of American food has become a luxury shared with a thrift.
Interesting mixtures of calories and nutrients have been tried and the sense of satisfaction has been overcome by taste or general cuisine.
While Mrs. Ziegelman was researching her book with recipes, she prepared an onion dish in a peanut butter-filled oven from that period.
"This was not a popular contribution at the dinner table," Mr. Coe said.
Mrs. Ziegelman supported it: "It was surreal."
Peanut butter has nothing in common with the onion in the oven.
In most household economies, that was an outstanding feature.
From 1923 to 1943, home economics experts, including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics, manipulated the country's eating habits as never before.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to be "collected" and popularized the struggle to turn pastries, such as carrot creamed spaghetti, into delicious foods.
"A Square Meat" is a feast of historical delicious bites.
President Herbert Hoover's responses to hungry citizens, such as the attitude to let me eat cake, are highly appetizing.
While he praised the public for the simple Iowa farmer's food as a child, he was eating like a millionaire intellectual.
Mr. Coe said, "She liked to eat European cuisine flavors like fish in salad sauce."
He was eating in a dining room, almost completely gold-plated, wearing jackets that fit his dinner.
It was far from the truth.
If his wife Eleanor hadn't encouraged him to set an example with his stomach, President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake.
According to the book, Mrs. Roosevelt's hiring an aide who doesn't care about flavor has begun to serve not only the saddest foods ever prepared at the White House, but also the saddest dishes prepared.
After the country rose to its feet again, many of the methods of cooking during the crisis were left aside.
According to Mrs. Ziegelman, calorie and nutritional understanding continue and the way science is applied to cooking.
In writing the book, the couple stated that Mrs. Ziegelman learned much from her mother's eating habits -- for example, she could never throw food away.
Mr. Coe said, "The waste of food really freaked him out."
Mrs. Ziegelman spoke of her old memories: "It has really made people sick."
There was a crème de crème de crème de crème.
After the dishes were gathered in Eisenberg, he and Mr. Coe took out a dessert that they had prepared at home: the plum pudding that President Roosevelt had for lunch.
Mrs. Ziegelman said, "It's called whipped prunes," and added that the most frequently applied number was to give these modest recipes a cool name.
There was no whipped cream; just prunes, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone hesitated to dive into the spoon of brown goo.
Surprisingly, it wasn't so bad.
Mr. Coe took the second and third spoon.
He said to his wife, like someone who could be saved, "I could use a piece of chopped walnut."
Gilead will receive legal fees in the fight against Merck's Hepatitis C patent
According to the U.S. district judge, Gilead Sciences Inc has earned the right to receive legal fees for the Hepatitis C patent case with drug manufacturer Merck & Co Inc.
After discovering that US judge Merck had committed a series of misdeeds involving perjury and other unethical practices, Gilead was dismissed from paying $200m in damages for the violation of two Merc patents related to Sovaldi and Harvoni, which had achieved a great success in June of Gilead.
At Thursday's hearing, US District Judge Beth Labson Freeman stated that Gilead has the right to be compensated for the fees made during the defence.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, the market judge, with a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90% of liver patients.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and claimed ownership of the laboratory work for Sofiasbuvir, the active ingredient of Gilead's drugs.
US-backed forces say Membic's control is entirely from the Islamic State
On Friday, the group spokeswoman said the US-backed forces have taken full control of the northern city of Membic, near the Turkish border, the last Islamic State fighters inside the city.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDG) are also in the process of cleaning the city after the departure of a group of militants hiding in the city.
Şarfan Dervis of the Membic Military Council, an alliance with the SDG, told Routers that they had released over 2,000 civilian hostages in the hands of militants.
He told Routers, "The city is now completely under our control, but we're conducting clean-up operations."
The Clinton family made $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2% federal tax.
Hillary Clinton announced on Friday the 2015 tax statement that Democrats' candidate and wife made $10.75m last year and paid 34.2% federal tax in force.
In 2015, the Clinton family contributed $1 million to charities, most of them to the Clinton Foundation, where former President Bill Clinton made about $5.3m in speech fees, and the former foreign minister announced that he had earned $3m in income for his book, which was released from the foreign ministry.
Clinton's candidate friend, Senator of the United States, Tim Kaine of Virginia, has issued a 10-year tax return with his wife, Anne Holton.
In 2015, they paid 20.3% federal tax.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Caine continue to set the standard for financial transparency," Clinton campaign official Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
On the contrary, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and backs down on his earlier tax returns.
Although it does not require law, it is customary for US presidential candidates to submit their tax returns publicly.
Trump and his lawyers, a New York businessman, said the reason the release of the statements was rejected was an audit conducted by the IRS.
In connection with the Democratic candidate's statements, Clinton campaign official Ian Sams tweeted "You're Up."
On Thursday, Trump's special prosecutor, Michael Cohen, told CNN he would not allow Trump to publish them until the inspections are complete.
In 2012, the group criticised the Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and Trump, including other Republicans, adding that his rejection poses questions about his self-existence, contributions to charities, business agreements and many other links, including those with Russia.
On Friday, Clinton went over it by posting an online video showing the top Republicans were pressuring Trump to explain their taxes.
On Thursday, he voiced this problem in an economic speech in Michigan.
He said to the crowd, "He refuses to do what every presidential candidate has done for decades, to publish his tax returns."
Politico reported that Trump had paid almost no taxes for two years in the 1990s, and on Friday, the New York Times business department columnist shared statements that a number of tax lawyers and accountants might still be in this situation.
Federal tax rates have become a major problem in the presidential election.
Clinton offered a rule proposal named after billionaire investor Warren Buffet, who will pay taxes at at least 30 per cent of those making over $1 million a year.
President Obama supports the offer.
Last week, at a Clinton rally in Omaha, Nebraska, the Berkshire Hathaway group challenged Buffett to come to Trump, where he worked and submit his tax return.
Buffet said he was also passing IRS control and Trump was "afraid" of voters, not the tax collection agency.
Clinton published tax returns in his campaign until 2007.
The Clinton family, currently living in Chappaqua, New York, paid about 32 per cent of the average federal tax from 2007 to 2014, and the combined tax rate reaches about 40.5%.
The Clinton family statement for 2015 shows that, unlike most Americans, only about $100 of their income comes from wages.
Their main investment is a low-cost index investment fund, and the Clinton family has stated that the deposit and interest revenues are $109,000.

Dust red pepper condoms, firecrackers, support the protection of elephants in Tanzania
Environmentalists in Tanzania use an unusual method to prevent elephants from entering human settlements, throwing condoms filled with powdered red peppers.
The method was proven to be effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation and the U.S.-based Nature Protection Association, which came up with this idea a few years ago, took a step to introduce it, and began training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use four steps of nonviolent, nonviolent method of protecting their homes and crops without harming animals.
Most people used spears to defend themselves before.
Friday is the World Elephant Day dedicated to protecting animals.
"Since we developed the set of vehicles, we have seen a change of attitude in these communities; they are now more confident that they can keep elephants off their land without harming the elephants," said Damian Bell, executive director of Honeyguide.
The first two steps include holding lanterns and honking the passing elephant.
When that's not possible, what's called a red pepper cloud is thrown out.
The dust mixed with the soil is put in the condom with a firecracker, only the fuse is sealed open.
When it's burned, the condom opens with the sound of an explosion, and the air is sprayed with powdered red peppers.
Even one breath can send elephants in the opposite direction.
The last resort is to use a catapult that launches fireworks into the air, causing a loud, bright explosion.
The Jewish filmmaker knocked over the hotel in Berlin, which lifted Israel's phone code on the Arab demand - RT News
A French filmmaker of Jewish origin sparked media sensations after revealing that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin did not list Israel's phone code and that the employee had proposed the Arab clients' demands.
Claude Lanzmann, a writer of the "Shoah" documentary on genocide, expressed his rage at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin in an open letter to the German broadcaster FAZ.
In his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the list of phone codes provided by the hotel.
However, the country was not one of the countries that could be searched directly from the room.
In 2016, how can Israel be eliminated and destroyed in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany?
It did, Lanzmann.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers the opportunity to search Israel through its own call centre.
The filmmaker reported the situation to the hotel reception to get a statement.
Lanzmann wrote that his response "shocked him."
The hotel's secretary said the measure was taken with "a deliberate decision by the Kempinski-Hotels administration."
The underlying reason for this movement has made the filmmaker much more angry.
According to Lanzmann, the employee said, "Most of our guests wanted the code of the Arab and Israel erased."
According to Suddeutsche Zeitung, Israel's ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman described the situation as "a great shame."
We were horrified and surprised by this situation.
It's a real shame.
It's a much bigger disgrace that this happened in Germany and in a hotel chain like this.
There's no need to explain it.
We expect the hotel to have the necessary results," he said.
The incident sparked a huge response online; people described it as a scandal.
Some have accused the Kempinski Hotel of "blowing" the so-called demands of Arab clients.
In another post, the statement "You should be ashamed" was highlighted on Kurfurstendamm street near a synagogue near the hotel.
According to Der Spiegel's report, the hotel quickly dismissed these charges by saying it was a result of "indulgence" and "apologizing" to Lanzmann.
One of Kempinski's representatives said "there was never a direct order not to be included in Israel's speed dial."
And now they've added the code.
Police used pepper spray and rubber bullets against Brazilian protest students
Students gathered in Sao Paulo, Brazil on Thursday to demonstrate reforms against the government's public education system clashed with police.
Police used pepper spray and rubber bullets against protesters.
The problem started when police officers tried to disband the students, which led to police using plastic bullets and pepper spray.
Hundreds of students participated in the demonstration to express their dissatisfaction with the plans.
According to the offer made by Governor Geraldo Alckmin of Sao Paulo, less than 100 public schools will be closed for savings and 300,000 students will be distributed to other schools.
Some of the people who participated in the protest were found writing on the walls against the interim President Michel Temer.
This latest protest took place a few days after protesters went out in crowds to support President Dilma Rousseff, who was suspended by the country's Senate vote.
Trade between Russia and Iran has risen to 71% - RT Business
According to Russian Ambassador to Iran Levan Dzhagaryan, the trade turnover between the removal of sanctions and Moscow and Tehran grew by 70.9 per cent year-on-year.
Since international sanctions against Iran have been lifted, Russian companies doing business in the country have grown largely, the ambassador said.
As new companies prepare to provide access to the market, Russian companies continue to maintain existing ties with Iran.
Of course, increasing trade is one of the main priorities of our bilateral co-operation with Iran," Dzhagaryan said.
In the first five months of 2016, he said the trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9% in 2015 compared to the same period, and reached $856m.
In particular, Russia's exports to Iran increased by 91.5 per cent to $697m.
Russia's imports from Iran increased by 16 per cent to 158m dollars.
This increase in trade has been provided with machine, ground tools and waste supplies for weapons," the envoy said.
Dzhagaryan also expects a record number of Iranian tourists to come to Russia this year.
Last year, Russia's diplomatic mission in Iran gave Iranian citizens 35,000 visas, mostly for travel.
Furthermore, Iran was among the top 20 countries to visit Russia for the first time.
"We can say that the Iranian tourist record for visiting Russia last year will be broken."
At the same time, relatively less Russian visits Iran - something the envoy hopes to change.
"I personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yezd, where the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization are well-placed," he said.
Cash from İzmir - Economic News
Strange details about Abdullah Kavuk and Ahmet Küçükbay Group Chairman Ahmet Küçükbay, who were detained for providing financial support to Å.
It has been determined that the funds in İzmir are number 1 and 2, and that Küçükbay and Kövuk are regularly sending large money to Fetullah Gülen, the leader of the PDY terrorist organization.
It has been determined that the money sent to Gulen to keep it off the record was not deposited through the banks, but through an organization member courier.
On the other hand, nine people have been arrested in Amassian province, including Merzifon Chamber of Commerce and Industry President Fatih Altınay, who have been taken into custody as part of the investigation into the coup attempt, have been released on probation.
In the ten-year term, 30,000 liras are in the pocket.
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's call to "take down the interest" has moved the banks to action.
It was suggested that the banks would be included in the campaign attack launched by the Real Estate and later attended by Gyoder.
The proposal for lowering mortgage interest rates, considered a psychological limit, was also made by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
13 banks have reduced mortgage interest to less than 1%.
Public banks started the sale fair.
Given the monthly interest rates that previously ranged from 1.12 per cent to 1.29 per cent, the consumer will pay between 15 and 30 billion euros, using a 10-year mortgage.
5 YEARS WITH 10 YEARS
And how much advantage does interest reductions give to home buyers?
A person using a 10-year-old loan of 100,000 lira will take advantage of the decline in interest.
The majority of those who use mortgages choose a 5-10-year-old payment plan.
In the coming days, interest rates are expected to drop further.
The interest reduction will also affect the sale.
In 2015, housing sales increased by 10.6 per cent compared to the previous year, making 1 million 289,000.
Sales are expected to exceed 1.5 million this year with interest rates.
GYODER President Aziz Grandson: Should be reduced to below 9% per year
It's an important step for public banks to go to interest reductions.
They listened to our president's call and lowered interest.
But that should go below 9% a year.
If this reduction process continues, we're thinking of extending the 0.70 interest campaign we started for a few months.
Lamb Group Special Lamb: Our campaign may last three months
The fact that the banks participate in this initiative, which we have limited as a month, may bring up at least three or four months longer the duration of this historic campaign.
But loan interest has to go below 9% year-on-year.
And it's a pleasure to see that with the positive psychology and unprecedented solidarity that this will only create in the housing sector and the real market, every sector has sacrificed housing for citizens.
Polat Holdings YKB Adnan Polat: We expect full support from banks
It's a good step towards our president's call to the banks for interest reductions.
Other than that, there are steps taken in all sectors to bring the economy back to life.
The NGOs' campaigns, the Central Bank's decision, and all the steps taken in this direction are for the country...
All banks need to put their hands on the ground.
Come and join this campaign, along with us, along with us, and together, we say, let's bring the economy to life.
$5.5 billion investment from the plowman in a year and a half.
In the first six months of this year, Sabanci Holding increased its net profit by 11 per cent compared to the same period last year, raising its sales to $1 billion,353m, and up 22 per cent to 17 billion, 166 million.
Sabancı Holding Senior Manager (CEO) Zafer Surklu reported that they invested $1.8 billion in the first six months of the year and about $5.5 billion in the beginning of 2015.
"As a country, we have successfully passed a difficult turn in recent times."
"From now on, it's time for more work and production for our country."
2 years off the boat from Kabataş
The Kabataş ferry docks have been shut down for nearly two years due to the "Kabataş Square Editing, Transport Centre and the Construction of Piers" by İstanbul Metropolitan Municipality (İBB).
There will be a modern transfer center on the Kabastone coast that will integrate sea, rail system and road transport.
Traffic will be underground, streaming uninterrupted pedestrians along the coast.
The tram and the funicular systems will continue to run for a while.
Rings will be launched in order to ensure that citizens will be transported to the regions of Salim, Eminönu, Beşiktas.
The interest has fallen, the house has been raised
My friend, the manager of a public bank, texted me.
It's always the same thing.
The interest is going down, the house prices are going up.
The interest is going up, the house prices are going down.
"That's what happened again," he says.
It tells of the sensations that come to him because his work is about individual loans.
He says the developers entering a 0.70 interest-related campaign organised by the Real Estate House have increased prices in many housing projects.
I looked for any truth.
There's a lack of status, there's no more...
Meanwhile, I came to think of a conversation with a contractor who attended our newspaper's construction summit a week after the Fetullahist Terror Organization's coup attempt on July 15th.
He's the boss of a big firm...
When I heard from the contractor I wasn't going to name, I said, "You're actually going to have to increase prices by 10%," I said, "You're going to be a violent opportunist?"
Following the coup attempt, construction workers launched a major sales campaign with a bid of 0.70 interest and 120 months.
I admit, he put his hand under the stone before the banks, took the risk.
But since we're moving in the spirit of unity and unity to keep Turkey from slowing down.
The banks also supported your one-month campaign by lowering interest.
Well, then, no one should take advantage of a raise.
And warn those who do so among you.
President Erdoğan accepts Ömer Koç and Ali Koç
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has accepted President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Chairman of the Coach Holding Board of Directors Ömer Mehmet Koç and Deputy Director of Coach Holdings and President of the Ford Autosan Board of Directors Ali Koç.
Erdogan's admission to the press closed in the Presidential Chamber lasted 40 minutes.
Call from BDK: Report those banks
President Mehmet Ali Akben of the Banking Editing and Control Agency (BDK) issued a statement on President Erdoğan's warning to "request the credit" to banks.
"If banks turn calling back loans into opportunistics because of the market's conditions, we will not allow it."
Those who bring us such complaints and information, we call them, "Name the bank and company, and apply for the BDK complaint line."
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned the banks in his statement yesterday: "I say that a new era will be opened in front of our country, both investors and banks when interest is down and credit opportunities are expanded."
In this time of our country, let's just say that banks who call back loans with false excuses have set a line for themselves, let's just say that I want to announce that.
At 78% a year interest rates, banks also made money from these jobs.
More than 500,000 Russian tourists are expected
Turkey-Russian relations took a positive course ahead of the July 15 coup attempt, scheduled flights from Russia to Antalya began, and a certain revival occurred in tourism, said pro-Hotel Managers Association (POYD) President Ali Kızıldağ.
"I expect very positive developments for both tourism and agriculture and food and construction textiles and all sectors," Reddağ said, saying the meeting of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin excited the tourism sector as well as the trade sectors between the two countries.
Turkey and Russia are very close, and we have traditional relationships based on years.
"As sectors, which the leaders of the two countries have led, I think if we move too fast, we can close the distances and head towards the targets as soon as possible," he said.
Citing that without the coup attempt, the number of Russian tourists coming to Turkey would exceed 1 million, he added.
But we lost a month during what we call the high season, so we're looking at a reduction of target.
I still think that if the charter flights start, we'll go over 500,000.
There may also be a season that lasts until the end of October, even mid-November.
In such a case, there may also be additional flights to New Year's Eve.
I imagine this positive weather will be well assessed by the Russian people.
They also have a longing for Turkey.
With that acceleration, I'm thinking maybe we can push the 700,000.
Citing hope for the Russian market as well as 2017, Reddağ said that if the two countries' relations and the Russian economy recover, the number of Russian tourists could again rise to more than 3 million next year.
"There are returns on canceled reservations, new reservations are being taken," said POYD President Reddağ, adding that the curfew has been lifted.
He said, "We have a hopeful expectation of the feast of sacrifice."
"It would be very good if we could bring in 100-200,000 people from Iran in 1,2-2 months," he said, saying the removal of the ban on selling tour tickets to travel agencies by Iran after the coup attempt.
Renovate with current credits?
First of all, contact the bank where you have the loan, and find out how the new interest conditions have affected your loan.
You calculated from your bank the cost of using a new loan with a lower interest rate (about 1.5 per cent to 2 per cent of the amount used in general).
If you still have the advantage when all costs are included, you can apply for low interest loan use.
No breathing for Aslan!
Beşiktaş, the last champion, is aiming to win the Super Cup fight against Galatasaray and enter the new season with morale.
Coach Senol Sun, who set up all his plans for victory, met with his students and said, "We have to play ball and aggressively."
He said, "I'm expecting a high pass percentage and 90 minutes of ball control."
It has been learned that the Sun is undecided about Adriano and Quaresma, who are not interested in driving the players who have missed training, especially Sosa.
The experienced trainer tried Necip at the stoper during the week's training, but if Adriano plays left-handed, Tosic will be on the stoper.
Ricardo Quaresma and Kerim Frei also chose the Sun to have his students run the ball after a long break.
Tolga will explode - Sports News
Galatasaray President Dursun Uzbek answered the questions of the media members at the previous evening's dinner, sponsored by Galatasaray, and backed the foreign footballer Tolga Lungici, whose annual fee was also controversial.
I'M NOT GONNA TALK TO THE FUTBOLISTS.
Dursun Uzbek, who said the football team had become much better than last year, said, "However, football players should talk about this in the field, not in my case," adding: "I can't say anything."
Two or three weeks, let me see the teams, and I'll tell you our chance for a championship.
I'm waiting for an explosion from Tolga.
You'll see Tolga with his posture, his physique, he'll explode this year, everyone will be amazed.
Galatasaray's president stressed that he had contacted Mehmet Topal during the transfer period, but that they would step in if he did not agree with his club, and said: "We were not about to be loaded so that our opponent could raise the price."
Mehmet Topal is a gentleman, a decent athlete.
If he couldn't get along with his club, we'd want to transfer him to Galatasaray.
RIVA AND BANK BANKS WILL STOP
"We wanted to build a hall of 13,000 people," Uzbek said, saying they would start building a hall next to the TT Arena soon.
However, our president said, "Make a hall of 15,000 people."
We changed the project.
We'll pay off the bank loans with the money from Riva.
MAY AGAIN IS US
According to Galatasaray President Dursun Uzbek, who closed last season with the Turkish Cup, saying he believes that his team will demonstrate its quality against Beşiktas in the Super Cup final tomorrow, he made his bet with a slogan at the yellow-red club.
"The Mays are ours," said President Uzbek, adding that Galatasaray believes he will again be the champion after a year's break.
The curfew has been lifted.
The Club Association Foundation signed a historic decision at its meeting yesterday.
The meeting, where the July 15 coup attempt was the agenda, agreed to lift the ban on the awaysite.
From the new season, visiting team fans will take their seats in the bleachers during the four big ones and the Beşiktaş-Bursaspor match.
"We have decided to lift the curfews for the continuation of unity and unity following July 15th," said Foundation President Göksel Silverdağ.
"We believe that this unity and unity are far more important after the July 15th Martyrs of Democracy," he said.
On the other hand, the vote at the Association of Clubs Foundation said the current board would continue its mandate.
The head of the Galatasaray Club, Dursun Uzbek, was elected chairperson.
Contrary to previous meetings, it was noted that club flags were not present at the table.
To highlight Turkey's unity and unity, the table is equipped with Turkish flags.
"We're going to clean up our own yard"
"We can't afford to underestimate the formation of the People's Union of Clubs," Göksel Silverdağ said, saying that those who tried a vicious attack on Turkey's indivisible integrity found the great Turkish nation against him.
He said, "As a family of football, we have to clean and clean our own garden."
"Do you think of an organisation under the July 15th Democratic Cup?" said Silverdağ, "Especially the general opinion of friends regarding the name of the Turkish Cup."
"We're going to share this offer with TFF."
Target 25,000 combo.
Tripolispor will compete at his new stadium in the new season.
Master Muharrem, who is taking the day to move to Akyazı, has determined the combined prices by polling through social media.
The fans are expected to show intense interest in the combined sales, which aims to sell 25,000 combineds and 100,000 jerseys in the new season.
Master President, the target is 25,000 combining and over 100,000 uniforms.
Polls have agreed on the price of the back of the castle and the east/west bleachers.
Good luck with that.
He used the phrase, "You got the ball now."
The Bordo-Blue Club's new season combined prices were set as follows: "In the back of the castle, the combined cost of the lower-top bleacher is $350, the east is upside down, and the west stands are $750."
The new season jersey, worth 150 lira, was also offered as a gift to the combined areas, while students would be given a 30% discount in the second combination, and students would be given a 50% discount in the second combination.
SUNWORK REFERENCE OPENED
Tripolispor has agreed with South Korean Hyun Jun Suk on everything.
The player hired from the Porto Club for a year will receive a temporary transfer fee of 750 thousand euros.
The player will also be paid a million euros a year.
The player's purchase option has been set at 15 million euros.
Computed-booked fired
On June 11, 2015, F. Bahçe sent Pereira, who had been signed for two years, at the end of the first year.
President Aziz Yıldırım and the board of directors held a meeting, including the club's Financial Co-ordinator Tamer Yelkovan.
The economic dimension of the incident was discussed at the meeting.
The agreement with the UEFA reported that Yıldırım, who was sensitive to keeping "yearly damage" on a level, had been helped by Yelkovan on financial matters.
There's been contact with the representatives of Pereira.
He's been served to be relieved of duty.
2-2.5 MlLY ON EURO
There are still some points in financial matters that cannot be resolved, so the official statement will be made today or tomorrow.
She and her team went to practice with the team yesterday because they didn't make a formal statement.
The total cost of this operation was around 4 million euros.
However, the F.B.A. said it would provide a deal for the dissolution at a lower price.
If the F.B.A. pays Perez's fee in advance, he will finish the job at a price of between 2 and 2.5 million euros.
If Pereira doesn't agree, he'll be paid monthly.
If he makes a deal with a team, the payment will be cut.
Yes, in the end, Pereira left and the fan of Fenerbahçe had made a great revolution.
In the battle with Vitor Pereira, Caner Erkin, Luis Nani was martyred.
Robin van Persie was rescued with minor injuries.
I'll be glad Vitor Pereira's gone, I think our administration will find something worse.
My joy stays in my belly.
Now that Pereira's gone, the champion is Fenerbahçe.
Vitor Pereira, you can pack your suitcase in 3-5-2 and go now.
And now that Pereira's gone, on the 18th, to Kadıköy.
Serdar Cakir has been relieved of duty
Serdar Çakır, a senior referee observer at the Turkish Football Federation (TFF), has been found to have been suspended.
The deployment of Serdar Çakır, the father of our referee, Cüneyt Çakır, who currently served at the Rio Olympic Games, sparked controversy in the referee's community last year...
In TFF recently, the Central Referee Board (MHK), the Board of Investigations and the committees of representatives and observers had been re-established under the scope of the TFF.
A smiley face icon from Van Persie
At the time of her alleged termination, Dutch star Robin van Persie made an implied share of her own Facebook account.
Robin van Persie, who shared pictures of him from Fenerbahce training, put a football and a smile icon in a row.
"Pereira's happy to be gone," it was interpreted.
The first independent gold in history is Al-Deehani's.
Fehaid al-Deehani, first in the double trap category at the 2016 Rio Olympics, brought the first gold medal to independent athletes in the history of the games.
At the Olympic Shooting Center, medals were distributed in the double trap category.
El-Deehani, 49, who joined the Games with the Independent Olympic Athletes for the punishment of his country Kuwait, met Italian Marco Innocenti in the final of the double trap category.
El-Deehani, who scored 26-24, was the first to win the gold medal in the independent athletes' team at the Olympics.
I opened a door to the headscarfs.
"I respect those who play in bikinis, and my opponents respect their headscarf," said Egyptian Doaa Elghobashy, who fought as the headdress of women's beach volleyball at the 2016 Rio Olympics.
"I haven't had any problems with my headdress in the Olympics," Elghobashy said, adding that he wanted to break the perception of Islam's religion in the West in recent years.
Here, athletes struggle with their abilities.
I've been receiving positive messages from many countries in the Islamic world through social media.
Especially when women say, "You're encouraging us, we're proud of you."
I opened a door for the headscarfed women."
"They understand when I tell them that I'm going out wearing this dress because of my religion," said 20-year-old Egyptian Elghobashy, who sometimes came to you asking why foreign athletes were wearing closed clothes.
Kazakh Balandin has made history
One of the greatest surprises in the history of swimming was yesterday morning's victory by Kazakh Dmitriy Balandin.
Balandin won 2 minutes, 7 seconds and 46 salises in the 200m butterfly, the favorite American swimmers.
Josh Prenot of the United States, who brought the first swimming medal in Kazakhstan's history with gold, followed by Russian Chupkov at 2:07.53 a.m.
Sun: Let friendship take the lead
Beşiktaş Technical Director Shenol Sun has expressed a gentlemanly wish for a fight in the community as the Super Cup match would be the anniversary of Süleyman Seba's death.
"I believe that in these days, when we need friendship more than ever, we need brotherhood, not only in the field, but also in the bleachers, friendship will be at the forefront," the experienced trainer said.
The assets of the leader Gülen have been confiscated
The indictment against 17 suspects was filed against the Adana 2nd High Criminal Court, which had been prepared to raise its value in changes made irregularly in development plans by the People's Office for Terror-Technical and Organised Crimes.
In the case of the number-one defendant, Fetullah Gulen, on charge of "Attempting to Detribut the constitutional order," the tribunal has issued a warrant to arrest the defendants, Omar Ekcici, Kemal Elibal and Cemal Soncu, who have been on the run with Gulen.
However, the court has decided to conduct illegal proceedings for the four fugitives who have not been arrested and have not been to the hearings.
Following this, the Second High Criminal Court of Adana decided that all assets of Fetullah Gulen, Omer Ekci, Kemal Elibal and Cemal Soncu, who were in the foreign country to ensure that the case against them would be ineffective and therefore unable to reach him, should be seized under Article 278/1 of the Law on Trials (CMK).
With the court's decision, non-moving persons belonging to fugitive defendants in Turkey, land-sea and air transport vehicles, all rights and purchases, valuable documents, company shares with their partner, safe deposit boxes and bank accounts have been frozen.
Hussein Gular: The fall of Gülen depends on the collapse of three legs
Commenting on the coup attempt, Hüseyin Guler has made several dramatic statements.
Here are the headlines from Huseyin Gullar's statement:
As I thought they'd attempt a coup, I've written in my writings for the last five or six months, "They can handle it, but they can't do it in a chain of command."
I didn't know two things: the first one is that it's common and deep on this scale, for example, the general general general's 8-year commanding officer and the vice president's aide.
Mr. President, who struggles the most, who knows how he chooses his aides, but one of the most important things about them is a secret that has never been seen.
They're so hypocritical.
One of the most important proofs of "this is not the work of a retired preacher such as Ankara" is that there is such a deep conspiracy.
He's definitely getting support from the CIA.
The CIA got a hold of this person too early.
Mahmut Övür says in 2014 that in 1971, at Vehbi Koç's house, Fuat met with East and Fetullah Gulen.
The people who were most interested in these things at that time are saying that the relationship between the MIT and the CIA was the closest.
The U.S. paid for our armed forces staff, and then there was this guy who didn't remember.
When do we learn that, 2014?
After Mr. Mahmut's writing, there was no denying it.
Like the Fair Orphan, caught at the base, right?
Wondering who that is.
Guy's been to Pennsylvania twice in the last 25 days before the coup, returned two days ago.
Fair Orphan has been abroad 109 times since 2002.
When you put all this together, this needs to be investigated, which ones have gone to the United States on an excuse since March 1999, when all the fugitives are now going to Fetullah Gulen to the United States, which ones have gone to the United States on a basis, which needs to be investigated.
Apparently, they went to Pennsylvania for a reason.
But their real contact with the CIA can be identified from here, especially from people who need to be upgraded from the police, there have been a lot of people sent to the United States safely.
Wikileaks is in his papers; he's building a laughing association and he's holding joint meetings with the CIA.
Work has been done 15 years ago to make those connections to the CIA official.
I thought Fuat Avni was an intelligence pool in Pennsylvania two years ago.
The guy who works for the PM works for Fuat Avni.
But the bad news is, it fell to the CIA just like it did to Pennsylvania.
Gulen's collapse depends on the collapse of three legs; one is what we call the base, which is a friendly ring; there are those who are deeply hypnotized, who say that even this coup attempt is still Erdogan's film.
I was saying three feet, one base support.
The theft of the questions, theft, defeating the rights of the subject, has shaken the base's support.
The other two feet are political support, international support.
International support is still available.
The only thing that's going to break political support is that Baykal and the MHP executives' tapes are documented that they were taken by Å.
After 15 July, Mr. Kilicdaroglu also used the "Kıldaroğlu" and opened everyone's eyes.
A smiling poser says, "I don't do it, my surroundings do it."
Next to me, he says, "Oh, Mr. Hussein, these students are having so many different dreams, they're sending them to me, I've banned them now, because it's not right to do with dreams."
A recording fell, speaking on that audio tape, Barbaros Kocakurt: Teacher, friends have dreamt, double the tweets of our Prophet.
One police officer has been killed in Nusaybin
According to information, a long-barreled gun has been fired on the armored vehicle, where police are patrolling Saladin Eyubi neighborhood.
A police officer was killed in the first shot, a police officer injured.
Two terrorists were neutralized in a shootout after the police responded.
The injured police were taken to Nusaybin State Hospital.
There's an operation going on in the area.
The coupkers stalled the TV broadcasts
Special televisions, which had an important stake in preventing the coup attempt on the night of July 15th, continued broadcasting on Turksat, thanks to a technical staff who had a heroic resistance to coups.
That hero Asim Akkaya...
"I took the risk of thinking that my friends were martyrs in the fire from the helicopter," Akkaya said, saying they entered resistance psychology under orders to cut the broadcast during the reading of the declaration on TRT.
They put a gun to my head and asked me to cut the literature.
I just turned off the local TVs.
Then I told them to get away from the building by telling them we had to go to the satellite dish.
I spent about 20 minutes in the antenna section.
And he said, "Well, I cut some wires here again, but I didn't touch the literature."
When the coupkers failed to cut the broadcast in Turksat, they brought in the experts of the Milky Way TV.
These terrorists were caught by the cops who came to the scene three minutes ago.
Akkaya explained his experience when the coupkers returned to the building and realized that TV broadcasts were continuing on the phone that came to them about an hour later, and that he was face to face with death at the time.
I took over the night shift at 8:00.
We were in charge of that place.
A friend of mine was on call for the e-government and electrical system.
By the time we met for tea around 9:00 p.m., helicopters flew over us on a low flight.
There were several other aircraft flying low around the helicopter.
We saw their lights.
They were probably drones with visuals.
They were flying in front of the helipcopters.
I've been there for 11 years, and for the first time I've ever seen a flight this close, I called the guard.
Then there was a movement.
We were looking at the news, and we found out the bridge had been shut down.
At the time, our head of staff instructed the unscheduled associates of security to come to the building.
We were on our way to the guardhouse to get information when we found out that all his literature at TRT had dropped.
TRT broadcasts were cut off for five minutes.
I called the TRT main control, but I couldn't get through.
Our control station said the TRT broadcasts are coming back and the memo is being read.
Our Deputy Director-General Halil Yeşilçimen has requested that TRT broadcasts be cut immediately under the general manager's orders.
We started working to cut the feed because the TRT has made a large broadcast from 3 channels.
We just heard Prime Minister Bali Yıldırım say, "There's a rise."
Our director's order to cut TRT has put us in a bit of resistance psychology.
We cut the TRT, and after a while, we heard a helicopter.
We went out, the helicopter went down to the guardhouse, shot everywhere, everybody spread out.
We hid in a building in the back.
There were 12 of us.
When we got to the back, the soldiers who got out of the helicopter came in.
A few of our friends were captured by soldiers.
We showed up so we wouldn't leave them alone.
That's when I saw them grab our assistant director and bring him to his knees.
The soldiers were talking among themselves.
One of them said, 'Let's shoot one of them, and they'll be afraid.'
Then they put us all inside.
Their commander started yelling, "Who's in charge here, and I won't ask you again."
And when we heard the "let's shoot somebody" kind of talk, we thought, "We don't know about the country, but we got an order to cut off TRT."
So there's resistance.
That's when I felt like I was giving up my own life.
I said, "It's me."
I stood up in that moment, not knowing what to do.
All I could think about at the time was shooting at my friends at the station from the helicopter.
I thought 10-15 friends were martyrs at the station, and when I thought, "They're going to kill us eventually," a relief came upon me.
The commander at their command said, "You will cut all literature except TRT."
We have a system section that monitors local channels when they go to satellite.
We're broadcasting 80 of the 200 local channels from the room in question.
I thought of this room.
There was no national broadcast between them.
If I cut these off and tell them they've all been cut off, at least by then, the backup will come and get help from the outside.
Or I thought it would go as far as it went.
After all, we agreed that we couldn't get out of there.
I said, "Okay, I'll stop."
I cut off one of the local channel packages from the antenna.
I cut the power switch to the monitors we can monitor national channels.
So it would say no signal on all the screens.
I told them I had to go to the antennas so it could be cut off completely.
The commander sent me to the antenna with two soldiers.
I opened the antenna room, and one of the soldiers said, "Stay there."
He put the gun to my forehead.
He said, "You're gonna cut them all, there won't be any left, I'm gonna shoot one of you sooner or later, it's gonna be you."
And now that I've passed, I said, "You'll see it when you go, it'll all be frozen," and I didn't say anything else.
We broke into the station, and I stalled and cut the local literature.
We're on the other antenna.
At that time, I had a system that would correspond to about 20 national channels.
When I cut the local channels, about 20 monitors were lost.
My Lord has helped us so that We did not have any difficulty in answering their call, nor did We make them see.
They believed the answers we gave them.
They didn't.
That's a relief.
After they left the antenna, they asked where the transformer was.
I said, "I don't know if I'm a TV broadcaster." He said, "Is there an electrician among you?"
I said, "There's no electrician after work tonight, and if there's a malfunction, the crew will come."
Actually, there was an electrician at the time.
It occurred to me that I didn't interrupt the Cyprus broadcasts.
I was thinking of cutting them off to keep the soldiers busy.
They're a little relieved that they think the feed's been cut off.
They couldn't think of looking at the broadcasts.
The group's on hold now.
About an hour later, they turned on the TV in the waiting room, and they saw News A.
He's inside, soldier.
'My commander didn't cut the A News broadcast,' he said.
We had an eye-to-eye with the commander.
He said, "Get up."
I'm up.
At that moment, a soldier said, "There are still literature going on."
'There are channels broadcasting on Cyprus.'
I said, "They're broadcasting through Cyprus, we can't do anything to them."
"Then he raised us all up after he had spoken to some people, and he said, 'Go.'"
The coupkers escaped from Turksat in a van.
I saw pictures of the soldier who took me to the bathroom and gave me water and was executed in the seat of that van.
They shot him three times, shot him in the forehead and cheek.
My friends confirmed it was the same soldier.
They called that soldier "son" next to us.
He's probably a soldier now.
They could have executed him to get rid of him.
According to Asim Akkaya's statements, the first police team came to Turksat from Lakehead.
When the police found out that there were helicopters in the area, security guards were being scanned, they returned to the county to pick up ammunition.
They came back 40 minutes later.
When the police arrived, Turksat didn't see anyone outside the perimeter.
"The police have called us from the inside, we are Turkish-Sat personnel, we need to enter immediately," Akkaya told SETimes, describing the arrival of so-called experts from the Milky Way TV just three or four minutes later.
"When the police asked for ID, they rushed all four of them to their phones and called in "We've been captured."
After the Catacombs, the Mountainside Spirit
The EC Party will launch to Diyarbakır, Van and Mardin in early September with a large delegation of businessmen, artists, athletes and leaders including citizens in the region to establish "voluntary bridges."
The EC Party is preparing to move "The Spirit of the Yenikapi" to Diyarbakır following the bloody coup attempt on the PDY junta.
The aid campaign in Eastern and Southeast Anatolian regions ahead of the Festival of Sacrifices will also be invited by CHP and UMP mayors.
The EC Party, which will give the people of the region a message of "The State and the nation are with you," will provide help to poor families and needy people.
At the EC Party's last MYK meeting, the project on the Heart Bridge was discussed for the first time in Ramadan.
At a meeting that assessed the positive results of the terrorist-inflicted, needy families, especially young and children's project in the region, the decision was made to continue the Gonul Bridge at the Festival of Sacrifice.
Vice President of Civil Society Public Relations President Mehmet Muezzinoglu has begun his work.
According to this, 12 provinces in the East and Southeast will meet in Diyarbakır, Mardin and Van.
In these three counties, which are considered central, meetings will be held ahead of the holidays.
The events will include businessmen, artists, athletes and leaders of opinion.
At these meetings, the organisation of your help and work will be discussed.
At the feast of the sacrifice, committees of famous names will deliver the help to the citizens personally.
Youths and children will receive holiday allowance, and school needs will be provided after-season schools.
Sacrifices will be distributed to the needy.
Following July 15th, the national unity air between the EC Party, CHP and the MPP will also be reflected in the project.
CHP and UMP mayors of 12 counties, including the project, will be invited to participate in organisations.
Three parties will be able to conduct relief activities together.
The HDP is expected not to be invited, as it was in Yenikapı.
The father-in-law of Fair Orphan speaks.
Her mother-in-law was taken into custody and transferred to the courthouse, along with her father-in-law, Adil Orphan's father-in-law, who was listed as number 1 in the July 15 coup attempt.
Father-in-law Cevat Yıldırım and his mother-in-law Hatice Yıldırım were released on the condition of judicial control and ban on leaving the country.
Speaking at the courthouse exit, Cevat Yıldırım urged his son-in-law to surrender and said: "I am with the state."
Damn the coupgers.
As far as I know, I haven't really known the Fair Orphan I've known in 18 years.
I don't have a son-in-law called Fair Orphan.
I want him caught as soon as possible.
He can neither live in Turkey nor live in the world.
Let him come and trust Turkish justice.
If he's wrong, he'll pay.
He's giving us a hard time running away.
Too bad for the police, too bad for the state.
The police haven't done anything else in 20, 25 days.
"We need to work, not the coup," Yıldırım said he did not want Turkey to return to Syria.
We don't want Turkey to go and be like Syria.
Syria had a neighbor like Turkey.
There's a president like Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
He said, "What do we do with a coup?"
On the other hand, on July 19th, at around 3:00 p.m., the TEM Highway was seen passing through the Akyaz tollboos, when the Orphan dropped off his "SIR" license plate car at his father-in-law's garage in Akyaz.
Ops: 30 detentions
An investigation into the university construction of the fetullahist terrorist group was launched this morning as part of an investigation into the Ýzmir.

Professors are among the names taken into custody during the operation carried out by the İzmir Chief Public Prosecutor's Office.
Names taken into custody have been questioned at the Fiscal Crimes Bureau.
The search for other names continues.
Prosecutor in custody tried to commit suicide
According to information, the district police department teams have requested to detain Viranşehir Public Prosecutor Ahmet Füpne in his office as part of the investigation.
So he claimed to commit suicide by putting his gun to his head.
He stopped committing suicide by being convinced by his co-workers and his wife who came to the courthouse.
He was taken into custody and taken to the District Police Department.
No smoking in parks and sports
At the signing ceremony held at the Sheikh Edebali Culture and Congress Centre, Bilecik Mayor Selim Yağcı said they added a clause to the police code at the point of no smoking in park, sports and playgrounds.
Reminding all public institution executives of the future of new generations that they met to sign protocol, he wished the protocol to be good for children and young people.
State Health Director Yasin Yilmaz has reported that the protocol is to get people to quit smoking and to keep young people away from bad habits.
Following the talks, Mayor Yağcı, Sheikh Edebali University Rector Prof. Dr. İbrahim Taş, County National Education Director Fazilet Durmiş, County Health Director Yılmaz, State Public Health Director Ömer Balcı, Public Hospitals Deputy Secretary-General Serkan Kadir Keskin and Deputy Director Hilal Savran signed the protocol.
He saw the plot in Ergenekon, killed him.
Ankara Chief Public Prosecutor's Office is investigating the role of Ankara's Chief of Staff Behcet Oktay, who closed the case "Suicide" in 2009.
Former head of Security Intelligence Agency Ramazan Akyürek, who lived in the same residence as Oktay and had Oktay heard as a suspect in the Hezbollah Terror Organization six days before he died, is the lead suspect in the investigation.
Part of the ammunition seized under the Ergenekon investigation is said to have been stolen and buried from the Special Ops Agency by the police force and killed because Oktay identified it.
Behcet Oktay, who was shot in the head in Ankara on February 25, 2009, was pronounced "suicide" in death.
However, there were many question marks.
Two years later, a murder investigation was launched as a result of the legal struggle and evidence filed by parents and family lawyers.
The gun that was said to have been shot by the left-handed Oktay was in his right hand.
There were also fractures to the ribs and signs of blunt force trauma on his body.
The case against the murder investigation opened in May 2012.
Only Halil Kesici, who was present at the time of his death, was charged with gunshot residue.
The cutting trial was finally acquitted.
Nurhan Önder, who was in prison for another crime and sent a letter to the prosecutor's office saying he was involved in Oktay's death, was sentenced to six months in prison for "crime and obstruction of judicial authorities."
Those plaintiffs are being questioned.
Meanwhile, prosecutor Huseyin Yalçin, who called the incident "suicide," retired, was promoted to Mustafa Straight Supreme Court, who conducted the murder investigation.
The Oktay family wants to investigate Nihat Yıldırım, the autopsy prosecutor, along with these prosecutors.
Behcet Oktay's sister Shule Oktay and her brother Nezih Oktay have made many demands in the process of trial.
The family said it was impossible for Halil Kesici to kill special-trained Oktay alone, and asked for further investigation.
The family, saying the incident was covered up, demanded that police officers, Hüseyin Yalçın and Mustafa Behcet Oktay, be identified and tried to close the case as a suicide.
While all the demands of the family were rejected, it turned out that six days before Oktay died, he was heard under the alias "Abdurrahman Right" as a member of the Hezbollah Terror Organization.
It was determined that Ramazan Akyürek was the head of the Police Intelligence Agency of the period.
Following this development, the Ankara Chief Public Prosecutor's Office, who has reconsidered the Behçet Oktay case, has begun to examine the Fetullahist Terror Organization's finger in the murder.
The trial at Ankara Heavy Penal Court on Oktay's illegal rest will begin on September 19th.
He's got a friend.
The Oktay family that SABAH is meeting with is hopeful of the current investigation.
Family members say their finger in the murder was covered up during the earlier cover-up investigation and trial.
Sister Shule Oktay, "This murder has actually shown up."
We couldn't detect it.
Before my brother was killed, he said, "They're going to eat me."
I said, "Who?"
That's when he pointed to me.
I thought he'd be relieved of duty.
I never thought of death.
Of course there's a Å behind this.
"They were in charge at the time," he said.
The martyr called the young man's family, joined his prayer
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan also called on the family of democratic martyr Omar Can Opengöz, through the EC Party's Sinop MP Nazim Mavis, after addressing citizens in the presidential Community garden during the last watch the previous night, during a recession of the democratic watch.
"Mr. President also joined in his prayers," said Father Fahrettin, saying he had received a call at 1:30 p.m. when they were praying for his son.
He said, "I said that our country and its health are important to us."
'IMITATE YOUR CONTINUE FOR US'
President Erdogan addressed citizens in front of the Presidential Chamber the previous evening.
Erdogan met with some citizens in Ashliye after his late-night talk.
As he walked by the hand of an elderly aunt on a democracy watch, Recep Tayyip Erdogan chatted with the citizens one by one, took care of the children, thanked the citizens for their sacrifice.
Erdogan then called Fahrettin Elgöz, the father of Omer Can Acuş, who died on July 15th through AK Party Sinop MP Nazim Mavis.
Omer Can's father, Fahrettin Düçgöz, 21 years old, who was shot in front of the Chamber of the Presidency, said that President Erdoğan called at home at 1:30 p.m. while praying for his son and the martyrs. "When I told him that we were praying for my son, Mr. President also joined in his prayers."
And I said that our country and its health are very important to us.
"We are very pleased that our President called and prayed on the phone," he said.
"The pyramid of ا has been destroyed."

The traitor who shot the people was protecting the PKK
Turkey, which has been struggling relentlessly to end PKK terror for over 40 years, has begun to emerge in its struggle to destroy its organisation's leaders.
Turkey's critical institutions have been infiltrated by AKP militants on all sides, working to tie Turkey's hands.
At the moment of arrival today, serious doubt and evidence have come to light that the Hrant Dink murder, the Uludere incident, the crash of the Russian plane, was behind the critical events.
The traitor's body is too weak.
During the July 15 coup attempt, it turned out that Brigadier General Gökhan Sönmezateş, who led the raid and assassination operation on President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's hotel in Marmaris, had a rather high record.
Earlier, it was determined that Sönmez Fireş had reported air operations to the PKK to the terrorists as the planes were taking off.
Investigating intelligence agencies has also confirmed that Gökhan Sönmezateş has a high record.
TERURISTS CONTROL
In addition to leaking intelligence to the PKK, Turkish fighter planes have not exactly hit their designated targets.
At the Kandil footlines of the PKK's leadership, MIT's terrorist organisation claimed that intelligence was deflected by Gökhan Sönmezateş and prevented the shooting of targets.
By changing the coordinates, it has been determined that fighter planes taking off to destroy the PKK's leading staff have hit locations on the side of the targets, and the leaders of the terrorist organization have also survived.
The intelligence survey found that Sönmezateş played a key role in both deflecting targets and escaping PKK terrorists before the F-16s took off.
Opening files of 37,000 officers
A restructuring process has been launched at the TSK and the Ministry of National Defence, following the repelling of the coup attempt by members of the terrorist head Fetullah Gulen.
A comprehensive cleaning process began, especially when it was discovered that the questions of entering military high schools had been stolen by Å, that non-organised military students had been intimidated and sent from schools.
With the final discharges left about 37,000 officers, some 37,000 officers will be left, while the cleaning for the generals and admirals will be performed for these officers.
For this, promotions will be frozen, especially from lieutenants to colonels.
A full investigation will be completed before the promotion.
The files of 37,000 officers began to open one by one.
With a full-fledged study, the soldiers of the Party will be exposed.
The officers who are not associated with ▪ will continue to carry out their duties.
The promotion of the officers will continue until the military clears the last GERP, while the promotion of the officers will only come up after the investigation.
The MIT, Security Intelligence and State Control Board are co-directing the investigation.
As part of the investigation, the officers whose files have been opened are being investigated for promotions, places of duty, and commanders, whether they have been promoted by finishing civilian or military school.
It will also be investigated by a hairless study of whether they are members of the CHP, even through its arrangements.
Any measures will be taken to ensure that officers who have no connection to the process will not be affected.
If there's any doubt, that officer will be immediately suspended and brought to trial.
Those who have been identified, those with information and documents will be cut off immediately from the army.
As promotions are frozen during all these procedures, the examination will be deepened.
The post-export staff will also have measures to avoid openings.
Those expelled from the TSK and forced pensioners will be able to return to their professions with the same rights as their equal staff and circuit mates if they want to pass through a security investigation.
2 BIN 133 SUBY REQUESTED

Pehlivanoğlu: Ankara poisons Türkesh
Former Superintendent Tahsin Pehlivanoglu, who was the founder and first leader of the SHP, Alparslan Türkesh's bodyguards, claimed that Türkesh was poisoned and that someone in the family had done so in co-operation with Å.
"I haven't told anyone until today, but I had to watch that soldier image of Mohsin Yazıoğlu pulling a piece out of his helicopter and see that the same soldier was inside the coupkers who were assigned to kill our President," Pehlivanoglu, who was with Türkesh at all times from 1977 to 1997, said.
Here's what Turkesh's bodyguard said:
In 1997, we went to Germany.
Three days before we arrived, we had the chieftain check-up.
The 33-year-old Burdurian doctor who did the check-up, Fikret, "You look like an 18-year-old."
He said, "You don't have anything."
This doctor died of a heart attack a month later.
We returned to Ankara on April 3rd.
My headmistress has gone to Amasya.
They called me on the way back and went to an engagement at Ankara Hilton.
After leaving the engagement, Turkesh driver tells Alparslan: "Open the back window."
He'd never open a window.
When you open the window, there's a noise.
First at the Chankaya Medical Center, they did CPR, electrodes, but it was over.
We took him to the Public Medical Center together, but it was too late.
I think someone in the family poisoned him in Amasya.
Turkesh wasn't autopsied.
His ex-wife, Seval Turkesh, will have heard my discomfort and rhetoric, and he will have come out and said, "Turkish has been killed," and so on.
Man builds a tomb, he opens a tomb.
They said it was a heart attack.
The tomb of Turkesh must be reopened.
Alparslan Türkesh was murdered?
They were arrested for smuggling gold into Pennsylvania!
An operation launched in İzmir on the construction of businesspeople of Å/PDY has been seized during the shipment of 1.5kg of gold to Pennsylvania.
The operation found that more than 30kg of gold had been held for abduction in Pennsylvania.
Three people were arrested and sent to prison following the gold prepared to be sent to Pennsylvania in Eldem Jewelry, the workplace owned by Mehmet Eldem.
Also arrested were businessmen Mustafa Ozkara, Ezel Chosen and Messenger-elected, who were detained during the operation launched under investigation in İzmir.
In an operation launched by İzmir Security Directorate's Anti-Fiscal Crimes Directorate teams on July 29th, Ezel had taken custody of Ezel, President of the Ege and West Mediterranean Industry and Businessmen Federation (ESDEF) Mustafa Özkara and Western Transport Oil and Tur. Tic. Ltd. Shti (BALPET) owners.
While trying to escape to Kyrgyzistan, İzmir Adnan Menderes Airport was identified as the son of Osman Gürbuz Özkara, the first trustee of Fetullah Gülen, and one of the most important figures in the Aegean region of Å.
Five fuel stations, owned by Ezel and the Messenger Chosen, were also reportedly seized on charges of providing financial funds to Ankara.
They stole a car and robbed three gas stations in an hour.
It happened last night on Eagle.
Two of the suspects who came to Eagle in the vehicle they hijacked first robbed another gas station 300 meters away from a gas station on the side road, then another station on the side road.
After the robberies, the Eagle police, who had been alerted, soon identified the suspects and launched a search for them.
Police teams have traced the suspect's vehicle to C.S. and U.A.
In the meantime, the suspects were shot at the police as they got out of the car they were driving from Eagle Square.
One of the suspects was caught on the Elite Boulevard after the pursuit on foot.
The police soon caught the second suspect based on information from C.S.
The suspects were arrested and sent to prison following their transactions at the Eagle Security Bureau.
On the other hand, the masked robbery was recorded by cameras.
Surveillance footage from the gas station's security cameras shows the unsub entering the gas station first, then entering the store again wearing masks on the outside and taking their guns.
There's a struggle between the first suspect to enter the market and the grocery worker.
The other person who was found with him following the attack of the store employee enters with a mask and a gun.
The unsub who pulled the gun has disabled the employees and then fled with the 6,200 lira in the safe.
About 15,000 liras, unlicensed weapons, and the vehicle they hijacked from 3 stations were seized in the search.
An earthquake the size of 7.2 in the Pacific Ocean
The US Geological Research Centre (USGS) said the earthquake was recorded 10km deep in the seabed 10km east of its central base, New Caledonia Island.

Vanuatu, located in the earthquake belt of the Pacific Ring of Fire, often has earthquakes.
He prayed for martyrdom, unaware of the coup.
On the night of July 15th, the relatives of 38-year-old Cetin Can, who died on the Bosporus Bridge, maintain their strength.
His wife, Fatma Can, said that while they had not yet heard of the coup attempt that night, she had learned of the martyrdom prayer in Şevval in a conversation, and that she had performed the prayer of martyrdom at home, and that she had advised herself to perform this prayer.
After the prayer, Fatma Can, who reported that they had seen the news on TV at night and had learned about the coup attempt, explained:
We packed up and left together.
When we got to the bridge, there were people waiting there.
As soon as we entered the bridge, the tank opened fire on us twice.
We took cover, and then when the tank left, we kept walking.
There was a spot on the bridge where a big bus stopped.
It was too crowded.
We stood there for a while, waiting.
When we couldn't move forward, we thought, "What do we do?"
Cetin wanted us to move to the side lane.
I'm guessing when we crossed the side lane, we were a sniper, an open target, and he was shot there.
Four hours after he had performed the prayer, he was a martyr.
He didn't know about the coup.
God's wisdom...
Allah giveth, and Allah taketh away.
My wife once said, "If I die, plant a tree that bears fruit to my grave."
I made that wish by planting a plum tree over his grave.
"God bless him," Fatma Can said, noting that they are grateful to President Erdogan for visiting them as well.

Assoc. Prof. Dr. Hasan Esenoglu, professor of Astronomy and Space Sciences at İstanbul University, told the AA correspondent that Perseid would reach the highest level on Friday (August 12th) on Saturday (August 13th).
Esenoglu said that thousands of pieces were formed from the comet "Swift - catch" by solar rays and gravity, and that it would turn into a natural visual feast.
Esenoglu said the Perseid meteorite was first discovered in 1862, and it began to appear again in the world since the 1990s.
"We have to watch such a visual feast from space, we have to be interested," he said, expressing that the rain of Perseid's meteorites can be followed in July and August.
After all, it's a natural visual feast.
"It will help us get to know the universe better," he said.
When they're cold, they're red, they're hot, they're white.
Esenoglu noted that some of the pieces that were torn off during the meteor shower would fall to the earth the size of lentils.
Perseid temperatures could go up to 2,000 centigrades.
Because of the heat and friction in the atmosphere, Perseids produce red light in the natural environment when it's cold, and white when it's hot.
The website of the International Asteroid Organization contains how many meteorites there are, and science can be contributed.
This data is informational because it's collected from all over the world.
It can be watched all night.
Reminding of the meteor shower moving at about 60km per second, Esenoglu said that this visual feast in the sky could be well followed throughout the night from places that have little light in the northeast.
Esenoglu said that more than 100 meteorites a year occurred, while Perseid noted that after the meteor shower, on December 4th and 17th, the rain of Gemini was a natural event worth watching.
Erdogan, former football player, undereducated.
It was the winning alliance of populist Islamists led by low-educated former footballer Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Fetullah Gulen, a widely religious entrepreneur, who founded more than a thousand schools, tens of universities and educational institutes from Texas to Tashkent.
The above is a translation of a sentence in an article released last week at Foreign Policy.
Erdogan's undereducated and former footballer, Gulen, who graduated from elementary school, is described as a broad entrepreneur, and these and such articles are often included in the Western media, where his followers are clearly praised.
On the other hand, they're trying to make a statement in their articles, "Why is America and/or Western anti-Westernism rising in Turkey?" "Because Erdogan..."
Analysts who view Turkey's anti-Western opposition as a negative situation during Erdogan's period are unaware of Turkey's history.
In fact, statistics show that the first decade of the Erdogan era can be read as a period when the anti-Westernism in Turkey decreases or stays average.
Because within ten years, they were in sync with the European Union and with the United States.
Erdogan's "one-minute" criticism of Israel, the outbreak of civil war over the massacres of the Assad regime in Syria, the EU's failure to establish a clear policy in the refugee crisis, leaving Turkey alone in Turkey, some figures such as European Parliament President Schulz, while "the Erdoğan is not our handler," the acquitive attitude in Britain, the opening of a swearing contest against Erdogan, and that it should be carried out by the London Mayor, with a poem in which the Foreign Minister can't imagine, and that some figures such as the PKK entered the country in Turkey, should "restruct our bomb," as the PKK's "not the PKK's deal with us," as well as the UN's representatives of Syria, and that the UN's special forces should be responsible for putting forward for the fight against Syria's special forces, as well as the UNPG's in Syria's office, and that it should be put forwarded by the UN's special forces, as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as possible.
Let's just say that as we lost 247 people in a bloody coup, we forgot that no support came to our democracy from our so-called allies, the EU countries and the United States, until the coup was proven to fail, Kerry's first talk was that they expected peace and stability to be built in Turkey, not to make any emphasis on democracy and the elected government.
How will it be forgotten that 11 Charlie Hebdo employees were killed in Paris, including Turkey, many leaders from the world joined in protest march, but that no president from any Western country, which was allied, had not come to Turkey a month after the coup attempt that killed 247 people who resisted tanks for democracy?
What do we say that the presidents, or the high-ranking representatives who come several times a year for the refugee issue, send sublevel representatives?
How are we supposed to assess the fact that all EU and US ambassadors have been visited with a broken window and that they haven't paid a solidarity visit to the bombed Turkish Grand National Assembly?
If the first two weeks after the coup in Egypt were reminded that the EU had sent high-level representatives to shake hands with coup leader Sisi, that Kerry's visit after the coup had been "rebuilding the democracy" and praised the coup leadership, is it too unusual for Western countries in Turkey to express their concern for Turkish democracy at every turn?
The fact that 95% of the people feel responsible for the coup, the fact that Gulan is allowed to live freely in the United States is now enough to piss off the Turkish people.
With the background I'm counting on up there, I think it's clear that the rising anti-Western/American opposition is an unexplainable situation with Erdogan alone.
Besides, Erdogan didn't even say that he still thinks there's a US influence on the coup...
So the chest was never a theme.
Is it possible to hear the same tune after the night of July 15th, when Travelers insult their own people as ignorant voters, who say, "The Ark is a joke," who don't think like themselves.
After seeing how these people have taken control of the state and democracy, I wonder if they've been looking for answers to the question, "Where have we been wrong?"
But there are so many questions that need to be answered.
Officers who have served on various levels until yesterday and who have been given the right to use the state's weapons have suddenly agreed to enter the status of "the traitor" and sought asylum from foreign states.
We need to see what kind of mental distortion we live in, and how obsessions with individuals lead people to what they call perversion.
As for the watered-down brains, the coup attempt...
Is there any other way for those who participated in this act to compare Turkey's cities to the cities of Syria?
Why would an officer bomb his own country's parliament?
We probably shouldn't have made the mistake of waiting for reasonable behavior from the brains that were watered by the curses of ▪.
Others are responsible, but let us know that the responsibility for all things is not only GER.
The staff, offering politics as a profession of fighting, hatred, and hatred, have also contributed to the necessary tragedies.
And the ones who present themselves as "Good" have convinced the masses that all sorts of illegal behavior and even vulgarity are natural.
We've seen how they've even opened fire on these people when their own people are given weapons.
The way of democracy, the way we know it
I'm saying one simple thing: on the evening of July 15th, the people in Turkey gave 250 martyrs to the members of the military, to the mob, to the thieves, to the segerdes, and to the democracies more than to save democracy.
But on July 15, there are three periods, 1992-2002; 2002-2012; 2012 and then 2012.
There are three changes in these three periods: economic, social, political.
He created two major phenomena of social change: a metropole migration from rural areas, and the move of these nomads to the centre after being held around the cities for a very long time.
I said on Wednesday that this move was via the subway.
I also stressed that the subway is the most important element of social change to pass through.
The second major change in the same direction is bridges and roads.
The road and bridge's contribution to modernisation is easier to understand.
Roads come, economic and social structure change.
In our case, it's changed the political structure as well.
I've identified this history with bridges that have been thrown over the Bosphorus in Istanbul since long ago.
Ironel built the Bosphorus Bridge.
This was the peak of the post-1950 peasant movement in the 1960s.
He continued his progress in the same direction with the second bridge, which we now renamed the July 15th Martyrs Bridge.
Even their routes indicate the relationship between the environment and the center.
It's a sign of what kind of social change course is being followed.
The goal of Ironel and Ozal was to melt large masses at the center.
It was to embrace the center's ideology.
The AK Party didn't build the third bridge for many years.
Because the migration was driving at all speeds.
The people who came were placed in satellite cities.
A bit of a closed system was created in those areas.
The AK Party's municipalities have given people food, jobs, social status, and they vote for the EC Party.
So the masses were not asked to melt at the center, but to gain political consciousness in the environment and then come to the center as themselves.
This formation was related to the debates on the headscarf that continued before the EC Party (1992-2002).
These discussions have allowed the masses to accept the obligation to stand side by side with the centre, not the conservative, self-centered and provincial people.
The EC Party acted in the way I described after 2002, politicizing the masses, bringing them into politics, maturing them.
After that, notice now, with the construction of the 3rd Bridge, the democratic struggle on July 15th is simultaneous.
So history and sociology are in sync.
Let me add another dimension: The AK Party's move is not limited to the Istanbul bridges.
Something more interesting is happening: The EC Party now integrates surrounding cities with central cities.
This is provided through two bridges.
One, Osmangazi Bridge.
Two, the bridge to Çanakkale 1915.
Add that to the pathways.
Turkey will now reach Izmir from Thrace on another route.
Do you know what this means, that Izmir will be a different city from now on?
Let's say the EC Party is going to take Izmir out of the 'inside' they can't get.
Now the city of Çanakkale, Thrace, will be transformed into other human and social geography.
That's it!
The martyrs of July 15th are the stars of this great adventure.
Van Persie and merry training in Fenerbahçe
Fenerbahce continued her morning training for the Grasshoppers game.
The training at Can Bartu Facility began at 10:00 p.m. under the management of manager Vitor Pereira and lasted an hour and 30 minutes total.
After 30 minutes of core training in the hall, the players went out into the field and did five-to-two ball grabs and pass.
The training was completed by a double fort in a tight space.
Fenerbahçe will continue his preparations with his training today evening.
The one who complained about St. Lightning to Smiley...
There's been a new development in Operation Defiance against Fenerbahce.
"A name from the sports world has taught Fethullah Gülen the words of St. Yıldırım himself."
"One day in the lightning, he said to this person on the plane, "What are you doing next to Fethullah Gulen?"
When this person told Gulen these words, Fethullah Gulen was obsessed with St. Yıldırım.
Why is he obsessed with St. Lightning?
If the president of Turkey's most popular club is in this mentality, he may hurt himself.
He used the phrase, "The trial was to liquidate St. Lightning."
Following these words, an explanation came from Faik Light, one of the key attorneys of the Strict Case.
He appeared in the Anti-Construction Program published in Light Haberturk and announced the person who had filed a complaint against Aziz Yıldırım, the leader of the group, Fethullah Gülen.
Here are the words of Faik Light:
St. Yıldırım is saying something to Ihsan Kalkavan about Fethullah Gulen.
On a private flight from Azerbaijan.
Mr. Aziz is a witty man, and when he criticizes someone, he speaks in western words.
Maybe those western words will bleed a little.
Some of those sentences might react.
These sentences are being brought up somewhere.
Towels, kimmets, it's not the kind of tolerance it would take for so many businessmen to go there as if they were going to Hajj, Umre.
What do they say? He's critically critical.
Of course that's not the only problem.
Meanwhile, there's a football team trial.
The direct connections of some football players and executives from the Galatasaray Club and Hakan Thank God...
Master Muharrem: The plot is different
Master Muharrem, president of Tripolispor, extends his hand to Fenerbahçe as a friend.
The issue of Turkey is a matter of all clubs, he said, saying "We are on the side of this country with 79 million."
We need to put on a good stand.
If Fenerbahçe has a problem with Ankara, if there is injustice, I will stand behind Fenerbahçe.
"But there is a difference between Tripolispor and Fenerbahçe," he said.
Sacrifice prices announced
Karabulut said: "As a unit, we have determined that the price of the live sacrifice calf is $18 pounds."
He said, "We've also determined the price of the cow, which we refer to as the living kilogram, is $17, and the price of the living kilogram is $15."
Karabulut noted that last year's non-victim animals were also on sale, and explained what citizens should be careful about when they make sacrifices:
In particular, animals need to be careful with earpieces.
It's also important that the animal is healthy.
That's why they can control the vaccines in the animal's passport when our citizens are victimizing.
And from the looks of it, the victim must have been alive and alive and out of her hair.
And you shouldn't have symptoms like saliva and snot on your face.
Over the past few years, we've seen non-victim animals being sold and sold.
An animal that's a victim needs to be two years old.
We can tell that by looking at the animal's teeth.
An animal that's about two years old has teeth that we call a cover.
But animals that are younger have never had these teeth.
The animal may seem large in appearance, but the lid teeth may not have come out.
The lid teeth are noticed because they're already bigger than the others.
Rize Airport to be held at sea
The second airport to be built with sea fillings in Turkey will be Rize Airport.
The Rize Airport will be built on a sea filling 26 to 32 metres from the coast in 266 hectares between Yeşilköy village of Sunday district and Girl Tower.
Since the construction of the Rize airport is too deep, about three times more filling materials will be used than at the Army - Giresun Airport.
As part of the project, an apron will be built with a 45m radius and 3,000m long track where 36 planes can land in an hour.
Rize Airport, which will serve passengers and cargo planes in general, is also expected to serve the composition class D, the turbulence class, aircraft that weighs more than 150,000 kilograms.
The first stage for the Rize Airport project, which will be tendered by the Ministry of Transport Maritime and Communications Substructure Investments General Directorate on September 8th, will be for sea fillings, runway, apron, incursion, environmental road, security fence, mendure, PAT fields and environmental lighting.
These things will cost $600 million.
After infrastructure, there will be a 150m-dollar spending of top construction, covering terminal buildings.
The construction of Rize Airport will be completed in 2 years and 9 months.
Eight cents higher on the bike.
Fuel distribution companies averaged an average of eight cents a liter of their engine, which is valid at midnight tonight.
According to information from the Oil Products Employers' Union (PÜSİS), an average price increase will be 8 cents per liter in its engine starting on August 13, 2016.
According to this, the price of its engine, which averages $3.68 per liter in Ankara, will go up to $3.76.
The price of its engine will go from 3.63 liras to 3.71 liras in Istanbul, while the average will go from $3.66 to $3.74 in İzmir.
Because of the prices set by distribution companies, competition and freeness, it can make small changes to companies and cities.
The fuel distribution companies raised the price of their engine by four cents last Friday.
Here are the Galatasaray football players from Smiley's chat.
Galatasaraylı and national football players, who once marked Turkish football, were found to have been involved in the 1996 talks of the leader, Fetullah Gulen.

Gulen mentioned Galatasaray in the conversation, saying "We scored four goals."
Said Alpsoy, also known as the former football imam of  Wasn't released to SABAH recently as "Turkey became third in the world in 2002."
Emre, Okan, Hakan Thank God, Hakan Ünsal and Arif raised money from these bonuses.
The sum was $250,000 or $500,000.
Arif Erdem took this money to Pennsylvania.
"The smile later spoke to Arif in praises."
The national football players have joined Smiley's conversation!

Very striking statements about Robert Amsterdam!
Robert Amsterdam, an official of the Amsterdam &Partners law firm, which investigates international illegal activities of the Fetullahist Terror Organization (AKP), wrote an article for the US magazine Forbes, sharing information on how Å is organised.
Amsterdam said that Fetullah Gulen, the leader, runs the organisation from his home in Pennsylvania, stated that "It would be very clear how close to 150 contractors (charter) run the school in the United States that the organisation has hidden advanced organisational ability underground."
Amsterdam stressed that it has been tasked by Turkey seven months ago to investigate Gulen-related companies and schools, stressing that what it has found so far is "surprising."
Amsterdam wrote in its article:
According to the informants, the Laughing Organization has a strict hierarchy with instructions.
These instructions are usually delivered during a face - to - face meeting with Gulen at Poconos.
There's a seven-man rule group on the hill.
This group transfers instructions to the advisory committee.
From here, the instructions go to local imams, country imams, territorial imams, il imams, territorial imams, neighborhood imams, student houses (light houses) and students, respectively.
Businessmen, bureaucrats and officers work at different levels, depending on their positions and support within the organization.
Amsterdam reported that the organisation opened 55,000 businesses worldwide and owned the largest chartered school network in the United States, reporting that millions of dollars per year were given to these schools from the taxes paid by American taxpayers.
Amsterdam wrote that most of the money was directed among the members of the organisation and transferred to the "elected" subcontractors.
Amsterdam explained this process with the following examples:
The Magnolia schools in California were caught giving $700,000 to a company that was connected to Smiley and shared the same office in exchange for a annual service contract.
Amsterdam, another example, pointed to Dove Science Academy in Oklahoma.
Amsterdam noted that the school also paid an extra $3.1m to its owner, and that the audits showed that the school and the management of the property company were made up of the same people connected to Gulen.
Noting that there are similar situations in the 46 branches of Harmony schools, which are the largest in the laughing network, Amsterdam noted that smaller companies connected to the  Wasn't paid for with pencils such as software licenses and curriculum purchases.
"These examples show that US taxpayers are being abused by about 28 million dollars," Amsterdam said, stressing that it makes each other rich.
"And that's just the part of what we've found so far," he used his statement.
Noting that nothing has been done to prevent such events so far, Amsterdam has reminded that the situation has been worsening in the past time period, that the Texas Department of Education has begun to investigate irregularities.
Amsterdam stressed that schools operate normally in public, that many employees have no information on what kind of corruption there is.
Amsterdam said, "But in fact, these schools work like snow machines for Laughing."
"The laugher then uses enormous amounts of money for political donations to hide illegal activities," he said.
According to a former American teacher who worked at these schools, Amsterdam said that some of the employees at Smiley schools held separate meetings, transferred a portion of their salaries to the organisation, "It is believed that members of the Turkish Armed Forces are working in similar operations."
The coup provokers have been strengthening their positions over the years.
"However, while the army was operating normally, a parallel force was gathering strength behind the stage."
Amsterdam finished its article as follows:
Politicians in the United States have questions about the events of July 15th to 16th, and that's expected.
However, as the two allies address their situation on a diplomatic level, individual authorities must wake up to the rapid violation of US law in Gulen's operations.

Zechariah's Öz explanation from Ciaoglu
"This information is not true at the moment," he asked the question of the alleged capture of Zechariah Oz and the Fair Orphan in Georgia.
But there are different reports coming in.
They're all being evaluated.
We're in close contact with the Georgian authorities.
"Any detail, information, tip is being carefully assessed," he said.
"Zekeria Öz had fled to Georgia before," he said, asking if there was any doubt that they might be in Georgia.
It was detected on the security cameras at the customs gate.
He knows he's been in and out of Europe.
Every information we get is not just for these two, but we're tracking every information we have on the other fugitives.
We'll track them wherever they run."
The question regarding his meeting with his Iranian counterpart, Javad Zarif, is that "two issues have been considered."
Turkey has many issues between Iran.
Political, commercial, transportation, energy, the fight against terrorism is our common struggle.
There are regional issues.
Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Bay Area, mainly Syria.
Turkey and Iran can play an important role in resolving problems in our geography.
We agree on a lot of things.
We agree on many issues, such as the territorial integrity of Syria, border integrity, and the removal of DAEŞ and other terrorist organisations in Syria, and the presence of an inclusive government.
We had different ideas about Assad.
But we'll keep talking about this as usual.
Truce, Geneva, we agree that the negotiations will continue.
It doesn't mean anything unless the consensus of many matters is essentially a result.
"It's important to get results," he said.
"Our delegation had gone to Moscow on this matter," he asked when Turkish planes would join operations in Syria.
"The purpose of setting up these mechanisms is to take what steps, especially in the fight against DAESS here, and that any incident must be coordinated so that the accident doesn't happen."
"Iran and Turkey are two sister countries," he said.
The investigations shouldn't decide, so we can make a deal between ourselves.
I had some websites.
We should be able to make these deals before we go on trial.
He used the phrase "Gas reduction, we had demands on prices."
The question about the date of Gulen's return to America is "a delegation from America will arrive on the 22nd."

After the end of prayer, Selmet saw the police and raised his hands.

Thanks to Gökhan, he followed his father's vehicle to the police station.
Sakarya Chief Public Prosecutor's Office has determined that Hakan Thank you and his father Selmet have provided financial support for the city.

Watch out for children's habits
Assoc. Prof. Dr. Bilgin Giray of the Faculty of Dental Medicine said that children are relieved by this reflex by making suction a necessity because they can't chew at an early age.
"Pinger-sucking is an event that occurs from birth to age 3 to 4," said Assoc. Prof. Giray, describing the reasons for the use of finger-sucking in children.
Most babies suck their thumbs.
The boy who sucks his finger to satisfy his need for suction as a baby sucks his finger to satisfy the longing for a mother's breast after the age of one and a half.
"He can be bothered and distracted, when he's sleepy, when he's nervous, and when he's separated from the mother, he can act like a finger-sucking person."
Stressing that lack of mother-child relationship and the lack of trust in the child are at the heart of the early age, Assoc. Prof. Dr. Bilgin Giray described the effects of this behavior on dental health:
Finger-sucking behavior has a negative effect on the shape of the child's dental structure.
As a result of pressure during suction, the upper teeth are pushed forward, while the lower teeth are pushed back.
It causes the lower jaw to be positioned back, disorienting the palate and dental structure.
The physiological reflection of this is that speech disorder and closure look aesthetically bad.
Noting that if there is no early solution, there may be a much more complex treatment process during the age of 6-7 when permanent teeth start to emerge, Assoc. Prof. Giray said, "We can protect our children from closure and joint problems before jaw development is completed."
"So children today need to be controlled by the oral structure, such as their eyes and hearing controls," he said.
New breath in close vision treatment: Trifocal Lenses
After cataract therapy, patients naturally don't want to wear glasses.
Multi-focused lenses have already been used for many years to solve this problem with our patients.
The recent use of triphocal lenses has taken the success of treatment in this area one step further.
The difference between triphocal lenses and other lenses is not only the distance or the distance, but also the ability to give a clear view in distances defined as distances.
Treatment for long, close, or range vision disorders
The distance between visual disorders represents a point that we often use in our daily lives.
For example, the dashboard of cars is the portable computers that we hold in our laps, or the distance we define as a 60-70 cm arm length.
With trifocal lenses fixing the distances, our patients don't need to wear glasses in any way near or far.
Another advantage for trifocal lenses is that it reduces night complaints.
"The treatment of triphocal lenses for each distance is no different from normal cataract treatment," said Dr. Volcano Hürmeric.
The patients we're treating with triphocals will be able to recover from a seven-to-ten-minute procedure.
And the next day, our patients can go back to their normal lives.
In particular, it is an operation that improves the quality of life for people who drive, use computers, like to read, and live a more active life.
You can also apply to an ophthalmologist to see if this procedure is appropriate for you to apply to any patient who has turned 18 years old.
A varicose vein is not used in heart surgery!
The heir is a very frequent disease in recent years.
The primary factor of genetic intimacy is the existence of long working hours, long-standing jobs, and long-term stay-in-law complaints.
Are veins used in heart surgery?
I have an heir, and questions like what happens if I have a heart attack in the future are often asked by people.
Here are the answers to these questions.
The leg has two types of vein system:
On the first leg, there's a deep vein system called the main pathway to the lungs, which brings the dirty blood from the leg to the lungs.
These are called deep femoral vein and surface femoral vein.
The problems in these veins are rarer, their disease cannot be shut down, and they are treated for medication to keep these veins open.
The leg has what we call a side pathway to the lungs, which leads to the dirty blood and connects with the deep vein system in the groin.
This system consists of two large and two small veins called vens.
In all four of these vessels, inadequacies and heirs can develop.
The vein that can be used in heart surgery is the superficial vein called the great puren vein.
The absence of these vessels does no harm to the body, and they can be used for heart surgery.
But in order for these vessels to be used in heart surgery, the vessels need to be healthy.
Because the heart is a very important organ.
The surgical removal of varicose vessels or being left in place by lasers also reduces the workload of the deep vein and makes the leg healthier.
A false belief amongst the people is that veins can be used as a backup, even if they are heirs.
The varicose vein is never, ever used in heart surgery!
There are other vessels that can be used in heart surgery.
The spare vascular systems used for heart surgery are found under the rib cage, around the stomach and around the arm.
Therefore, it is inappropriate to wait to use the varicose vein for the heart and worry about it.

A meaningful message from Uzbek before the Super Cup
Galatasaray Sports Club President Dursun Uzbek issued a statement ahead of the Super Cup Final between Galatasaray and Beşiktaş.
Here are the words of Dursun Uzbek, who noted the unity and unity of Turkish football:
Two major and two favorite clubs of Turkish sports, Galatasaray and Beşiktaş, will face the Super Cup at the Conium Metropolitan Torku Arena on Saturday (August 13th).
This game is neither the first nor the last match in the competition of our two distinguished clubs.
But it's a vital encounter in timing.
As we all know, our country went through a lot on the night of July 15th.
The coup attempt by the Fetullahist Terror Organization/Paral State Construction (CHP/PDY), meaning our democracy, has been avoided by the unity and unity of all parts of society.
That night, as a nation, we paid heavy prices.
We gave them martyrs.
We have a lot of gas.
This bitter price once again reminded us of the virtue of democracy, the need and importance of peace, not of fighting in this land.
On that night, representatives of Turkish sports opposed the coup as one voice -- a single heart -- to stand together with democracy.
In these critical days, we need the unifying quality of sports more than ever.
I wish that this match, which coincides with the anniversary of our worthy opponent, Solomon Seba's second death, and just before the new football season, which bears the name of our club's legendary captain, Turgay Sheren, would be the beginning match of the love and peace of Turkish sports.
Whatever the score at the end of the game, which Galatasaray and Beşiktas fans will split in half, I wish the winner to be our country and Turkish sport.

Scot Callum Skinner flies home while Britain closes its gold.
The Great Britain Team three held the title they received in London in 2012, while Callum Skinner of Scotland competed last night at the Rio track for men.
Glasgowian, 23-year-old racer, took the pioneer position adopted by Sir Chris Hoy of Scotland, and this young man was proud to return home victoriously in his admirable New Zealand suit.
Britain won a shocking victory at the event four years ago, when Hoy received five of the six Olympic gold.
And even though Hoy had retired, they repeated it by finishing sixth place in the London World Championship in March.
The problem between Beijing and London was the exchange of expert starter Jamie Staff.
They did that right when Hindes showed up.
Hoy's retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton were trying to fill.
He had foreseen the potential that Scot had now made, and British trainers had not given up on Skinner.
Four years ago, Hindes, who was the champion with Hoy, broke the Olympic record for Kenny and Skinner, but in the first round, New Zealand re-set the record.
And the British three went to duel for gold.
Even though Hindes was a little behind on his tour, Kenny put the team first, and Skinner endured it.
It was a strategy change most of the transformation that allowed Hindes to slow him down using a larger tool, Kenny, and especially Skinner.
Hoy watched them as the BBC's expert commentator, and when they got on the podium, Skinner, Kenny, and Hindes caught his eye.
"This is an honorary comparison," said Skinner, 23, from Glasgow.
I'm just here to do my best and announce my name.
We broke the Olympic record in the final and beat the world champions.
That was really amazing.
There's no better way to win this.
Hindes admitted that after winning with Kenny and Hoy in London 2012, he deliberately fell on the track after a bad start.
Then he responded to this comment, and there was no way to make demands from Britain's competitors.
This time, there was no such problem for an incredible victory.
Hindes said: "It was as if we were in London with all the Great Britain flags in the stand."
We're just a team that was formed three months ago.
We've lost too many world races, so it's really amazing to have won the Olympics again.
It's just an event, a medal for a nation that won seven out of ten races in Beijing and London.
If this is the measure of progress we've made in the last five months, we'll have five more days of success on the track.
Kenny's attitude shows that Hoy's dream of recurring the record of three gold winnings in one single Olympics is not entirely impossible.
This will mean that Kenny, who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy and was born on 23 March (also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister, has received six gold medals and a silver medal).
That's the same level as Hoy.
Kenny, from now on, he's going to run the sprint race; the race starts today, and it's going to take three days.
" For now, I'm just enjoying it, " said the 28 - year - old Boltonite.
Team events are always the best.
You can win with your friends.
To be honest, when you win alone, you feel lonely.
Hindes said: "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be knighted."
Although this is only the event of today's medal, there are many good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull ranked first in a four-mile team race with four men.
They completed the runway in 3:51.943.
The world record set by the winner of the gold medal in London 2012 is 3:51.659.
The first round and final (22:42) will be determined in the second episode today, and Wiggins will certainly draw all attention to himself.
Yesterday, ahead of the ranking tour, when authorities called him in to measure his height, he had a disagreement with the officials.
At the event, which will continue and be completed tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie reached the world record for 4:13,260.
The Great Britain team is counting on the strong bicycle team to take the reins and win many medals during the middle of the Olympic Games.
After the great superiority in Beijing and London, expectations have been greatly reduced in Rio.
In the background, there have been many bad developments, including manager Shane Sutton's resignation in April for accusations of sexism and bullying and the retirement of important names such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
But the first night after the track races, it shows that Great Britain's epic reputation for ending in perfect time will be proven again this time.
With the cancellation of the energy contract, there's a question of the future of the Portland Resort.
The future of the Portland aluminum islabe in Victoria, and hundreds of workers' work fell into uncertainty after one of the facility owners announced the dissolution of a supply contract, which would have led to the cancellation of all supply contracts that powered the facility.
The move followed Victoria's government's decision earlier this year not to exceed subsidies to keep the facility running.
20 years of fixed subsidies expire in November.
At Alcoa's Portland facility, business could be at risk by 2000.
Any closure could put about 2,000 jobs directly or indirectly at risk.
And since the isabé has consumed about 10 percent of Victoria's electricity, there may also be additional chain effects.
In 2014, Alcoa Point Henry shut down the isolated furnace, which led to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoa's Portland is losing money, and he's at risk of closing.
These developments initially came after speculation over the future of the facility over several years, based on the strengthening of Australian dollars and the cost of the plant's consumption.
The AGL, providing energy from Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley to the large aluminum islabe furnace, said it expects the other three owners to take action to terminate their contracts.
Most of the facility is owned by Alcoa and Alumina's joint venture, and China's CITIC and Japan's Marubeni Corp companies have smaller shares.
"The AGL expects the Portland facility to continue to work, which means that the burner's demand for physical electricity will continue," he said.
The agreements are "risc balancing contracts" that should be in effect from November 2016, the AGL said.
The agreements will be completed in 2017, as it is a 12-month period of dissolution.
"Therefore, the AGL will continue to wait for contracts to contribute to the 2017 fiscal year," the energy company said.
The effects that the AGL may have on the 2018 Financial Year and the potential after-effects are available, limited to its adoption of a strong-term contract stand for wholesale electricity prices.
The AGL has already stated that the value of their contracts in their accounts has already dropped to about 187 million dollars due to the "feshin expectation."
The decision to terminate the contracts "does not affect Alcoa's ability to operate or supply electricity to the islabe stove," Alcoa said.
The US company signed a 20-year contract in 2010, which was supposed to take effect in November this year, but has yet to explain why it did not withdraw from the contract.
Analysts are on the lookout for the possibility that both the Portland isle in Victoria and the Tomago facility near Newcastle will be closed due to economic difficulties in the sector.
Responding to analysts earlier this week, the AGL chief of operations Stephen Mikkels said that Portland uses about 600 megawatts each year and Tomago uses 900 megawatts of energy.
If both of these facilities are withdrawn from the market, the demand for the [electric] market will be significantly reduced.
And as a manufacturer, that would not be a good development for us."
Not only is Kardashian the star of the TV show; Kendall is on the cover of Vogue's September issue.
The fourth daughter of the model and executive mother Kris' Kardashian-Jenner group, Kendall Jenner (20), is on the cover of the most anticipated September issue of the United States Vogue.
Kendall, a Estee Lauder ambassador, reported on Thursday from his Instagram account during fashion weeks in Milan, Paris and New York.
Kendall wrote, "I cried when I looked at this cover in a room full of people I loved."
Following the release of the cover, a strange (or only Keeping Up with the Kardashians), scripted reality video, where the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (who caused trouble in the bar, Rob and Caitlyn and everyone's favorite show business, Ryan Seacrest), was created a classic ending: in fact, they were preparing a surprise party.
Even though this is the cliché storyline of almost every "birthday" episode of every child television show (Seacrest at 8:00 a.m., a cartoon rabbit said, "Did you think we'd forgotten?") Kris had to include the other girls in this presentation somehow.
With this development in Vogue's September issue, we're definitely entering a new Kardashian era.
Kendall's sister Kim may have passed him on the cover of Vogue (in April 2014) but the cover of the magazine was a success.
Vogue's September issue was the best-selling issue of the year.
With its thickness more like a coffee table book than a fashion magazine, many advertisers noticed (Fashionista found that there were ads in 615 of last year's 832 pages of skin).
The disclosure of the cover star is also a closely monitored process that has been leaking pictures of the magazine prior to the official announcement for the past two years.
Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista, and Kate Moss are among the women previously placed on the cover.
In recent years, the cover features celebrities who have been "modeling" more than famous models.
The Oscar-winning Dior ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, and the next year, the honor was given to Lady Gaga.
However, even if Mrs. Jenner, described by the magazine as the "shining model" of her generation, was taken into the previous category, her surroundings could be said to be quite good.
These celebrities are not celebrities, or reality show stars, or young people who know how to make good Snapchat videos (all of them).
These are all women whose talent is legitimate, prominent in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, on the cover of last year, had one of the best moments of her career with Lemonade coming out.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenner's success.
Because of his reality show history, Jenner's position in the fashion world will always be disturbing.
In June, the original Victoria's Secret model, Stephanie Seymour, criticised Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them "the bitches of time."
When word came out that Jenner was going to be on the cover of Vogue, that thought surfaced again.
But focusing on dissatisfaction seems unnecessary.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of Vogue's September issue.
He's literally a supermodel.
He's doing Marc Jacobs' fashion shows.
Estee Lauder's getting you fondue.
He and his sisters are selling his own paintings on pay-per-view apps.
He's selling pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to LOVE magazine.
And in his spare time, maybe he's on a reality TV show just to see his brother Kourtney and his kids.
Social legal support centers turn down 160,000 people every year
As the sector prepares for the impact of more funding cuts in current difficult operations, more than 160,000 people from the most vulnerable part of the nation are being rejected from social legal support centres.
Three out of five people in Queensland (mostly elderly, immigrants, unprotected workers, victims of violence, and others with no resources to deal with unjust evacuations and so on) are rejected in search of free legal advice and representation.
Social legal support services, which have exhausted their facilities, are preparing for further cuts.
Starting in June next year, these legal support centres are scheduled to be deprived of more than 30 per cent of federal financing.
James Farrell, director of the Community Legal Support Centres in Queensland, reported that thousands of people have been rejected every year in the latest Countdown Report of the Social Legal Support Centres National Association.
Mr. Farrel said the situation would be much worse if the federal government's decision was not reversed.
"Queensland's social legal support centers are chronically underfunded, which means that thousands of people are unable to reach the vital services they need," he said.
People who are in violent relationships, struggling with power and backbreaking forces, families in the process of separation and workers who have been laid off unfairly, all of them face legal problems, and according to this report, they can't get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 per cent from June 2017, which means thousands of unguarded Queensland residents are forced to deal with more complicated legal problems without help.
In order for people to have the support they need when faced with a legal problem, we urge the Attorney General and the Grand Secretary of Queensland, George Brandis, to withdraw these funding cuts immediately.
Last year, the government fulfilled its commitment to raise legal support financing to a national average.
We must now look at social legal support centres and the investment of the Palaszczuk government in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign team was sued after the staff claimed to have pulled a gun.
New York: Donald Trump's campaign team was sued for charges of no action after being told that the director of North Carolina operations had pulled a gun on a staff while traveling in a jeep in February.
The case was announced on Wednesday at the state court by Vincent Bordini, a former software instructor on the state campaign team.
Bordini said he waited months for the inside to be dealt with, but later realized that "this is not going to happen."
As Bordini complained, the director, Earl Philip, "took out a gun, put his right index finger on the trigger and held the barrel to Vincent's kneecap."
According to the complaint, Bordini learned that at least four other people had the same experience as Phillip after complaining to local and regional campaign leaders.
Bordini's complaint said, "There's no need to fire to damage the weapons."
The case opened two days after the Republican presidential candidate in North Carolina told the crowd that the people of the Second Constitutional Amendment (seemingly armed and gun supporters) could act if his opponent, Hillary Clinton, was elected and elected his own judges.
Trump's campaign team expressed that the media considered these words outside of context and that it itself did not support violence.
Bordini has filed a complaint, demanding compensation from the campaign staff for negligence and Phillip for assault, battery and emotional damage.
Trump's spokesman, Hope Hicks, did not quickly return the message asking him to comment.
Their efforts to reach Phillip have failed.
A local news associate in Charlotte, WCCB, reported that Phillip had recently left the campaign.
The call to his consulting company Innovative Consulting Services did not return quickly.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is running a controversial campaign.

"Tell on the person" line
Following Erdoğan's call for "not everyone knows intelligence, not the police, not the police," the MİT and Police have set up a tip line.
Following the July 15 coup attempt, new practices are also being launched to identify "secret communityists" who are hiding themselves while thousands of people are being expelled from institutions.
As part of the work, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan emphasised the importance of the public's reports in the fight against Ankara. "Your friends from that community can be your friends, I say, expose them."
You need to report it to the D.A.'s office.
It's a patriotic debt.
"He may not know everyone's intel, he may not know the police, or he may not make it, but look, they're on the run."
An online tip has been launched by the Ministry of Interior, Police General Directorate and National Intelligence Agency (MIT).
According to this practice, he will be able to communicate with the police and the MIT those serving him around the citizen, the activities of the organisation he knows, the institutions belonging to the organisation.
www.egm.gov.tr/pages/ihbar, www.mit.gov.ktr/kinkikiin links will keep the information of people who will report with the form submitted to the service.
Those who want to file a report submitted by the Security Directorate will also be able to add documents.
The same application will return to him if the informant asks for it.
"As they can telephone the 155 Police Helpline, the citizen will be able to give these information to the Public Prosecutors' Offices in the districts and districts.
It was inspired by the basement, and they built an example village in Sivas.
In co-operation with Canköy, the subsidiary and philanthropist businessman in Lakeova district of SIVAS, the 'equal village' was built.
In the village where the roads were paved and the sidewalks were paved with cobblestones, all houses were sampled and painted blue and white.
The Colekova subsidiary has prepared a model village project to improve the image and quality of life in the district.
In this case, the model village has been selected as the 66 digits of Canköy, 12km away from the district.
The roads of the village, where infrastructure and upper structure services have been increased, have been paved with asphalt, and the sidewalks are covered with hardwood.
The village houses, which have different shades of color, were painted with the support of the businessman Selahattin Ayan, who owns Pelit Bakery.
The whole village was covered in white and blue buildings.
BODRUM EXECUTED
Erkan Jesus Erat, the Co-op of Lakeova, who briefed on the study, said they had prepared this project to create a role model for other villages. "The more modern the village seems, the more colorful the houses are all one color is part of our project."
When we started this project, we looked for a place to sample it.
When we went to the basement, we noticed a white-painted, blue window view of the houses.
We wanted to imitate the basement because of the white cleanness and the positive influence it has on people.
By doing our work, we painted all the houses in Canköy white and blue.
This work was done by government and philanthropic cooperation.
The project cost about 200,000 liras.
The study turned our Canköy in Sivas into a small basement.
We want to continue this kind of work with our budget and the support of our businessmen again.
Canköy Mukhtar Abdullah Macit, 66, said the village has received a brand-new image with the support of the subsidiary.
Macit thanked all those who worked hard, saying that being a model village also pleased them and the people of the village.
Drug operation in the Canal
Seven people have been detained in a drug operation organised by gendarmes in the Kangal district of SIVAS.
Police officers working in Cetinkaya County have spent 600 grams of marijuana, 49 drugs, 1 shotgun, and 1 blank gun in their search with the help of narcotics detector dogs.

Four people's assets have been seized along with Gulen in Adana's case (PDY)
Fethullah Gülen, Omar Ekci, Kemal Elibal and Cemal Soncu, who have been tried at the 2nd High Criminal Court on charges of zoning and profiting from the Fethullah Terrorist Organization/Paral State Organization/PDY in ADANA, has been decided to seize all assets.
A report to Adana Security Directorate on 15 May 2015 claimed that in 2012 the Metropolitan Deputy Mayor Hadn't mind, and that his administration's zoning and plan fraud had been transformed into a housing area, despite the lack of a parliamentary decision on land belonging to the Legal University known for its proximity to the Gulan community.

5 of whom have been arrested, including Fethullah Gulen and former Adana Metropolitan Deputy Mayor Albinaş, have been sued by the 2nd High Criminal Court for 5 to 35 years in prison for the arrest of 17 defendants.
While not all defendants have agreed to the charges, in the last hearing of the trial, all arrests have been released under judicial control and ban from abroad.
IMAGES CONTINUED
The court has issued a warrant for the arrest of Omer Ekinci, Kemal Elibal and Cemal Soncu, who have escaped along with the case's number-one defendant, Fethullah Gulen.
However, the court has decided to conduct illegal proceedings for the four fugitives who have not been arrested and have not been brought to the hearings.
The court's committee then ruled that all assets of Fethullah Gulen, Omer Ekinci, Kemal Elibal and Cemal Soncu's Penal Court (CMK) 278/1 should be seized according to the Article 278/1, which was found in the foreign country to ensure that the case against them would remain fruitless.
With the court's decision, non-moving persons belonging to fugitive defendants in Turkey, land-sea and air transport vehicles, all rights and purchases, valuable documents, company shares with their partner, safe deposit boxes and bank accounts have been frozen.

The audited asset fund is back on the commission.
The Turkish Entity Fund, which is expected to be among the world's largest funds, has been removed from the silent bag of legislation over objections.
The fund was decided to be renegotiated due to lack of control mechanisms, but it was renegotiated at the commission without any changes.
"We are strongly opposed to the fact that this structure, which will consist of public assets, labourers, employees' mandatory pension cuts, unemployment funds collected for the unemployed, should be excluded from constitutional control mechanisms," said CHP MP and Plan and Budget Commissioner Utku Çakırözer, who evaluated the AKP's proposal for the Entity Fund as a law to be made up of.com.
The government's long-term proposal for the Turkish Entity Fund to provide long-term funding for investments and projects was lifted from the bag on Tuesday, with the opposition saying it should also be discussed.
Today, however, the AKP brought the proposal back to the Plan and Budget Commission, as it were.
Eskişehir MP Utku Çakırözer, a CHP member of the TBM Plan and Budget Commission, told CHP's concerns and concerns about the Entity Fund's proposal of law.com.
"When the establishment of this fund came to the Plan and Budget Commission in the bag bill, our former Finance Minister, Zechariah Cleanel, head of the CHP delegation, expressed our concerns and concerns, proposing that the bag be removed from the law and discussed in detail as well."
The government, which accepted our view, withdrew the bill.
The bill came to the commission as it was yesterday.
"The government seems to insist that it be removed from the House within a week," he said.
"Our biggest concern for this law proposal is lack of rules," he said.
"Public assets are being handed over to the worker, the employee's mandatory pension cuts, the revenues collected for the unemployed, the revenues from privatisation, beyond the control of parliament and the Court and to a structure that has no responsibilities," he said.
"But we have a savings deficit," he said, adding that such funds were established in Russia, China and the Gulf countries had more than oil revenues and trades, and that this is how the fund was funded.
So the fund will be made up of public resources, people's money.
A total of 100 billion in unemployment funds are planned to transfer 100 billion from the individual pension fund forced on employees, 50 billion from privatisation.
"So this fund, which will be made entirely out of public money, must be under public supervision and should not be irresponsibly spent," he said.
Emphasizing that the state's resources are collected, that it is unacceptable for a government-owned fund to be held outside the control of parliament, the government's resources are collected, and that its assets are guaranteed in debt, Cakirezer has expressed his concerns and concerns about the Entity Fund proposal.
Jobs and transactions on gathering, spending, debt to the public cannot be avoided by the supervision of independent control companies alone.
There must be public supervision and a transparent structure.
The law proposal does not have provisions on the Constitutional control and transparency of the Fund of Property.
No restrictions on how much resources to transfer.
No one will be able to account for how this fund is being used.
The purpose of the fund is to justify funding major projects.
There's no need to set up an unsupervised fund outside the budget.
Why don't you put it in the budget?
And so, naturally, the question comes to mind, "Why are the Deputies and the Capitol audits being avoided?"
They are not opposed to the transfer of money into investments, but they are opposed to the fact that it is done with non-transparent, non-accountable mechanisms, Cakirözer said. "Is such a fund necessary to be discussed?"
But if the government insists on it, then we have to make sure that the current international standards in other countries where such investment funds are established apply in Turkey as well.
It has to be structured in a way where the control and responsibility mechanism is brought in.
It's supposed to be built with no suspects on it, to account for its own money used to the citizen, every penny.
"We are pleased that the AKP is listening to our criticisms in parliament, especially after the July 15 coup attempt."
In this proposal, we hope that the AKP will listen to our constructive criticism.
We don't want national beings being used illegally, handed over, those who use it are irresponsible, and there's no public supervision.
"It can only be useful if these concerns are resolved," he said.
It has been learned that efforts have been made to reach a compromise between the AKP and the opposition on the coming proposal of the law.
"Our confidence in Turkey is what we invest in."
"Our $30 billion investment in the last five years is a sign of confidence in our country's future," said Ali Koç, president of the Ford Automotive Board of Directors.
Coach Holding Board Deputy Director and Ford Automotive Board Chairman Ali Koç met at a meeting held by the executive of several foreign capital firms, the Istanbul Industrial Chamber (ISO) on "Those who rely on Turkey, the producers in Turkey."
"We are not only expressing our faith and trust in our country with our partners, we are filling it with our investments and actions," Ali Koç said at the meeting.
The $30 billion investment we've made over the last five years is a sign of confidence in our country's future.
The essential issues for attracting more foreign investments in Turkey are a reliable and fair legal system, a democratic, qualified labour and R&Ge, an ecosystem that promotes innovation, entrepreneurship and integration in international standards.
In the last few years, our government has offered our industrialists the most comprehensive incentives in our Republic history.
"I believe that with these incentives and holistic strategies, we can start a new "investment move" that we need.
"We now know this as global players, not just a single country's problem," said Huseyin Gelis, chairman of Siemens Industries and Trade Executive Board of Turkey and CEO.
We came to Turkey with a long-term look.
As long as we're united and united, our problems will be solved.
We were able to bring what couldn't be in Turkey to this land 160 years ago.
We will continue to be in these areas in Turkey.
He said, "Of course we're going to build factories, but we need to keep our horizons open in this area."
Turkey is one of the top 10 countries for them, said Shell Turkey Country President Ahmet Erdem. "Turkey is one of the top 10 countries for Shell."
We sincerely believe in Turkey's potential and future.
We have invested in many areas, especially energy, and we continue to do so.
We thank our president, our Prime Minister, and our ministers for their supportive work on international investors.
It's been done to reassure international investors.
"This is to increase our country's competitiveness," he said.
"On August 10th, our Global CEO would arrive in Turkey," said Dr. Alton Demirdere, head of Sandoz/Novartis Turkey and the Middle East District.
But the trip was delayed.
That's what we opposed.
Because the CEO's arrival was very important.
They made demands, like bulletproof cars, protections.
And then when he got here, he saw that everything was normal.
He left the guards and the car and went home happy.
Investment in a country is like marriage.
First you promise, if everything goes well, you'll get engaged and get married with a long-term plan.
We're married to Turkey, and we have no intention of getting a divorce.
He's been turned off the cliff!
Prime Minister Banili Yıldırım called on business leaders to attend a consultation meeting held by the Istanbul Industrial Chamber on "Those who rely on Turkey, the producers in Turkey."
"We must not miss the transition to industry to 4.0," said Prime Minister Yıldırım, expressing that Turkey's industry is an industrial sector that will ensure its comparative superiority.
He said, "If we're interested in catching our country's engine and its 2023 targets, we need to think about the industrial revolution together with the IT and technology revolution."
"We were talking about another Turkey today, if they were successful, those who meant to destroy our country's future, those who tried to destroy its democracy, those who did not hesitate to bomb our Veteran Assembly," Prime Minister Yıldırım added on the night of July 15th.
We were going to talk about a Turkey between third-world countries who were taken over by the coup, the national will was eliminated, and the world had fallen out of the league of developing countries.
"Thank God, the insight of our nation, the Commander-in-Chief, our President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's strength and the determination of our government, we have eliminated this plague," he said.
"We will quickly come out of the influence of this event and move forward," Prime Minister Yıldırım said.
It's never, ever right to live with a constant blow.
We have very ambitious targets ahead of us.
This coup attempt did not undermine Turkey's economy.
Once again, those who are looking for chaos and crisis are wrong.
Today, both our democracy and our economy stand firm.
Our banking sector, our financial sector, continues to work in good health.
In 2015, the foreign trade deficit appears to have dropped by 25 percent.
The Cari deficit's national income rate was 5.8 per cent in 2014, while this rate dropped to 4.5 in 2015.
We aim to reduce it to four at the end of this year.
We will never change our firm position in the public finances.
Turkey's 2016 budget also exceeded the national income of 130 countries.
We have reduced the national income rate of the budget deficit over 11 per cent to 1.3% in 2015, and we are trying to maintain those rates.
We're better off in public debt than in the EU, most of the world's countries.
Our banking financial sector is working on a solid ground.
"Our Central Bank, despite July 15th, did not feel the need to exchange money for the market, and we have gross reserves of over 121 billion dollars, not a reduction in our reserves."
"We are also making comprehensive arrangements for you to free yourself from your burdens of the past," Prime Minister Yıldırım said, saying they will provide all the ease for the development of the economy, the growth of production and the creation of new jobs.
We've made a lot of arrangements, and we're going to continue to spend it, until we're able to make it easier to pay off the stock pardons, more than the deposit boxes, and the unpaid tax debt to be paid off again.
"Keep producing for the country, keep trusting your country, and your government will continue to remove obstacles in front of you one by one," he said.

Vice President Mehmet Simsek, Minister of Science Industry and Technology Faruk Özlü attended a meeting held by Economy Minister Nihat Zeybekci İstanbul Industry Chamber (İSO) on "Those who trust Turkey, the producers of Turkey."
Speaking at the meeting, Science Industry and Technology Minister Faruk Özlü said, "I think there have been many good results from developments on the night and after July 15th."
The most important of all is the spirit of unity and unity that Turkey now feels deeply.
The July 15th process showed how strongly the Turkish economy has dynamics, and how deeply society has internalized democracy.
"For a society that has achieved this level in economics and democracy, it is clear that the next process will be easier and faster," he said.
"TÜRKEYA NEEDS TO BE SAVED FROM THIS SHIT"
Economy Minister Nihat Zeybekci said they had difficulty explaining the July 15 coup attempt from Faruk Özlü to the world, saying they had declared mobilisation as a government.
"If 63.4% of the first five percent of my real sector goes to interest, we should concentrate on our work, leaving all our jobs behind," Zeybekci said, referring to the interest reductions that the banks have recently started.
That's why our President is turning around and telling us what to do.
With the real sector, with the banking system, with his government, with his politics, after the July 15 civil Turkish democracy revolution, politics and together Turkey must get rid of this ordeal.
And we welcome recent developments in this regard.
"We will, hopefully, be able to maintain sustainability, continuity, by supporting this competition as the economy management, which is starting down to zero point nine per cent, eights, which the banks have started in the coming period, with our President's incentives," he said.
"We're going to supply our supplier with green paper."
"In the coming period, the world will be won, we will be ladle," Nihat Zeybekci said. "We will not leave a country that has not been taken in the world by our president, our Prime Minister, and we will not leave a door that has not been stolen."
We're not leaving anyone we haven't contacted about increasing our trade.
"We will never, ever ignore this; we will not be the birds in the hand as we chase after the bird in the branch," he said.
Zeybekci also said that the exporters would be given green passports later on, saying, "One of the latest decisions is that his law has come out, and we've now completed his regulations in the economy ministry; we'll give our exporters about 17 to 20,000 exporters representing this country, as well as our privileged green passport, which is our exporter."
"I'm going to have to have people present in my attack."
Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek, referring to the July 15 coup attempt and the post-declared State of Emergency, said "The nightmare" for the coup attempt. "But it's behind us now, we have to move forward."
"Of course, those involved in this attempt must be cleared of the state and this process is under way; but more importantly, serious administrative reforms were necessary to avoid the next attempt at this kind of coup," he said, saying for two simple reasons.
As a climate for these administrative reforms, the State of Emergency has been declared, and so far serious structural reforms have been made.
"We have, of course, acted within democratic principles and the state of law while we do all this," he said.
Simsek said that life has returned to normal in many areas, stressing that there is no cause for the slightest concern of companies and individuals who are not involved in the financing of terrorism.
"I think the foundations of Turkey's democracy have been strengthened because when you look at the origin of recent problems, you will see that this network of betrayal is definitely involved.
"It will strengthen Turkey's democracy if this period is closed in Turkey," he said.
"Turkey has returned to its original agenda, there is progress in structural reforms," Simsek said, saying that the fundamentals of the economy are generally sound and are back to normal structural reform agendas without delay.
Structural reforms are already essential because populism, conservation is increasing in the world.
"Turkey can only prepare for the future by reforming," he said.
Finally, he emphasised Turkey will not break from the West, stressing that "Turkey may occasionally disagree with our Western allies, our friends, but Turkey does not break up with the West, it does not give up the European Union," he said.
He jumped into the sea at 25 meters and...
In Antalya, the 17-year-old Shamail Tayyar Flagmaker was hospitalized when he jumped from the cliffs of the 25m high called Eagle Hill.
The Shamil Tayyar Flagker, who swam with his friends on the coast of theconium in the evening, then dived into the sea from the cliffs at 25m high, known as the Eagle Hill under the variant.
Shamil Tayyar Flagman, a professional swimmer, got his neck hurt when he hit the water.
The Flagmaker, who had difficulty moving at sea, was again brought ashore by his fellow professional swimmers.
Paramedics arrived at the scene following the intervention took Shamil Tayyar Flagker to Antalya Education and Research Hospital in an ambulance.
It has been noted that there is no life-threatening threat to Flagmaker who has been treated.
A friend of Flagman's who testified to the police said, "His neck got hurt when he jumped off Eagle Hill."
He said, "We didn't see this coming."

Two brothers in Kahta died in an armed attack
2 brothers and sisters killed in Kahta County of ADİYAMAN who were attacked in a car with a gun.
The incident took place on Mustafa Kemal Street in the evening hours.
A gun shot was fired on the 02 KH 839 car headed towards the district centre of Ramadan Karahan, 39.
The car in the Karahan administration, which lost control of the fire, crashed into another vehicle.
Meanwhile, the person who approached the car fired one after the other with Ramazan Karahan and his older brother, Omar Karahan, 50 years old.
The Karahan brothers were severely injured, while the attacker fled the scene on a motorcycle.
Police and paramedics were dispatched to the scene after the report.
The Karahan brothers were taken to Kahta State Hospital by ambulance.
Omar and Ramadan Karahan, who were treated in the emergency room, were not rescued despite all efforts by doctors.
While the bodies of the two brothers were being placed in the morgue for autopsy, police investigating the CCTV and security cameras in the area where the incident took place launched an investigation into the identity of the escaped assailant.
Britain must channel the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will offer improvement and prosperity not only in our local communities and not in London, but throughout the country.
I think it will make Heathrow quite attractive, as it did in 2012 in London, when we worked so hard to benefit all nations and regions from the Games.
The Olympics gave Stratford and East End great advantages.
And we'll do it again by creating opportunities for locals and companies near Heathrow.
For our local communities alone, 10,000 new internship opportunities will create 40,000 new jobs, and we will not leave unemployed young people around the airport.
As before London 2012, there will be those who think the struggle to expand Heathrow is too difficult.
I was told that Britain would never prepare for the Games and that we would disgrace the whole world.
Doubters were wrong in 2012, and they'll be wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers all the questions asked.
As in the Olympics, Heathrow is not just a few people, but an infrastructure project for many.
Enlargement leaves 180,000 new jobs and the opportunity to create 211 billion pounds of economic growth and many skills and jobs both around the airport and across the United Kingdom.
We have a great team in Heathrow that has put together an investment in infrastructure worth 11 billion pounds in time and budgets for two of the world's busiest runways, from T5 to T2, back to back for five years.
We are now ready to present a third track, supported by a private investment worth £16 billion.
The London 2012 Games were a great success for the United Kingdom, and I have no doubt the Heathrow expansion would be the same.
It is time for us to channel this Olympic spirit into Heathrow's expansion to ensure our future in commerce and create many skills and jobs that Britain will be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton, Head of the Heathrow Board and former Secretary of the Treasury
Adblock Plus is like a "cat-mouse game" on Facebook advertising block.
Attempts to block advertising software for companies who make money from online advertising are like "cat-mouse game" for one of the companies that does software.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would block ad blockers on its desktop, Adblock Plus released a blog saying it could update its users' filters to prevent advertising on the social network.
On Tuesday, Facebook said it would change the codes around the ads to make it difficult for commercial blockers to determine which part of the page is advertising.
But Adblock says he's breaking new codes now.
In a blog post, Adblock spokeswoman Ben Williams wrote that "a forward fight between the open source adverts and those who tried to prevent them has been under way since the invention of advertising." Facebook is likely to come up with its own solution soon.
The world's largest social media company is in this fight, showing what a concern the ad blockers have for the industry.
According to a study by Pagefair and Adobe last year, about 200 million globally use advertising blockers, four times the number of people using this type of software in 2013.
With 1.03 billion days of active users accessing Facebook via mobile devices, mobile advertising is now 84 per cent of Facebook's advertising revenue.
According to one spokesman, mobile ad blockers are not effective on Facebook's mobile applications for social networks and Instagram, so the company is pursuing ad blockers on the desktop.
Since Facebook considers such a move worth investing in, desktop ads should still be able to provide sufficient income.
Again on Tuesday, Facebook announced that it will update the "promotion preferences" tool so that people can better control the ads presented to them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock's new filters were alarming and would block some of the non-advertent content on the site.
"These people do not have a good experience and we plan to deal with the problem," a Facebook spokesman said in an e-mail statement.
The ad blockers are a dulled vehicle, so we're focused on creating tools like Ad Preferences to give people control.
A woman ran into the Swiss highway; it looks like suicide.
The victim was lying on the highway at midnight.
Police are searching early Thursday for witnesses who witnessed several vehicles hit her on the highway.
The incident took place on the A1 near Morges in the Canton of Vaud just after midnight Thursday.
Vaud police said in a statement that she lay on the ground in the dark of the night "unhopeful" and that several vehicles hit her.
A 49-year-old Swedish woman, who clearly wanted to kill herself, was hit by several vehicles, including a truck.
He died at the scene.
Police have stated that several of the drivers involved have been interviewed, but some have not been identified, and have asked them and everyone involved to appeal to them.
Attorney Gilles Hofstetter explained to Le Tribune de Geneve that "a criminal prosecution has been filed as a logical step in such cases."
However, it is not yet known whether drivers involved will face any charges.
Was it possible to avoid a collision?
That's what the prosecutor needs to identify," said Hofstetter.
Two similar cases in the past five years indicate that drivers will not be held responsible.
In both cases (both included a person on the highway in the dark), the report ruled that it was normal for drivers not to expect a pedestrian across the highway at midnight.
Last year, one night in August 2014, a police officer who hit a man lying on the road near Payne in A1 was found not guilty of causing death for negligence.
The court said the 22-year-old victim was drunk and passed out on the road.
The court said that the police officer responding to an emergency call was using the vehicle in a reasonable manner and that the presence of a man on the road was "a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation."
Anyone who has information about this incident near Morges on Thursday must call the police on phones 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once suitable for living
The new NASA climate model estimates that Venus once had conditions for life.
Scientists at the NASA Institute for Goddard Space Studies developed a model to explore the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus once hosted conditions similar to the one on Earth, with its warm, water-free surface and CO2 atmosphere.
In the past, scientists explained the low rate of rotation of Venus with a thick layer of atmosphere.
However, the latest estimates suggest that Venus may have had a thin Earth-like atmosphere and yet could return slowly.
The model also looked at the topography of the old Venus.
Although its planet may have more dry regions than Earth, it may once have had sufficient water and protection against rapid evaporation with geographical variation.
The ancient Venus was also taking advantage of a less than 30 percent sun.
"The slow rotation of Venus in the simulation of the GISS model allowed the sun to be facing the sun for almost two months at a time," said GIS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a news bulletin.
It warmed the surface, causing heavy clouds to form layers of rain that move like an umbrella protecting the surface from solar warming.
As a result, today's average climate temperatures were only a few degrees colder than Earth's.
For Venus, the model created a story similar to the evolution previously proposed by planetary scientists.
Although it once had conditions for life, Venus was exposed to a lot of heat and ultraviolet light over several billion years.
Their ocean evaporated, and the water vapor burned with ultraviolet light.
Hydrogen is exhausted, and there's only a thick atmosphere left with a deadly greenhouse gas effect, full of carbon dioxide, which is Venus as we know it today.
Researchers shared the results of the new Venus climate model in Geophysical Studies Articles.
Patrick Roy resigned from the Avalanche antenna.
Patrick Roy resigned Thursday as vice president of Colorado Avalanche coaching and hockey operations, expressing that the team had no say in the decision-making process.
The Colorado executive vice president/ General Director Joe Sakic approved this development and said the club would immediately start looking for a new trainer.
"For the past three years, I have carried out my duties as vice president of head coaching and hockey operations at Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," said 50-year-old Roy in his statement.
Over the summer, I've been thinking a lot about how to make this team better by giving it the depth it needs, and how to get it to a higher level.
To accomplish that, the vision of coach and VP hockey operations must be in perfect harmony with the vision of the founding.
He also needs a say in the decisions that affect the performance of the team.
In this case, these conditions are not yet met.
Sakic, who joined Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick informed me of your decision today," said Sakic.
We thank him for everything he's done for our organization, and we wish him good luck in the future.
Roy was awarded the Jack Adams Award for Best Coach of the League in his first season with Avalanche in 2013-14.
The club won 112 points and led the team to finish the league first, but Colorado lost to Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and missed the after-season games every two years.
Avalanche crossed 39-39-4 in 2015-16 and received five points less than needed for the second Joker field at the Western Conference.
Roy, the goalkeeper on the Hall of Honor, won four Stanley Cups, both for the Montreal Canadiens, both for Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers continue talks by suspending strike
The strike of the North Sea oil workers was suspended due to the price, and the chief negotiators began to debate over a new round of talks.
The strike against the oil field service company Wood Group is gradually conducted on platforms in the North Sea, run by Royal Dutch Shell.
In a joint statement, he said, "We, the Unions of Wood Group and Unite and RMT, have decided to restart the process to resolve the current dispute."
In the next few weeks, from the beginning of next week, we will hold a series of meetings that will take all day to adopt a new perspective on problems.
Labour unions said this protest was their first action in 25 years against pay cuts that could reach 30 per cent.
Wood Group has cut about 9% this year in payments to its contractors in the North Sea due to negative pressures in the market.
In 2014, the company's contractors on the coast were also given a 10% price reduction following this reduction process.
The company said additional cuts would provide the company with the necessary space for the market to pass through the difficult period.
Shell laid off thousands of people and announced plans to abandon oil and gas operations in the country by 10.
Energy companies are under pressure because of low crude oil prices, an economic situation in which Britain's decision to leave the European Union in June.
Earlier this week, Scottish Parliament member Dave Anderson will meet with labour leaders and discuss one of the largest labour conflicts in the North Sea.
As he said, the North Sea is vital to the regional economy.
"We need an effective economy for the majority, not for the minority in the North Sea and across the country," he said in a statement.
In 2016, less than $1.4 billion is expected to be invested in new projects in the North Sea, despite the average investment of about $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measured the rotation speed of stars in the Pleiades constellation
Kepler's space telescope has helped astronomers to create the most complete catalog of the return speeds of stars in the Pleiades constellation with its final mission.
The new data helps astronomers understand why stars in the constellation rotate at a variable rate and why their cycles relate to planetary formation.
Luisa Rebull, a research scientist at Caltech's Centre for Infrared Processing and Analysis in Pasadena, said in a news bulletin, "When we compare our results to clusters of stars, we hope to learn more about the relationship between the mass, age, and even the history of a solar system."
The Pleiades constellation is 445 light-years away from Earth.
Most of the stars in the constellation were formed 125 million years ago and have reached the new level of adulthood.
They're spinning at the highest possible speed in their lives.
At peak rotation speeds, these ripentening stars create a huge amount of star wind.
As these winds move through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a breaking effect on the stars.
As a star grows older, the rate of rotation begins to drop.
Kepler measures the speed of each star's rotation by observing the time between the appearance of visible star spots, such as sunspots.
The latest rotational speed catalog suggests that larger stars rotate faster than smaller stars.
Rebull said that by comparing stars to dancers, the older ones are making their turn on one foot slower than the smaller ones.
Rebull said, "We see that the slow turners in the country's ball are much heavier, and the fast turners are very light stars."
Since the Pleiades constellation is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare star properties with rotation speeds.
Rebull said, "The country provides theoretical models for constellations in both directions as young and old."
There's a lot we'd like to know about how, when, and why stars fall, and why they leave their dancing shoes in a corner, so to speak.
Rebull and his colleagues have detailed their latest analysis of the return speeds of the Pleiades team star in three new articles that will soon be published in Astronomy Magazine.
