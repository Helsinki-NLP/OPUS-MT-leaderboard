The periodic rhythm is not just a response to the periodic signal from the outside, it's recorded about most organisms including bacteria, bacteria, plants, animals, animals.
The internal clock is a self-sustaining trigger, without any signal from the outside.
Hery and Chase's experiments were one of the strong experiments that suggest DNA is genetic material.
Hery and Chase used a farge to plant their DNA into bacteria.
They tested two experiments, one marked by radiation in the DNA of Fage.
The mutation may have different effects, depending on whether or not the cells that are affected by the genetic material, or whether they are the different cells that are affected by the gene.
The mutations that occur in the reproductive cells are only passed on to children, and the mutations that occur in other parts may cause cell death or cancer.

Every person who lives in a social life uses traffic.
In the developed world, most of the complaints of water quality and bridges collapse are not heard.
Why does traffic have these complaints, and why does traffic fail everyday?
Traffic research is a study of individual drivers and vehicle movements between two points and those interactions.
I'm afraid I can't predict the behavior of a driver, so it's hard to study the flow of traffic.
Fortunately, the driver tends to act in rational consistent range, so traffic flow tends to be a certain reasonable consistency, and it can be expressed mathematically.
In the last video, we're going to talk about the relationship between the three major properties of the velocity of (2) density, (2), and the speed of the traffic stream in order to be more accurate.
These relationships can help plan, design, and run a road facility.

The nuclear bomb works by the principle that it needs energy to gather more protons and neutrons in one nucleus.
If you divide the nucleus again, you're going to get a little bit of energy out of it, and you're going to roll a heavy load of the hills.
If you have an atom, you have an unstable nucleus, and that nucleus tends to divide even if you do nothing.

So, the idea of content is based on finding things that can tickle people's hearts, or Asperger.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and desires in their adulthood.
In these theories, we're going to look at the motive that some species want to identify, and then we're going to look at the environmental factors that they can't identify, or they can't.
So, the second theory that we're going to talk about is that the two content theory that we're going to talk about is the two factors of Maslow's desire for Maslow and Helsberg.

And this is how we can get more information and materials to build a simulation model to understand human behavior.
AI is a very important field in computer science, processing behavioral, learning, intellectual adaptations by machine.
The AI research involves the creation of machines that are required to automatically automate tasks that require intelligence.

You can also use a blog to improve the student's writing ability.
The blog author starts to try to improve the sentence in order to avoid criticism.
And writing a blog allows students to be more familiar with the world around them.
This is a way to encourage students to work together and encourage students to spread learning beyond traditional classes.
By using blogging properly, students' analysis and criticism improve. By responding to Internet materials, students can define their position in a context that others have written, and show their self-opinion about certain problems in the context of the problem. (OAVc 2002.)
