"I don't like women's lingerie," said Suzuki.
"You're going to be like me on September 30th!"
I'm going to show you some of the most messed-up episodes in the studio.
The studio one-on-one?
Suzuki, the "Too rude Body Tuck" series.
And from midnight after the ground wave broadcast, from 0: 50 to "Abema TV," full video of the class and laugh research.
In this broadcast, Suzuki would come out of the world as if he had no idea what was going on.
In 2007, Suzuki who did model debut in Gal magazine when he was 18 years old.
Since the first TV show in 2011, we've been working on a high-pitched talk and overreacting to bareerage.
Suzuki was published in a week magazine this year in a magazine called "I hate a woman's lingerie," winning a top in the "Rosetier" section.
And he also said that he was elected to the second place in the whole entertainment world.
As a result, his mother was shocked, and his husband was hurt at work, and he also caused trouble for his people.
How did you get to the top of the "hate the Rand" walk as a talent?
In the background of all the talk and reality of Suzuki, it was from the word of a senior artist.
It's also a Suzuki that has been escalating its extremism, not only to the reality, but also to the "full body tacitters" and "full force underpinata," and "all the forces" and "all the extremism."
In the past, Suzuki played a body touch that was at the theater, and in the past, it was a situation where the studio studio, the earthquake.
And then, after the ground wave broadcast, we distributed the full class and laughing research department.
"The secret story of my husband and the secret story of the day was exposed naked."

Drive on the heels is dangerous!
There's been a mistake in the young pedal accident.
It's a violation of road traffic.
There's been a lot of reports of malfunctioning accidents in Perdus, but that's a big mistake.
In the late '20s, the number of malpractice accidents that occurred in the late' 20s, the most common age was over 1080, over 1032 over 75 years old.
The problem is not that many older people do not have to step forward, but that the younger ones are also concerned about the same thing.
You want to take that off your feet?
Do you want to make it safe?
Not in this data, but from the decline of the body, like the driver's skills and reflexes and so on. In young men, they are considered to be distracted by other things like music, or conversation, or appearance.
In other words, women choose different shoes by high heels, bread, sandals, mules and that day's clothes and drive.
Some people think it's difficult to change clothes when they know that it's not right for them to drive, but there are people who don't think it's a risk to get in.
But driving at high heels and sandals tend to cover road traffic.
One is, "Do not drive to harm the person who caused the accident."
The other is that the driver has to comply with all the details that the National Guard has set up.
Not even in every city podium, but in the high heels and informing it, it's also similar to the fact that driving is a violation of the possibility of preventing driving.
So, why are you driving at high heels?
It's clear to me the basic idea of a safe operation.
For a secure pen operation, first you set a foot on the floor, and then you set the foot to be perpendicular to the brake pedal, and when you step on the brake pedal, you tilt to the right as a support point.
It's important to keep it steady, whether the car is behaving or not.
But at high heels, the area of the ground is small, and the width of the floor is always grazed and brushed, and the width of the feet all over the height of the hill is not small enough to reach the pedal.
This could be dangerous.
And most cars have floor carpet, but this material is easy to scratch, like a high heel, or a brakes.
And the example is that when you step back from the pedal, the heels are stuck behind the pedal and the gas pedal is gone.
And the second thing we need to do is we want to go to the company that has a new AWD car, 86 / BRZ model, and we want to do a collaborative development.
It's the same thing with Toyota Cars and SUBRU.
Toyota gets a svaler stock and becomes a relevant company for the balance sheet.
Since both companies agreed to work together in 2005, they've been working on a partnership with the Toyota vehicles, transportation from Toyota to SR6.
In June, we agreed to work on EV platform and EV vehicles.
So let's say that this is the company that we agreed to.
The Svalbard stock now owned by Toyota is 16.83% of the vote rate but get additional until this reaches 20%.
Svalu will be a relevant company in order to handle Toyota.
So the total amount of the total amount that Toyota has spent to get the stock price on the Svalbard stock (8 billion yen) is equal to the amount of yacht shares that the Toyota has given to the Svalbard stock.
Both companies developed cooperation with business capital partners, enhanced.
A collaborative development of AWD models, 86 / BRZ models, with SARS, and SYS in the Svalbard area, and a collaborative collaboration in the developing connector area, and other techniques in the auto-driving area.

But both companies can't wire another company for 100 days, so the SIM lock works on the device.
The NTT Dko will only take 3 / 3 of the terminal to the top of its own line.
