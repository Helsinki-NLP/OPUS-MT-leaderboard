On this broadcast, there will be a "Students of the World Had I worked my whole life, I'd've been fucked up before I knew it."
Suzuki, who made his model debut in the Garr magazine in 2007 at 18 years of age.
Ever since I first appeared on TV in 2011, I've been busy in high-pressure talks and overreactions, and I've been working on a variety of differentials.
That kind of tree won first place this year in the "I don't like the Lady Running" section of a weekly magazine.
And they say they've been elected second in the whole entertainment world.
As a result, the mother is shocked and her husband is able to work at the workplace, and her family is in trouble too.
In class, we look back on the steps of the tree as a talent, how it came to win the top of "I don't like the lady running."
It is said that the background of all the talks and reactions in the Suzuki's excessive talk and reaction was based on the words of an old man.
Moreover, not only the reaction, but also the "full body contact" and "full-strike" and "full-sharp" and "all-sharing" tree that was accelerating its radicalness.
In the past, when Suzuki went to the big concertist, he showed a physical touch, but his rudeness led to a shaking of the studio.
And right after the ground wave, we're going to send out a full edition of the class and a laughing team.
And the "private talk with my husband" that I had exposed in order to increase the scene of the explosions and the performances of the Suzuki era.

Japan, the last hundred finals.
The 100-meter male finals start at SaniBrown Hakim (left).
I couldn't make it to the finals.
A 100-meter male final.
The second world championship day on land was held in Doha on the 28th day, and Sanibrung Hakim and Ichiki, at the 100-meter mark, were not the first to make their way to Japan.

It's not safe to drive with high heels!
There's been a lot of missteps on young people's pedals.
A violation of traffic laws.
There's been an increase in reports of accidents due to mismanagement, such as mismanaged pedals, but it's a big mistake to think that it's only a matter of old drivers.
In the number of misdiagnosed cases (the NYPD data for 2015), the largest number of accidents in the world is under 24 and the highest number of accidents over the age of 75 is 1032.
It is by no means common in older people to make mistakes, but it is important to call attention to younger people as well.
You want me to take the umbrella at your feet?
You want me to make it safe?
There is no description of the gender or the cause of this data, but unlike older people, who are often considered to be infertile from physical decline, such as driving skills and reflexes, there is also the possibility of missteps and mistakes in the younger generation because of being distracted by other things, such as music and conversation, and so forth.
In particular, some women choose shoes according to their high heels, Pamps, Sandals, Muir, and so on, and they drive as they do.
While some people know it's not suitable to drive, it's not easy to change clothes, but many people drive without any thought of any danger.
But driving with high heels and sandals violates traffic laws.
One is: "Convention of handles, brakes and other operations," and "Do not drive so as to harm anyone who has caused an accident."
And the other is that the 71th Article of the Security Council, which says the drivers must observe the requirements of each State Security Council, is not to wear slippers, slippers, slippers, heels, and other controls in such a way as to prevent drivers from driving.
The same is true in each Tokyo prefecture as in the case of driving in "a fit that might prevent a driver's driving, " unless it is written with high heels.
Then why is it dangerous to drive with high heels?
It's obvious when you consider the basics of safe pedaling.
For a secure pedal operation, first place the heel on the floor, then position the foot upright against the brake pedal, and then turn the foot to the right when you step on the accelerator pedal.
In this case, it is important to keep your heels firmly fixed so that no matter what car you're driving.
However, high heels have a smaller area on the floor with heels, and it always has a gradient and a break, and for the overall foot angle at the height of the heel, the area of the foot on the pedal will be smaller and less sensitive, making it difficult to adjust.
This could lead to danger.
Also, most cars have floor carpets, which are easy to pick up with heels of high heels, and these can be so tight that they can't get the pedals on when they're in a hurry, or they can take off their heels on the ankles that they're stuck in the back of the pedal, so that they don't step in the back of the pedal.
In addition, there are cases where the heel stuck behind the pedal when the pedal was turned back, and the axel pedal failed to return.
We're going to do a lot of research on this, but we're going to do it in a couple of videos, and we're going to do it in a couple of videos, and we're going to do it in a couple of videos, and we're going to do it in a couple of videos, and we're going to do it in a couple of videos, and we're going to do it in a couple of videos, and we're going to do it in a little bit more detail.
The yo-yo car and the SUBAR (Svalued) agreed to a new business capital partnership on September 27.

Sval will be associated with the application of yoga's derivatives.
Sval, on the other hand, gets a yo-boo stock worth as much (over 80 million yen) as the yogi's money to get the svalbar stock.

U.S., refugees, at least three years in a row.
The U.S. Department has announced a policy to cut the limit of refugees from all parts of the world by 18,000 on 26 days, 2020 years of accounting.

But the last time the housing crisis has been down since Leiman's shock, the earthquake in Japan, the earthquake in Japan, and the earthquake in Kumamoto have caused demand to rise to about 1345 million yen in sales during December of 2018.
In addition to the decline in profits resulting from rising fuel prices, the profit was forced into a series of financial deficits, resulting in excessive financial deficits associated with stock and equipment investments.
As a result, financial institutions have been trying to rebuild their businesses, such as calling for a discount on their loans, but there is no sign of recovery.
I couldn't support myself coming here and giving up my business, and that was the last step.
The debt is currently under investigation, but is likely to be about two billion yen.

"Beautiful and ugly" is a piece of paper?
The image of "snake" among the beautiful girls of your work is called "The Snake."
What do you have in common with mysterious beauty and shadows?
Since the 1950s, works have been sent to the world and have been published in August of 2019.
As you hold it in your hand, you'll notice the correlation between beauty and fear in your work.
Is the shadow the most attractive thing you can do?
The beautiful girls of your work.
There is also a phrase in the "Beautiful Collection" section that says that "their beauty, their horror, their horror, their impact, their beauty at the opposite side of the story" but it may be that the contrast is more evident... because of the contrast between the beautiful face and the distorted expression of a grudge.
There is a word for "snake" in many of the works, but snakes are viewed by the viewer as "horrible creatures," and they vary in how people feel "beaut" and how they receive it.
Some people in the world like reptiles, and others are just not good at it.
So, by the sensitivity of the viewer, there may be a "snake" and a "snake" on the inside.
This creature is also called a higher-powered creature, and it is believed that the home in which the White Snake resides is blessed.
"The Snake" is the title of the book in 1965 called "Mammy's Hard!" or "The Little Girl."
It's the shadowed beauty that's about to become a "naked woman."
I think it's kind of cool, if you put it this way, it's kind of cool, but it's kind of like the beautiful girls in the drawing.
Among other things, from 1969 to 1969, "The Loki" is a beautiful girl character, as it is called, representing the work of art, but the deep sleep of a hundred years and the mysterious parts of power are associated with "the snake."

It's like the light of hope in a closed society.

"The real killer" who attacked Saudi Arabia's oil facility.
"The Iranian drone "Aberbeer" used in this bombing has dramatically improved performance in recent years by analyzing crashed U.S. military drones.
It's cheaply manufactured, and it's about 1,000 kilometers long.
It's also an advantage to be caught by radar because it's low-flying.
On September 14, 10 military drones bombed the oil facilities of the largest Saudi oil company, "Saudia Ramco."
Right after this, Yemen's anti-government organization, Hussi, is making a statement.
Iran cannot allow hostile Saudi Arabia to make money with crude oil under conditions where its own country cannot export oil. If you continue to ban oil on Iran, it is to make known to the international community that there is a corresponding pain.
After the bombing, half of Saudi Arabia's oil production stopped, and oil prices rose 15 percent.
Some voices say that oil shock will come back.
"I would like to avoid military intervention at least until next year's elections have been held in pledge to withdraw American troops from the Middle East. As it turns out, Iran will continue to strike the Hussi in secret, but the US will not be able to endure indefinitely. It is likely that they will ever decide to attack Iran."
The Civil War between the United States and Iran is facing an explosive crisis.
Why did YouTuber become a legitimate employee?
Ask your employer.
9:27 (Golden) 8:47, 247.
YouTuber, now so popular with young people.
Although it's not uncommon now for companies to come up and use their products for advertising, there are companies that have begun a unique system called YouTuber adoption, which they employ at their own company.
It's a direct marketing mix of stock companies, DMMIX, whose main business is the company's CRM, customer management.
What does it mean to adopt YouTuber?
I spoke to Mr. Komori, who is the chairman of the DMMIX, and who is actually the director of the company that YouTuber was hired.
I want to support young people who work hard on YouTube.
- How does "YouTube" work in the first place?
YouTuber is now the dream of many young people.
In the future, elementary school students will be in the top of the line of work, and more and more young people will continue to be interested in it.
In the past, our firm adopted and supported young people who are pursuing their dreams of bandmen and laughrs.
It's like "YouTuber" to hire young people who are pursuing your dream of becoming YouTuber and to support them.
- There's an image of YouTubers as individuals who would voluntarily post videos, but why did you decide to adopt them?
Koforan: While many young people are eager for a career called YouTuber, most YouTubers are not able to make the kind of revenue they thought you would.
There are a lot of creators who do videomaking and post while they're at work, and many creators who can't be recognized by their family as YouTuber.
We're not going to do that. We're not going to do that.
I'm going to support your work by supporting your career as YouTuber, which will make you unstable at first.

It is unusual for the U.S. high officials to mention the reassession of GSOMINA.
GSOMINA is the basis for the sharing of such things as daily Koreans, Japanese rice, and American Koreans.
Korea announces that she will break her treaty with Japan in August, and if she expires, the framework for protecting military information in Korea will collapse.
Mr. Napper insists, "I can't deal effectively with the crisis without GSOMINA."
"There is time to expire," he urged South Korea to return.
He also said that it was "the first time in history " in a joint flight program conducted by Nakasuke over Japan in July. He complained that" it is essential that the Koreans, who share the values of democracy and human rights, should be united in alliances. "
The current deterioration of Korean relations points out that "it hurts the interests of the United States."
While he said, "There's no purpose for intermediation," he said, "it plays a positive role in helping Korea fill the gap. "
-I'm so sorry.

The story of a gentle wife, who has lost her evil face, continues to sing in order to help her instead of being surprised by her face.
Forgetting hatred, returning with tenderness and kindness, I felt the origin of the people of Fukui's piety and kindness.
I was given a hint, and as soon as she went to the original picture book, she went to Yoshizaki's boy in the city of Yosaki, and completed the story of a gentle demon couple and a boy.
Starting in June, ten scenes were painted with a warm watercolor, with a warm coat of water, and the materials of the picture book were added.
In addition, we are going to live in the city ahead of us and take advantage of our traditional craft's advance paper, and the cover of the book is to be produced in Japanese paper.
Reading helps parents and children enjoy the touch of Japanese paper.

Mr. Sawada says, "The mind of Fukui, who has been brought up in a history of Buddhist culture, is proud of the whole country.

According to the store, television sets, washing machines, refrigerators, and other large household electricity went up in September, and sales were said to be about twice as high as they were last year.
"Increasing demand is more than we can imagine. In the latter part of the day, customers are prominent in demand for higher goods."
It's a suit-selling business to carry out a sale that has been labeled "pre-decision pre-tax tax."
The coat has been sold since early September a month earlier than usual, and it is said that this month's sales have increased by 10 percent than last year's.
The man who visited the storage store to buy an adult suit is a businessman who says, "The formula is still ahead of me, but I want to buy it before I pay the tax."
This tax increase puts the tax rate for drinking and drinking in the tax system, so that home centers and supermarkets resort to day-to-day supplies and liquor.
At the time store at home center, expand a special section of large-capacity detergents and tissues near the entrance.
Sales of day-to-day waste are one to six times higher than the previous month, and they are said to be cut out if you don't supplement them a day many times.
The city official (63) who came to buy kitchen paper, "It's just for this occasion, because it's something to buy."

"The Best Overseer" in 2019, "The Best Overseer" in honor of the greatest enemy general.
Jürgen Crop, the winner of the "The Best," looked back on his career in the interview and left a comment on the situation.
What surprised the world in many of his comments was that he had something to do with the director of the Manchester City, the largest rival to him in the title of the Premier League.
"His happiness is still in Valsa."
After the "The Best" award ceremony, the German commander claims, "I didn't imagine anything so great. I'm very pleased and proud that I could win this prize. It was a wonderful few days for me, thanks to my athletes, and the most important thing is the team."
Regarding Guardioola, Cop says: "I respect him very much," and says, "What can I say about him?" He gains many titles. His team's style is extraordinary. He is the best director I've ever played, and he has been able to compete with me for the prize."
He also mentioned Director Pchettino and Tottenham.
"His last year was incredibly wonderful. In many cases, if you don't get a title, there's nothing left in people's memory.
I don't think many experts or myself would have bet on us at the best moment in 2019. It's like a death sentence. We couldn't believe that we had a small chance and could say we had a CL in this game.
The last person to ask a more personal question: "When I was blessed with the championship, I woke up on a bench and didn't even know where I was. This didn't happen. I don't like getting drunk because I'm plagued by the obsession of self-administence. I remember that the blessings of CL domination have become very modest. I remember that if I were to put everyone in front of me, I might be able to identify all the people I saw from the bus."

Lexus sets up a special train for the Laplope "LC" and "Spotysedan" and "IS" and will be released on October 1st.

I finished my wind speed and taste as an even higher model.
The L-ANIINE singles only the topmost skin, and achieves softness with a long process of flexibleness and a color coat designed for a thin coat of its own technology.
I'm going to make it easier for you to sit around and improve your sense of fit in the running.
They also use premium leather to make their skin feel better.
In addition, they were made of metal with Alcantalolololuff and laser Etching, and they were specially equipped with squaff plates and color-head-up displays with heavy L characters.
In the interior, you will adopt a colorful Patna Brown with a doortrim, a full leather sheet, and a colorful pair of browns that are distributed to the seat belt.

The above image has been posted on a Danish Apple site (now modified).
The image certainly has the character "fra dan 4. cotobber" starting on October 4th.
If it's an official site, it looks like the information is also more accurate.
By the way, the most personal feature I'd like to try is "Sidecar."
This is a feature that IPads are used to treat as a Mac sub-screen, and it was used to be achieved by a third app.
And Sidecar, because it's an Apple purity function, is expected to be better at completion.
There are rumors of the next 16 - inch display of MacBook Pro, but I'd like to experience this next generation's macaOS in full.

Look at the young men in Thailand!
It's been a long time since I've been here.
He even entered the September head of the region's S300 and won a fine victory.
Fidices are strong in the first place, and they don't suffer the battle.
Even if the convention lasts, there is no big problem with playing the game.
Rather, it would be easier to adjust the schedule for future conventions by winning high points in the previous half of the game.
It was an impression of lack of explosive power until last year, but this year's increased security on the playing field made it possible to continue with good grades.
I'm afraid I'm going to be a lot more awkward than I've ever been for Seung Jo.
Except for these two players, the results were left in the last half of the fight: Ace Cantaphone, a young man in Thailand, and Cypony B in India.
And he's the three champions of Anders Antonsen, who are struggling to be left alone as the European Powers.
Cantaphones, although not a final match at the top, have been able to win the top four in this season.
There is still a rough side to it, but the 20-year-old, 18-day-21, who is able to do as well as the top players, seems to have a great deal of potential in the five-wheel race.
And Cypnice B. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Samir Barama, Pranoi H.S., and Slycans Kidambi, who are injured and delaying, need to be careful about India after the middle war.
The new cost of a cell phone is reduced by fair competition:
A new cost plan for a mobile phone company has been set up in connection with October's rerouting communications operations.
But it was a dead end.
The Chief Minister of Justice said he could drop by about 40 percent last summer, and despite the high expectations for lower prices, there was no price competition.
A major factor is the continued occupation of three major firms by sending out the real entry of the weather.
It is desirable for consumers to be an easy charge system for use through fair competition.
I want to make the effort of each cell phone company.
Modification laws prohibit terminals and communication discounts.
Because instead of selling the terminals cheaply, they had to set up a higher cost of communication.
The soft banks and the KDDI (au) have announced a plan that will cost up to half their terminals.
But both companies have a system with SIM locks that cannot be used by other companies for 100 days.
The NTT Dommo will make the cost of a terminal at a maximum rate of one third for only the clients on its line.
It seems that all three companies continue their "brows" to prevent transfers to other companies.
As for SIM locks, the Prime Minister has set out a policy that requires immediate decommission.
The corporate side needs to be dealt with quickly.
The delay of the weather is due to the failure of the base and other networks to carry out the plan.
It's the only thing that's expected to become a trigger for a low-level race is that it's dressed like a shoulder-to-head.
Wasn't it easy to look forward?
Neither the start nor the charge for the full service is clear.
As a company responsible for the social infrastructure, I want you to work on the business.
This time, the charge reformation was triggered by the comment of the Chief Inspector.
He complained about three new fees: "I think the competition is about to begin. I don't think it's a good thing. "
I just don't think "men's price" is going to upset the market and encourage healthy competition.
The corporate side should develop a competition as competitive as it is in the business world before it comes out from the government.
Each company's charge system is very complicated, and it is not easy to compare.
The Consumer Service called attention to some cases where the terminals were offering ads, such as "The Biggest Cost," but the consumer's burden was more than half the price.
To avoid misunderstandings on the part of users, companies themselves must consider polite and easy to understand explanations.
Iseshima Hotel.
For 26 days, the three trust vaults in the triple prefecture have decided to lower the amount of cash-card output to prevent damage to special fraud.
For the past three years, we have held a cash card for each credit box in northern Japan, with a maximum of 500,000 yen per day in cash cards for those over 70 years who have never been in a cash bank.
The trinitary and the North Iseshima trust deposit box will begin a decline on October 1st and the Citadel Trust Bank will begin November 1st.
In the province, there are many special fraud cases involving cash cards and security numbers being stolen by financial agencies and other law enforcement agencies, and the credit deposit vault officials are saying, "We want to protect the customer's valuable savings in the best possible way. "
I'm going to move to the back room of the Ryogitaku.
The Japanese Prime Minister's Association announced that on the 27th day, at the death of the Iwbetson Master, it approved the transfer of three wrestlers and one Crescent Man to the inland room.
The back room is at the same time as the Iwner room.
The master's master's master's master's father, Omikashima, comes from the Iwner Room and corresponds to the mother's brother.
The Iwner Master died suddenly on the 16th, and the cranes were held in the same mirror room, where further luck was discussed.
In the back room are twelve wrestlers from Mongolia, the same as the Tsurakure. At the fall point, there are 12 wrestlers.
A single dive and a wild fight for a U.S. athlete's "face-to-face-to-face Tuckling."
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this, because I'm going to tell you a little bit about it.
(WW) The Japanese games were last seen on 26 days, in 20 countries, and the United States lost at 7-45 in England.
It's a black start, but in the latter half of the time, FL-John Quill played a rough play called a wave wave.
"I'm afraid so," said Mr. Bunting.
The actual scene is also presented by foreign media with videos, and former British champions have complained that it's "indignous and mean play" and that it's not "tuckle."
"Indulgent and mean play" and a wave of foreign waves!
One shot out, two players in a tumult... the real moment that Quill played the face-thuck.
The hot fight has crossed the line.
It's 29 minutes later, at 0-38.
Deep in the enemy ranks, General Farrell of England lost balance and balance as he caught his friend's path.
It was Quill who went to Tuckl.
He just raised his upper body, not from the waist down, and hit himself hard on the upper body.
It's called the head-to-head approach.
Farrell was blown hard and fell.
The English player tried to push Quill against the obvious lack of justification.
The two players gathered together to form an explosive atmosphere.
As a result of the TMO, Quill took one shot out with a red card.
The bat left the pitch with a bad look, but the crowd asking for fair play asked some questions.
"The local media of New Zealand, the great rugby, "the local media" feature the headline "BigW 2019: the American player is out of the game with a mean play, England is the winner."
He reported that he broke out of the street with a mean Schwarzerge on the face of the English Starist Farrell.
In the article, we're introducing a comment by former British champions named Oogo Moña, a maintainer.
He complained: "It's an insult, it's not something to be called a bull, it's a dirty play."
The U.S. lost one game in 81 minutes when it managed to get out of the game by a determined test.
But Quill's play left behind a bad taste.
On September 26, the Ministry of Health and Human Services released the first 424 hospitals in 455 public hospitals and sun - red and other public hospitals in the country.
In Fukui County, the Ministry of Labor reviewed the treatment record of the 14 public hospitals and the four small beach hospitals in Oshima, Japan, the prefecture hospital.
It's not the standard.
An unusual response was that it was necessary to encourage reassemble and integration with hospitals in a rival area because of the age-intensity of medical costs.
In October, we ask the hospital for a full review of the reassemble and integration process, and we'll have the decision reached by September.
There is no compulsion, but fear of the loss of a nearby hospital predicts the insurrection of local chiefs and residents.
We made it public at the meeting that same day.
The total hospital averaged 29 to 11 percent, with a relatively small number of beds.
In the separate states of Tokyo, the percentages were high in order of the Shinga (53.7 percent), Hokkaido (48.6 percent), Miyagi (47.5%), Yamaguchi (46.7 percent), and Okayama (43.3%).
The target number was 54 in Hokkaido, and Okinawa was the only zero.
Based on the 2017-year-old data, the Department of Labor has studied a hospital that can cope with the "high-acceleration" stage for patients who are seriously ill, and the "accessary" stage for general surgery.
I analyzed nine clinical records, such as cancer and emergency medicine, and determined the need to make a name for the hospital by analyzing whether there was a rival hospital in "car less than 20 minutes."
A hospital will be considered to do away with or to transfer some medical practice to other hospitals.
Medical expenses will increase rapidly in 25 years when all mass - generation generations will be over 75.
For this reason, the Ministry of Labor has set the goal of reducing the number of beds in one hospital throughout the country by 1,246,000 (18 years).
Now, while there are many beds for the "high-acute" and the "emergency" periods that are expensive to keep nurses in high places, there is a shortage of rehabilitation programs that the elderly need.
In order to cope with aging, we need to increase the number of beds not only by reducing the number of beds but also by increasing the amount of rehabilitation.
In the reassemble and integration of hospitals, we plan a "division of regional medicine" that has determined the number of beds each state needs in 25 years.
The country is divided into 339 sections, and local and medical personnel are discussing it, but many local residents and chiefs remain cautious, and debates are difficult.
The Ministry wants to activate the discussion by publishing the name of a less successful hospital.
For the first time in 18 years, we've been involved in disaster prevention training.
On September 27, disaster prevention training was conducted in the woods, rice and deer town of Iwashima on the 27th of September.
There were about 400 personnel and residents of twenty different institutions, including roads and three towns.
It has been the first time since the Hokkaido Safety Council has planned a evacuation plan to set up a evacuation route for the residents in August.
For the first time in 18 years, the population has been involved in widespread training.
It was assumed that at 8:45 a.m., a fire broke out, and the mud stream reached the town at the foot of the mountain.
When the eruption level was raised to five, shelters were set up in the woods, in both the towns, and residents were moved by buses and police cars provided by each town.
We've got 100,000 students who are going to go to the Vancouver climate demonstrations to try to stop the warming in school.
On September 27 in the city of Vancouver, about 100,000 citizens, centered on students who had sympathized with 16 - year - old environmental activist Gregora Tungberg, marched to protest against climate change.
And I'm going to show you a couple of examples.
The march took place from Banker City's city hall across the Camby Bridge to the library downtown.
Before the city hall of the assembly place, people began to gather for hours before the start, and at the start time, 13 o'clock, people were enough to fill a few blocks of streets in front of the city hall.
After that, the attendance continued to increase and eventually more than 100,000 attended.
On the road along the way, the police helped by means of road regulations and watched over everyone for several hours.
In harmony with the summit of United Nations climate behavior held in New York, Vancouver has hosted numerous events that consider warming from last weekend.
The last 27 days are a school strike called "Fridays for the Future."
Students who were absent from school this day complained to the adults, "We want to keep the earth safe by staying away from the important things of school. " Many men who didn't work were also seen to respond: "We do our best for the future of children who are seriously learning."
It's called the Powcola Vaccine, and it's called the Powder-Powder.
On 27 days, the Department of Agriculture and Agriculture issued a amendment to the anti-infectious vaccine against the currently unrecognized pig population to prevent the spread of livestock disease "pig cholera."
The area has a policy of selecting nine prefectures, such as pigs and wild boars, and beloved prefectures.
Inoculations of live pigs, ovulations, and so forth are restricted to the area, but the flow of meat and processed goods is allowed.
Through public comments to the public, and so forth, sooner or later, we will plan to complete the procedure in October.
The use of vaccines and recognition of foreign circulation, such as raw meat, may not be a "clean country" approved by the international organization, but may affect pork exports.
Since last September, Japan has had a temporary status in a clean country.
In the amendment, the Ministry of Agriculture has an expert's opinion on the high risk of infection from wild animals to pigs.
The State of Tokyo, Japan, has created a "compulsion program" of inoculations, timing, head count, and progress, and has been identified by the Ministry and authorized to use it by the decision of the governor.
The other seven pre-inoculations are Osama, Tokuyama, Ishigawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mizushi, and Tsuno.
The region is determined by the context when the hand is corrected.
The transfers of inoculated pigs and sperm, fertilized eggs, dead bodies, and excreta are restricted to the area as a principle.
As for meat and processed goods, they do not subject themselves to the cost of distribution or the effect on farmers, but, in effect, recognize the flow out of the range.
In order not to spread the virus, we will deal with food garbage thoroughly.
We're going to talk about the safety of infected pigs and we're going to try to prevent damage.
The amendments to guidelines were gathered together at a conference of experts held that day and confirmed at a meeting at the Center for Prevention and Prevention.
From now on, we will continue to review and make public comments at Tokyo State University until October 7 and administer a new anti-intestinal needle.
I don't know what to do!
"Give me an offer. I don't need money."
9/ 28 (Sun) 2:57
During last season, the Australian A League of Leagues left Melborn Victory, and now the former Japanese representative, Mr. MF, acted in a remarkable way.
I'm not sure if I've ever been in a game.
The truth of your dreams will be revealed.
When he updated his Twitter Twitter at midnight in Japan, he went to a club and said, "Give me an offer. I don't need money, but I need to play with a great team or a great teammate."
The man who sent the reverse offer was Manchester United, the world's most famous.
Why did you make a grand request to one of the most powerful clubs in the Premier League?
The trigger is in an Australian article published on the 24th.
In an article entitled "Five FWs Possible in the Injury of the Injury, " Manchester United picked up five unsurpassed players who are now available.
Among the players, such as Hattem ben Alpha and Jupiter Rossi and Wilfred Bony, were the names of Honda.
Now, injuries such as MF Paul Pogba and the FDL Luke Show, FDF Eric Byley, FW Anthony Markar, and FW Marks Laxford are in dire danger.
The Red Devil, a leader at Orre Gunner Sursharal, has been forced to lose two, two, two, two, two, two, two, two, two, two, two, two, two, two, two, one, and one, two, three, three.
So it was the Shinda that the Great State Media named as a new candidate for constituency.
In the article, it was analyzed that "the contract of Shinda as a creative player on the side, not strictly a striker, can fill the hole that Andreas Perira is filling. "
The nine score for the 18th match in Melbourne Victory is "firm record, " but it is pointed out that"the 33-year-old Honda needs to draw full attention away from his entertainment as a representative of Cambodia. "
Does the approach of Honda really work?
We are also interested in whether United will move on account of the Veteran, which will be declared a target for next year's Tokyo Five.
500 portable translators have been set up.
A mobile translator who gives 500 free-for-profits to a store in Beach Matsu City.
For 26 days, the Beach Matsumoto Institute announced that 500 units had been set up in stores and other places on the beach. It was a venture to pay for a portable translator at a membership firm.
It's the first country in the world to have the translator concentrated on the same area, and it's important to see if it will improve its ability to respond.
The inside of the loan is 236 restaurants, 13 retail stores, 17 accommodations, and 34 other things.
The downtown section covers 60 percent of the city.
I also started to show a loan to the map app Google Map so that I could use my smart phone to find out where the shop for a foreign language was located.
It can be accessed from sites in the famous lake area and elsewhere.
The free donation of Poke Talks, corresponding to 74 languages, began in April, under the declaration "The Inbound City of Beach" by nine organizations in Japan.
The firm buys 500 cars, gets hospitality authentication, and rents them for two years to a small business that meets the requirements of cash receiving.
"I want you to connect me to new foreign customers while the business environment is tight."
Doesn't Ikemura need a first T-shirt?
Today's best shot.
A 1W shot doesn't always hit with a T-shirt.
When you want to earn your distance by making a second punch, such as a fifth hit, you can hit the ball on the ground, which is what is called a "right-dra" technique.
AW nowadays may have a large head volume, and it's a risk of losing the ball, but some athletes do this frequently on the tig round.
It's Ichimura, who will be waiting for his first victory on the tour.
In the seventh year, the 24-year-olds are smaller than 6 feet, but they are now 7th in the Dreying Resistance sector.
"I don't know," said Mr. Bunting.
"I thought I'd try a straight-dra for the spoon 3W."
Sometimes a ball is dropped on the grass of the tequila from the training round and the ball is thrown off the grass, and the one-w may well be thrown out.
In case Big Carrie is asked for, she uses a lot of tea up, but the two sides use a straight ladder, such as in a small hall.
It's not a hall with eyes down.
The ballistics measure is Carrie's record from 270 to 280yd.
That's why we don't need 3Ws.
From the Japanese tour championship in June, Wood is the only one in the caddy bag.
The second longest club is the 19th degree of Loft.
I'm glad to see the surprise of my tour companions as well, as well as the admiration they make from the gallery.
The trick is to move the club level to a level.
"Even if you hit down a blower with an upper hand, it doesn't fly straight. If it's in a cut orbit, it goes right.
The ball won't be caught, and the slice's at risk, but the left side will be erased.
I'll tell Kantão, but... it's a professional trick that I can't believe.
It's the first ice on the landline.
This is the first time observed in the Tsukoku pond on board.
On the 27th of this season, ice was observed for the first time.
Four days later than last year, one day faster than the average of the last ten years.
At about 6:25 a.m., a patrolman on the road confirmed that the ice was about two millimeters thick.
The weather at the observation was sunny and 3 degrees Celsius.
The lowest temperature in the province this day was 9 and a half degrees Fahrenheit from the city's Hikashi River town.
Let's go experience the Paramarital Games!
"Tomorrow, a Caravan event on an ion-name beach."
In 2020, the Tokyo Paralyn Picker's plane was set up in Tokyo, and the Tokyo Sea-Sun-Sun-Sun-Sun-Fied Fire Insurance "Creet 6" in the 28th of the 28th, on the mighty ocean beach.
As a paralyzing contest, there are six corners where you can experience Botcha, wheelchair Phenning, wheelchair basketball, goal ball, land, and wheelchair rugby.
From July to October, challenge 6 was held one place at a time in the province of Tohoku, and in Fukushima, a small beach was set up.
The paralyzing game is still under-known in comparison to the five-wheeler game, but through challenge six, the goal is to get many people to understand it by having some experience with a paratropicist.
The stadium was wrapped in a yellow costume, and the familiar person of the "Gets" and Mr. Dandizano visited, enjoyed the games together, and was excited.
On the 29th, the joker, Maggie, will be running.

The first to be published at the Tadashi Village Memorial
By the 27th of Tokyo's northern district, Tadashi Village Memorial has obtained a copy of his work, which was published in the very last year of his fight with Tanijiro Tanizaki (1892 - 927).
We'll be at the museum on October 1st.
Although it was known to be written in general, for the first time, it was said to be public.
It has been estimated that it was written several months before the suicide of Hanagawa.
The two 200 - letter paper calculators were published in the April 27 issue of The Spring of Science.
"Why do adults laugh at children and threaten them?"
In his speech on September 23th at the summit of the United Nations Climate Action in New York,
While the speech is being noted, it is coming out in a way that insults Greta.
"Why do adults laugh at children and threaten them?"
A political critic on American television said that she was "psychic. She's being used by her parents and her international left wing."
In Japan, too, there are a lot of messages on the Internet that comment on non-verbal comments such as, "I'm sorry I'm being used" to talk about Greta.
Then, on September 26, Greta posted to her Twitter, "Why do adults use their time to mock teenagers and children?"
"to come up with every kind of lies and conspiracy you can think of."
"Look, I'm starting again. As you can see, people who hate me are as active as I look, my clothes, my attitude, and I'm going to chase around different places. They're going to come up with every possible lies and conspiracy."
He pointed out that adults seem to be arguing about the subject because they don't want to face the climate and environmental crisis.
To be honest, I don't understand why adults use their time to ridicule teenagers and threaten their children.
I wish I could do another good thing at that time.
I think they feel threatened by us.
But don't waste your time on giving them any more attention.
The world is beginning to wake up.
The change is coming.
It's not about changing the world. It's about changing the world.
I'll see you on the street on Friday!
Last Friday, on the 20th, there were strikes on climate change in New York and elsewhere around the world.
Greta called on me to do it on Friday 27th.

Akita TV!
The 432nd show of Akita TV was held on August 16th in a hearing of "The Editor and Master of Cooks!

What's the best way to prevent dementia and keep it "forgotten"?
Forecasts/e-sun
Major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals are trying to develop drugs that are failing to develop and that are failing.
However, it is said that the relationship between dementia and life - style is being resolved, and it is becoming apparent that it is possible to remain extremely mild and almost forgotten.
I've spoken to Professor Osama from the University Hospital of Japan.
It's not going away. It's not going away.
- It's been hoped for to prevent or cure dementia, but what about the situation?
The difference between bipolar and serious is that everyone in their age may develop dementia.
But it is believed that it will still take more than 20 years to develop new cognitive drugs.
The drug Denepezil, commonly used in Japan, is already out of insurance in some countries abroad and can't be expected to have a marked cure.
On the other hand, with fewer deaths due to infections and accidents, and a reduction in cancer deaths due to significant advances in anti-malarial treatment, people have been able to live longer.

A way to keep your mind off things.
- Are there people who are more prone to dementia, more difficult to become?
Even if it is inevitable to develop a major dementia, there is a possibility that you will be able to keep your symptoms as low as possible and to keep them as "forgotten."

People who live in an environment where neither gas nor electricity can be used, nor can be cooked in the future.
This leads to a diet of less vegetables and protein, leading to a diet of fat and sugar.

There can be a similar situation in Japan.
Other people who don't think about things and who don't work tend to have dementia.
In other words, to prevent Alzheimer's disease, you need to think about things from day to day, not being metabolized.
