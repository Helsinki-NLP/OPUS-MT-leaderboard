However, the supply of stickers under the government, which is said to be over 20,000 in the restaurant alone, remains at 11,000 stores.
So Governor Yoshimura plans to do it at the end of January, but when he makes a reservation, he will send out a declaration sticker to make sure that he knows in the reservation. "

I'll meet you on a new mission. I'll meet you there.
In a bicycle class that was opened as a mission start, an experiment was conducted with a car and bicycle.
In recent years, the Chief Police Department of Tsukaoka has launched an Operations Zero on the "By-By-By-By-By-By-By-By-Tier" in an effort to eliminate the high rate of bicycle and motorcycle accidents in the tubes.
In addition to helping to prevent accidents with traffic safety groups in the tubes, we're going to go on a campaign against and strengthen the traffic rules of our bicycles.
Three traffic deaths occurred in the station this year, killing people driving motorcycles and bikes.
Although the number of accidents is on the decline, the rate of bicycle - related accidents is about 11.7 percent today on June 30, and motorcycles are about 5.8 percent related to the same thing, each being higher than the county average.
In particular, bicycle accidents have been more common in the last five years than in the prefectures average, and have planned an operation to resolve this situation.
Operations combined "bike" with "goldygle" meaning "the end of the accident."
Associations will be called on more than ever in traffic safety classes, such as driving lessons for the elderly and using night-light reflections.
At the station, yellow cards are passed on to police and others to alert them.
The program began on the 21st day at the Ambulance School's School of Vehicles in Tokyo City.
About 30 people were present, and Chief Sato said, "I'd like to help you reduce the number of tragic accidents."
The official at the station showed the policy and the activities of each group.
We'll continue to host a bicycle class as the start of the operation.
We demonstrated how the impact on the bicycle is different from the impact on the car when the driver hit the bicycle at the brake and then hit it at about 55 kilometers per hour without stepping on it.
The president of the Council on Traffic Safety and Safety in the Yuoka District said: "I've come to realize again the horror of the traffic accident. The elderly, as well as the young, want to be aware of it."

A special support school student for Okayama.
High School of Special Support (Iseshima High School) students in the area are making a pre-burn for a monster who is supposed to suppress the plague in order to present it to older people in the area.
Because of the effects of the new Corona virus, they planned early recovery and health for infectious diseases while their sales practices and community interactions in their annual stores were difficult.
Eleven high school students work as part of the class from June to the third of the week.
After the clay has been molded with all its strength, it can be wrapped around the skin to produce a red - colored broth of pre-burned wood.
It is said that it will be completed in about two or three weeks, including the dry and cooking process.
The third grader ("8") said that he was working hard to make sure that the new corona will not give up on him and give the old people a good time.
The burn is to be delivered 40 to those who enter the home of a nursing mother, Okayama, with whom there is exchange.

The Sea Lake Hall, a tourist center in New York City, is going on with the experience of catching fish and eels on the beach.
On the 24th of the day during the rest of the day, it was clear time, and it was popular with parents and children.
A typical event sponsored by the New Town Tourism Society every year.
The blue eels, as well as the chrysalis and hennnuts from the beach lake, are released into the pond.
After catching them in the pond, they can be cooked and tasted.
You can enjoy the experience of making eels.
On the 24th, I saw my family with me outside the province.

Butler once again praised Tyler Hero, the young warrior responsible for the future of the heat, "The idea isn't that of Rookie."
The first match is with the Kings.
In this game, which won 104-98, Duncan Robinson won 18 points on the team high and Tyler Hero followed 15 points and backcoats.
Robinson, the league's best-natured shooter, of course, has 13-to-one routines, hero steps, which are important to the heat.
The hero missed the 15 games between February and March due to his ankle injuries, and the last season went into a long break during the game on March 12th.
The hero said that he had plenty of time and was able to get back 100 percent of the conditions. He felt the best he could ever feel, but his performance in the Smegage was more convincing than words.
The first point guard, Kendrick Nann's reunion, was delayed, so the hero's play time increased, thus saving the chance.
It's worth a lot because it's 15 points on a job that's different than usual.
Team leader Jimmy Butler once again praised his " favorite ' hero.
"He can do it, he can do it, he can do it, he can do it, he can do it, he can do it, he can do it, he can do it, he can do it, he can do it for the team.
Since the beginning of this season, Butler has liked the strength of his hero's routine and the quickness of his approach to basketball.
That's why I asked you to train with me at 4:00 a.m.
Butler once said, "He says his opinion to anyone and doesn't withdraw; he respects such fighting."
The Butler is the type who always talks, and when he thinks it's good for the team, he's willing to give in.
It has made my relationship with my teammate worse in the past.
Butler is probably giving his hero a young life.
For teammates, the personality of Butler can be a good guide for anyone who has enough guts to follow it.
If two teachers and siblings who respect each other spread across the entire team, heat should be an even better team.
That's why I'm here.
Matsumoto-sama, Tsukita-dono-dono-dono-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-
It's a four-time game.
The Toshima Trader took advantage of the opportunity to complete the project and won the first prize with the Beach Matsushita North Worker.
That's the first time that Ikita's sales have been killed by a two-point hit on Matsuura.
I added two more points in the interior and in the schematics.
The first time Saito threw, he won a losing prize by hitting at least six times at a low cost.
The Hawa Matsumoto-Maka's Ha Ni didn't make the last two-to-one opportunity.
▪ Four fights led by three years.
For two years, Matsuura, the first round of thanks.
The opponent's comet was the fourth in the second year of this summer's first year.
Matsuura, an island solder, took her to her left at her first death row.
"If I lost three years, I'd retire immediately, and I wanted to win."
Last fall, I was thrilled to have served number four.
One or three fights were fought in three years, and two powerful years were in short supply.
At the meeting, Director Ikeda gathered the players and told Nine that they were going to be best members for three years.
Four out of the nine Stamen this day established their core in two years.
It's hard to see, but it's evidence of a serious fight.
Matsuura is reassuring that from now on, he will also have a higher level of opponent. He will come here to send the runner home.
Saito, who had been in line for three years, didn't even take two rounds with a single beat.
The number 10 will be stimulated for three years by 12 years. It will be mutually mutually beneficial to say that if you win, you will win.
The rest of the team who will go to the 4th round of the Shizuoka Games last year in three consecutive years will not remember the rest of the games.
There are 16 musicians in the Fukushima area in the world singing with the local people.
I'd like to send a lively voice from the beach, in and out to the world.
Sixteen musicians from the Fukushima area grouped together to make a message song.
Following up on the recovery from the Tohoku earthquake and the Tokyo power disaster, the Fukushimas fight the new Corona virus.
The local people sing, and we will complete the complete edition by next summer, the 10th anniversary of the earthquake.
The song was released on YouTube on the twenty-fourth.
The song's name is "Pray from Fukusima."
The positive attitude of the people will be put on a cheerful melody of "I want to tell you from Fukushima."
The live house, which is a base for musical activity by the new corona, has been forced into the rest of the business, and many musicians have lost their place to sing and play.
It was when I couldn't see the beginning that I planned to believe in the power of music by Sing Singernappo, who lives in the city of Nanval.
Napoléon is a composer and composer, and Mr Dazor is in charge of the rap.
As the project began in March of the Corona disaster, the singing writer from Fukushima City, Mr. MANAMI (28), and Mr. Kunichi (38), agreed, and the circle spread quickly.
Mr Napoléon told me with all his heart, "I'd like to enjoy this opportunity for as much as I can think of."
There was no opportunity for 16 people to assemble as a protection against infection, and each one was recorded at live houses and at home.
In an effort to encourage the project, Akira, a painter in the city, drew down an image character.
It traces the Fukushima prefecture and describes the natural, blue and green winds.
The finished song will be sent to the world by YouTube, and will be used for CDizing.
Next year, it will be ten years since the earthquake and will be hosting the postponed Tokyo Five-Walin Pick.
Mr. Dazo said that "we've been through a lot of difficulties, and we'll be happy to be able to make many people happy by publishing a song in a paragraph."
The other participating musicians follow the following.
The rocket is launched on 26 days.
The space venture of Hokkaido Daiichi's space venture, the Interteletechnologists, announced that on the 25th, the project of their own development "MoMO" 7 would be delayed for 26 days because of a strong wind.
The plane is about 10 meters long, about 50 centimeters in diameter, and about a ton in weight.
The original launch was scheduled for 18 days, but it was postponed because of bad weather.
On the 19th, there was trouble not setting off the engine and watching off the launch.
The company, the first private corporation in the country to reach space last May, aims at a second success in order to make it commercialized.
New Corona Sendai City, confirm the infection between the new two.
In Sendai City, new men in their 50s and 60s were found infected with the new type of corona virus.
The infection was confirmed by male employees in their 50s and 60s in Sendai.
According to Sendai City, men in their 60s were working for the same company on the 23rd of this month as female employees in their 20s confirmed infection.
Starting on the 12th of this month, I had a 25-day infection that was diagnosed with headaches, diarrhea, and other symptoms.
And men in their 50s complained of headaches and other symptoms on the 19th of this month.
It's said that men had visited Hokkaido in the middle of this month, but they don't know the way to the infection.
There were 42 people infected in the province on a daily basis.
We'll be able to detect a crisis immediately from Internet information, and then we'll be able to determine the dema.
"I want to know quickly where and where the disasters and accidents occurred."
This is a strong need not only for news media, such as television and newspapers, but also for many companies, such as social infrastructure and localities.
The response service is "specti," developed by Sedentee, who uses AI information analysis.
So, we're going to use this as an example of how to test social media information.
Now, the first means by which people know about disasters and accidents are moving from television to social media.
Social media, such as Twitter, have become important media that transmits information right after disaster or accident.
It's hard for people to work at keeping an eye on the flow of information and to extract useful information from it.
Spenti has the ability to deliver information from social media, such as Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, by detecting natural disasters and accidents and then analyzing them and then identifying the truth of the information and then sending it to the companies that use it.
"A wide range of negative impacts such as stopping and stopping social activity"
NHK, during the bear book earthquake in April 2016, was the first major use of Splashi, after which the adoption movement spread rapidly among the corporations.
More than 350 national companies, including television and newspapers, are currently using them, as well as companies that support social infrastructure, such as power, gas, transportation, and localities throughout the country.
▪ Parsing post to determine the type and location of the crisis
Spenti delivers information through four steps: "recognition of information, "" analysis and category, "" title, " and "false test."
Using companies have a prearranged list of areas to collect information, such as Tokyo State and Town Village, and crisis categories, such as disasters and accidents.
Spenty collects the appropriate posts using the APl provided by social media.
Then analyzes and classifys the text, images, and videos in the post collected.
For example, if you see a fire truck, if you see a black smoke coming out of a building and an orange flame coming out of a room, you're classed as a fire.
In other words, if you have an image of a rotated car, it's a traffic accident; if you have an image of a floating road, it's like a road cap.
Pitty also estimates where disasters and accidents will occur.
"I often don't know where I am from my post, so I'm guessing with a combination of various information," says the village CEO.
For example, if a road sign or a sign is shown in an image or video, it will extract local names from it and match them with a local name database to determine where they are.
Angelis, the opening battle is going to break up...

The area of Nagano is threatened with heavy rain at the center of the south in 26 days, and the middle and south must be careful about the dust disaster.
In Tsukimura, the circuit of the pre-traditional route is flowing and the residents are once again isolated.
The swollen river is swallowed up by a temporary bridge of earth and is being washed away.
After three o'clock in the morning, the security cameras set up in Saokimura's construction office.
This is a prefecture that was blocked by mud and mud. From 17 days to 17 days, the circuit built on the river mat has been made to pass by the residents' cars alone.
This has left 56 families in the Oshima area isolated again, and the Ikeda construction office wants to work on the restoration as soon as the water pulls back.
The warm, humid air poured into the front of the rainy season, and the province is expected to have more than 30 millimeters of rain an hour over 26 days.

Can't you see it's a bunch of cheats and cocks?
"I really thought you weren't saying that."
They're Chiba people near Tokyo City.
I have been living in the prefecture for less than 30 years.
In a conversation with a friend at the university, it was said that "surpassing" means "sharing."
The flow and the sense of language made sense, but you were told not to use it.
- "Is it true that cheating and cheating? "
I'm going to connect them to the other side of the equation.
And one more thing.
I didn't realize this was pointed out, but the expression "home," meaning "my house," was never used in reading, nor heard from my friends.
- Oh, my family... was that so?
I use it locally, but I didn't realize why it was so natural when I grew up...
The Japanese Cold Chinese don't like it...?
It's called "Cleazy Noodle Food" because it's not popular.
In China, the Chinese call it "Sun's Cool Noodle."
As mentioned at the outset, the cold Chinese Chinese are Chinese dishes from the Japanese birth based on China's soft side.
Thus, although it doesn't originally exist in China, the diversity of food has made it possible for us to see it in Japanese restaurants in the summer.
And recently, in a Japanese convenience store, there has been a variety of products that have been described as the "Change of the Sun " and the" Yuuki of the Sun. "
On the other hand, Japanese food, such as Shikoku and Lake South, is pushed by popular punch-in-the-art Chinese food, which is not as popular in China as it is in Chinese.
Of course, the Chinese are often familiar with the Chinese flavor of Chinese dishes.
That's why it's not a bad idea, but when it's not a good idea, it tends to be badly praised.
The Cold Chinese Chinese are not the exception; they are still minors in China.
In China, for example, the name of the Chinese cool Chinese name "day cool noodles. "
To the Chinese, it is recognized as one of the Japanese dishes.
Summer's duel is "Lingpie."
In China, noodle food that feels summer is called "Lingpie."
In Japan, I think many people are not familiar with the skin, but it is made of flour, rice, corn and so on.
It's said to be 2,000 years old.
It's a B-class grumme that's sold on the counter, and the price is about 10 to 20 pounds, and it's very rich.
It has the letter "calamity," but it doesn't have to be iced like the Japanese cold Chinese.
Rather, normal temperature is fundamental.
On top of the noodles, chopped cucumbers, carrots, pepper palm, and other ingredients of choice are topped with a flavor of pepper, pepper, pepper, garlic, and so forth.
Finally, it was made with a special seasoning price, mixed with soy sauce, latice, vinegar, paste, and so on.
It is easy to swallow, but often it is mixed with refreshing, thickly tarted tats, which are so bitter that when summer is hot and they don't have a appetite, they slip into it quickly.
Also, because it is absorbed throughout China, there is a variety of toppings and flavors, and a wide variety of variations is characteristic and one of the ways to enjoy yourself.
The expert will explain!
It's called "The Cold Water shower" -- the benefits that it brings to the body and heart.
I'm going to try to help you.
Research into the effectiveness of hydrotherapy, published in The North American Journal of Medical Sciences, indicates that the effect of physical and mental healing can be expected.
It is said that cold water after exercise can reduce muscle pain and other inflammation.
According to Professor Douglas Kassa, director of "Korey Stinger Institutate," who studies sports medicine and teaches at Connecticut University, "exercise exercise and take a cold shower with as little time as possible.
I'm gonna ease your fatigue.
It is said that when the temperature is high and you exercise, your heart, muscles, and skin need more blood flow than normal.
"When you exercise, your heart rate increases, so your blood flow to your heart increases, and it requires more energy to contract muscles, so that your blood flow increases, and for skin, there is much blood flow to regulate body temperature."
"The cold water shower lowers the temperature of the skin, thus reducing the flow of blood sent to the skin. Instead, it sends blood to the intestines, such as the gastrointestinal tract, making water and nutrients easier to take in after exercise."
Holmings effect expected
Mr. Dorsesky explains that by taking cold water, you can expect the "holming effect" to work.
Holmings is the idea that a little bit of matter or stress is better than nothing that is harmful to the body.
Low oxygen movement, pneumatics, and cold water showers are typical of those that can expect a meththelin effect for health. By cold water showers, hormones and nerves can be stimulated to increase physical and physical strength and resilience.

I'm going to take a sports veteran's license to the end of the day.
Shizuoka prefectureded two bicycle teams in the eastern part of the province to "Saporter at the far end" to help in the sports activities in the province on the 24th.
Team Brixton Bicycling at Mishima City.
A team of Brystston Cycling's Tadashi champions, who received a plate from Governor Kuyama on Koyama's Speedway, said: "We'd like to have a team of people on our bikes with us."
The chief of regional strategy and officer of the area received a plate.
Miyagi Oyama, 2x07 in battle!
Director Yano's looking at me like this.
In the middle of the league, two-five gods fight seven times, four, three, two-four, Nagoya D, there's no stopping.
The high ball landed on the middle of the left wing.
The Great Mountain sends out two consecutive arches around the diamond.
Back on the bench, I looked at my white tooth.
"I've been able to narrow down the target ball while I've got a good swing. I've been able to swing with all my might."
Four zero twos, entered the race in the first place.
So let's see what happens.
I didn't miss Onoo's sweet, 34-mile slider.
The ball caught at the core is perfect enough to be sure of standing in the moment.
The two consecutive games followed the 23rd of the previous day's Hiroshima fight were cursed for fighting back.
It was worth it.
On the other hand, when you fight Onoo on the 17th, hit the 9th, 4th, and so on.
But with the Nagoya dome alone, he was in the 7th of August 23rd, 2013, and he was in the 7th round of the 12th round.
He took 23 inning points from such a formidable opponent at the Nagoya dome (and even the half-sized board was counted for "inning") with a spectacular shot and didn't pass through the game.
"It's a high level to be able to catch a sweet ball properly. It's windy and the timing of a foul. I think he's still going to hit you."
One hit is right in front of the other, so we mark the six-and-three-time low-frequency round.
The opening session has been a beginning, but the 7th and 6th races have already played a good role as team tops and fourths.
We're going to keep the results for the victory.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Iwao, join the medals, seven men, four months old.
The seven Japanese champions, a Japanese coach, decided on the 25th, and on Tokyo's five wheels, which were postponed next year.
The Fukuoka Fukuoka tree, represented by the 15-year World Cup, represented by the 5th World Cup, has left the team.
The commander urged: "Of course, it's great, but we can fight together and move on."
From this day forward, the team will start a national candidate camp in Tokyo.
Although accommodations have been held since March for 28 days, it is said that no contact practice will be performed to prevent the new corona virus.
The representative stated that since the next season, the top group could be back at the 7-man World Cup of WS (WS), but because the world's own WS is inconclusive, he is negotiating with countries that allow him to enter.
The first 40-year-old female in Nagano County to run PCR tests on all contact.
It was found that a woman in her 40s in Nagano County was infected with the new type of corona virus.
It's the first infection in the province that a staff member at the Ipang Cross Hospital has.
The infection was confirmed by a woman who was in her 40 '40s in Tsukoku.
There are 87 people infected in the province, and the first medical worker.
According to the province, women have 13 days of cough and cough and have been receiving three medical institutions since 17 days.
I was in the hospital on the 23rd, and on the 24th, I found out I was positive.
It's a mild condition, and the four family members of the "contained contact" have no symptoms.
It is said that women work until the 16th, and that they have not been able to visit out of the province for the last two weeks before the onset of the disease.
We're working on the way to the infection.
The Red Cross hospital, where women work, announced that there were infected staff 24 days and nights.
There are no "contained contacts" in the hospital, but it means running PCR tests on all contacts, closing the wards and other patients involved with women, and then thoroughly cleaning them.
An official at the Macao Casino has been able to observe the conduct of quarantine measures in casino facilities... and is required to present a new corona virus negative certificate at the time of entry.
About 40 casinos in Macao have been closed for 15 days, followed by a new corrugated infection (COVID -19), and since February the 5th to 19th, they have resumed their business on strict prevention measures since the 20th of the month.
The Macao Casual Control Authority (DICJ) requires that employees and guests be kept as safe as possible by resuscitation. Gaming (the casino) allows them to maintain their distance between tables and allow their neighbors to sit next to each other in a table game (e. g. in the Bakara table, for example, three or four persons can sit at the same time), and slot machines have one or two operating or two of them, and the risk of cross-infecting is shown.
There's also an increase in contamination against chip and other gamer products.
Also, guests are required to wear masks when entering, to be warm, and to have a valid health code (the last stay, no previous contact with patients, no symptoms such as fever or cough, or to enter and produce contacts).
Since midnight on July 15th, the proposals for the new Corona virus nucleotic acid certificate (only within a valid period of time issued by Macau or Kanto's licenses) have also been made.
A new negative certificate must be presented at 6 a.m. in 15 days to ease water control between Macau and Canton.
DICJ, in a change of entry conditions from July 18th to June 15th, announced that the Director of the Bureau, who has observed the enforcement of the quarantine in casino facilities, has called in a meeting of security representatives of the casino management of six companies, and has requested that employees and guests be well protected by thoroughly managing their guests ' health.
The DICJ continued its strict patrol of casino facilities, regularly meeting with management companies and meetings, with conditions and assessments, and the policy was to adjust quarantine measures in casinos along government health guidelines.
It is reported that the chief of the M.E.'s Center for Disease Control, accompanied by the chief of the department's Center for Disease Control and Prevention, has been instructed on how to clean up the game chip and take a safe distance between seats in electronic casinos.
Also, due to a sharp decline in the number of U.S.-invented passengers, including border limits, the cost of casino sales has dropped from one to six months this year to 337.4 percent since the previous year.
Ale of light from the hot springs next month, for the festival of the Zhou, a message to health workers.
Under the influence of the new Corona virus, a hot spring of water, which was canceled each year by the annual "Sun of Water Fiesta," will begin to be the beginning of an effort to write a message to the health workers from August 1st.
All the country's fans and local residents put some 350 sheets of paper on top of them, wrapped the city of water in ale's light, and delivered healing to visitors.
The Luxury Festival is a re-reviewing of an animation in the "Spirit of Water" model of a hot spring. It is sponsored by the Water - Water - Water - Water - Water - Water - Source Tourism Society.
It began in 2011 when cartoons were broadcast, and thousands of cartoon fans came from all over the country every year.
For example, from July's lighting ceremony to October of the book festival, every day, they are lit up on the stairs that follow the whole water - water - water - rice temple.
This year, the new Corona was forced to call off the festival, but local and national fans kept saying, "I miss it when it's the summer of hot water." The Society proposed this project.
They wanted to help heal and recover the troubled world of the Corona disaster.
There have been over a hundred applications from all over the country, besides having been given an illustrated message to about 50 children on the grasslands, local water baths.
If you buy your message paper from the Society's home page, fill it out, send it to the Society in a return trust envelope, and receive pictures of it with light attached to it.
At 6,000 yen per set, we will accept the application until we reach the total number of 350.
A dim light will be set up until the end of November.
Shinichi Koichi Yamaro, the first head of the festival, said: "We are encouraged by reading the message. We want to celebrate the tenth festival next year."
For the campaign, we also prepared an illustration of the flowered characters as well as the drawing and drawing of the Great Bridge of the Asano River.
From a day on, I present an illustrated clear file to a special guest at a beach in a hot spring.
The Western-sized core 4'Object of Moriyama 'is the link between soul and soul
The west-southed "Object of Moriyama" has shown the spirit's cooperation and has made its second victory this season.
On the 24th, the Rottette War was two, two, nine times, and four others who were still in a state of doubt still holding fast to victory.
The lead source is headed from safety van to base by head-sling.
Then, in the last six games, 18 minutes and 2 minutes, the forest at the bottom of the ocean, will send in a van, and it will be second base to die.
The fourth and Yamagawa were turned down, and from this day on, foreign beyond the forest and back to Five, crushed the right sphere of Koda and led to a 3-2 victory.
The hero's foreign hero, Owada, said to himself, "I've got to do something about it. I've got to do something with it. I've got a feeling that he's got a banut and he's got to trust me behind him.
In the third year, the four of them in the third grade, they're in the middle of what they call "the heart of the house."
All of them have experience with generals in amateur times and have a sense of responsibility twice as great as that of men.
In his 4th year, he took over the captain from Fujisaki, who is "the captain who pulls the team with words because Mr. Yamagawa is a good talker anyway. On the other hand, I've been the type who speaks best and talks best, and I've been the type who talks in the background." Each of them takes on his own personality to support the forest of the new general, the new president.
The director said, "It's the safety of the Haida. It's not the sign." But I thought it was "I can go" and he was a great bant too.
All four of them are suffering at a rate of twenty-four to five minutes, but even if they can't hit, they're wisely supporting their team.
U.S. Inter-working Groups respond to the threat of the Communist Party:
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced that on the 24th, they had launched a cross-terrorist group as threats from the Chinese Communist Party were increasing within the United States.
We're going to put China's response together by various departments in the Ministry, and we're going to put it in priority.
They're going to reinforce their efforts to protect the United States from organized activities that undermine U.S. economic prosperity, national security and fundamental freedoms.
The Secretary of Homeland Security, Wolf, stressed in a statement that "injurious activity in China's trade, cyber security, immigrants, and intellectual property has reached alarming levels. "
The Ministry of Homeland Security has thus far launched a campaign against China's manufacturers who have taken advantage of the new Colorado pandemic.
[roaring boat SG Ocean]

On the fifth day of the 25th day, the SG's 25th Ocean Cup of the boat racing gate was won by the third major champion of the battle.
The first round, 9R.
I decided to ride first.
The two major battles were between Goonta (Saga 35), Koyako (Nagono-Sai) and Kosaka (Naoka-33). The mountain rises up two degrees above two meters (two degrees).
We decided to press for the championship in second place.
The following "R" is the form of the Hideki of the outer frame taken from him and pushed outside of Ishinono-dono.

The tail was first in the third SG challenge.
As a result, throughout the 26th and 26th days, the champions of the 12R championships "were to be fought by six players in the history of the 4th and 6th centuries.
Shut down China, the U.S. Consulate in the state capital without approval of the Secretary of the United States.
Chinese media reported that on the 25th, the gates of the United States Consulate in Shikoku, capital of Shikoku, where the Chinese government wanted to shut down.
It is also reported that a supposed employee will carry his luggage and leave the building.
It's a prospect that will be shut down by the 27th morning.
The U.S. government has confirmed the closing of China's General Consulate in Houston, southern Texas, and the conflict in the United States has increased.
In a twenty-five-day editorial by the National Communication International, China's subcommittee showed that the Secretary of the United States, who criticized the Communist party's regime, was prepared to reject the speech of the Secretary of the United States, who spoke out against the Communist party's regime as "an ideology and a new Cold War against China and the United States. "
I'm going to go back to my old life, and I'm going to go back to my old life, and I'm going to go back to my old life, and I'm going to go back to my old life.
The copper statue of Jiro Omura (1825 to 69), which can be counted among the new tenants, was seen on the 23rd day at Yamaguchi City, where he was born.
There was an opening in the front yard at the cast-off community exchange center, where local and administrative workers celebrated the completion.
Jiro is a Western scholar, doctor at the end of his new year.
After standing on the platform in the study and education organization of the Order, he opened his private home in Edo and taught the sciences, the arts, and medicine.
When I returned to Nagago, I continued to teach military studies at the Yamanashika Inn.
The statue focused on Jiro's benefits as an educator.
He held a book by the earth's surface and took it into his hands to teach a study of orchids.
It is said that the height of the statue, with its platforms in place, was about three meters high, and that it was made by the eyes of a disciple who was taught by Jiro's teaching.
The design was taken care of by Jiro's wife, Mihoko's descendants, and the local designer, Takashi Koda (27).
After Ichiro Omura's death, whose mother is the Great Britain Bank, the Operations Committee of the Operations of the Operations of the Work in 150, proposed a donation.
About 12.8 million yen's worth of goods was collected from104 people throughout the country.
The cost of business, including the installation of a fine board, is about 12 million yen.
The extra money is used to maintain the bronze statue.
Jiroro, who maintained his ambition and made a great contribution as an educator, spoke of it as "the pride of old age. The copper statue which children in the future will wish for. "
I'm going to take you through the night, and I'm going to leave you in an embape with an Embape with a bad tackle on it.
On the 24th of the local time, the Paris San Germaint, at the Cape de France final, took down Saint-Tierenne at 1-0, decorated his 13th championship in two years.
The PSG has achieved two crowns in the country.
The initial goal of Neemar, which sends Saint-Tierne at the end of Neimar's finals, is the final finish line, and the second crown of the country, followed by League Ann, is in a situation of concern to the August champions league.
Kirian Embape, who started the same fight in the same year, suffered a wounded turnover after receiving a vicious rhythm by his CB Roya Peran.
In the first half of an hour, a young French star was knocked down in such a way that his right ankle was stuck in.
The players of this game got into a fight with each team.
"It's too late," she said.
A red card was offered to Pelan.
After the game, Embape, holding her right leg, left the stadium with crutches on.
PSG fights the Coop Dora League final with Lyon at 4:10 a.m. on August 1st, Japan, but it is certain that it will not be possible to use Embape in this game.
We need to wait for a medical report published by the club, but we may miss the champions league in Portugal.
"The Corona Plague" is the launch of an online museum, "Haczard" Akino.
Everyone has an art museum free of charge when they like it.
It comes in a wide variety of ways from famous artists like Claude Monet and Gustav Klimt to unknown artists in the country.
Since the Open House in April of 2019, the Online Museum "HASARD" has seized its users' minds from its convenience and newness, and the new way of life of the Corona plague has increased its attention.
A representative from Yanonobu City (26) who set up his site: "Everyone wanted to create a service that would be easy for everyone to enjoy art." Under trying circumstances, he said, "I want art to be touched."
When you visit Azer, you are surprised by the abundance of exhibits and the beauty of the images.
Today, on the 24th, we have a regular exhibition and project exhibition with 14 exhibitions that attract people not only from color but also from extremely high resolutions, which range from the quality of the brush to the quality of the brush.
It is characteristic that membership registration and admission fees are unnecessary, not only to the eye but also to the artist who wants to open an exhibition without cost.
If you're online, the way you show it will also attract attention.
One of them moves the picture.
Claude Monet's permanent exhibition, "It's starting to move again," is using digital manufacturing to make clouds, flowers, and meadows move.
"I want people who are less interested in art to be able to enter."
The meeting of art with the representative of the Blue Field was in elementary school.
At that time, when my family and I visited the newly completed Aixie County Museum, we were shocked to see the three huge paintings of Mark Chagro's "Aleko."
From the next day, art classes turned into fun times, and after coming to college, they moved on to gallerys and so forth.
At the same time, I felt that the big project exhibitions, where museums were not near, were only about to be held in the capital, and that many people didn't have much opportunity to get in touch with art from different standpoints, such as the fact that it was difficult to go out as a child.
So I spent about two months working at an IT company and set up a site where I could admire art on the Internet.
The number of users reached an average of 10,000 per month in the first ten months, and after the new cholera epidemic, it increased to about 30,000.
If anyone could see art in a free way when they wanted to.
Azer's aim was to be accepted by more and more people by the cholera plague.
The representative of the Bluewoods emphasizes the importance of the art prize to enhance his imagination.
"As your imagination grows, you can reach out to people in need.
I hope that art will become a better society by getting close to it.
A simple reason for the end of the Chinese quality era and the era of Japanese quality.
Pandemics, changing values.
There are many predictions and debates about the world of afterpandemic.
On business level, the July 8th article is beginning to lose its "administration" job in Japan... and in the world of the July 4th article, "After Corona," it could be a change described as "the production of Japan" coming back to life! "
The identity of Japan's strength, unknown only to the Japanese... unexpected reality in Asia.
And mentally, it seems that the currents of "The Complete Burn of Burns" for those who become conscious of life's end in Corona, "The Article of June 10" and "Let's Look Again at the Benefits of " God in Times of Distress."
And what seems to be apparent to our eyes as the combination of those two "economic business " and" spirit " is the great flow of Chinese quality to Japanese quality.
For example, if there's a bad fault with a T-shirt or a bad turtle, it makes me angry, but there's nothing wrong with the person who buys it.
On the other hand, the poor quality of a Chinese mask or respirator recently mentioned... "Chinese quality" in such a life and safe product is lethal.
No matter how cheap it is, you can't buy such a product.
Even at a considerable price, they will want a Japanese quality product.
Of course, this stream is not happening in Japan alone.
It is evident from the fact that the countries of the United States, which were in trouble because of lack of masks and medical equipment, still continued to do "responsive" to the terrible nature of "Chinese quality."
Safer than cheap.
Also, goods such as automobiles are products whose defects can be fatal.
No matter how many countries, starting with Korea in a cheap trade strategy for cheap goods, will eventually be unable to compete with Japanese products.
And this Pandemic reminded us that many other goods need security.
Also, security is important not only for Japanese quality in manufacturing but also for Japanese quality in services such as streams.
Like a toilet paper riot, the medium distribution may slow down so that it doesn't reach you.
And like "Who's the real culprit in the lack of masks?" on April 17th, he realized that self-sufficiency in Japan was an important element of security.
It is very important that every country should have its own priorities and be able to raise such necessities as masks and food in its own country.
South Korea's new Corona infected, 100 people have been in and out of the country for 115 days, 86 people have been in and out of the country.
South Korea's Central Defence Task Force announced that on the 25th of this day, the number of new Corona viruses infected by midnight a.m. increased by 113 people from the previous morning to an average of 19,4092.
The new number of people infected per day has been over 100 since April 1st.
In addition to the fact that 32 seamen were found infected by Russian ships that sailed into Busan harbor, 32 of the 293 workers who returned from Iraq on the 24th were tested positively.
The new number of people infected in Korea was between 30 and 60, except for 20 days (26).
Of the new cases released on the 25th, 86 immigrants from abroad were the largest number since January 20th, the first one in Korea.
There were 36 immigrants from Iraq, 34 from Russia, 5 from the Philippines, and 3 from the United States.
On the other hand, 27 people were infected throughout the city, 11 each in Seoul and in Tokyo, and five in Busan.
The five men in Busan City were employees of a repairman on board a Russian ship.
The death toll is as high as 298 from the previous day.
It's called "Cone-Auto" and it's called "Cone-A-A"
Nagoya, soccer J, announced that 25 days had seen a positive response from the new Corona virus.
This is the first positive test for the player after resuming the J league.
The player at the club is the third to be followed by the 3rd FW FW Fowsaki dreamer who got infected in June and the 2 GK Mitchell Langerak (3) from Australia.
They were already treated and returned to the game.
The Miyahara player of this season sat down on the 22nd at the J1 major battle at the Japan Electrical Company.
Nagoya held a press conference online on the 25th and made it clear that the same day it had been tested PCR for 60 athletes and staff members.
98% reflect.
It has been found that the defibrillation of white paint from the tephroned pan increases the air - conditioning effect!
That's a hell of a discovery!
This year, the rainy season is marked by an unprecedented amount of rainfall, but in the light, the hot summer will become real.
It's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's
People have narrowed down the wisdom of how global warming is a global problem and how to get over hot summers a little more comfortable.
One way is to wear thin, white clothes.
Look, you don't have to wear black clothes that absorbs heat in summer, do you?
And they say that the same principles are being applied to the construction of homes, and that more and more cases of white paint are being used.
The white could not be white, but can be reflected more with more light, using it as a paint that doesn't absorb heat, or it was also the latest research field.
Henry Samuel School of Los Angeles (UCLA) at Columbia University, along with researchers in applied physics and applied mathematics at Columbia University, has recently found a way to match white paints that can be used most effectively to reroute the sun and increase the cooling effect inside buildings.
It's estimated that early practicalization will be pointed to.
So far, the white paint that has the highest reflector of sunlight has been used with carbon dioxide, up to 85 percent.
White paints that already use carbon dioxide have been painted on the roof of high-heat buildings and have been used to block out the sun's heat to increase air - conditioning efficiency.
However, what was new was discovered was a white coating from the polyethrofluorocarbons (PTFE) that are used in that tephroned pan.
The white coating that uses this tephron effect is supposed to reflect the sun's rays close to 98 percent and make a large heat cut.
Even in hot summers, white coats of tephron unexpectedly make it easier for the interior to live without the heat.
Maybe that's a time that's coming soon, isn't it?
It's like the roofs of Japanese houses have a lot of dark colors, but from now on, the White System is going to be mainstream.
When's the annual sale in the Amazon this year?
The U.S.
Although held in July each year, it was reported that this year the new Corona virus has been forced to postpone its spread.
▪ Public relations officials, "Details Soon to Be Announced, " said an Amazon publicist in a statement.
"The Prime Day has become a special celebration which we look forward to in the past five years.
However, when it came to saying, "The details will be released soon," the specific date of the event did not reveal.
On the other hand, we decided to hold a convention in India.
Press release on the country's site.
I explained that August 6th will take place between midnight and 48 hours.
Prime Day has been held at the world's joint meeting, but this year it may take unusual steps.
▪ A large event that sells 760 billion yen in two days, the Amazon started this membership sale in 2015 as a way to promote sales in summer when sales are down.
At first, it was a 24-hour event, but it expanded its scale yearly, last year in 18 countries, such as the United States, Canada, Germany, France, India, Japan, and Australia, July 15th to 48 hours.
Last year, according to the company, sales for two days exceeded the sales of Black Fridays and Cybermandays.
This event also contributed to the acquisition of the new member Prime, last year with the highest number of first-day applications, and the next day with the next.
And last year they said they sold 175 million goods worldwide.
About this, Internet Rie Taylor, an expert in the Internet trade industry, reported that the worldwide sales for two days increased by 70 percent over the previous year by 776 million dollars.
Cell phone transfers, hard eyes to keep.
What about commissions and points?
(New switch) - Yahoo! News!
The Ministry is making a full review of the same number transfer system (MNP) that can be used to change a mobile communication company.
In the 21st session, he showed the policy of modifying the MNP guidelines established in 2004.
The specific points of argument vary greatly from the way MNP fees are made, and from those who wish to switch.
In anticipation of backfires from communications companies, the attention is focused on whether they can be connected to the promotion of healthy market competition.
The darkness of each company's cell phone transfers is so remote that the customer charge was 2,000 yen early in '06, but today it's 3,000 yen.
The MNP commission income of three major cell-communicators is estimated at 159 billion yen per year.
For 21 days, the Department of Investigation listed the current state of the MNP at the Institute of Working Groups (WG) that discuss the competition of communications markets and other things.
The time of receiving the MNP number required for consumers to transfer to other communications companies was also put to the test.
Each large communications company accepts it on the web, but thanks to the convenience of the infrastructure system, the response time is 9-20 p.m.
The WG material clearly stated the direction in which we are going to consider the principle of day-to-day response.
It is also a matter of holding back a cell phone company, such as giving a point to anyone who wants to be transferred to the MBP.
It's because of the judgment that excessive restraints will only interfere with fair competition.
The Nomura General Research Institute partner, who serves as a WG member, suggests: "With permission from the users, give us time to explain how we can provide financial benefits and then quickly issue numbers to those who refuse to accept them and end up. It is important to get this process thoroughly.
However, in a series of points, there is a structural problem of "the more expensive customers are, the less likely they are to be motivated to drop aggressively."
If someone lowers the MNP fee first, it is also feared that the company will have increased customer flow and business efforts will not be rewarded.
The General Ministry also points out that many countries abroad do not ask for a service charge for MNP, and it is possible that this will happen in Japan.
The Ministry of Justice has compiled WG results as a report about 9 to 10 months ago, and then wants to begin the process of modifying the MNP guideline.
The time of reform is expected after 21 years.
Mobile communications companies, including some of their sales and customer support, are likely to be mind-wandering.

Is there any chance of a debut at Mount Fwang, 17 years old, at Kobe?
Miyamoto's Overseer's score is out
When G Osaka's Minister Miyamoto Miyamoto (43) took the lead in a four-day victory in Kobe, he accepted the expectation of the first member of the top-class team in the high school of FWSung (17).

"7 years old, but I want you to do more for Gumshala. I've seen athletes going abroad as young as I can, but I've also ordered them to play with high consciousness and greed."
Tangshan was a special player last season in J3 as a prize of eight games.
It's about seven feet long, sixty-five kilos thin, but with the sense of taking the back of the PDF at the moment of moving, and the coolness of the shot shown in front of the target, it's proud of its "five" goals and amazing score in J3.

The car is turned over to the insurance company, the legal owner, and then shipped to the scrap seller.
Scraper Looe van De Oyevaar says: "There are still a few parts left, but they're for the art to be adorned. We've already received a lot of requests from people who want to make a table out of the broken mondial. We'll use engine blocks and glass plates."
For the time being, they don't think of specific sales, but they say that the scrap sellers will keep them as beings like an objet.
