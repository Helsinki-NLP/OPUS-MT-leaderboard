DFB Chief Grindel sees no basis for Özil-Comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for a return from Mesut Özil to the national team.
"This is a question that depends, of course, on the fact that one comes to talk once, that one also talks to him about why he has felt that one or other apparently the way that is laid down in his statement," said Grindel in the football podcast "phrases" of the "picture newspaper.
Despite the monthly debate about the photos of Özil with the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regrets the resignation of the 92-fold national player Özil.
"I would have been glad if Mesut had played Özil for Germany.
I also assumed, until a certain time, that this would be the case, "said Grindel.
The 29-year-old had declared his resignation from the DFB team in July and also justified it by the fact that Grindel had not defended him against racist hostilities during the World Cup.
The DFB chief repeated his criticism of Özil that he was not ready for a conversation with federal trainer Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He didn't want to build any pressure, but he knows it from the football so that if you leave a team or change a club, you talk about it with your coach and I'm sorry that this conversation has not been achieved so far.
Linz: Garden cabin in Schrebergartenling burned
At 2.13 a.m., the occupational fire defense Linz was alerted into a fire in the Angererhofweg.
Because a high voltage pipeline leads directly over the shrimp garden, danger was delayed.
The firemen went out and found the cabin in full fire when they arrived.
The roof had to be practically removed from the alley and fire shots were eliminated at the most necessary level.
According to the owner of the burning garden cabin, he had put a battery to the store at noon.
That might be the cause of fire.
In any case, according to the fire department, the charger was in the range of the largest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire still needs to be determined - as well as the cause of the fire.
However, it is likely to be significant because the owner had many collectors in his garden cabin.

Guard sharp - the party day of the Tories
Birmingham becomes the stage of a power struggle.

The Foreign Ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have already agreed
Macedonia is a state in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.

Protests in Brazil against the right populist Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" means Jair Bolsonaro.
One week before the presidential election in Brazil, the mood in the country is split.
Thousands went on the street in several cities to protest against Jair Bolsonaro.

His strongest competitor is Fernando Haddad from the Left Workers' Party.
Audi: "Dieselgate" processing takes longer than planned
"The Diesel Taskforce still exists," said the Development Board Peter Mertens to the "Car Week."
The detained and vacant Audi Chief Rupert Stadler had announced in December 2017 that the task force will soon be dissolved.
"In the first quarter of 2018, all engine / gearbox combinations are expected to be tested," he said.
Mertens said now: "We have reached an important step-by-step goal in the process of the diesel crisis at the beginning of July.
We have completed the internal technical analyses of our VTDI engines.
The task force had been founded in September 2015 after the discovery of the diesel scandal at Audi-Mother Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the car owner had made "serious organisational changes" so that such a scandal would never occur again.
The VW Supervisory Board had postponed a decision on the future of Stadler on Friday and wants to continue to discuss this Tuesday.
The investigating authorities presume to the Audi boss that after the disclosure of the exhaust fraud, they have authorised the sale of diesel cars with incorrect exhaust values.
He knew about the manipulations or deliberately ignored them.
At present, Bram Schot's sales board is running the company as Chief Commissioner.
Due to the transition to the new exhaust and consumption test standard WLTP there are production failures at Audi, said Schot der Heilbronner Stimme.
In principle, it sees a decreasing demand for limousines such as the audio models A6, A7 and A8 produced in neccarsulm.
"The segment itself is difficult," he said.
Shots are on electrical mobility.
For the e-tron, the first Audi electric car, there were already 15.000 reservations.
Grindel strives for re-election - Lahm should enter the DFB Bureau
Mainz (dpa) - Reinhard Grindel wants to re-join the office as DFB president in the next year despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özil affair.
"I do my job and try to make it as well as I can," said Grindel as a guest in the ZDF's "current sports studio" early Sunday morning.
You have to keep trying to re-elect, I will.
And then you have to see if the support is there.
According to his own words, the Head of the Association would find it "strange" if he did not "wish to participate in the future project after the award for the EM 2024."
Since April 2016, Grindel has been head of the Association as a successor of Wolfgang Niersbach's fall over the summer marketplace affair.
In the autumn of 2016 he was elected for a first full term of office of three years.
The next vote will be held at the DFB Bundestag on 27 September 2019.
According to Grindel, the future EM chief organiser Philipp Lahm is to cooperate in the DFB Bureau.
"I would be pleased if my colleagues in the Bureau agreed that he would continue to advise the Bureau in this role and then, of course, is warmly invited to provide his experience on sports issues," said Grindel.
In speculation, whether Lahm could become his successor as DFB boss, he did not want to participate.
As a consequence of the affair about the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the wish that in future a national player without a migration background should become the integration ambassador of the DFB.
This office currently exercises the born Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, the latter has family roots in Cameroon.
"If someone who has no migration background has a significant impact on society and football and says," the subject is important, we have to take care of it, "said Grindel," that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our associations on the ground where integration needs to work.

Erdoğan opens mosque in Cologne
The Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Ditib mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdoğan had previously met with Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier at his three-day visit.
Criticism against Germany
In his opening speech, Erdoğan called on the German Government to deliver supporters of the Gülen movement living in Germany and to act against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens - no matter where they live.
We will not allow sympathizers of the PKK or Gülen movement to shake our citizens and harm German-Turkish friendship, "he said.
For the opening of the Ditib mosque, the Cologne city of Cologne had been partially blocked.
Several thousand police officers were in use - among them also snipers.
The Islamic Federation of Ditib is criticized because it is considered to be the extended arm of the Turkish Government.

Musicians such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have called for more commitment to the fight against poverty and diseases at a joint concert at the New York Central Park.
"engage wherever you can," Mendes said at the festival in the night to Sunday about 60.0000 spectators.
Thank you for coming here. It's a dream.
Cardi B appeared in a red outfit with French and golden microphone.
I'm nervous, I'm sweating, but it's okay, 'cause I'm here and ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and aid organizations showed themselves at the multi-hour spectacle on the stage.
In the meantime, however, there was a horrible second when many spectators thought the sound of an surrounding metal lock for shots, were afraid and tried to escape.
Shortly panic occurred, people ran into each other.
Seven spectators were slightly injured, said the organizer Hugh Evans.
The New York police and the musician Chris Martin then calmed people off the stage.
"No one tries to hurt anyone," said Martin.
You're all safe.
Tickets for the Global Citizen Festival concert were available free of charge on the Internet as every year.
Anyone who wanted to catch up on the Internet had to read and disseminate texts, photos and videos about the global fight against poverty and diseases.
For the numerous musicians and actors there was the audience's jewelry and applause - Buhcalls, on the other hand, for the Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
Although he spoke with his democratic colleague Chris Coons on the stage for more equality between men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake had declared himself a judge at the Supreme Court in the United States Senate's Justice Committee for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh and thus put a lot of women in the head.
At least three women have been accused of abuse until attempted rape against Kavanaugh, which he rejects.
Flake called for an FBI investigation of the accusations, after two women who have faced him, according to their own information, even experiencing sexual assault, on the way to the committee meeting in an elevator.
"You can also join me at any time in an elevator," said Flake at the New York concert about the crowd of spectators.
Press freedom: Federal Government defends the reporter's throw-out
Government Speaker Steffen Seibert defended the release of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
The Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had transferred a T-shirt with the Turkish and German recipe "Freedom for Journalists."
The T-shirt, had not been the problem, said Seibert the picture on Sunday.
It was about a disturbance in the end of the press conference.
The journalist's action has caused a strong disturbance, which is unacceptable.
That's why he made people protect the man out.
Seibert said it was not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Chancellor Office.
This applies entirely regardless of whether or not it is a legitimate concern.
The rules are the rules.
In Turkey, many journalists are in prison.
Many of them are accused of alleged spying activities or support or membership of banned parties or the Fethullah Gülen movement.
The Turkish leadership makes the movement responsible for the failed pussy attempt on July 15, 2016.
Some of the accused journalists are threatening several decades of detention.
Foreign journalists are also not sure about the Turkish authorities: in early September, the Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was arrested.
Last but not least, the cases of the imprisoned journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel had taken care of.
They were free to return to Germany, but in Turkey they are still in process against the two.
Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller
So fresh and good-looking, his fans usually know him: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look at it twice: yes, this is really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The Talkshow "Inas Night" produced by the NDR is known for moisturizing conversations at the Theke of the Hamburger Hafenkneipe "Schellfischposten."
Moderator Ina Müller meets with her guests on some beer, some wine or even more prominent drinks to attract the mood and tongues.
Not a few promis also drink for the mandatory singing deposits courage.
On Friday, another episode of the popular talk show was recorded.
This time, the actor Florian David Fitz is known from movies like "men's hearts," "terror - your judgment" or "The coolest day."
The Munich's trip to the high north was not good at all.
On Saturday he posted a selfie - his face is completely cracked on it, the eyes only two little slices left.
The bed selfie shows a completely excited Florian David Fitz.
But he's not sick, he only has a powerful cat.
To his fans he posted some - probably not very serious - insights that he has now gained: "Rule one: NOT goes to India's night.
Rule two: Never drink the black sow.
And splash.
And the round of egg liquor, which throws Ina at half past three, also lets go.
The alcohol consumption is indeed written in the face of the 43-year-old.
His fans posted a few tips to fight the progeny.
They were rich in instant breads, fish breads or, most likely, headache tablets.
Others simply enjoyed the view of the usually attractive cinema star.
As Ina Müller has survived the night lap, it has not yet been known.
Since she has moderated the TV fun on the theatre since 2007, the 53-year-olds seem to be significantly more tested...
To a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa has to fight with vandalism and uncounsel
The entrance to the 36 kilometers long railway bike road in the Red Cave country in Treysa is difficult to detect and disguised.
Recipes against grazing vandalism are sought, but solutions are hardly drawn.
Snippers, cigarette chips, garbage and uncounting, demolished garbage and now dismantled signs - this is how the entrance with seating group has been presented to the bike road on the Haaße hill in Treysa for a long time.
For the preview object railway bike road in the red cave country a more than unremarkable view.
The topic deals with members of the ADFC local group of Schwalmstadt but also others for a long time, according to the Cycling Officer of the city of Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem had already been raised in the bicycle council.
There has not been a solution so far.
The proposals ranged from the relocation of the seating group to regular cleansing of the waste tanks and cleaning of the areas at the entrance point.
"I think the latter would be the commandment of the hour - regardless of possible further activities," says desert garden.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reported that he also brought the subject into the local council.
Not only the trash drives cyclists and residents - the seating group is regular meeting point on weekends to celebrate.
It is not only often loud to go, the layers are also destroyed: brushes torn out of the earth, garbage crushed, shields crushed, seating furniture crushed.
Volunteers would have cleaned up more often, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
But the actions are only the spokesman drops on the hot stone.
They are angry that the rest place on the bike road is in Treysa meeting point for soap storage.
"Along the whole bike road is clearly the focus here on the Haaße hill," confirms the bike operator, who now also cares about the new bike site in Goat Hain, which is being opened today.
"If she suffers the same fate, it will be really expensive."
Another idea is video monitoring on the hill: "Perhaps this puts the threshold much higher to exploit on common goods.
This would, however, imply that a police force would be passing by in the near future.
In principle, desert gardens wish to develop the Haaße hill.
It needs to be made more attractive.
In fact, the frequency of the bike road so far could be very satisfied.
Tourism marketing is still expanding.
Our bike path is very high compared to others in Germany, "said the ADFC members.
As an extremely critical hazard site, ADFC member Susanne Klippers appreciates the situation in the Ascheröder Straße in Treysa.
There's no abbey trace on the Haaße hills.
In the case of real traffic, cyclists may have to wait in the middle of the road between both sides of the traffic flow, "she explains.
This is not a problem for sportsmen, but for older people and especially for children.
Music Contest at the Cultural Station: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call to the music contest was a success, creative and together.
"D to offer a song for Hiltrup" is the appeal of the urban part offensive Hiltrup, in the "Music contest for big and small, young and experienced musicians."
A contest "with eye wings in the sympathetic assistant family," as Karl Franke formulated.
In fact, it was soon a family coexistence with coffee and cake by the honorary officials of the Cultural Station.
Seven formations occurred, from the one-man band to the big ensemble: Alvin Jasic with Pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long in Hiltrop living Albachtener, the nine of the "Hiltruper Star Colors," three members and three generations of the Trenkamp and Claus families, a ensemble from the kindergarten Lummerland and finally Rike Weßling and the Zwarties.
This contest, said Mayor Joachim Schmidt, was a new one.
We haven't seen that in other parts of the city yet.
What did the texts look like?
At the places the Hiltruper Lake and the market allee were particularly frequently mentioned.
Rolf Himself cut the Allee in his slayer-like song to the "Kö von Hiltrup."
The cultural station was also appreciated.
Always again it was about experiencing each other at these places, especially at Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke revived the short conversion breaks with short interviews with the interpreters or indications of their work.
This is how Humberg learned that he actually studied chemistry, but now he also teaches guitar.
The sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann knew Franke to report that he recently appeared in Ludwigshafen - at a major event of the BASF with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
And Alvin Jasic has placed all hands on Youtube.
"It's not about winning," Franke said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hiltruper Gastronomy.
There was something special for the jury's favourites - so that others could hear their songs.
A whole CD can play Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied with sound engineer Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Him with his help-trop slayer, who particularly impressed Franke with his musicality, and the "Lummerland-Rudel": "a very nice performance" with ten children and two educators on guitar and cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tullen.
Like all of them, the children came to the final again - and even without electronic support, as Franke said.
The jury was led by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, inconsistency of the melody and recognition value.
The jury belonged to Gisbert Keller from the West African School of Music, Andreas Klomfat from the KvG Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Economic Association, as well as Jan Kaven, chairman of the district offensive.
The district offensive had created the event due to its ten-year existence.
She appreciated the event as a full success.
Everyone is "very satisfied," and "the atmosphere was good" at the soon very full cultural station.
The Word Game: "Decrypto" in the game test
The players form two teams that are facing each other.
For each page there is a visual screen, in which four cards with keywords can be unzipped - the old trick with the red slide - only once you put them in.
Thus it is ensured that the opposite side can also read nothing by mistake.
On the cards, for example, you can read from left to right: "1. Renaissance.
2nd window.
3rd cube.
4. Party. "
These are the terms that are to be encrypted from now on.
Because here we are supposed to guess not the terms, but codes.
Changing one player per team is the encryptor.
He gets a code card that might be "3.4.2."
In "Decrypto," it is not supposed to be the words behind the secret film, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case is to describe, in this order and in this example, the terms "cubes," "feast" and "windows" so that his own team recognises the correct order and the opponent team as far as possible does not; because that wins the party if he succeeds twice in breaking the code.
So the encryptor notes and reads loudly: "Throw" for the cubes, "Lose" as a contrast to the feast; here, of course, something like "Party" and "Prague" would be possible because he watched at school and knows the window crash there.
This is the round for round, team for team on.
You do not know the terms of the opposite side - but this can be better combined with any hint that the encryptor gives there.
Possibly mysterious, but not too distracted should be the transcriptions, otherwise you make it unnecessarily difficult for your team.
The most cryptic of "Decrypto" is unfortunately the rule book.
The players probably have to study it quite long and thoroughly until they can finally play.
The explanation video under decrypto.info on the network makes it easier.
But who first started, will be fascinated by how much feeling there is in this invisible game.
Overall, "Decrypto" is not as conclusive as predecessors and genre primus "codenames," which also has an agency enthusiasm on a game less words, but much better to play in small groups.
And who's all about rates and not victories, he can easily find a version for two.
Kulmbach: Man shows the police Hitler greeting and harassing guests in the pub
A 48-year-old man employed the police inspection of Kulmbach twice in the night from Saturday to Sunday.
He first showed the Hitler greeting in the upper city of a passing police squad, and later he also noticed in the upper city in a bar when he harassed other guests.
After he had not responded significantly to the posting of the police, he had to spend the night at the police inspector Kulmbach in the prison cell.
In a sober state, he must also be responsible for the use of labels of non-constitutional organisations in criminal law.
Pressig was home to the shoe blocks
The Pressig station was the roller in the Frankenwald for decades.
= = References = = = = External links = =
"When buffer buffered at buffer, it was heard in full pressures," Georg Dinkel recalls, who archives the history of the place and the station.
It didn't make anyone feel better.
There the brakes were quietly and the wagons were snatching.
It was just a railroad.
Statements that are meaningful for Dinkel's home Pressig.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald, a place was so shaped by the railroad.
Here was the starting point of the Steilrampen mountain route to the north, which after an increase of about 220 meters of altitude has its headline point in Steinbach am Wald.
In order to deal with this, trains and shoe blocks, which had their home in Pressig, were used to be needed.
In 1901, the Bavarian Landtag approved the construction of a railway workshop with 21 locals, apprenticeship workshop, driving management and railway championship.
"Heart was the slide, which had a diameter of 18 meters after a reconstruction in 1899," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, railway historians and 47 years professional seisenbahner.
The railway company (BW) Pressig, which was subjected to Bamberg in 1968, also operated locks for the side lines Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalben.
On July 15, 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported a staff of 160 men; 13 steam and eight elloks were stationed in Pressig.
The electrification of the line in 1939 already minimised the need for train and shoe blocks.
From 1977 they were only used for freight trains.
Until 1991, at least 10 000 weights were ranked in the month.
In 1982, parts of the plant were cancelled, 1991 the rest was cancelled.
Heidrich: "It is regrettable that there has not been a better use of the site, even in terms of freight transport."
At Pfingsten in 1989, the Nuremberg Railway Directorate celebrated a pompous railway station in Pressig for the anniversary of "50 years of electricity in Nuremberg - Saalfeld."
"There were 10,000 enthusiastic spectators here," remembered Georg Dinkel.
A little later.
On June 1, 1991, the last 30 men were pulled off, and the Pressig Rangierbahnhof was history.
"The runners and hemisphere did the most difficult work in train traffic," reminds Dinkel.
Every misattack would have had fatal consequences.
Why the Pressig-Rothenkirchen station led for the reverse of the hierarchy of the two places and many other historical and current pictures are available here in the infrankenPlus article.
Kerber with recording success at China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledonwinner Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have reached the second round at the tennis tournament in Beijing as before Julia Görges.
Kerber won at the China Open 6: 2, 6: 2 against the French Kristina Mladenovic.
The next opponent of the world rankings third is either Julia Putinzewa from Kazakhstan or the Spanish Carla Suárez Navarro.
Sieger led 6: 3, 4: 2 against Darja Kassatkina, when the Russian set up at number 13 gave up.
The Schwäbin is now dealing with Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
A special exhibition was opened in Mittelehrenbach during the series "Art and Enjoy."
With great relief registered organisers and visitors looked at the ideal weather when the Dahlmann-Schmidt property opened the special vernissage "Windgame Performance."
It takes place under the roof of the Tourism Association "Rund um Walberla" in the context of the series "Art and Enjoy."
This opened its doors in the 15th year.
A great visitor's commitment showed the fascination of the exhibition.
21 copies of 20 artists can now be visited in Mittelehrenbach.
Hauerr Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to open the vernissage.
He himself has been there since the first hour.
Like Volker Hahn, who made himself a name as the main organizer and artist.
Something surprising, but Hahn announced his resignation a few days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, he put his task in proven, young hands with good future prospects.
Both of them have already been actively involved in the selection of artists in the past and have been involved in flyers.
Also this year, at the time of art & enjoyment, there is another 70-cent special badge designed by them, available at each art station.
There also this year's poster "Betzn Austanze," designed by Volker Hahn, can be purchased for eight euros.
Hahn welcomed the high commitment of the special exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler was won from Nuremberg for the musical envelope.
During the course through the generous garden, the visitor quickly becomes aware that the title "Windgame Performance" formally challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately expresses the play.
It is made of metal or ceramics, often with colorful accents.
Already at the entrance of the presence the visitor awaits the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau, on the right side of the "Glücksbaum".
It is a tree stump, colorfully lit, playful with 20 windshirts, 24 hoopers and 24 aluminium tubes provided as sound piece.
With the sun going through the bush in the background, the object is magnificent and invites to stay.
From Eckental comes Barbara Washneck, who prefers to dedicate himself to the event 15 years K & G in three-dimensional letters.
There are many parts in motion in the wind.
Siegrid Frey from Eckental exhibited her work "The Wind the Heavenly Child."
And at the end of the area, Volker Hahn shows his colorful imagination of sound, cement and stainless steel.
The theme "Windgame Performance" to wear through the versatile art exhibition.
The special exhibition can be visited by 31 December 2018.
50 years MGV 68 Albachten: Singer celebrates 50th birthday festive
1968 - this was the time of protest and student movement.
And the Albaiters also made their humility.
At least five of them.
They did not want partout to find that there should be no sanctuary in the district after the dissolution of the church chorus "Cäcilia."
It has now become a legend: at a bank in the tin bush they lifted the MGV 68 Albachten out of the baptism.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated in the "House of Meeting."
"It will be full today," said Chairman Jürgen Holstiege, and he should keep right.
150 guests were there, a real success for the Albachtene singer.
To the anniversary they had the foundation festival revived.
For years it was tradition, and then there was a break.
At the time of the 50th anniversary, the tradition festival was back.

Volleyball: 3. League Women: USC II wins high-class Derby against BW Aasee
The climber marches.
Three games, three victories - the reserve of the USC Münster under the auspices of Axel Büring is really good in Liga three.
No sign of shame or fraction sauces, the independent people do their thing.
And that at 3: 0 (25: 15, 25: 23, 26: 24) against city competitor BW Aasee really good.
"That was not a glacier, but we have already left the impression," says the somewhat satisfied coach.
BWA-Coach Kai Annacker immediately commanded: "This is a defeat with which we can live very well with.
We are not dissatisfied. "On the contrary.
In the evening at a subsequent birthday celebration by Ronja de Boer the mood was good, the game was cut off.
Yes, the result is indeed an optical deception.
In the third sentence, the guests had a satzball.
"When they bring them to the goal, such a game can kick," Büring knows from years of experience.
Finally, the USC made everything clear with its routine forces and brought the full exploitation to the goal.
"We all know who's in such a derby on the other side.
That won't break our neck.
I've seen really good volleyball phases, "Annacker didn't hesitate with the 0: 3 - and went to the agenda immediately.
Wherever the journey goes for the independent, it does not seem foreseeable after just three days of play.
"It's just too early for that," says Axel Büring.
Only in one he feels confirmed: "The 3rd League has an incredibly good level.
With regional league volleyball, this is not almost comparable. "In the fourth league they don't want to look down anyway.
If the vest is not contaminated in the next few weeks, they have to look upstairs.
However, a first balance can only be drawn after ten, eleven lots.
On Saturday, we're going to Emlichheim.
Aasee arrives in Essen on 14 October.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
On the "dream ship," Heide Keller became a star.
Now she opposes the fact that the series could have been guilty of her marriage with Hans von Borsody.
Her role of chief hostess Beatrice von Ledebur on the "dream ship" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 1, 2018 she left on board forever.
She was married to Hans von Borsody in 1929 and was married for ten years.
"That could have been a reason.
Because I grew up with this work, traveled with a suitcase alone around the world and many of my admired colleagues saw me at eye level, "says Keller in conversation with the" picture on Sunday. "
First, she had always been "the wife of Hans von Borsody," but that changed with the "dream ship."
Because now the journalists only called Heide Keller.
"I don't know if he liked it so well."
She considers it possible that her then husband could have been quite jealous, but "how many men also shook His conversations about problems and feelings."
Keller has always tried to be the only right one for Hans von Borsody and he wanted to know my fears, not my weaknesses.
This means in good German: I have set myself up, "as she further explains.
She always felt "not good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman that I was never in truth, even though I sometimes appeared freaky and brave on stage.
I wanted our love to be forever. "
After a previous marriage with Thomas Härtner, Keller said again yes, "although I was afraid that it could go wrong another time."
On the day before the permanent wedding, I sat crying in the wardrobe and wanted to cancel everything.
The marriage to Borsody also failed.
Why never worked with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller had imagined love at that time "as in the film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not everyday.
I have gone far too naive to love. "
This time, the nightfolder who regularly explores the city's nightlife in Zurich's NZZ resort has dared to see the ZFF opening party.
Our falter is not a moat, but a little light shy.
And the scary shine, in which a green carpet was dipped in the six-seat place, blinds him over the fee.
But it's like a movie festival, because more or less famous people want to sunrise in the headlight.
In this late Thursday night, he will be drunk over the place to facilitate himself in the "Aquaclean WC oasis."
This is the public toilet sponsored by a large sanitary company, which celebrates its premiere at the festival: the need facility in the parterre of a new pavilion makes a lot of effort to streamline a luxurious ambience.
On that evening, however, it stinks in the gentleman oasis for some reason to heaven.
So get out here, over to the other side of the street: invited guests who have been entertaining in the cinema next to the opening movie "Green Book" just at the best level celebrate the festival start every year with a party in the three-shot warehouse.
Its name fits perfectly with this movie festival: from the whole Earth ball, we know that the works shown are coming from.
What does an article about this festival do not have to be made up of in order not to fall into probability for its 190 partner companies?
The folder binds a bendle around the feelings that gave him a good fairy, and two bully door rocks actually whistle him in generously.
Inside, the loads push themselves, they dance to live music long after midnight, or they can be presumed by DJ rhythms to which they scream each other, and rinse down with Cüpli exquisite hoods.
In the delicacies shop in the souterrain, oysters are waiting for sloppy mouths, next to the incomparable raw ham Culatello di Zibello is cut up fresh, a chocolate fountain sprinkled.
And the hammer is: All the sales shelves full of exclusive products have not been cleared for the occasion.
This has been the case for years, so it seems to work without great losses.
You have to love this country for it!
The folder studies the sign at the roller staircase: "Wear a long dress, please be careful on the roller staircase."
If these are two separate instructions, he's lost his name in the dress code.
But it's more of a conditional construction, and it certainly has saved lives already.
In the household warehouse department on the top floor, the poultry kicks a cocktail prepared with Espresso called "Golden Eye," suitable for the Festival Award.
The price for the best drink is not mandatory for this mixture with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself.
And George Clooney, who's been recruiting that brand for years, isn't here that night either.
However, between local prominence, cassette and kitchenware, there is a face that is known to the observer: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
His main actor is probably not far there.
And really: Immediately Viggo Mortensen, with almost sixty acting like a choir boy, walks through the crowd.
He's not being chatted, he's not gathered, he's sheltered.
Just for this restraint, if misunderstood as a clamour, love international stars of this film festival.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with Cumbia dancing
Coach and ex-football star Diego Maradona welcomes the victory of his team.
Argentina's football legend Diego Maradona seems to have lived well in his new home Mexico.
After a 2: 0 victory of his club Dorados de Sinaloa, the 57-year-old coach danced with a player in the cabin to Cumbia-Rythmen, as can be seen in a video published on Saturday.
In the 15-second clip of a crew member, Maradona dances in the yellow tricot, fired by the players.

After the game, Maradona called in a TV camera "Always with my boys, always."
The 57-year-old has trained the Mexican club since the beginning of September.
Handball: Verbandsliga 1: ASV Send to Last-Minute-Pleite "On the ground"
Swen Bieletzki, coach of the handball association list ASV sending, could hardly believe it: "Such a bitter defeat." His protectors were "destroyed on the ground" after the unfortunate 29: 30 (12: 14) - Pleite - the fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday night at LIT Germania 2.
As in Steinhagen, as against Hüllhorst, they had not played badly over broad phases, the broadcasters.
Only the initial phase "we slept completely," the ASV trainer was angry.
At 8: 1 the households quickly led, even the early leisure that Bieletzki had taken, did not frustrate at first.
"But then suddenly a ruck went through the team," Bieletzki merged the second quarter hour.
At the break, the residue was only two gates.
Most importantly, Marius Hintze, hit the stage once again.
After the change it became even better from the viewpoint.
After 33 minutes, David Ernst went out to 15: 15, and then the seasonal change was almost complete.
Four minutes before the siren the leap was still apparently reassuring three hits (29: 26).
And then?
Involve the impartials in the event.
Bieletzki usually protects himself from looking for the guilt of others.
But: The 120-second time penalty that Steffen Mühlhoff cashed, "was a joke."
LIT had a good laugh and hit four more times until the end - while the decimated ASV failed also in the last attack.
The boys fought great, stood well in the back of seven men and threw them on the empty gate again and again.
Only they can buy little for the compliments.
"Now a fucking victory has to come," said the rest of Bieletzki.
ASV-Tore: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), of the Pol (2).

Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla's electric car manufacturer, has abandoned his threatening call as head of the billionaire firm.
He and the US Stock Supervisor SEC brought an extrajudicial dispute about misleading Twitter messages in which Musk could have lost permission to run listed companies.
As part of the comparison, Musk and Tesla pay $20 million each, and for three years, Musk gives the chair's office, a position comparable to the German Supervisory Board Head.
He may remain head of the board of directors.
In comparison, which must be confirmed or confirmed by a court, neither Musk nor Tesla had any misconduct.
The SEC had sued the world's well-known manager to the US Federal Court of Manhattan for fraud.
Musk, who is also chairman of the Space Company SpaceX, is the public face of the loss-writing electric car pioneer, which is now rated at the stock exchange with more than $50 billion.
Musk is not aware of any guilt
Musk explained that he did nothing wrong and was sad and disappointed in the complaint.
He has always acted in the sense of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7, Musk had written his more than 22 million Twitter followers, he might take the company from the stock exchange, paying $420 per share, the financing is secured.
This would mean that Tesla would have been rated at a total of 72 billion dollars.
Later Musk returned: Tesla stays on the stock exchange.
After the agreement, Tesla now needs to find a chairman from outside, appoint two independent board members and also set up a committee to monitor musk communication.

Surveys: 46 percent Merkel doesn't want to be a Chancellor by 2021
After the crosses of the past weeks, the GroKo is cashing several survey defeats.
The SPD falls back in an interview behind the AfD - Angela Merkel is seen critical.
Berlin - The AfD has for the first time overtaken the SPD in the Emnid Sunday trend for the picture on Sunday in the Federal Republic.
In the weekly survey of the opinion research institute, the AFD adds a teller to 17 percent, the SPD gives a point compared to the previous week and ends at 16 percent.
CDU and CSU also lose a counter and only reach 27 percent.
This is the deepest value for the Union in the trend of Sunday.
The Greens reach 15 percent, the Left 11 and the FDP 10 percent.
If it were Bundestag election on Sunday, the government partnerships SPD, CDU and CSU would receive only 43 percent of the votes, according to Emnid.
This means that the large coalition has now lost the majority in the Sunday question at all major research institutes, with the exception of Allensbach.
The Governance Partnerships consistently reach 43 to 45 percent of the votes (Allensbach: 51 percent).
= = References = = = = External links = = * Official website
For the other parties, the bandwidth is also large: AfD, in several surveys the second largest party, comes to 15 to 18 percent.
The Greens reach votes of 12.5 to 17 percent.
The left is on average 10 percent, FDP 9 percent.
For statistical reasons, such surveys have an uncertainty of 2 to 3 per cent up and down depending on the proportion of votes.
But also the restraint for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in the population has fallen significantly since the Bundestag election in 2017.
At the moment, only 48 percent of citizens find that Merkel is the right person in the Chancellor Office, as the Emnid survey on behalf of the BamS revealed.
Only every second (50 percent), according to the survey, is currently wishing that the large coalition holds up to the next regular Bundestag election in three years, 41 percent are for a new election.
In a further survey published on Saturday, there had also been a marked loss of popularity for Merkel.
The Germans also assess whether Merkel should re-join the CDU Presidency in December.
According to Emnid, 47 percent are against it, 44 percent against it.
Thus, 64 per cent of the Union's supporters want a candidate, 35 per cent not.
Expension at Aldi: Price reduced to love happiness
Will Aldi become Tinder 2.0?
Who says that in times of Tinder there are no more romantic identifying stories - he should talk to Aldi about peanut meat.
Munich - In times of digital "fastfood datings" by Tinder and Co., the supermarket broadcasts almost an anachronistic romance as a place for the great love.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced pudding meat, boxershort snaps at the wrestling table or the favorite pudding is in doubt still a better story for the later grandchildren than a just swipe to the right.
The App Tinder is in the name of being less a contact but rather a sloppy stock exchange.
We have dared to test: how do women react, you don't talk about the hot breath long in the first message?
Here's the amazing result.
Regular Hollywood Lovestory potential has it when the happiness of love precedes an out-of-the-eyes-lost-and-found-plot.
If the guy returns to his prayers under the email address bio-putenmeat @ gmx.de, it sounds like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and consorts - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
So it is the author of this Annonce in an unknown Aldi branch to wish that she will also find her dreamman, with whom she has briefly entertained over the "30 percent reduced organic potter meat."
For the faith in the magic of analogue learning she definitely deserves her Happy End à la Hollywood.
Billerbeck: 500 lid for a life without paralysis

The cause of poliomyelitis, the polioviruses, can so far only be impeded by vaccines, as it is mentioned in a press release.
Football: Reus and Zorc demand peace for gods
Leverkusen (dpa) - BVB sports director Michael Zorc and Captain Marco Reus have called for an end to the public debate on the form and fitness of Mario Götze.
"We should stop thinking about Mario.
That's not good for the boy.

Football: District League: Researcher's appearance of the VfL Wolbeck against the SC Altenrheine makes courage
There were moments in this young season, and Alois Fetsch went to court with his own.
He was the coach of VfL Wolbeck, the coach of the soccer district ligist, who first withdrew (inside) in order to sinne about the lack of performance on the green.
All history.
In the meantime it's running around the fire head road again.
The deaf proof is the 1: 1 on Sunday against the SC Altenrheine, in the past playtime only cut off thin on the rise.
Yeah, I'm very happy with the show.
"We have tightened the rooms and put pressure on the ball.
This could be seen, "Fetsch praised his boys and looked up every single person for the party to say simply" thank you "for so much defense against the ambitious guests.
The coach had to change the system after 26 minutes.
After the injury of Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - for him Luca Rehberg - it went almost seamlessly from the 4-4-2 to a 4-2-3-1 where Niklas Thewes waited in front of balls.
Wolbeck had significantly more gambling shares in the first section.
And opportunities.
But Frerichs before his exit (17.), the changed Luca Rehberg (26.) and Jan Schroer (38.) missed the leadership.
Almost that would have aroused when the SCA in minute 41 was twice in person by Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbäumer at the Wolbecker box - Tormann Damian Hallas proved to be the master of his profession.
After the break, the VfL took full control.
Thewes from 18 meters failed.
Schroer also came too late after 58 minutes at a thewes entry.
With the exchange of Miles Geske, a fresh cell cure was missed on the left side.
When the old rheine Chris Naberbauumer fell in the 70th minute Robin Westhues, there was 18 meters in front of the guest house an indirect freestoost for the square gentlemen.
The prisoner himself attended and demonstrated his danger to standards.
Westhues "thing with the right slapping struck down left from the shooter's view - 1: 0 (71st).
Twenty minutes left to be damned long.
And then that: VfL Captain Florian Quabeck flew the leather in the stray room unhappy to the hand in the 80th minute.
Judge Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the gift (79.).
Scared minutes Wolbeck had to survive in the final phase before geske had the victory hit on the pump in the 87th minute from 12 meters.
Maybe it would have been too much of the good.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75. Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26. L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66. Geske) - Thewes

Report of the Allbright Foundation: Women remain in business presidencies a rare one
Only 8 per cent of the board was therefore female on the Day of September 1, as the report "The Power of Monoculture," which is officially presented by the Allbright Foundation this Monday and presented to the German Press Agency in advance.
"The companies will have to move differently, otherwise the international competitors pass by them," said Foundation Managing Director Wiebke Ankersen.
In the USA, the UK or Sweden, purely male management teams - with a few exceptions - are no longer possible.
The gap makes German competitors less versatile, innovative and future-oriented compared.
It's a different corporate culture.
In addition, the small increase in the share of women among German stock exchange companies was due solely to positive impetus for enterprises in the medium-sized value index (MDax).
According to Allbright, only 6.8 per cent of the board is female.
In the previous year, however, the value had remained at 3.8 per cent.
With the 30 Dax companies - in the past years preriders - the proportion of women stagnated.
Last time, 26 women worked in the board.
"I am sure that the Dax companies will recruit consistent women again next year - in their own interest," Ankersen said.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement would have signalled that they would not continue to commit themselves to increase the share of "zero percent" so far.
Another picture can be found in the Supervisory Councils: on 1 September there was the proportion of women at 30.5 per cent - 45 women more and 68 men less than one year ago.
"Recruited every year as many women for the board, a 40% share would have been reached in 2023," says the report.
Some even make mice: luxury carrots: Which manufacturer earns the most per car?
Ferrari deserves the best.
The Italians take €280,000 with each sold Ferrari and make €69,000 operating profits.
Big cars, big profits: This slogan still applies today - in most cases.
Who makes the most profit per car among the noble providers.
Munich - Ferrari, Maserati, Bentley: How much are the luxury manufacturers per car they sell?
This question has been addressed by "Autopapst" and economist Ferdinand Dudenhöffer.
His study shows that the differences are massive.
Ferrari made 69,000 Euro operating profits in the first half of the year with every car sold - Jaguar Land Rover, on the other hand, only comes to around 800 Euro, Tesla and Bentley even lay vigorously on each car.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are well in the race with prices from an average of 33,000 to 38,000 euros per car and about 3,000 euros before interest and tax.

Such a rescue trip took a deadly end in Bonn for a 26-year-old.
Bonn - In the collision of an emergency car with a taxi a 26-year-old pedestrian has been injured fatally in Bonn.

Driver of the emergency car and taxi driver seriously injured
The 62-year-old cab driver and the driver of the emergency car were severely injured in their vehicles and had to be exempted from operations.
The 29-year-old emergency doctor, who was also severely injured, was able to free herself, but the pedestrian could no longer help her.
Another called an emergency doctor tried to do this - but without success.
The three severely injured were brought to hospitals.
The police, in close coordination with the Bonner prosecutor's office, are investigating who is responsible for the accident.
Manchester United loses again, for Mourinho we are uncomfortable
After the blamable out in the Ligacup, Manchester United now loses in the 7th round of the Premier League.
West Ham United is subject to ManU 1: 3. The way of defeat may still exist.
Strange was the scene in the 74th minute where the restored Marko Arnautovic for West Ham shot the 3: 1; only three minutes after Marcus Rashford had brought the Red Devils to play again allegedly.
As they suspected an offside on Mark Nobel's passport, all the defenders of Manchester stayed standing and left Arnautovic all the time in the world to pass the ball on the helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative peak of an earlier insufficient performance over wide distances.
At the moment, the vegetation situation at Uniteds City Trivale Manchester City is quite different.
The citizens who were trained by Mourinhos, a major competitor, Pep Guardiola, came to an unendangered 2: 0 victory against Brighton & Hove Albion.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling first broke through the defense line of the outside for the home team.
Sergio Agüero, after a good hour and a double pass with the former gate protector for securing the sixth victory in the seventh game, and thus also for jumping to the table tip.
Liverpool no longer table leader
Three days after the 1: 2 defeat in the Ligacup, Xherdan Shaqiri fought with Liverpool in the Premier League a 1: 1 against Chelsea.
Eden Hazard was the best man in London.
The 27-year-old hit in the 25th minute remained in the final phase of the game's only hit.
Shaqiri, who came to the field in the 66th minute for Mohamed Salah, missed the compensation after 70 minutes.
Better made it Daniel Sturridge in the 99th minute with his lock.
After the rods had started with a painless balance in the week, Chelsea was not to beat for the second time.
First, the Londons eliminated the team of Jürgen Klopp in the Cup, and the Remis in the league crashed the Blues Liverpool from the top of the table.
Like City, the two London city clubs Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford) also celebrated 2: 0 victories.
However, the fans of the Gunners, with which Granit Xhaka played through, had to stand up against the surprise team from Hertfordshire county until the 81st minute for a success report.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford defender Craig Cathcart unfortunate an entry of Alex Iwobi into his own gate, only two minutes later, Mesut Özil made the decision with his third season hit.
Arsenal passed Watford's fifth win in succession and is now right behind the great Rival Tottenham on rank 5. A strong impression remains Wolverhampton ascending under his Portuguese trainer Espirito Santo.
The wolves remained unbeaten at 2: 0 against Southampton in the league for the fifth time in succession and occupied the 8th place.
VW core brand missing: Paris car salon in the sign of the Diesel debate
The Paris car salon takes place every two years in exchange with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially no topic and yet at present: The diesel scandal and the ring for driving bans and refurbishment should not let go of the German car companies at the industry meeting in Paris.
From next week on, they will show their news in the French capital, along with the competition from all over the world.
The diesel doesn't really matter anymore.
However, the potential exchange and refurbishment offers for diesel owners in Germany, which are to be negotiated with the government in Berlin until then, should still be an important subject at least behind the shiny scenes of the exhibition stands.
A large name is missing in Paris: Although the Volkswagen Group is involved with Audi, Porsche and other daughters, it is not with the core brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are there and have their first pure electric models: The e-tron of the Ingolden Towns is to come to the market at the end of the year, the EQC of the Stuttgart 2019.
Officially presented, however, both have already been presented.
The iNext of BMW should not start until 2021.
The new 3s are at the heart of Paris.
In total, more than 250 exhibitors are represented this year from 4 to 14 October.
In addition to car groups, motorcycle builders as well as numerous mobility service and software providers are present in each of their own halls.
The fair, which celebrates its 120th birthday this year, takes place every two years in exchange with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, well a million visitors came.
The heavy earthquakes and the following tsunami have killed at least 380 people on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Dozens are still missing.
In addition, there are more than 500 injured.
The island had been shaken by two earthquake on Friday.
The first beetle had the strength 5.9, the second the strength 7.4.
Communications and transport connections are damaged, and they have caused enormous damage.
After the funeral, the tsunami broke into the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the city of Palu, hundreds of people gathered at the beach for a feast.
It is feared that the number of victims will still be significantly higher.
The figures have so far only come from Palu.
However, many other municipalities are also affected - along Sulawesis West Coast.
About 150 bikers celebrate service in Werdohl
Motorcycle pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated on Sunday with a helper team the final service for motorcycle drivers in the Peace Church in Eveking.
Werdohl - The place before the Peace Church in Eveking belonged to motorcycle drivers on Sunday.
After all, the final service for the bikers was on the program.
Frank Schröder is the motor pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and thus responsible for the psychological concerns of the PS-strong two-wheel drivers.
Between April and September, on the last Sunday of a month, the traditional motorcycle gottesservice (MoGo) at the house Nordhelle will always take place.
The final of the season is traditionally celebrated by the bikers in the Peace Church in Eveking.
On Sunday, about 150 bikers had come together to do anything other than ordinary service.
Already from 10: 00 the bolides were ripped up before the entrance portal of the church.
First, the bikers' early shoots were on the program and it was allowed to be strengthened with coffee and cake or even with a defective curry sausage.
In addition to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, were involved.
The preaching was held during the Biker service priest Dirk Grzegorek.

"Although the bikers prefer the Blues Rock, Valerie Lill is more poetic-quiet tones," said Reverend Frank Schröder.
This was certainly a novel in the history of the motorcycle service yesterday too.
Fatal villages Home Association celebrates great feast: After the apple comes the milk
And even on the actual day of action Borisch was active.
She provided her hungry guests with fresh apple pie cakes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg also woke great interest.
He had his apple press in his luggage and demonstrated his stunning spectators step by step the process from the mature apple to the apple juice.
Then and when Hartmann-Niemerg left the children the field and made them fill the apples in the great trigger.
With a little muscle power, a fine crushed mass was made from the apples.
I don't think many of the children could imagine how it should become a tasty drink.
But they could also look at this important step of work this late Friday afternoon.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg packaged in shapes and wrapped by nets, stabbed the a little like hake-well apple pieces layer for layer across each other.
Thanks to some technical support, the last step of work was no longer so difficult.
The freshly pressed juice ran gradually into a large container.
But the farmer had already completed specialities.
So he opened his "treasure box" and presented the most recent spring white to the older visitors.
The demand for the good drop "Made in Vochtorf" was accordingly high.
In a cosy atmosphere the parents came to talk, while the children were able to follow not only the process of apple press but also the built-up Hüpfburg for themselves.
Active members of the Foottower Campaign former soldiers also committed themselves in the context of the festival and invited to short-bidding games at some stations.
The home association will also offer a day of action next year.
Then, however, as Gregor Krützkamp stressed, will not be the home house in the heart of the Spargeldorf the place of the event.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also obvious because of the issue: finally, the milk will be around.
1: 4 against Frankfurt: Hannover with fourth season-pleite: "Fucked-up situation"
Frankfurt / Main After the fourth defeat of the Bundesliga, trainer André Breitenriiter gathered his disappointed professionals of Hannover 96 and spoke to them with courage.
However, there was not much positive before at 1: 4 (0: 2) of the last table at the entry Frankfurt.
"It's a fucking situation, but you have to get out of it as a team," said 96 football professional Pirmin Schwegler and said, "This is of course disappointing, because you're always doing a lot."
The further victorious Niedersachsen, for which only Florent Muslija (86.) joined, are with two counters at the bottom and are in their current constitution a descent candidate.

Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45. + 1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59.) and Luka Jovic (89.) achieved the gates for the DFB-Cup winner before 46.300 viewers, who went forward with seven points in the middle of the table after the successful trial for the Europe League game against Lazio Rome.
Croatia's vice-world champion Rebic was involved in his start-up debut almost every dangerous offensive of the Hessen and never to get caught by Hannover's defense.
The storms that had long been hit after the World Cup showed with its speed and enforceability why it is so valuable for the entry.
In addition to Rebic, the Brazilian Allan, borrowed by Liverpool, was the first time in the first formation of the Frankfurter, which began to become vibrant.
A headball of Lucas Torró (17.), falsified to the torrent network, was the first time in danger.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped in an exquisite position at the last moment from the 96 defense around the Brazilian Felipe, who replaced Kevin Wimmer (back) in the short term.
The leadership for households fell almost necessarily and completely deserved.
Filip Kostic lifted the ball after a rifled corner in the stray room, Haller extended by head in front of the gate, where Ndicka only had to hold his foot.
It was the first Bundesligatreffer for the defendant who arrived in the summer by the French Second Liga AJ Auxerre.
And Frankfurt left before the break.
This time, Haller mattered his storm partner Rebic, who was able to tank and left 96-torwart Michael Esser no chance.
In the half-time Hannover-Coach Breitenriiter responded to the weak idea of his eleven and brought two new offensive forces in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt.
The Lower Saxony now played a little more courageous forward, but burning ideas remained short before the end of the match.
The Hessen were much more efficient there.
After a short hour Rebic started a solo and then laid across De Guzmán, who had only to push the ball into the empty gate.
The rest was only for the Frankfurter against exaggerated guests, even Jovic met one minute before the end.
The Morlaixplatz becomes a party mile
In spite of cool temperatures, there was a good mood at the octoberfest in the city centre.
The Münchener Oberbürgermeister Dieter Reiter made it before millions of audience at the opening of the 185.
Münchener Wies' n last week with two beats.
Geisingen: Geisinger Christians celebrate Holy Cross Festival
The Geisinger Catholics celebrate the Holy Cross Festival on September 14th or Sunday thereafter.
The Festgottesdienst takes place in the city church, then is a procession to the Holy Cross Church with the final blessing.
The Holy Cross Church hosts the shot Christ, who comes from the thirty-year-old war and on whom the legend should have shot a Swedish soldier.
Then blood flushed out of the gunshot wound.
From this a great pilgrimage developed to the shot Christ, which then also led to the construction of the Holy Cross Church.
This is not finished until now, only the altar room stands, the missing langhouse is indicated by the trees.
In his preaching, Reverend Adolf Buhl recalls that the cross is a sign of hope, comfort and life.
In spite of the importance for the Geisinger parish, the service was badly visited.
After the service of God, the procession to the Holy Cross Church took place and with the final blessing the Church ended the part of the Cross.
For many years, the Catholic Churches have been inviting to the Catholic parish for the worldly part of the festival.
The choir members provided visitors with hearty food as well as a large selection of cakes and weather adapted, farm feeds.
In the afternoon, the parish community offered tours around the city church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed visitors on behalf of the parish community about the damage to facade, roof, sandstone works and windows as well as the upcoming construction measures that will continue to take place until next year.
After some time, the damage could be found more precisely and the individual invitations to tender more specifically were prepared.
It is certain that renovation will be more expensive than planned, because the damage already occurring a few years ago has become greater, but more has also been found to what was only possible by the inauguration by scaffolding.
The sockle cleaning work is completed, before the winter will be started with the natural stone work and one hopes to be able to finish nearly half of this work this year.
Inauguration: New residence in the New Ulmer Münsterblickstraße
Donau-Iller's lifelong help opens a new home for people with disabilities in the Münsterblickstraße.
The fact that "a very special house" will now be handed over in the Munich Eye Road - at the inauguration date, all of those present were agreed.
Finally, the twelve wheelchair drivers who have been living in the residence of Donau-Iller for some time have been dependent on the special architecture of the new building.
Wider corridors, corridors and doors, larger spaces and barrier-free access for all areas have taken account of architect Rudolf Bader in his concept.
The first plans began about eight years ago, when the former U.S. Army officer's building was placed on the test stand for the residents with Handycap: "The house had come into the years and no longer in time in the equipment," said Bader backward.
In 2016, the excavators started to tear the house off.
The new construction should be as friendly and bright as possible so that the residents can feel comfortable in it, according to the architect.
Life aid Danube-Iller opens new residential home
About 4.6 million euros invested lifelong support in new construction.
The free state went to 2.4 million euros, the district of Schwaben 450000 euros.
According to architect Bader, the construction works have remained within the planned framework - timely and financial.
He also thanked the managing director of life aid, Jürgen Heinz.
The spagate between a barrier-free and at the same time fireproof construction had not always been easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many requirements that allows residents to experience the freedom to move without any other help.
Similarly, the head of the social administration of the district of Schwaben, Gertrud Kreutmayer, said: "The house is based on the special needs of its residents who need help to be mobile."
Kreutmayer said that housing and functionality had been well combined.
And then, "The property in this situation is a real happiness case, because it is no longer available in today's situation."
Overall, the new residence in the Münsterblickstraße offers room for almost 1500 square meters for 30 people with disabilities, divided into three residential groups.
Stolz is life aid manager Heinz on the eleven full-time workers all employed by tariff.
Germany: Swedish complains of differences between East and West
Berlin - Before the day of unity, the Deputy SPD-Federal Chairman Manuela Schwesig has appealed to all countrymen not to deal with the disadvantage of East German.
There are differences that hurt after almost 30 years of unity.
With these differences we must not be satisfied, "the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern said to the" daily mirror on Sunday. "
The aim must remain to create equal living conditions throughout the country.
It is unacceptable that East German work on average longer than the people in West Germany, but 15 percent less pay.
"I can't explain that to anyone almost 30 years after the German unit," said Schwesig.
North Korea: Does this pussy dog end the Korean Conflict?
The one-year-old Pungsan hunting dog should slide the walls between the two Koreas.
In striving for a relaxation of relations with Seoul, Pjöngjang has made the South Korean President Moon Jae a gift in two North Korean Pungsan hunting dogs.
As Moon's office announced on Sunday, the two about a year old dogs reached their recipient on Thursday.
They then passed the border site Panmunjom together with three kilograms of dog feed to facilitate the "accustoming."
The dogs with the thick white fur, spicy ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They are part of the national cultural property of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
At the third summit this year between Moon and the North Korean mayor Kim Jong Un in Pjöngjang, the North had announced the gift of friendship in the middle of September.
Both countries also agreed to join international sports competitions such as the Olympic Games 2020 and to join together for the launch of the Olympic Games in 2032.
In addition, Kim agreed to close the Tongchang Ri test plant for rocket engines.
Austria moved history in the mirror of 99 documents
What is Austria?
The 100-year anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated for almost ten months in this year of remembrance, has shown numerous new books that usually answer this question in view of the last hundred years.
It is quite different from Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and Director General of the Austrian State Archives, in the magnificent "Picture Book" Austria, which will appear on October 1.
New week, new opportunity for the government
Return to work - this is the unofficial motto for the working week of the Great Coalition which begins today.
It is hardly an interview, hardly a speech in which the Chancellor and her ministers from CDU, SPD and also from the CSU have recently not mannered the "return to work."
This may have led some craftsmen, doctors, cashiers and otherwise employed citizens in this country to the legitimate question, which is actually the difference between work and work, but be it.
If the federal government is ready to dedicate itself again - to govern - then it should not be prevented by defining debates now.
Whether the Union and the SPD, after the provocation and harassment of recent weeks, can actually bring something together, it may already show Monday.
In the evening, the leaders of the Governments will meet the Coalition Committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel wants to call this round regularly to resolve conflicts early; a lesson from all the dispute.
But first of all, with the diesel refurbishment and the law on immigration, conflicting issues are again on the agenda.
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants to let the car companies get away with exchange premiums, SPD and CDU see the manufacturers in the obligation to refurbishment of older diesel technology.
While there has been a convergence in the diesel crisis over the weekend, the Union and SPD are still far from each other in the planned migration law.
The SPD calls for a lead restriction for denied asylum seekers who work or train.
The Union is strictly opposed to the "trace change" from the asylum system to the labour market.
So there will be a fight again among the coalition partners - and how should it be different?
Not just like and equal has joined the GroKo, but three partners with some very different social images and priorities.
It's a good fight.
Without a dispute, a society that is so diverse, sometimes contradictory, does not move forward.
However, in order to be constructive, disputes must not again be raised on the question of being or not being for party-political reasons.
It's still politics, not theatre.
Union and SPD should fight - but always have the real life of people in mind.
What is feasible and benefits many?
This key question allows both the diesel and the track change question to be clarified pragmatically and thus recovered confidence.
This is particularly why the People's Party must fight now.
Mushroom checks working hours at Hartinger
Minister in the Visier
Does the Minister of Labour violate the applicable right of service?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look at this.
"Really day and night" her legions had worked on the social insurance reform, a overwhelming social minister reported on the presentation himself two weeks ago.
In the case of list-fungi-Mandatarin Daniela Holzinger, the statement by Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ) is astonishing - she now brings the matter to Parliament via inquiry.
She assumes "that the Minister only wanted to express her enthusiasm about the deployment of her team and in no case to announce violations of the applicable law of service in front of current cameras."
Nevertheless, she now has questions to be able to "dismiss any suspicion."
Police are picking up a street in search of female corpse
Marxgreen - Long time the police didn't want to say anything about it.
Now there's a confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning, the state road between Naila and Bad Steben has been buried.
The route is still locked in the area of Marxgreen until Monday.
Previously, the investigators had used an archaeology dog.
The dog specially trained for the smell of old human cubes could finally limit the relevant place to a few meters, along with his guide.
In addition, a soil anomaly was discovered together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Supreme Bavarian Denkmalschutzbehörde in the area of the street.
For more than a year now, the prosecutor and the police have been working on the missing case.
Always again, Marxgrün was locked up with a cycling road and examined with sonar devices, because investigators suspect that in the course of the new construction of the state road 30 years ago Heike's body could have been hardened.
Colour powder and eggs: crawls in Barcelona before Catalonia anniversary
On Monday, the contested referendum on independence in Catalonia will be the first time.
But before that, it's crawling.
Separatists have not forgotten the autumn 2017 police operation.
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan Independence referendum of 1 October 2017, there have been collisions between separatists and police in the centre of Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked by Independence supporters, among other things with colour powder, when they wanted to prevent them from approaching a demonstration by the National Police and the Civil Guard.
About 3000 police officers from Policía Nacional and Guardia Civilian wanted to honour their colleagues who were employed last year in the referendum classified as illegal in the electoral premises.
In attempting to prevent citizens from voting, violence had also occurred at that time.
The Catalan police had formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of separatists and central security forces separate, reported Spanish media.
Some of the around 6000 separatists would then have tried to break the police chain by force, and the officials would have thrown paint bags and eggs, among other things.
Six persons had been arrested, 24 more were slightly injured, it was called upon by the authorities.
On Monday, for the first time, the referendum on independence will begin.
Following the vote and a subsequent decision to dismantle the prosperous region of Spain, the central government in Madrid had put Catalonia under forced control in the autumn of 2017.
The former regional president Carles Puigdemont fled to Belgium in exile.
Other politicians also went abroad.
Several ministers of the then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement are still in U-detention.
In December, new elections had been held in the region.
After the entry into force of the new Catalan government in May, the compulsory administration was terminated.
But the new regional president Quim Torra also insists on the "right to self-determination" of the Catalans.
Football: Oberliga Westfalen: Collected countless: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen separate torless
Red-white asses continue to step in the spot.

The final light and the third last they unfolded in front of 438 spectators in the Heidewaldstadion as gathered counsellessness.
The first half was angry about the entertainment factor.
Therefore, if you'd rather get a beer or a bratwurst, you could do this without any concern.
There was no danger of missing a chance, because there was practically none.
First shot after half an hour
Responsible for the first (harmless) bullet of the entire party took Nick Flock's freight slohs in 28 minutes.
The best - and in principle the only real - possibility had the Ahlener, when Cihan Yilmaz FCG-Torwart Frederic Westergerling forced after 32 minutes with a shot from the streamline to a parade.
Even less harmless were the hosts.
Their most effective action was in an early change.
Stürmer Lars Schröder had to be exchanged due to injury, for him Sinan Aygün came.
After the change, both teams decided to do something against the increasingly emerging boredom.
In the 48th minute Sebastian Mützel, from 18 meters close to the housing, and after an hour, the goods slopes also appeared offensively for the first time.
After a balleroeuvre of Matthäus Wieckowicz it was fixed.
The quickly presented account about Sinan Aygün "crowned" Nick Flock (62.) with a sharp shot in the arms of RWA-Torwart Bernd Schipmann.
In addition, they played with a head ball by Wieckowicz (66.) after a corner ball by ex-Ahlener Tim Manstein.
RWA interim trainer Angelo Daut responded, first brought Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60th) and later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70th).
It didn't do anything.
More than optical superiority thanks to its own initiative, the Ahlener did not create.
Only in the 91st minute Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance, but they didn't bring in anything.
Angelo Daut attempted to delete the positive: "I like the fact that we played to zero." But unfortunately the zero had also stood in front.
"This time, we were not as dangerous as we were against wooden wrecks and although our opponent had no desire to play with us," RW Ahlens interim trainer confirmed.
Apparently, "everything plotted a little" against a team, "which just wanted to defend.
In any case, I didn't feel like we could get a counterpart, "said Daut.
As an audience, however, one had not the feeling that his team could shoot a gate.
The idea was too poor for that.
Reckenfelder Erntedankmarkt: Fortunately there are enough creamers
This is a pleasure for Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfeld Table Extension Station for which these donations are intended.
The honorary officers assure: "These donations remain in Reckenfeld."
To open up, the sky was shining blue, but the place was still a little empty, but it should change in the course of the day.
For: "It's so nice here, so we're here today," said a visitor.
The organizer of the festival Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed the guests in the Kiepenkerl outfit as always with a proper prize humor.
For the Brockmann couple, which should actually be balanced against food, Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer entered in the short term.
The Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has become ill.
But there are plenty of creams.
And the "replacement" could not be taken to entertain the ever-increasing visitors musically in the meantime.
This happened so well that some folk songs were singing with us at the later hour.
"Just great," Marcel Kreimer was happy.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to place the opening date this time in his schedule.
He is delighted with the many activities with their staves, including mostly associations.
"Actually, there shouldn't be anything like a board," he thanked himself for the action of the male chores.
Andreas Hajek praised the deployment of all those who were in use at the stands and also included the other festivals held in September and the "Clean Up" action.
Our garden town gives itself a colorful stroke - here's something going on.
Then the Maikranz was taken from Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück with the help of the fire department and taken to the winter quarter.
Many staircases were worked for the physical well-being.
From sweet to heartful was to have everything.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has only lived in Reckenfeld for a year, became creative at his decupiersage.
Furnier works, beer cover with rectangular motifs and some more he had on offer.
A specialty offered three Reckenfelder Imker: "Reckenfelder Honig," brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschschlüter.
The latter has a specialty with it.
Honey cake in the glass, of course with honey from my own production.
The little Elsa had to touch again and again, so good tasted the cake.
The sensitivity is it that the visitors left long until evening hours, even without stage program that there is not at the autumn party.
Lubricants with local political embassy: No successful advertising for skateware
In Lengerich, unfamiliar people have advertised in hardly any beneficial way for the construction of a skateway.
In several places there are corresponding lubricants, says Jürgen Kohne from the city administration on request of the WN.
At least one case has been brought to the police for damages.
In large letters, the three words "Skatepark for Lengerich!" are printed on signs, among other things at the Gempt Hall and at the Old Town Hall.
Michael Rottmann, the manager of the hall, reports that a corresponding letter on the advertisement at the stairway to the Gempt-Bistro had been discovered already after the professional election fair on September 19.
Since the short message was apparently "only" left with a edding at that time, it could have been removed without any difficulty.
"A few days later, it was then there again, sprayed this time," said Rottmann.
He assumes that the corresponding advertisement must be replaced.
A special note just gets this case by calling on the board several large companies from Lengerich.
If the skate system is built, its implementation is also made possible by sponsors.
There are already promises, explaining Jörg Hesselmann from the city department school, sport and culture, without naming names.
Well possible, however, that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that are on the muddy table.
For years, local policy and administration have been dealing with the subject of skatebuilding.
After the old had been demolished at the LWL clinic, after some time the search for an alternative location began.
Finally, the Council voted a majority in favour of the fire park.
However, this sense was not implemented - too many factors apparently spoke against a construction at this point.
At the end of June, a turn was followed.
The members of the Main and Financial Committee now voted unanimously for the area of the Gutenberg School.
Jürgen Kohne says about the state of things that the administration is currently in the middle of the concrete planning.
The last word is the council.
It assumes a decision this year, so that a positive vote could be built in 2019.
Deficiency in flight control is getting worse
Frankfurt / Hamburg After the European air traffic chaos in summer the German air traffic controllers see no signs of improvement next year.
"This year we had wind, 2019 we will have strong wind and then the storm comes," said the chief of the aviation security union, Matthias Maas, the German press agency before the aviation summit on October 5th in Hamburg.
An important reason for the numerous delays and flight failures has been the long-known need for European aviation security personnel for which there is no quick solution.
"Airlines and airports can make rapid improvements for the next year, but the training of new lotses lasts four to five years," said the trade unionist.
In Europe, the market for finished-trained lotses was emptied.
Only in the centre of Karlsruhe to monitor the upper German airspace lacked about a hundred people.
Maas once again criticised the fact that various aviation trade unions were not invited to the summit.
On Friday in Hanseatic City, representatives of the federal, national, air traffic control, airlines and airports meet to address the causes of delays.
"If you want to talk about additional work density and overtime, this will not go without us," said the head of the GdF, who has many members in the Federal German air traffic control.
Maas reiterated the EU Commission's responsibility for the Lotsen Misere.
Transport forecasts for the regulatory period running by 2019 were far too low.
The resulting costs and staff savings in national aviation security are now fully linked to the operational business.
Maas appealed to Federal Minister for Transport Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to take action in Brussels for regulations that "do not cut the air even further."
At present, EU standards would be harmonised by 2024 and further reinforcements would be feared.
The EU is under constant lobby pressure from airlines.
"The airport manager Michael O'Leary and his colleagues have now harvested exactly what they have sown themselves in recent years," said Maas.
He hoped that the high delays of air carriers would lead to a rethinking.
The GdF will only contribute to the improvement of the situation if German Air Safety (DFS) offers a "unanimous training and future pact," said Maas.
The previously announced recording of 120 lottery students annually over the next five years is just enough to compensate for age-related departures.
The necessary staff construction is not yet connected.
Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board votes for group conversion
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board voted unanimously in favour of the Group's restructuring plans.
According to the will of Thyssenkrupp Interim Chief Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed Chairman of the Board of Directors at the meeting on Sunday, the crisis group is to be divided into two independent societies.
Both companies should have their headquarters in Essen and be listed on the stock exchange.
There should be no additional reduction in staff beyond the already known reductions in the administration.
After two resignation, the control body on the capital side has only eight heads.
There are ten representatives of the employees.
However, the final decision is expected to take a general meeting in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG will include the 50% share of the merged steel business with the Indian partner Tata.
In the second company Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG, the business is to be bundled with elevators and supplies.
Barcelona: Violence in the dementia of police and Catalan independence advocates.
Two simultaneous demonstrations by Spanish policemen and Catalan Independence Protestants in Barcelona have led to violent conflicts with numerous injured persons.
According to the city administration, about 3000 police officers from all over Spain gathered on Saturday, as well as around 6000 independent supporters demonstrated.
The Catalan police tried with a great offer to keep the two protests away from each other.
According to the forces, however, independent supporters repeatedly tried to break the security barrier.
They would have attacked the officers with color and throat shot.
According to the data, there were also riots between the participants of the various protest trains.
According to rescue personnel, 24 people were injured.
The police told us there were six arrests.
Better salaries and appreciation of colleagues
With their demonstration the police had wanted to pay tribute to the colleagues who had done almost exactly a year ago against the referendum on the independence prohibited by the Spanish central government in Catalonia.
At the same time, they demanded better salaries.
People of the Spanish police and Guardia Civil feel it is unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers deserve much more than they do.
The demonstrators felt it was a provocation that the Spanish police were demonstrating in Barcelona.
"Why did they come here to protest?" asked the 55-year-old Catalan demonstrant Manel Perez of the news agency AFP.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they drowned us a year ago.
A 31-year-old police officer from the Balearic Islands, who only wanted to mention his name with Daniel, rejected the accusation.
"Of course we want to support our comrades who did their duty last year: defend the law," he said.
But the demonstration is in favour of enforcing our rights and we do it in Barcelona because this is a great European city and there is more echo here.
But he and his colleagues had "not come to provoke," the policeman assured.
Panne allowed access to personal data British Minister
A security gap in a cell phone app has led to the personal data of Ministers and Members of the Conservative British Tory Party being temporarily accessible to anyone on Saturday.
According to British media reports, several ministers received calls from unknown people after the Panne became known a day before the Tory Party Day in Birmingham.

Football: Juve coach praises after top party: Ronaldos best game
The Portuguese star storm "played the best game this evening together with the half hour of Valencia," Juve Coach Massimiliano Allegri praised after the record champion's 3: 1 victory against the SSC Naples.
For the coach the expensive star was also the decisive man in the important game against the persecutor without his own gate.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and was doing well," said Allegri.
Even though we started with tactical errors, Ronaldo was very good at our first gate - and from the moment we grew.
Thanks to the three goals of Ronaldo, Juve drew the game after the early restraint due to the hit of Dries Mertens (10 minutes) and hanged the poorest tracker first.
The Torjager, assisted by Real Madrid, first placed Mario Mandzukic's former Federal League professional, who took over a double pack (26 / 49).
And Ronaldo also did the preliminary work for the meeting of Chief of Defense Leonardo Bonucci (76.), who had only to push in shortly before the tower line.
"He gives many templates," praised the coach.
However, Allegri also wants to see gates from the attacker, who is both in the Champions League and in the Portuguese national team of the record-shooter.
"We need to get even better in serving him," the coach called for.
The best Juve Torshot is currently Mandzukic with four meetings - Ronaldo has three on the account.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than 100 million euros, Juventus's overpower seems to be even more suppressive.
Seven victories in seven games are the makelessly series in the series A. At 21 points the master of the last seven years already has six counters advance on Naples.
The table range trained by former Bayer-Coach Carlo Ancelotti was not unlikely against Turin.
But at the latest after the reference of the already warned Mario Rui (58.) the top party was decided.
The Portuguese had to step too hard against Paulo Dybala with yellow red from the square.
"We played well against a good Naples," the Turiner Coach commented.
They also allowed Emre Can to feel.

The middle field player also played in the Champions- League against Valencia, which Allegri said with the "half hour" Ronaldo had flew from the square at the 2: 0 victory of the Turiner and is blocked for the home game on Tuesday against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West changes his name
With a particularly scary performance, Rapper Kanye West has given attention to the US TV show "Saturday Night Live" on the weekend.
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump provided a mineral water costume for starring and questioning among the spectators.
In addition, the 41-year-old announced a name change on time to publish his new album.
From now on, you can only call him "Ye," says the musician.
"The being known earlier as Kanye West," he twittered in line with the deceased singer Prince, when he renamed his artist's name.
However, the pseudonym is not a news.
Already the 10th album appeared under that name.
In an interview with the radiosender KRRL, the artist had explained that "Ye" has a religious significance for him.
"I believe" Ye "is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there it means" you, "says the rapper.
Soccer: Circular A1 Münster: Finally!
Got it!
Hoetmar's trainer Averhage did not make a hero from his disappointment.
This was a weak game of ours today.
The opponent was simply more griffy, we have put him almost never before problems. "As a result, the list of Hoetmarer's possibilities for shots reads thin.
Grade two torches in 90 minutes, so it is rarely possible to make games positive.
Football circular A1: SC Hoetmar is subject to SG Sendenhorst with 0: 2 (0: 1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
The SG also had only two possibilities in the first passage, but the first Maik Krause used from a spicy angle for early leadership (7.).
In the 43rd minute Steffen could have increased Uphus, but after great preliminary work by Krause he freely turned.
The hosts had only a double opportunity when Moritz Höne first failed to Torsteher Jos Schuhmacher and in the aftershooting Jan Blome also found his master in the Sendenhorster Keeper.
After the break the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good opportunities.
But Uphus (49.), Julian Turl (61.) and Heinz Linnemann (69.) all forgave.
A handheld meter - Louis Kortenjann had saved with the hand on the tower line and saw red for it - also Niklas Eilmann could not use for guests (75.).
Only when Nils Berheide stepped the ball over the line was the party decided (81st).
"We had criticized ourselves hard before, which was then different today than in recent weeks," said Florian Kraus's conclusion.
Sendenhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77. Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90th Leibig), Turl.
Gate: 0: 1 Krause (7.), 0: 2 Berheide (81.).

Football: Circular A2 Münster: Spectacle Football in Albachten: GW Albersloh is covered by Concordia with 3: 4
"I don't know what to think about it," he rang for words.
"We didn't get access to them at all." With that he probably meant the winging song with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but also all the other green white people who perform with collective openness.
He could still laugh: "A dirty victory," he still said, wink freak and pulled from his players, on the other hand, the relief was noticed that they had withdrawn with three points from the affair.
Recognized, after a duel of two teams, one of which, namely Albachten, is playing the championship and the other, Albersloh, is fighting for class content.
With understandably mixed feelings, GWA coach Sven Lewandowski looked back at the 90 minutes behind him.
"That was our best season performance at a distance," he says.
"How we come back after the 0: 2, how we keep against one of the top teams of the league over the whole game time, that was quite phenomenal."
The bitter it seems that you now have to go home with empty hands.
Top-Torjager Lars Zymner led the hosts with his 12th season meeting (24.).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this gate.
The 2: 0 he placed on the left side with patterns valid for Fabian Frohning (39.).
We knew that, but you can't take a player like that out completely.
"This was already madness what he did," Lewandowski acknowledged the quality of the opponent.
Shortly before the side change, his own eleven managed to compensate: McGills Freistoß from the left sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia-Torhüter Hinkerohe through to the long Toreck (45.).
After the page change, it was again McGill who made the compensation (59.).
After that, it went back and forth.
It was a crazy, action-loaded game.
Nübel shocked Albachten again (64.), only five minutes later as Patrick Horstmann (69.).
In spite of the large number, Albersloh failed to return to the last Concordia hit (80th).
We must now focus our full focus on Wednesday.
"The game against shepherds, that's what we have to win now," said Lewandowski.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87. Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87. Bareksai).
Tore: 1: 0 Zymner (24.), 2: 0 Frohning (39.), 2: 1 McGill (45.), 2: 2 McGill (59.), 3: 2 Nübel (64.), 3: 3 P. Horstmann (69.), 4: 3 Jülkenbeck (80.).
Yellow red: Atalan (74. / Albachten).
Football: TSV Straßberg fights point against Primus
There was no winner in the Landesliga-Duell between the TSV Straßberg and the FV Biberach.

Media: Total Bureau of Dynamo Dresden withdrew
According to media reports, the entire Bureau of Football Second Liga Dynamo Dresden has resigned.
Several media responded in the evening to a joint letter from the Saxony Board.
The association was initially not confirmed.
The reason for the withdrawal should be internal power struggles at the former Federal Ligist.
Erdogan in Germany: Politics instead of Pomp
I'm glad he's gone again.
There are only a few state guests whose departure in Germany provides as much relief as those of Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Three days the Turkish President was a guest in Berlin and Cologne, and many had meant that he should not have been invited at all.
Evangelical Academy Tutzing: Prominent guests and new offers
The Evangelical Academy Tutzing offers about 80 meetings until the middle of next year.
That is why France's President, Emmanuel Macron, has signalled that he wants to pick up the tolerance price personally in Tutzing.
For Christian Wulff, the term of office was too short: as President of the Federal Republic, he was not in Tutzings Evangelical Academy.
But before and after, Wulff was there as a guest.
This is how academic director Udo Hahn calculated him when he was proud to say, "All the Federal Presidents and Chancellors were already with us." That at the Academy in the castle of Tutzing was always prominent, but it was also a topic in the presentation of the annual programme.
At the end of October, Liedermacher Konstantin Wecker participates in a meeting on spiritual experience in philosophical perspectives, on 29 September the writer Frido Mann is at a meeting on his grandfather Thomas Mann.
Meanwhile, France's President, Emmanuel Macron, has also pledged that he personally wants to receive the "tolerance prize" awarded to him by the Academy in Tutzing, which also receives television moderator Dunja Hayali in another category (we reported).
The approximately 80 meetings by mid-2019 have it in themselves.
"The pension is not safe!" says a meeting title.
"SOS at Europe's borders" - the academy describes the "risky and deadly route over the Mediterranean."
"And to a meeting on Syria:" Barbary without limit. "
Weapons, destruction, torture, death - war raises every human idea. "
From structural racism in society through the scissors between the arm and the realm to the radical change of work through digitalisation, the spectrum is sufficient.
Academy Director Hahn convinced himself: "Free democracy needs places where a civil society can come together to find solutions or at least to find solutions."
At a meeting of 200.
Karl Marx's birthday is about to expect one more visitor of the direction of capitalism criticism, the others rather a trend "from left to middle."
What about neutrality?
"We are 100 percent a daughter of the Evangelical Landskirche," said Professor Dr. Ulrike Haerendel, "so we are not 100 percent neutral."
Musikabarett: Gender understanding with heart - Wolbeck - Westphalian News
"Suitable for both adults and men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday night in the Chamber of the Christuskirche in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret stone, devils prevailed not only with humor and heart warmth for the (felt) woman and the (felt) man and what else there may be, but also with music.
The mini guitar put her in and also mastered her violin.
Ben was sitting on the wings.
One of the male sparring partners, who sometimes comes to words until the end of the sentence, is a true pianist: so congenially harmoniously accompany the divine sweater that some may have wanted a solo.
There was, too, with Beethoven and Chopin, but different, namely, as it matched the red thread of the evening.
Devils had played a paradox: the satisfaction of the man comes when he has a partner but does not open the door.
A closed door without a partner does not do any good.
The piano solo now demonstrates itself: what would have come from composing Mozart, would "the Nannerl" have unhoped to open the door?
So sweeteners slide over in improvisations, from Bach's "O Head full of blood and wounds" into the "Song of Death," and from Mozart g-Moll Symphony into a played dance.
There was a great applause and "Bravo" from the full hall.

But the chairman of Heidemarie Markenbeck was not allowed to take an additional thank you.
She had the idea of benefiting the duo in addition to performances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt also in Wolbeck.

Handball: Ladies-Landesliga: Ahlener SG keeps the white vest against TV Wattenscheid
The Ahlenerinnen had problems with Carolin Stallmann, who only marked ten hits.
"Actually, I was well satisfied with the defense, only one player has made too many gates.
We didn't get them under control, "said ASG Coach Dogan Aydogdu.
But he was more upset about the many outlawed odds.
The concentration in the graduation left his team missing this time.
Therefore, the ASG ran almost to the end behind a restraint, lay at the break at 11: 12 and later at 15: 18 (45: 5) back.
Only at the end was the wider bank of the host women decisively noticed.
Aydogdu also placed Merle Klement on the left, which then made "extremely clever the decisive gates" (Aydogdu).

We worked her well.
Our opponent has taken a high risk, but also produced several tickets.
In the second sentence the BSV already led at 12: 8 "Food has switched the assumption to triangles.
We couldn't hold the impact pressure.
Food sucked up, and we got a little bit of an inch, "said Munch.
At 18: 17 the Volleyball women from the Ruhr area had the nose ahead for the first time.
Although the East Beavers withdrew four more set balls at 19: 24, the fifth attempt found his goal.

International: Turkish community: Mosque opening as a missed opportunity
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) has criticized the way in which the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan inaugurated the great Ditib mosque in Cologne.
"The Mosque opening in Cologne has left in the German-Turkish relationship a pile of scraps that can only be turned together hard," said the chairman of the TGD, Gökay Sofuoglu, the German editorial network.
Both the Turkish and the German side would have missed the chance of a common, reconciling appearance.
"Instead of emphasising the belonging of Muslims to Germany, Erdogan used the date for his purposes," said Sofuoglu.
The widespread exclusion of the German public has "strengthened many reservations."
Home Association Nottuln: Offer has already established
After the long summer break, Folktreff is finally back.
On October 18th (Thursday) at 7.30 p.m., the home club Nottuln already organises its fifth Nottulner Folktreff in the chamber of the Old Amtmannei.
Almost exactly on the day it is then a year ago that we did a folktreff for the first time.
In the meantime, this event has become an integral part of the musical event calendar in Nottuln, "Hanns Moormann, chairman of the Nottulner home association, is pleased.
I didn't think our Folktreff was going to stay in Nottuln so fast.
Whether stormdeep Friederike in January or heat wave in July, the chamber of the Amtmannei was always fully occupied.
"The program at the next Folktreff is, as always, a colorful mix of German folk songs, hiking songs and sailors, folksongs, Evergreens and old slayers," says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who always invites friends to Nottuln.
Klaus Spellmeyer pledged with his accordion for the first referendum "Birthday."
He was a member of "Gaitling," a group from the district of Steinfurt, who played music with German lyrics.
Now he's on his way with an Irish folk band.
Gladly, the makers of the Folk Reef recall the last event in the summer when Christoph Schulz from the Folktreff Emsdetten with his international version of the song "Frogs in the Night" enthusiased the listeners and sent home with an earworm.
"We expect many joyous guests to spend a cheerful and humorous evening again," says the invitation of the home association.

The Folktreff begins at 7: 30, but inlet is already at 7: 00.
China approves planned merger of Linde and Praxair
For legal reasons, all open questions must be resolved by 24 October.
FrankfurtLinde and Praxair are taking another step on the way to the world's largest industrial gas group.
The Chinese competition authority had approved the proposed merger, and Linde notified it on Sunday.

Finally, there had improved the chances of an insider's approval because Linde promised to sell additional parts of the company.
For legal reasons, all open questions must be resolved by 24 October to ensure that the merger succeeds.
From pure fruit production to ecology
With a gala in the Dr.-Stammberger-Halle, the 125-year-old existence of the Gardening and Landing Association was celebrated.
On September 29, 1893, with a fruit show at the Kulmbacher Vereinhaus, the last foundation impulse for the Kreisverband für Gartenbau und Landpflege Kulmbach was set, and exactly 125 years later he celebrated a great anniversary in the Kulmbacher City Hall on Saturday night.
At the time he was called another one: as the district building club Kulmbach City and Land, he was raised from Baptism by mayor Wilhelm Flessa in 1893.
The purpose of the fruit association was also different from today's work - it was actually about the fruit building, about flowers and gardening no one thought at that time.
"At that time, in the epoch of enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favorite child of the elites," said Kreisheimatpfleger Günter Dippold in his feast lecture.
Fruit trees should clean streets away, schools have built so-called industrial gardens.
The fruit construction is still the task of the 55 Gartenbauverbände in the district of Kulmbach, which comprise almost 7000 members.
But with this the spectrum is far from exhausted.
Natural gardening, biological plant protection, village beauty and nutrition play as much a role as providing knowledge, healthy nutrition and youth work.
How versatile the tasks of a garden building association are, the members of the Hutschdorfer youth group "Mole Thoughts" showed entertaining on the stage.
"Youth work is urgently needed especially in the digital age," said the circular chairman Günter Reif, and also OB Henry Schramm stressed the importance of natural experiences for life.
Castanian collection was a giant thing for us children, I doubt that you can gather a similar amount of joy with smartphone & Co..
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with Landrat Klaus Peter Söllner for the anniversary.
"Where they are to stand, the circle association decides," added the Landrat Söllner and highlighted the particular importance of the gardening associations for the villages.
The county association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green areas in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many gardenbauverbände in the county also left county managers and specialist consultant Friedhelm Haun no doubt.
He led the many visitors with a picture presentation through the long history of the circle and reported, among other things, the need for self-sufficiency after the war.
In the past, everything came out of the garden, for the winter it was fed in.
At the end of the 50s, however, the garden of use has turned into a garden of decorative and living.
"Nature has existed, it has already been there before us and we have to focus on it," the expert pleaded for fruit and nut trees.
Therefore, there is an incentive for the gardening associations not to leave behind so that our home remains beautiful and worthy of life.
The President of the Bavarian federation, Wolfram Vaitl, also welcomed the new citizens in our associations.
"We must stop the eclatant decline in insects, which we owe to our children and grandchildren," Günter Reif closed the successful Festakt, which was solemnly surrounded by the towers of the Thurnau Music Association.

Priority to Nafta talks: Canada's Foreign Minister moves UN speech
The Mexican government wants clarity on Nafta: they make both trading partners an ultimatum for an agreement.
Canada's Foreign Minister now gives absolute priority to the trade agreement - and postpones its speech to the United Nations.
Due to the time pressure at the ring for a new edition of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with the US and Mexico, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland has postponed her speech at the UN General Debate in New York.
Instead of today's Saturday, the Minister will not speak until Monday before the United Nations General Assembly, her spokesman Adam Austen informed.
In the meantime, she concentrates on the renegotiation of Nafta.
The Mexican Minister for Economic Affairs Ildefonso Guajardo said on Friday that Canada's negotiators and the United States would have 48 hours to agree if Canada actually wanted to join the trade agreement already concluded between Canada and the United States.
In August the US and Mexico agreed to revise the Nafta Regional Free Trade Agreement.
US President Donald Trump indicated that Canada could be excluded from Nafta in the future.
The conversations about a new edition have been running for over a year.
By Sunday evening (local time) they are now to be completed, Trump's government wants to present the agreement to the US Senate before 1 October.
In the event of a failure of the negotiations, Mexico's nominated President, Andres Manuel López Obrador, announced on Friday that he would endeavour to reach a bilateral agreement with Canada.

Protests against presidential candidates Bolsonaro
The Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, who was injured by a knife attack, left the hospital.
The right-wing ex-military wanted to fly to Río de Janeiro, where he lives, after a report from the "O Globo" newspaper.
After his dismissal, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will perform public performances last week before the presidential elections in the South American country.
The politician had been attacked on open road at the beginning of September during a campaign in South Brazil.
Meanwhile, thousands of people went on the streets in several Brazilian cities to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele não" (in German: "Der nicht"), women's associations had called for protests against the ex-military.
Also in social networks, associations made mobile statements against Bolsonaro's racist and feminist statements.
Several thousands of demonstrators were expected in the economic metropolis of São Paulo.
In the capital of Brasilia, the protests were mixed with a sound of the presidential candidates of the Brazilian Labour Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He was replaced by ex-President Inácio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to 12 years of imprisonment for corruption and is therefore not allowed to apply.
The presidential elections in Brazil are held on 7 October.
As ex-mayor of the Million City of São Paulo, Haddad has so far been far behind the right-wing candidate Bolsonaro.
The "Trump Brazil" has long been involved in the policy operation, but is recently presented as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates in the first round of elections reaches the absolute majority, there is a selection on 28 October.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not be successful from this - no matter who he is against.
Bolsonaro is known to fight homosexual and black people and glorify the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
He always shocks with verbal detractions.
Another time he said that the followers of Lula's left labour party should be shot.

After long illness: Danish rock legend died
The Danish rock icon Kim Larsen is dead.
The singer had died on Sunday at the age of 72 after long illness, announced his producer Jörn Jeppesen on Larsen's website.
Larsen had been surrounded by his wife and six children on the bed of death.
The musician had been treated for prostate cancer since the beginning of the year.
Larsen had become known with the band Gasolin ', which was extremely successful in Scandinavia in the 1970s.
Their songs were influenced by international music sizes such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
After the dissolution of the band in 1978, Larsen was successful as a solo artist.
He sold about three million plates in Denmark.
His "Midnight" album from 1983 is the most sold album in Denmark.
The Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen appreciated Larsen on Sunday in a statement as a "street boy," which "was against everything but in all hearts."
The Heads of Government also recalled that the Monarchy opponent Larsen had appeared in 2010 on the 70th birthday of the Danish Queen Margrethe II.
Rocknight in the shoe factory: volume at the air-conditioning level
"Here we stand, take the bone saws and light a concert with the power of a tiger." Alone the band names of "Here We Stand," "" Tiger Bonesaw, "and" The Ignition "lay such a rewrite of the rocky live music lifestyle on Saturday night near the room of the Citizens' Center Schuhfabrik: Hardrock purely from three other friends band.
After the sound check and shortly before the start of the concert, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
There's no sign of light fever.
After that, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and the surroundings - all in association with the Booking Agency "Mosquito" from Oelde - with their bands are very enthusiastic about 120 visitors to the "Mint Mosquito" rock night.
Already the "Tiger Bonesaw" quartet with front man and guitarist Dennis Hadrika is able to convince with the latest, unknown pieces of his own feathers and the CD that will soon appear.
In front of the stage, the band is danced to a harmonious and printing interplay.
Although "admission" calls are not to be overheard, then leave "Tiger Bonesaw" to the Trio "Here We Stand" stage.
The fact that Hardrock is not like Hardrock demonstrates guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich at the bass and drummer Kai Hölscher with their alternative, sometimes classical rock of the 1970s remembering sounds.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers," a synthesizer is used in addition to the guitar rock.
Not only is it the seamless, just as balladeous "Take Me Home" embraced by the change of melodic passages to the guitar-like rock riffs of the versatile songs.
The quartet "The Ignition" from Tönnishäschen has, however, been a special acquaintance since its foundation in 2005.
Full Agility, the band presents her Hardrock on Saturday.
The fact that "The Ignition" with its performances in front of a very great audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the tour in China of 2017 - has special stage experience is obvious and incomprehensible.
In conjunction with the band, singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann also puts his own accents on the only covered song of the evening, "Word Up" from Cameo from the 80s.
For the sound that is even higher than before, guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers a rejoiced solo, running through the audience.
A certain volume is, of course, part of such a Hardrock concert: The "Mint Mosquito" - Rocknight, according to the information of the mixpult team at the three-stage concert of "Here We Stand," "" Tiger Bonesaw "and" The Ignition "is about 98 decibel.
This is, for example, at the presslufthammer level, but is still clearly below the controls of the "Wacken-Fesitvals," which points to "The Ignition" on their website.
However, the Ahlener audience does not need an ear-numbering 120 decibel in the thickness of thieves as usual in the annual metal pitch thickness in the north of the Republic.
After just four hours, the three bands of the harder, rocky gangway have long convinced with their sovereign, virtuous game and their own compositions.
"Here we stand, have taken the bone saws and lit a concert with the power of a tiger," all three groups can say in the end, in the deliberate sense.
And especially enjoy the great applause of visitors.

A dead man in a sailplane accident at Essen / Mülheim Airport
There has been a fatal accident at Mülheim / Essen Airport.
On Sunday a sailing plane crashed in a parking lot at Mülheim / Essen Airport.
The pilot died in the accident.
Near Mülheim / Essen airport, a fatal accident occurred on Sunday.
As the Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung reported, a sailing plane had crashed at the Messeparkplatz at the airport.
The pilot was killed.
As the WAZ further reports, the aeroplane has been on board alone - the aeroplane is supposed to be a one-seat aeroplane.
The plane was already landed at the time of the accident.
The crash site is located only close to a festival on the airport site.
But there has been an October festival since this weekend.
Mülheim / Essen Airport is located at the city border of the two Ruhrgebietsstädte and directly on the highway 52.
From the parking lot there is a park & ride offer at large events at the Messe Essen or the Gruga Hall in Essen.
Trump heels to Kim: "And then we fell in love"
It is not a secret that the US President of North Korea's power, Kim, is well-healthy despite the nuclear crisis.
Now Trump has made his colleague a proper love statement.
She also has to do with Kim's "beautiful letters."
At the delicate age of 72, the married President of the United States has become a new flame.
The Tragic: It's a remote relationship.
In general, Donald Trump made an unusual love statement to the North Korean magician Kim Jong Un on Saturday.
In front of supporters in the U.S. state of West Virginia, Trump found almost all sorts of words for the half-old Spross of the Pjöngjang ruler, although in the ring around North Korea's atomic disarmament it proves to be quite thick breaks.
"I was hard, he too, and between us it went all the way," Trump reported.
And then we fell in love.
Okay?
No, really.
And not only the conversations with Kim would have made his heart melt.
He wrote me beautiful letters, they were great letters.
Their personal connection also had political fruits: Trump referred to the stopping of all nuclear and missile tests announced by Kim, even though critics see little more than lips to date behind them.
The fact that the affection for whether his martial threat-bearing "Rocket Man" - so Trump's nickname for Kim - should not be anyone, seemed to be quite aware of the President of the United States.
In any case, he took the criticism that was expected when he appeared in a large sports hall of the city of Wheeling in advance: "Donald Trump says they've fallen in love."
How terrible is that?
This is so unpresidential.
But he cares very little, said Trump, and then directed his finger to the crowd: "I have always told you that it is so easy to be presidential."
But then there wouldn't be 10,000 people out there pushing into this bold arena, but we would only have 200 people outside.
Octoberfest attracts many guests to Baesweiler
Baesweiler best visited, tuned and overspoiled by sun: Very varied and with a good shot of Oktoberfest flair Baesweiler's downtown cleaned out on Sunday.
For the first time the Oktoberfest took place not only in the festival at the firehouse tower, but was extended to the city by the trade association on Sunday.
Refugees saved by video from Libyan prison
Nigerian refugees have pointed out their catastrophic detention conditions in Libya by means of a mobile video, enabling them to be saved.
In July, the group drew the recording in its cell in the coastal city of Sawija under life risk and spread it online.
"They refuse to send us back," said a man in the videotape.
We suffer here, we die here.
The recording was sent to the website "France 24 Observers," whose editors alerted the International Organisation for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were finally fled to Nigeria at the end of August.
"Without the video we could probably not have returned to Nigeria," said Efe Onyeka, who had recorded the video, the news agency AFP.
The 25-year-old had been arrested in Libya in attempting to reach Europe through the Mediterranean.
With the video, he put himself in danger of life according to his own statement.
One of his fellow opponents was almost killed by the guards, said Onyeka.
In general, the detention conditions would have been catastrophic: "They beat us all with pipes and sticks."
They gave us nothing to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM organises the voluntary return of refugees stranded in Libya.
About 2,700 immigrants from Nigeria were sent back to their home this year with the help of the programme, said the IOM spokesman in the West African country, Jorge Galindo.
The case of the now rescued Nigerians is not extraordinary in view of the bad detention conditions in Libya.
But he hasn't heard of a phone call yet.
International organisations have long criticized the conditions of Libyan refugee camps as being unworthy of mankind.
The North African state, which is dominated by too large parts of militia, is the main transit country for migrants on the way from Africa to Europe.

German was caught in his own car for days
A 75-year-old has had to sharpen several days and nights in his car in a forest area in central France after he had stuck the car away from all the forest roads and a tree blocked the car door.
Rescue forces accidentally discovered the car on Saturday afternoon near a pasture and freed the missing since Tuesday night, the police informed on Sunday.
In spite of the cold nights and the long time without care, the 75-year-old from Pleinfeld was shown to be in good health condition.
He said he was looking forward to his home now.
The pensioner had been reported missing by his family after he had not returned on Tuesday from a ride with his trailer over the local meadows and fields.
In spite of intensive search measures, the man's stay had remained unclear for days.
Laschet encourages the rule of law in Turkey
Cologne NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) has called for the rule of law in Turkey in talks with the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
The relations of the two countries are currently "overshaded," said Laschet on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne Airport.
This was mainly about arresting waves, the freedom of the press and religion.
He has therefore made it clear to Erdogan that, if relations are to normalize in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, the rule of law is a very important prerequisite for this. "
Laschet also mentioned the cases of Germans who are in prison in Turkey, according to his own data.
He expressed the expectation that freedom of expression should be respected.
Erdogan then reiterated the independence of Turkish justice.
The conversation of Laschet and Erdogan had been moved to a building of the state defence ministry at Cologne Airport in the short term.
Originally it should have taken place at the castle of Wahn - that was what the castle owners had rejected from political conviction against Erdogan.
After the conversation, Erdogan continued to open the Ditib mosque in Cologne.
Laschet had canceled a joint appearance in the building.
He said, "The Muslims who enter this mosque are also citizens of our country."
And we are also their contact partners - not the Turkish President.
Lack of confidence in the US: North Korea demands disarmament
While US President Trump does not get tired of emphasising the success of the negotiations on the denuclearization of North Korea, the East Asian regime represents the conditions more sober.
Foreign Minister Ri is calling for Washington's meeting.
North Korea's Foreign Minister, Ri Yong Ho, accused the US Government of blocking negotiations for a nuclear-weapon-free Korean peninsula in the UN General Debate.
"The latest standstill is therefore that the US is based on forced measures that are deadly for confidence building," said Ri in New York.
A disarmament was unthinkable for North Korea under these circumstances.
"Without any confidence in the United States there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no way that we will be the first to disarm ourselves," the North Korean Chief Diplomat issued.
That sanctions could force North Korea on the "knees" is "a dream of people who don't know us."
In order to build confidence, however, his country stopped its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear test plant, Ri highlighted.
However, from the US side there had been no "corresponding responses," the Minister criticized.
For North Korea's nuclear and missile programme, the UN Security Council alone decided three times last year on sanctions against the internationally isolated country.
US President Donald Trump and his Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo have been pushing the United Nations for strict compliance with the criminal measures in recent days.
At the same time, the US government is working to bring it closer.
In June, Trump first met North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un.
After the first summit in Singapore, the US President strives for a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo will return to Pjöngjang to discuss the end of the North Korean nuclear weapons programme.
The HoT serves: New cuisine with donations from the community
That they were actually in a youth meeting, the many visitors of the house of the open door HoT didn't get anything with it: white blankets and flower muck on the tables and a big buffet waited for guests after the Erntedank service.
The youngsters of the HoT had the buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new kitchen.
The facility was funded by donations from the community, for which the young people wanted to thank themselves with the food.
The start with the new facility was not exactly easy, as Henriette Westbuer, the head of the HoT, remembers.
We had filled our refrigerators with food and ingredients before the summer break and were perfectly prepared for the big day.
But then the first day after the summer break came the evil surprise: a power failure had put off the huge two-part refrigerator, the food was spoiled and had to be disposed of.
"Now we had to start again: we have received a lot of support from friends and neighbours, but the children and adolescents wanted to make it alone," Westbuer said.
And that's how everyone took it.
The result could be seen, the guests were enthusiastic.
"Better it can't cook either," a visitor praised, while hokkaido pumpkin soup was served or guests were allowed to use quiche, liver cheese or cake.
"It is really great what the children and adolescents have put on their feet," Reverend Frank Beckmann stressed, while magicians Stephan lambs with cardboard tricks and other pieces of art gave astonishment.
Jürgen Sator leaves the National Board NRW of the Board
The head of the Essener Tafel, Jörg Sartor, has delivered his position in the federal federation from the frost of criticism from his own series.
Sartor had become known throughout the country because the Essener table had introduced a reception stop for foreigners.
He had already resigned as Vice Chief of the NRW tables in July, said Sartor of the "World on Sunday."
I've fallen too many in my back.
The head of the NRW board association, Wolfgang Weilerswist, expressed sympathy with the dpa for the decision of his long-standing deputy.
The sharp criticism took Sartor.
"I can understand his step - people who didn't know exactly why the dining table did this."
But Sartor is still active for the Essener table - "Six days a week, nothing changes," said Weilerswiser.
Sartor again criticized colleagues from other tables in the "World on Sunday."
One should not follow the approach, "without us, people in the city are starving."
It is the responsibility of the state to ensure that people did not starve.
The Essener did not attend a conference of tables on Friday in Berlin.
"Too much sweet mud is told to me," he said.
There are all these social fuzzis that criticized me so much at that time.

In the meantime, the Stuttgart garden had to be banished against the Werder Bremen, which was devoted to a yellow red card against Milos Veljkovic before the break.

Yann Sommer was powerless when he was shot 20 meters from the Aargauer, as was the second counter after an hour.
Nevertheless, the trends at Gladbach are quite devastating.
Alassane Pléa proves to be a goalgetter in the storm of the fools.

After half an hour, Hanno Behrens brought the home team on course with Foulpenalty.
Macedonians vote on new state names
In Macedonia today, about 1.8 million citizens vote on whether to change their country's name in northern Macedonia.
In the case of a yes, the almost three decades of whistling conflict with the neighbour of Greece could be resolved.
In Athens, due to his native province, there was a change of name and any approach to Macedonia to the West was blocked.
The voters therefore also decide on future Western integration.
The United States had announced that the country could quickly become NATO member if the referendum was to be a positive outcome.

SPD politician: John Kahrs marries his friend
Almost exactly a year after the marriage came into force for all, the SPD politician John Kahrs married his long-standing friend Christoph Rohde.
The two of them gave themselves the jaw word in Hamburg on Saturday.
A registered partnership of life had not been challenged for them, Kahrs had previously said the "picture" newspaper.
"If we get married, then right." He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is the budgetary spokesman of the SPD Bundestag and one of the spokesmen of the Seeheimer Circle, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of the marriage for homosexuals on 30 June 2017, Kahrs had raised an upset view.
So he had accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of being "folded" on the subject.
"This was your Schabowski moment," he said in a speeches on the accidental proclamation of the Günter Schabowski GDR border opening.
Since October 1, 2017, equal couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
They had previously been able to register their life partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, such as adoption law.
Garden day: 400 meters hook cut
There was a lot of work in front of the members of the Civil Society Kinderhaus and the Society for Leprakunde.
For about 400 meters of hectares around the gardens of the inhabitants of the Pfründner House should be cut.
Supported by the residents, it went to work for about twelve supporters.
"We do this to reduce costs," said the chairman of the civil association Walter Schröer.
And so many things have accumulated.
Because of the hot summer we're late this time, but lucky it's just a forming cut.
Because already in the spring, the hedge has been scored.
The breakfast always following the work has a long tradition as well.
Walter Schröer said, "I want all of them to remain with strength."
World Championship in Rio: Hannes Aigner picks up gold at the kanuslalom World Championship
The Augsburger Hannes Aigner won the gold medal in Rio de Janeiro to finish the Canuslalom World Championship.
On Sunday the 29-year-old took a perfect run on the Olympia route.
Two years ago, he missed Olympia bronze by three hundred seconds.
I was well prepared, had enough trips here on the plant and it all suited today, "said the London Olympia third in 2012.
In the goal he threw away his paddle from joy and stretched both arms safely to the height - well knowing that it would at least be enough for a medal.
After all, he had number four.
But the six remaining starters couldn't top his fabulous time of 89.69 seconds.
Second, the Czechoslovakia Jiri Prskavec in front of the Russians Pawel Eigel.
The police inspection Gauting indicates the first attempted break-in of this autumn into a single family house.
Fortunately, the perpetrators failed.
The days are getting shorter - that's what burglars want to make use of again.
So the police inspector Gauting mentioned yesterday the first attempt to break into this autumn.
The fact that it stayed at the single family house on the royal street is due to the alarm situation.
It started when the perpetrators put hands on Friday just before 8: 00.
The burglars knew that the residents were not home.
However, the alarm was so surprising that she took the escape without a bust.

Pleite at Hertha: Reality Requested: Bavaria Ajax Requested
The predication is unstrikable there: The defeat in Berlin wants to "not let the FC Bayern."
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first intermediary for Niko Kovac's term of office.
The first small performance models under the new coach Niko Kovac are not supposed to increase to the larger autumn depth for the Munich.
"A week ago they had the impression that we were invincible.
Now a bit of reality has come to us, "confirmed Thomas Müller after the earned 0: 2 defeat at Hertha BSC and called for a reaction to the Champions League Duell with Ajax Amsterdam.
Anyone who knows us knows that's really upsetting us and that's why we're giving gas to Tuesday.
For the first time since more than a year outside, no own gate has been shot, like at the same time in the preceding season two mandatory games in series without victory, the table leadership in the Football League for the first time lost to Borussia Dortmund.
Although the overall situation is not as dramatic as the final phase of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, the record master must be warned.
The FC Augsburg at 1: 1 with its loud-intense man-against-man tactics and the Berliner through their playful needle stitches over the outside delivered two bluepause within three days, as the last abundantly apparent Bavaria are to crack.
"Those who know FC Bayern know that we don't like this and we will do everything we can to succeed again," Kovac stressed.
Otherwise, however, he and his losers in his birthtown were surprisingly gentle, and his first defeat as Munich coach was only due to the once again inadequate handling of opportunities.
A victory against Amsterdam and against Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would still be the first intermediary of his term of office - otherwise the tone would probably be tightening up.
So Kovac did not take any extraordinary measures before the second class performance of this season after the 2: 0 at Benfica Lisbon.
After the day off on Sunday, the short preparation for the second round game against Ajax, which had also been superior to the start of AEK Athens with 3: 0, begins as planned.
"Now it caught us in two games, but we will also make our gates again," announced national crew captain Manuel Neuer.
As already after the lost pocal finals against Eintracht Frankfurt in the same place, Joshua Kimme spoke in particular clear text.
The legal defender played the role of Mahner.
"I don't think this is all bad luck, we also have to work it out again because we do not make the many chances and make the mistakes back," stressed the 23-year-old just before leaving the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh day of the previous season, the Bavaria were already with five counters behind Dortmund, which has now taken the top with a point of advance again.
And so Kimme was at least positive with an eye wink that now the public debate on the allegedly inviolable Bavaria has come to an end.
"Yes, that's good," said the national player.
It's good for the league.
DFB boss in gunline: Özil-Causa: sharp attack by Erdogan on Grindel
With serious accusations, the Turkish President Erdogan is pronouncing an exclusion of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany.
DFB President Grindel does see mistakes, but defends the association line.
Now a new post is to be created.
Berlin - Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought on different stages for the clarity of Mesut Özil in the long-term dispute issue.
After the Turkish President strongly criticized dealing with the former world champion in Germany to open the big Ditib mosque in Cologne, the DFB chief defended the association line.
On early Sunday morning, the Grindel attacked by Özil personally sharply in the Mainzer ZDF "Sports Studio" announced consequences from the Causa.
"In the future, because we also have many players with migration background in the subteams, we have to draw very precise conclusions that something like this is not repeated," said the 57-year-old and wants to win a national player without migration background as a further integration representative.
At the same time Grindel reiterated that Erdogan does not represent the values of football and DFB.
He had provoked racism against Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with sharp words.
Our born and raised in Germany Mesut Özil and our Ilkay.
They have excluded them from this society because they have taken pictures with me in England, "said Erdogan at the Court on Saturday.
Honestly, as their President, I could not waste the fact that our two young men who have gone up to the German national team were excluded.
Grindel referred to Gündogan's statement that, unlike Özil, it had felt "reasonably treated by the DFB" after the World Cup affair, which had begun by photographs of the two with Erdogan.
At the same time, he announced his intention to face players in the future.
That someone says, "If I win, I'm a German, if I lose, I'm a migrant - I can't."
"That he has such an impression, I very much regret," said Grindel.
We should have defended Mesut more, I always said.
But he does not see a basis for returning Özils to the national team either.
In addition to the born Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, who has family roots in Cameroon, it is now intended to call on an additional integration representative.
"If there is a person without a background of migration who has a strong influence on society and football and says:" The subject is important, we have to take care of it, "said Grindel, that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our associations on the ground where integration needs to work."
In spite of the criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özil affair, he wants to rejoin the office as DFB president next year.
"I do my work and try to make it as well as I can," said Grindel.
Years build three accidents within three hours
Coburg / Rödental - As the police report, the 75-year-old has caused accidents on Friday between 10: 00 and 13: 00.
First, the 75-year-old driver was addressed by a lady at the red light in the area of louder height.
This informed the pensioner that he had gone against her car.
However, there was no personal exchange since the 75-year-old woman could not find the lady in the parking lot.
A short time later, the police received a phone call from a car driver who would have gone off the street and run against a guide.
On that point, the man didn't want a police on the ground and then drove away.
After that, the Red Valley went home.
However, in his place of residence where he has lived for decades, the pensioner has handled a construction vehicle and has been damaged by turning.
Finally, the police could find him and stop him.
His car had marked accident damage.
The 75-year-old made a confusing impression and couldn't remember much more.
The damage is about 1300 euros.
Moorbrand in Meppen: still almost 1000 forces in use.
About four weeks after the outbreak of the Moorbrand on a federal defense site in the Emsland, 980 forces are still working on the eradication work.
That was announced by the Federal Defense on Sunday.
As the situation of a spokesman continues to evolve, 70 volunteers have recently been withdrawn.
It says that a further reduction in the number of forces is planned.
In the night to Sunday, an upper earthly fire had been discovered and erased.
Last week the disaster, which was announced a week earlier on 21 September, had been abolished because it was feared that the flame would endanger woods and settlements adjacent to wind and spark flights.
On Thursday, it was said that an attack on the fire on adjacent communities would no longer threaten.
In time, more than 1500 forces tried to control the big fire on site.
The Air Force continues to support the work on the German defense test site at Meppen with a transport helicopter.
There are also exploratory flights with drones of the Federal Defense.
According to the Federal Defense, for October 2nd and 5th there are also plans for reconciliation flights with "Tornados."
The fire had been triggered by test missiles that had fired Airbus engineers.
The Moorbrand's smoke fade was temporarily moved up to a hundred kilometres from the north-west of Germany to Bremen.
On Monday, the Federal Defense wants to set up a contact point that receives damages.
First claims for damages had already been announced by hotel owners and property owners.

Hamburg - Almost exactly a year after the marriage came into force for all, the SPD politician John Kahrs married his long-standing friend Christoph Rohde.
The two of them gave themselves the jaw word in Hamburg on Saturday.
A registered partnership of life had not been challenged for them, Kahrs had previously said the "picture" newspaper.
If we get married, it's right.
He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is the budgetary spokesman of the SPD Bundestag and one of the spokesmen of the Seeheimer Circle, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of the marriage for homosexuals on 30 June 2017, Kahrs had raised an upset view.
So he had accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of being "folded" on the subject.
"This was your Schabowski moment," he said in a speeches on the accidental proclamation of the Günter Schabowski GDR border opening.
Since October 1, 2017, equal couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
They had previously been able to register their life partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, such as adoption law.
Referendum in Macedonia on new state names started
In Macedonia, the referendum on a new name for this small Balkans country has begun with tension.
About 1.8 million voters should decide whether their state should be called North Macedonia in the future.
This is due to its native province of the neighbour of Greece.
As a printing agent, Athens had blocked every approximation of Skopje to the EU and NATO for almost three decades.
If the citizens vote in favour, they will also give the start for the western integration of their country.
Elie Wiesel - The author who saves the Shoah from forgetting

Switzerland launches electronic register for organ donors
The register aims at facilitating organ donation and relieving people in stress situations.
The new procedure does not change the fact that institutions may continue to be removed only with explicit consent, emphasises Swistransplant.
(dpa) Switzerland will launch an electronic register for organ donors on this Monday.
This is intended to facilitate organ donation and to relieve relatives in stress situations.
People who want to make their organs available in the event of death can be registered there.
Your wishes will then be retrieved in the event of a roadworthiness transplant.
The new procedure does not change the fact that institutions - as in Germany - can only be withdrawn with explicit consent, emphasises the Transplant.
It is assumed that 15 percent of the Swiss people have a donor card, says Franz, director of the Swiss Transplant Foundation.
But only in five percent of the cases a card will be found at the decisive moment with possible donors.
In more than 60 percent of the conversations, the relatives do not know the deceased's wish.
"You then have to decide alternatively in the sense of the deceased, which is often very burdensome," so always.
A similar registration system already exists in Great Britain.
In Germany, there are considerations to store information about possible organ donation on the hospital card, as the speaker of the Federal Health Department, Marita Völker-Albert says.
"A register in which people can register their wishes - pro or counter organ donation - does not exist," she says.
Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn has expressed his support for a new system of organ donation.
According to his proposal, everyone would first be considered an organ donor, unless he or his family contradicts.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.
14-year-old pupil is world champion in headphones
The 14-year-old Tomohiro Iseda student from Japan is the world champion of headphones.
He went to Wolfsburg on the weekend against 39 fellow striders.
This was announced by Martina Flamme-Jasper from the Phaeno Science Museum, the venue of the competition, on Sunday.
The 16-year-old Wenzel greeting from Germany was the third place.
The youngest WM participant was a twelve-year-old Japanese student, the oldest a 74-year-old French retired, as the main judge Ralf Laue said.
The computer professor from Zwickau (Saxony) organizes the competition every two years.
To date, for example: 14.130 214 x 17.981.822 or 57.809.355 + 28 x 16.448.333.
Since spectators were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon that participants attended against guests from the audience with pocket calculators.
Wenzel greetings from Lastrup demonstrated how he keeps a ball with his head in the air when calculating.
He is one of seven Germans in competition.
A total of 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for competition.
Greetings were in Bielefeld two years ago than 14-year-old.
With terms like superbrain, genius or miracle child, organizers Laue can not begin much.
"Headfrechnen can be trained," he said.
Many participants exercised several hours a day.
In India or Singapore there are even calculating competitions oriented in stages.
Disciplines include, for example, square roots drawn from six-digit numbers.
When calculating the multiplicity, the candidates get surprises for which they need to quickly find a solution strategy.
Here too, the Germans would have good opportunities, said the main judge of the divorce.
Otherwise, Asians are often in the advantage, because there is already in early childhood headaches being learned more intense and with other effective methods.
Intensive appeal: Video with naked Serena Williams: It's about breast cancer early detection
Tennis-Ass Serena Williams shows itself from her emotional and sensitive side.
The 37-year-olds want to point to breast cancer with this video and make themselves strong for early detection.

Government wants to ban more extremistic symbols
Vienna - The Federal Government is planning a clear extension of the ban on the use of extremistic symbols.
Next week, the Turkish-blue coalition will send an appropriate draft law on the so-called "symbol law" in consideration.

Polar cold air brings new snow on the mountains in the west
Mrs Holle will shake her beds in the West next week for the first time: Polare cold air reaches on Monday Vorarlberg, North Tyrol and Salzburg.
According to the meteorologists of the Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snowfall limit at the beginning of the week falls to 1,500 to 1,200 meters - in close valleys it could cut down to about 1,000 meters at strong intensity, it was said.
From the Bregenzerwald to the High Tauern, over 2,000 meters are expected to be 20 to 40 centimeters of new snow.
On higher passages (Arlbergpass, Timmelsjoch, Bieler height, Brennerpass, Gerlospass, Felbertauern, Großglockner Hochalpenstraße), road conditions are therefore winter.
Farmers can start on Monday with the annual knickcare
Schleswig-Holstein's peasants are allowed to start on Monday with the annual Knick care.
The unique "green walls" in Germany have been shaping the landscape of the Waldarmen Bundesland for about 200 years.
The trees and stamps up to five meters wide are "forest set" and for many animals and plants the last retreat rooms.
Knicks combine as corridors of scattered habitats, over which the exchange of organisms can still work, as the Managing Director of the Naturschutzbundes Germany (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski, said.
Knicks are living fences
The Knicks were built on the basis of an order of the Danish King Christian VI in 1766, who ruled over Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living fences" were not only field limitation and livestock, they also delivered firewood and beams to farmers for their workshops.
From that time, his name "Knick" also came from: By "Knicking" the branches were able to develop the dense, curved borders.
Today, between the North and the Baltic Sea, about 45 000 kilometres of the hills stretch and give the picture of a wooden, diversified landscape.
According to NABU, they are now used by around 7000 species as a replacement habitat.
In a kilometre Knick could live up to 1800 different species and up to 30 bird pairs breed.
However, its ecologically important function can only be fulfilled if it is properly maintained in winter.
Otherwise he confuses to a light tree series, which, besides biodiversity, also reduces the wind protection effect, said Ludwichowski.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, the Knick care may only be operated outside the breeding period from October to March.
After tsunami on Sulawesi Indonesian speaks about on-site situation
The local Radika Pinto describes in an interview with the German editorial network (RND) the situation on site on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquake and the tsunami:
Were you on site during the tsunami?
No, I was in Jakarta on the island of Java at the time.
When the earthquakes were, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I learned about the tsunami, I went back to Sulawesi immediately.
I arrived on Sunday morning because I had to drive more than 20 hours after a flight, since the airport at Palu was closed at the time.
What is the situation on the island now?
The national government has opened the airport again, so that auxiliary goods can also be flew in.
When I got here, I saw the houses on the coast that were completely destroyed.
Our office of "World Vision" is also destroyed, but we have provisionally set up something where we have also accommodated other people.
Where are the people living on Sulawesi now?
Many have run on surrounding hills, on which they still are afraid of another tsunami and earthquake and where they have no access to water and food.
Some people stay in front of their houses, there are still replacements.
Because many food shops and also the gas stations are completely closed, people are partially stealing food and petrol.
The public service has been completely down, the national government is helping.
A prison was also destroyed, the prisoners are running freely, and the search for them is difficult.
There are still a lot of bodies around, many people have not been found yet and are missing.
How is communication and information on the island going?
At the moment, we have cell phones, but this did not work before, and we only received information on the radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbours and other people, of whom they do not know whether they live and where they are staying, because people during the earthquake were not at home, but for example on the way to work.
The tsunami warning system didn't work properly.
Do you have any information about this?
We don't know the reasons for that, but when the warning came, many thought "Okay, no tsunami" - and then he came.
In other regions not hit by tsunami, there was the misformation that a tsunami hit the region and they ran to the surrounding mountains.
Is an island like Sulawesi, located on the Pacific Fire Ring, not prepared for earthquake?
Yes, there are earthquake every day, but this was the worst.
We usually know how to react to earthquakes and also train evacuations.
But the entire infrastructure has collapsed, the earthquake has hit a lot of people.

Brett Kavanaugh: FBI investigation in Turbotempo
The time is extremely short and the number of scheduled interviews is heavily limited.
With an FBI investigation at the Turbotempo, the Republicans in the U.S. Senate are trying to secure the mighty majority of the judge's candidates Brett Kavanaugh, who are disputed for the need.
President Donald Trump has set the investigators a deadline until Friday to clarify the alleged incidents over 30 years.
The latest turn in the drama about the vocation of Kavanaughs accompanied by a cultural struggle had been triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing of Kavanaugh and the first prosecutor Christine Blasey Ford, in whose course the jury cast angry tirades against the opposition democrats, the Senate's Justice Committee should leave the way for the final confirmation of the ArchConservative Judge at the Supreme Court.
The majority of the Republicans seemed secure when suddenly Senator Jeff Flake declared against his original announcement that he would agree but demanded an FBI investigation.
After scenery, his party friends agreed.
President Trump, who had referred to the serious events on Thursday as a "bully," first held up further attacks against women and, on the contrary, spoke of "happiness in misfortune."
In this way, last doubt could be eliminated, he said.
Later, Trump attacked the Democrats sharply in an electoral lecture because they rejected Kavanaugh: "They are trying to block and destroy."
Trump commands FBI investigation in Kavanaugh case
The White House has also extremely limited the powers of investigators.
One will investigate the well-known accusations of two women, that's all, a government representative said to the Wall Street Journal: "They don't go on a fishing trip."
According to the New York Times, only four witnesses are to be heard.

FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: Fear has been felt
Coach Domenico Tedesco and Shalke 04 celebrated the first season victory against Mainz.
The relief on shell is great after the first season victory.
However, the factor time also played a role against Mainz.
Gelsenkirchen - In the meantime it is well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist in football games.
That was no different in the home game against Mainz 05.
"I've seen every ball in it.
And there were many corners and many balls in our frame, "said the Sports Board of Schalke 04 - and breathing up.
After all, the king's blues succeeded in bringing the narrow 1: 0 against the Rhineland over time and thus the first seasonal victory under the roof and the field.
It could have actually happened differently.
After the leadership by Alessandro Creator 11 of the team of Chief Coach Domenico Tedesco had given Tedesco security: "In sum, the first half was good, both playful and pressing.", apparently, with increasing gambling time more and more the head played a role.
Create actually no head ball monster
"The last ten minutes have felt like two hours for me," Heidel said, "If the crew was only half as nervous as I was on the bank, I can understand that."
The boys were afraid to give it out of their hands, so they kept pulling back.
And defended with man and mouse against Mainz.
To save the first three counters of the season.
"All of us have fallen a huge stone from the heart," said Schöpf, who had no unimportant part of it with his headball hit: "I am actually the worst headball player in the manhood."
But at the end only victory counts.
The relief was noticeable throughout the arena, of course also at Tedesco.
"We wanted to start pronounced in the initial phase and make a fireworks of it," said Schalke's chief coach.
The victory was important.
Finally, we can enjoy a few hours.
I'm very, very happy for the crew and the fans.
We have played intelligent, quiet and courageous, so we have to deal with lots over 90 minutes
The biggest manko of the afternoon: King's blue missed it to worry more about clearer conditions.
The possibilities were finally there, for example by the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who twice hit the latte 59 / 72. Or Amine Harit 62.
"Then it would not have become a triumph," Tedesco said, "Fear has already been felt a little."
That's why I'm glad we won.
He wasn't the only scalker with that.

Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani talks about integration: A discussion at eye level
The author is ahead of them, Professor Aladin El-Mafaalani.
He followed the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild for several times.
"I have been doing my job for many years to get interesting people to Greven," explains the founder and chairman of the "Reckenfeld Treff" - the association that cooperates in the direction of the evening with the alliance "Cultural Policy."
El-Mafaalani gets into the reading very slowly, describes the writing process of the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the subject comprehensively.
With a lot of gestures, handproof numbers and some kind of joke, he brings the listeners closer to one of the most conflicting themes: migration and integration.
Why do conflicts arise despite successful integration?
The Syrian memorable author is used to answer the question of a metaphor.
The German society is sitting on a table, the first-generation immigrants are on the catchtable.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to go to the table.
The third generation of migrants is born in Germany, they have always been sitting at the big table and now want to decide.
That leads to conflicts.
It is therefore not decisive whether you are politically right or left, but: "Am I for or against an open society?," he emphasises.
Initially, behave rather, then the discussion round starts more and more smoothly.
And there is a need to speak.
A Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, two teachers tell them how they see successful or unsuccessful integration in pupils.
El-Mafaalani stands up, not on stage, a sensation for the discussion: it is on eye altitude.
The sociology professor does not urge his opinion, emphasizes that he speaks of the average, not of individual fate rooms.
He is pleased that there is interest in this issue, because "only if we understand what the problem is, we can find solutions," says El-Mafaalani.
Even during the subsequent Significance Hour, he continued to discuss an open ear for the questions of the guests and also in the Foyer, with prepared Kurdish specialties.

The municipality of Pliening sold the first land in the Neubaugebiet Landsham-Süd on the free market.

Thus Schalkes Naldo succeeds "great sport" also on the bank
For the third time in a row not at the start: Naldo still thanks at Schalke-Trainer Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues for the third time in succession had not been in the shell startelf but on the exchange bank, the understanding would have been great for many people if the Brazilian almost two meters large once had spoken the joy of the soul.
But when after the 1: 0 victory of the FSV Mainz 05, as used to be in the middle district, the shelters gathered and thanked Chief Coach Domenico Tedesco with all his pros, the 36-year-old, all of whom call Naldo simply, turned on and said: "We have to thank, Coach!"
"That was very emotional, that was great sport," later Tedesco said about the reaction of his vice-captain, who, despite his renewed reserve existence, did not have any grudge.
Probably Naldo, who was celebrated as the best shelter in the last season, knows that he did not actually get on the track with his coach - but is getting a break for good reasons.
A reason called "load control."
It wasn't easy to tell him
"It was not easy to tell him that I'm telling you very honestly," Tedesco reported about the moment he told Naldo that he was not in the startup.
He's an important player, he's an important person.
But it's always about the thing, it's about the association, "founded Tedesco the step.
Naldo played against Bavaria and Porto for 90 minutes.
He's 36 years old.
It's important that everyone can get through right now.
And that we all keep in the boat, "Tedesco explained the rotation that last also caught Naldo.
And responded to the Brazilians with the wisdom of his advanced age: by also proving himself to be an excellent team player on the bank.
The mood in Austria's industry continued to speed up its valley journey in August compared to the euro area.
The shopping management index (PMI) was on a 37-month deaf with 46.7 points.
In Europe, however, Austria has the third best mood behind Ireland and the Netherlands, the Markit Institute announced on Monday to its survey among 3,000 companies.
In contrast to Austria, the euro area PMI rose by 1.1 to 45.1 points, with the index being still the 13th month in succession below the mark of 50 counters indicating growth.
Only Ireland's industry cracked this threshold in August with 50.9 points.
The final light was the Greek (42.1 points).
Although in Germany, France and Spain the voting barometer decreased more slowly than in the previous months.
In Spain, the index reached the highest level with 44.0 points since March.
"The slightly weakened valley journey could mean that the worst thing has passed," said Markit economist Rob Dobson.
But industry - in the third quarter in any case - remains the growth brake number one.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight: export orders in the euro area have not fallen as much as since November 2011.
The companies therefore reduced the seventh month in succession.
Also in China, industrial production fell more than initially assumed in August.
The voting barometer fell from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts had first expected 47.8 points.
The purchase management index is based on representative surveys by 3,000 European industrial companies.
Developments in sales, employment, storage and prices are highlighted, among other things.
