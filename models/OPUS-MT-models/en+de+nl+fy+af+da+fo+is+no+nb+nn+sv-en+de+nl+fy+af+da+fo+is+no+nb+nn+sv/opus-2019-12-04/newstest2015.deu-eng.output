According to reports, India also hopes for a defence cooperation agreement between the two nations.
Police of Karratha arrested 20-year-olds after fast motorcycle hunting
A motorcycle was seized after the driver had driven it at 125 km / h in a 70 km / h zone and through bushland to escape the police in Bilbara.
Traffic police in Karratha tried to stop a blue motorcycle this morning after they had observed how it left a gas station on the Bathdate Road at 125 km / h.
The police reported that the driver then ignored the stop signals and went on Burgess Road before he left for the bushland where the officials lost sight of it.
The motorcycle as well as a person who matched the description of the driver were later seen at a house at the Walcott Way in Bulgarra.
The police of Karratha accuse a 20-year-old man of failing to observe a stop signal as well as of negligible driving.
He is due to appear in Karratha on September 23.
The motorcycle was secured and seized for three months.
George Webster accused of hotel rape in Naim and Pitlochry
A man is in court for the rape of women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was reviewed at a hearing by the Supreme Court in Glasgow.
He is accused of raping a woman at Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry in Perthshire on June 7, 2013.
The charge is that Webster attacked her while she was "unconscious, slept, and couldn't signal agreement."
Webster is also accused of raping a second woman at the Golf View Hotel in Naim in the Scottish Highland on May 4, 2014.
Judge Lady Rae set the hearing date for 17 November at the Supreme Court in Edinburgh.
Recalling the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have tabled a legislative proposal to establish the organisation of trade unions as civil rights.
"As trade unions die, middle-class jobs are also dying," said Ellison, a Minnesota Democrat and Deputy Chairman of Progressive Caucus in Congress.
That is why I am proud to present the Staff Authorisation Act with the Citizens' Rights Side John Lewis.
This interrupting law gives workers the same legal opportunities for discrimination on grounds of the organisation of trade unions as for other forms of discrimination - and thus stops anti-trade forces.
The addition of the national labour law to create a possibility of discrimination against workers to organise a trade union representation in order to sue for justice before a civil court - and to obtain damages or penalties - is a meaningful and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the other sponsors are proposing is to reconnect to a very American idea.
Despite the repercussions of the trade unions in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other countries throughout the country - Americans have once encouraged countries around the world to recognise, extend and observe labour rights.
There was a time when millions of Americans remember when this country called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right of association in a breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution to ensure that the militarised autocracy Hedki Tojos was replaced by democracy.
In full consciousness of the role of workers and their trade unions in the creation of a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly acknowledged that "the rights of workers to association and joint bargaining and action are guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff urged the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that fascism Adolf Hitler would be replaced by a strong democracy.
In recognition of the fact that the workers would have to organise themselves, and should raise their voice in the new nation, the Germans added a clause that explicitly stated: "The right to set up associations in order to secure and improve the working and economic conditions is guaranteed to every individual and every profession or business.
Agreements that restrict this right or aim to narrow it are zero and void; measures aimed at it are illegal.
When the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt chaired the International Commission for Human Rights, which drafted the General Declaration of Human Rights, as it was adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a global agreement, Roosevelt and the other authors added a guarantee that "everyone has the right to form or join trade unions to protect their interests."
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic principles that labour rights are human rights.
When this country spoke to other countries about how to form civil and democratic societies, Americans stated that the right to establish a trade union - and that this trade union should then participate in collective bargaining as an equivalent partner with companies and government bodies - should be protected.
After these rights were under attack in America, it is indeed very wise to face up to the American ideal, which means that the working population must have the right to unite and to hear in a free and open society.
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said 50 years ago:
The story is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the worker movement did not restrict the strength of the nation, but increased it.
By raising the living standards of millions of people, work has created a wonderful market for industry and raised the whole nation to unforeseeable levels of production.
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths, but history preserves them.
The story remembers, and we should do that too.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights as protection against discrimination in the creation of workers' representations - has long been overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that America has made in the past and triggered the promise of democracy.
Judge stops temporary law that all abortion clinics in Louisiana could force to close
A U.S. federal judge temporarily stopped implementing a law in Louisiana on Sunday, which lawyers say would probably have led to the closure of all five state abortion clinics.
This measure, which was brought into force in June by Bobby Jindal, Governor of Louisiana, and intended to enter into force on 1 January, would force doctors who perform abortions to acquire a patient's right to receive a hospital within a radius of 30 miles to acquire their practice.
However, the decision of the Judge means that doctors can continue to carry out legal abortions on a provisional basis while they apply for such a right.
"The applicants may continue to work in accordance with the law while they seek to obtain these rights," wrote Bundesgericht John deGravelles in his judgment.
A hearing for the Judge shall be held within one month in order to obtain a more lasting decision for the law.
Absorption supporters welcomed the decision that was the youngest in a number of judgments against similar measures and said that doctors gained more time to obtain hospitalisation rights.
"Today's decision means that women in Louisiana are neglecting a deceptive law that wants to take their health and rights," said Nancy Northup, President and Chairman of the Reproduction Rights Centre, which had complained on behalf of three of the five clinics of the state to stop the law.
It was not directly clear whether the judgment also covered the doctors from the two clinics who had not joined the action and also applied for a right of appeal.
Louisiana is one of the 11 states that have adopted similar laws, with courts recently declared such measures in Alabama and Mississippi non-constitutional.
Key points of a law in Texas, which would have forced most of the clinics left in the state to close, were stopped by a federal judge on Friday.
Abort promoters and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists as well as the American Medical Association agree that registration rights require unnecessary restrictions by doctors.
Absorption opponents prevent the measures to protect women's health, although some also welcomed the impact of closing clinics.
Only one doctor who carries out abortions in Louisiana has a patient's right to report, informed the Centre for Reproduction Rights.
If all the other doctors in the state were forced to do no more abortions, this doctor would no longer perform the operation for fear of his safety, the group said.
In their arguments against the judgment, representatives of the State of Louisiana said that they would not punish doctors for the conduct of abortions while their requests for patients' rights would still be pending.
Delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment options lead to higher death rates due to ovarian cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have online a video campaign for her mother who died of egg cancer in 2007.
For women in the rural areas of Australia, there is a higher risk of dying of ovarian cancer than for women in cities.
Researchers analyzed the medical data of more than 1100 Australians, where ovarian cancer was detected in 2005, and found that only 25 percent were alive five years after diagnosis.
Research director Susan Jordan from the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the mortality risk during the study was 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas.
SMALL STUDIE: New medicines could slow lung and ovarian cancer
The researchers studied the medical care of women over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman in diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, pre-existing diseases as well as the social and economic status also affected survival opportunities.
For older women and those whose cancer had already progressed further at the time of diagnosis, the survival rate was the lowest.
For those living in rural and remote regions of the state, mortality risk was 20 per cent higher during the study than for those in urban areas.
Although the study did not investigate why women living outside the city with higher probability died of ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suspects a late diagnosis and the lack of access to the best treatment centres as possible factors.
"This disease is best treated by gynecological oncologists, and these are mostly found in larger cities," she said.
Despite the improvement of telemedicine services to counteract the distances, it proposed as a possible remedy a reinforcement of the service of enrolled doctors to allow specialists to provide women closer to their place of residence, as well as treatment programmes for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said that, regardless of geographical status, the study showed a poor long-term survival rate in women in ovarian cancer and stressed the need for better treatment and precautionary strategies.
The study financed by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a 33-year-old young mother from the golden coast, learned that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Gardening centres deplore declining house owners numbers
The decline along with an increased decrease in the number of house owners under 35 years could lead to the loss of tens of thousands of pounds per year when today's young consumers reach the "core age group for garden products" following a study by HTA, as reported in the Financial Times.
The report says that tenants spend on average 55 percent of the amount that people with homes spend for their garden.
The increase of people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popular process of asphalt parks and the decreasing garden size are other factors that threaten the industry, where estimated £5 billion is implemented in the sale.
In the large area of London, where the share of household owners has fallen from 61% to 43% over a period of 6 years, the lowest expenditure on garden products per household is reported.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that housing for rent or small gardens does not mean that people cannot draw plants.
Guy Barter, Chief Garden Adviser for the RHS said: "Container gardeners are very popular with tenants, for example, because they can take their plants on a move."
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of gardening retail trade due to increasing house ownership and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
He also predicted an improved market situation for this year due to the better weather according to unfriendly weather conditions in March and April last year.
The protest movement in Pakistan led by the opposition politician Imran Khan and the Christian Tahirul Qadri continues.
In the capital of Islamabad, about 1,000 demonstrators have stormed the state television station PTV.
Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said that soldiers could have pushed the protesters out of PTV buildings again.
The station stopped its operation for about 40 minutes, but is now sending back.
At the same time, about 3000 demonstrators tried to reach the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
Approximately a kilometre away, they were equipped with sticks and stones with collapses with security forces.
The police used tear gas.
The demonstrators demanded Sharif's resignation, but he refuses.
The army of the country therefore urges a political solution to the conflict to "waste time and apply without violence."
After a meeting in the headquarters on Sunday night, the military announced: "The army remains bound to play its role in ensuring the security of the state."
The military plays an important role in Pakistan and has already popped more often.
Imran Khan, the opposition politician, claims to have deceived Prime Minister Sharif in the parliamentary elections last May.
The protests were escalated this weekend after Khan and Qadri had called their followers to pass to Sharifs residence.
Three people had been killed.
Turkey orders US diplomat for spy reports
The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has ordered the oldest US diplomats in the country to provide information about American and British spying in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bülent said that the businessman of the US Embassy and Turkish officials had discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel as well as the online magazine The Intercept reported that the one from the former US analyst of the National Security Agency, Edward Snowden, showed that Turkey was a major area of activity for US and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan played down the importance of the report and said that all important countries were spying on each other.
An earlier report, which also had the most important secret service of Germany's Ankara in sight, caused significantly more annoying reactions by the Turkish government.
Warning strike: Locator threatens with consequences for Pendler
The national warning strike of the local guides on Monday evening could also affect passenger traffic in NRW.
The state of play announced for 18 to 21 o'clock concerns all transport companies throughout the country, including distance, regional and S-Bahn transport,
The main direction of the warning strike is freight transport.

The district chairman of the German Locomotive Guide (GDL), Sven Schmitte, said in Düsseldorf.
We expect significant failures.
There are no regional priorities.
The main direction of the warning strike is the transport of goods.
The Deutsche Bahn in NRW announced to do everything to keep the impact as low as possible.
However, the GDL did not say where it wanted to strike, so it was difficult to predict the consequences in concrete terms.
Chief of Police of Magaluf accused of corruption
On Friday, the prosecutors presented evidence of blackmail by police and employees of the city of Calvià to the office of the Prosecutor of Mallorca.
The chief of the police of Calvià on the holiday island of Mallorca was arrested on corruption charges by businessmen and barbecents in the notorious Binge-Drinking Hotspot Magaluf.
Chief Commissioner José Antonio Navarro was arrested by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street in which most bars and nightclubs of Magaluf lie.
According to the online newspaper Mallorca Diario, the prosecutors presented evidence of blackmail by police and employees of the city of Calvià to the Office of the Prosecutor for Corruption Fighting Mallorcas on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish Guardia Civil in conjunction with the charges of corruption and are questioned by a judge together with Navarro.
The national Spanish newspaper ABC reported that the annoyed nightclub owners stated that the government's vetting economy had a serious impact on their business.
"It's not about making money anymore, it's about survival," one of the businessmen said to the court.
Leave our livelihood out of the game.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made international headlines this summer because of a viral YouTube video, in which an 18-year-old British tourist was shown, who performed 24 men during a sauftour Fellatio.
The island authorities have since tried to stop the wrong behaviour of alcoholic holidaymakers in Magaluf by minimising the number of participants in the notorious alcohol-imprinted cutter tours.
The Playhouse Club, where the Fellatio incident took place, was forced to close for a year, while Playhouse and the Kneipentour organizer Carnage jointly have to pay a penalty of €55,000 ($73,000).
The tourist town of Magaluf, which is popular especially with young British holidaymakers, is also known for several accidents under alcohol flux, including the trend of "balcony," where people jump from one balcony to another or from one balcony into the hotel pool.
The first spring with wet and stormy weather conditions affects flights from Adelaide Airport
The FRÜHLING has given South Australia a winter surprise, with heavy showers and strong wind, which affected the flights from Adelaide Airport.
In the evening until 9: 00 a.m., further 5mm rain fell on the city, after 6,6mm, which had already gone down in the night to Sunday.
The last rainfall was the result of a series of short, stormy showers, including a cast that started just before 20: 00 and caused almost 4mm rainfall in about 10 minutes.
After the winter last week provided an early dose of spring, the temperatures in the city fell back to a maximum of only 15.8 ° C.
The evil weather conditions have probably led to the late landing of a flight from Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane should have landed shortly after 7: 30, but was hit by a sharp wind - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to start through.
At that time wind shoots reached about 50 km / h on the ground at Adelaide Airport.
The flight data showed that the plane had to go through a second landing flight and finally started at about 8: 40 a.m.
The delay resulted in delays in some other flights, including an Emirate flight from Dubai and a Quanta flight from Sydney.
For Adelaide a maximum temperature of 16 ° C is foreseen on Tuesday, with possible showers.
Matthies thinks: Highest time for big networking
In view of the galoping technical progress that threatens to transform our comfortable home into high-tech circuits, our columnist Bernd Matthies comforts himself with a highly trusted electronic accessory.
While I write this, I look at the spiral cable that connects the phone to the phone, and I think, Boah, how retro is that?
But there is a thought behind it: if the cable were not, in the shortest time all the listeners would be running around in the house without a chance, and that would be even more retro.
Do you not apply to the eceltronic (eceltronic?
No, tip errors: electronic) sector the rule that today's world novelty is the electric scrap of tomorrow, bought - obsolete.
And, for example, who still has a pipe TV in the living room today just says that he rejects television in principle.
Why these considerations?
Because pushing the Ifa to the radio tower this week again brings our absolute incompetence in electronics issues to mind.
The Laie, who used to control washing machine and CD players blind, today does not even understand the purpose of the devices that are spread out with an unbelievable expert speech in front of him: "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies" promises us the press office.
Yeah, are you okay?
What are you supposed to talk to people who seem to voluntarily spread such quark?
In essence, for about 20 years, it's mainly about networking our house.
So that the yogurt can reorder itself, so that the fire detector can tell us on holiday on the Maldives that it burns in the working room.
And wouldn't it be wonderful if we from the office out of the air conditioning on our early arrival...?
Yes, but that requires an air conditioning.
But a dream will certainly come true soon: We lift our wristwatch, say loud "suction!" and at home the vacuum grobot goes off.
Crazy.
Everything goes down to nothing less than a revolution: "The boundaries between white and brown goods are floating," an industry acquaintance, you can connect the washing machine with a headphones, the steam yarn sends the weather report, and the data glasses show how long the pizza in the oven still takes, which is not useful because we are in the state.
We also know from everyday practice: if a new-fashioned device is really needed, the battery is guaranteed empty.
Another reason why the spiral cable on the phone will also survive the next radio exhibitions.
Israeli children return to their schools after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from the areas near the Gaza Strip returned to schools on Monday after they had spent the summer in airspace, while rocket and murderer shots on their municipalities went down during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas and the schools remained closed in Gaza while the area recovered from the fights.
The start of the school brought a sense of joy and expectation to the communities in the south of Israel drawn by missiles, but the signs of fights are still fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, staff of the "Pashosh" kindergarten, hit by a rocket, removed from the walls and sliding walls before the students arrived.
"We're a little scared, but excited," said Ronit Bart, resident in Kibbutz Saad and there English teacher.
Many children from our neighborhood need to return to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart said it feels "a little weird" to suddenly go back to school.
"These were difficult times, and we didn't leave the house at all," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the Kibbutz near the border with Gaza to offer his support.
Until a ceasefire interrupted the war last week, thousands of inhabitants of border communities such as Saad stayed in their houses or left their houses to move further from Gaza in safer areas and escape the missile and murderer fire.
Many inhabitants of Nahal Oz, a community near the border with Gaza, where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar grenade, are still hesitating to return.
The Ministry of Education announced that about a dozen families have not yet returned.
Your children were temporarily housed in other schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanjahu attended a school in Sderot, a border city to Gaza, which is heavily drawn by the Palestinian Shoot.
He appealed to the children to learn a lot and said, "We will ensure that their knowledge is acquired and offer you security."
Israel and Hamas agreed last Tuesday on an unlimited ceasefire.
The ceasefire brought an immediate end to the struggles, but important problems remain unresolved, such as the demand of Hamas for the abolition of the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of the air and sea ports in Gaza.
Israel calls for the disarmament of Hamas and the surrender of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the fights.
A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin this month in Egypt.
In the war more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed, three quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children, according to estimates made by the Palestinians and the UN.
Israel disputes this information and estimates that at least half of the killed are fighters, but did not provide concrete evidence for this information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza fired 4,591 missiles and mortar grenades during the fights on Israeli cities, most in the south of the country.
In the meantime, the Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of houses in the Gaza area and around 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools that were converted into temporary protection rooms.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in the protection rooms and continue fighting, the educational authorities last week postponed the beginning of the school year.
"I hope that the school will soon be open again so that we can continue to learn, as the children of the world and the Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who currently lives in a school in Gaza City.
By choice in Saxony: CDU-Vize Strobl questioned NPD prohibition procedures
In view of the loss of votes of the NPD in Saxony, CDU-Bundesvize Thomas Strobl has expressed its support for an end to the ongoing NPD prohibition proceedings before the Federal Constitutional Court.
Berlin - According to CDU-Bundesvize Thomas Strobl, the ongoing prohibition proceedings against NPD should end before the Federal Constitutional Court.
"The NPD cuts down worse than last time," Strobl, who is also head of CDU in Baden-Württemberg, said the "Leipzig Volkszeitung."
This is a joyful development in the right direction and a development that makes me more likely to come to the conclusion that the NPD is being fought politically rather than before the Constitutional Court.
The NPD failed to vote on Sunday at the five percent hurdle.
A first start for a ban on the right-wing extremes was failed in 2003, because the constitutional protection had informants at the NPD top at that time.
In December 2013, the Federal Council submitted a new application in Karlsruhe after long preparation.
Federal Government and Bundestag did not join.
Harburg: Tents for new refugees
In the New Country Square refugees are now housed in tents.
The Central First Reception for Refugees in Harburg crashes out of all seams.
Now the interior authority has set up three tents of the Red Cross next door.
The district politicians were only briefed shortly before - they are little enthusiastic.
"These hauruck actions continue to raise citizens' reservations and do not allow districts politicians to participate constructively in the human accommodation of refugees," says Britta Herrmann, the Group chairman of the Greens at the Harburg District Assembly.
Your party demands that the district administration Harburg currently provides unused houses for accommodation.
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents.
Reasons for overfilling in the initial recording are the storm of auxiliary seekers - and the fact that the authorities cannot provide sufficient space in follow-up facilities.
Many refugees therefore remain longer than the regular three months.
The house prices have experienced the strongest winter rise in seven years, showing a widely observed index.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for home homes in the Australian capital increased by 1.1 percent in August, so the RP data from Monday.
As a result of this increase, the total increase in June, July and August is 4.2 per cent, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 per cent, more than twice as high as the increase in the 12 months to August 2013, but the increases were not evenly distributed across the country.
The research director of RP Data, Tim Lawless, announced that Sydney and Melbourne are driving a two-share market.
The figures from RP Data show that home prices in Sydney increased by 16.1 per cent last year, but in Melbourne by 11.7 per cent.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices increased by an average of five and six percent.
At the other end of the scale, Canberra, which was hit hard by the cuts in government spending and where prices increased by only 1.4 per cent over the year.
Mr Lawless also said that with the spring start, there would be an increase in the real estate to be sold, which would be subject to a "real test" market for the coming months.
"If you look at the continuing high rate of auction prices, a generally fast rate of sales and the continuing low interest rate environment, it is likely that the price of ownership will increase further in the next three months," he said.
In an opinion to the New Press, he contradicts the statements of Managing Director Peer Medau and certifies that he is positioning "as a field master."
This is not the style of the university, it is said in the communication.
Thus, the Medau family had already been informed orally about the remembrance of the university in mid-June.
The statement that the plans were not known until July is definitely wrong, "Pötzl said.
At the same time, he pointed out that the plans were not "preliminary or even decision-making," but "preferences."
The extension of the narrow road to the castle, which is necessary for access, was also less dramatic than the Medaus feared.
A nine-metre wide street was and is not the talk.
It goes about 5.50 meters, which is one meter wider than before, "Pötzl explains.
The argument of the Medau operators that their free and sheltered parking spaces will then only be used by university students will not allow Pötzl to apply.
Parked is not parked at all because this can now be resolved intelligently, as with other public parking spaces.
Think of the residents
According to the university president, the children's crutch, which is located on the site and would lead the door to the park deck, should not be "damaged."
Instead, he has to remember, "that this is not only about the crib, but also about the residents of the insulation to the Friedrich Strib street and the 800 students of the neighbouring real school.
So it is about much more than about Mr Medau's particle interests, "Pötzl said.
Whether the criticism of the parental council of the children's crimes, with the extension of the road would be entitled to "lose one of the few natural spots of Coburg," "the reader can decide himself."
At the beginning of October, Pötzl, together with the State Bauamt Bamberg, will inform the city councils about the building development of the university by 2020 "and address the importance of the new development."
Last week, Peer Medau had informed the parents of the children's cripples about the plans of the university.
As a result, the entrance to the new park deck should not be carried over the campus and the Friedrich Strib street, but over the Medau mountain.
This would allow the narrow road to be expanded to a length of about one kilometre.
According to the Medaus's high bills, traffic in the park of Hohenfels would be multiplied by this.
About 2,000 vehicles per day are mentioned.
From the side of the city one did not wish to comment on the project so far.
Glandorf withdraws from handball national team
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31-year-old of the Federal Ligist SG Flensburg-Handewitt highlighted in particular health problems for this decision.
I didn't have a easy decision, it's been ripe for several months.
It is time for me to listen to the signals of my body and end my career in the national team, "the 2007 World Champion announced on his Facebook page.
He therefore goes to international retirement with a balance of 167 country games and 576 gates for Germany.
Because the widespread backroom player for the Champions League winner from Flensburg still wants to go for a few years, he is no longer available to the new federal trainer Dagur Sigurdsson.
On Tuesday, Glandorf made a "long and good conversation with the Icelandic people who announce his cathedral for the country games against Switzerland.
His ideas and approaches have just as enthusiastic as they will be my long-standing players and my successor.
But for my club I would also like to be available healthy in the coming years, for this longer regeneration pauses are needed that do not allow the current double load.
The left hand had had to fear his career end in 2012 after a ferse infection.
Because of Achillese's problems, he had been allowed to treat himself with a cortisonic syringe from the German Handball Federation (DHB) team doctors, which had later caused a severe inflammation.
One emergency operation and two more interventions followed.
Then Glandorf had announced a complaint against the crew doctor, the dispute ended with a comparison.
Twelve years of professional and eleven years of national crew careers don't pass a body without a trace.
I have some health sites that I can't ignore anymore.
After the three infection-related foot surgery that took place in 2012 at short intervals, I never really got my blood pressure under control.
In addition, there are some other disguised complaints.
Already at the beginning of the year I noticed that although I control my head, my body cannot deceive, "said Glandorf in an interview to the magazine" Handball Time. "
He would only be ready for a comeback in an absolute emergency.
"When all the stripes are ripped, I am always ready to talk," the dual family father explained to the trade magazine.
However, I can count the years in which I can still play handball by one hand.
I must also say that after my long hospital stay in 2012, I have also become rather humiliated as regards my health.
After my career, at least I want to be able to go straight.
In addition to the 2007 World Cup and the 2014 Champions League win, he won the EHF-Pokal in 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo).
In 2012, he also secured the European Cup of Pocal winners with Flensburg.
German economy dropped by 0.2 per cent in spring
The crises around the globe have hampered the German economy in the second quarter.
Gross domestic product decreased by 0.2 per cent from April to the end of June 2014 compared to the previous quarter.
This was communicated by the Federal Statistical Office and confirmed provisional calculations.
Consumption alone revived the economy in the spring, while investment declined.
External trade also hampered the economic recession.
Thanks to the strong annual record, GDP plus 0.8 per cent for the first half of the year compared to the second half of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point and destination of the "Münsterland-Mooiste," which led through the Burgmannsstadt on Sunday for the first time.
On Sunday, the Burgmannstadt Horstmar experienced an invasion of Dutch "Fietzenfahrer."
The largest cycling association in the Netherlands, NTFU, organized the so-called "Münsterlande-Mooiste."
It is about the largest cycling tour across the Münsterland, the cycling paradise near the Netherlands.
More than 1000 participants thanked their registration at Jos ter Huerne for organising this tour through the Münsterland.
This tour was awarded to interested people in various journals.
We came from The Hero and went over the night to take part in this tour.
We would like to get to know the Münsterland in this way too, "the cyclists welcomed the route through the Kreise Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.
= = References = = = = External links = = * Official website
Katharina went on a small "peace trip" through the city over the wall, where the start also took place.
The route, which was written for three different categories, was further headed back to Horstmar through the Schöppinger Mountain towards Coesfeld and over Havixbeck and Billerbeck.
On routes of 95 kilometers with 1175 altitude meters, 120 kilometers with 1475 altitude meters and 145 kilometres with 1775 altitude meters, the cyclists proved their good condition.
They were packed on their way to Havixbeck and Billerbeck.
Major organizer Jos ter Huerne and mayor's deputy, Heinz Lölfing, welcomed the success of this cycling event.
We are satisfied and it was a nice experience for all involved.
The organization went without problems and there were no negative incidents, "Heinz Lölfing draws a positive conclusion of this event.
Unfortunately, not as many participants came as the organizer had hoped, which was probably due to the bad weather forecasts and the morning rain.
"We'll meet again in 2015 at hopefully beautiful weather on August 30 or another weekend," the cyclists promised to return to Münsterland and the organizers are planning a new edition.
Konstantin Wecker's ruthless honest memoirs
It is actually more philosophical testimony than biography, which has brought Konstantin Wecker, Liedermacher, Pacific, politsafe activist, ex-prisoner, into "monk and warrior" on 287 pages to paper.
Not chronological, but more thoughts for thoughts the Münchner born on 1 June 1947 wrote down his memoirs, each chapter started by a matching song.
And he's being ruthless honest: from the Onanie as a gymnasiast to the shop theft and drug consumption he does not abandon human weakness.
Also to show how he himself learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow people.
Wide space also takes abstract, but even more important terms: love, soul, ego, being in now, spirituality - all of this he tries to go to the ground, in very philosophical but also very personal way.
And he also explains his Pacific, his social criticism, his political commitment - and also, as it has not only shaped the music (the opera lover became a soul and rock musician), but also his prison stay.
The latter has also brought the Lebemann Konstantin Wecker closer to the ashetic monk, which is "created by subtraction," as he says, "by leaving everything unnecessary away."
However, there are also short anecdotes to the earth between all the highly spiritual views: for example, over battles in a site frequented by GIs or a crazy car ride, where he frontal directed a tree.
Even there he is ruthlessly honest.
Lenny Henry: My father never took me in my arm.
Never said "I love you"
Henry was one of seven children of a family of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and her relationship was limited.
Henry is rehearsing for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and originated from the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mixture of Reggae and Rap, with vivid melodies.
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments.
He attended "many" therapies after his mother's death, and Henry is thinking about his relationship with his father.
It was hard to know him.
You never saw his face, only his voice said, "Stop the noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I want to look at Cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who were already grown up when I was a child - went to the pub with him and talked about things like the shape of beer glass or the beauty of a cricket beating.
I never had such a conversation with him.
Most of my life he was this serious guy in the corner who read the newspaper.
Recently Henry opened a cast in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than at times of his father, he won an insight into how life might have been for him.
It's a little light now, but they're dark, smoked, deep stygical labyrinth with flames and smoke and a lot of rust.
My father used to just lay in the bath and then he was able to slowly hear how he started singing because he could wash the cast off himself.
When I walked around there, I realized that he had done this for years to bring the food on the table, and my respect for him became greater.
However, Henry grew up as a child without his parents' love testimonies.
My father never hugged me, he never said "I love you."
Only when my mother went bad at the end of her life we started to say, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
By his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he was able to share the love he had missed as a child.
Could you stop with the "I love you"?
Stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
It is still friends with French who he was married to for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother was a diabetic.
That contributed to her death.
So when I became very, very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You must be radical.
So I went through this fitness thing and had to make a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's exhausting.
Nobody likes carrots.
Henry's career change may appear in his elegant, short-cut beard.
Since he was praised by the critics for his Othello, he has been taken from the theater.
It followed the comedy of the villages, and then Fences of August Wilson.
This is a different experience than the Sitcoms and comedy who have filled out his busy working life.
He started with only 16 years when he worked in a factory.
A DJ discovered him on stage when he imitated people and wrote to New Faces about him.
His television career began in the mid-1970s. "I was the only black imitator / comedian on TV for a pretty long time."
He learned how to work.
I had not only to get big in front of the public, but also from 1975 to 1985, learning how I could become an efficient joke story machine while I was a star through television, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 at New Faces
Since his manager had the stage right at the Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program in which people "painted" black, "Henry performed his comedy there for over five years.
My family was very uncomfortable.
I somehow wish it hadn't happened, but I don't regret that I did it.
It was a strange, unpleasant position for me, but I worked with huge projects and learned how to deal with a large audience.
But this "year-long prize-crowned pillar of British television" was also a "grotesque parody of black people."
By introducing figures that mocked the British black culture as well as celebrated, Henry worked in the eighties on an alternative comedy circle.
The first series of Lenny Henry Show went on show in 1984, and in the nineties he was known among other things as chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedyseries boss!.
Advertising, documentary movies, TV series and film roles marked his next decade, but after his BBC series LennyHenry.tv in 2008 he thought: "What do you do next, Len, because it feels like you only bring around the time or step a little in place."
After that, a documentary series for Radio 4, titled What's So Great About...?
The first episode was about Shakespeare.
I was allergic to Shakespeare.
I never really learned anything about him in school and thought he was mostly a middle class domain, white in pants and a coal head in front.
So I was terrified of it.
Everyone we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said, "You should try it.
Don't make it bad if you don't know what you're talking about.
Take a few of the words in your mouth, and then you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry recorded 20 lines from Othello's last speech for the documentary film and he was enthusiastic.
I had the feeling I could do it.
It was almost like someone finally put my head right on.
"That's what it is, it's a serious thing, take it seriously, learn your text, investigate a little.
The samples were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we did it.
And it was a success.
You seemed to be expecting a car accident, and that just didn't happen.
And soon he appeared in the comedy of the madmen.
Suddenly I went to the National Theatre and I couldn't believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you changed."
There was a technical error and Henry felt instinctive that he had to entertain the audience.
"A small voice said to me," You have to bridge 10 minutes now while they repair the computer. "
Instead, the stage leader announced that the idea would continue as soon as the problem was resolved.
I walked off the stage and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."
I'm not responsible for this.
I can leave it to someone else.
"You play in a play, so stay in your role."
Henry in Fences at the Duchess Theatre
Learning the text for Fences was demanding.
Panic is very good, it strengthens the teeth.
This also happened well, so it's like a great shield of gods that say to me, "This is your destiny."
He says this, of course, with a DONNERN voice.
So I'll stay with you.
I really love this.
I love being in a sample room.
But Henry still has the head of a comedian - our conversation has been through humorous outbreaks while he imitates people again and again.
I've decided not to make a stand-up comedy because I think this kind of immediate satisfaction of a room full of strangers is somehow dangerous.
If you're always looking for this, you're driving in front of a wall.
I sometimes perform live in the Apollo when I want to, but overall there's not as much to me as I used to.
I'll ask him if he'll ever make a stand-up comedytour again.
The fun I have in a room with a director that helps to form a start, a middle part and the end of a journey - I don't think I ever want to give it up again.
So this is his new incarnation?
I think so.
I like to be an actor.
It's fun.
You always tell a story, and that's great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Huthi rebels block roads in Jemens capital
In the conflict between the Shiite Huthi rebels and the jemenitic government, Huthis has called for civilian disobedience in the capital of Sanaa.
Huthi followers had occupied central streets in Sanaa on Monday, a speaker of the Huthi Party said "Ansar Allah."
Access to Parliament had also been blocked.
Jemenitic media report a traffic chaos in the capital.
According to the online issue of the newspaper "Yemen Post" Huthi Führer Abdulmalik al-Huthi had called for the measures on Sunday evening.
According to the paper, Huthi threatened with a further escalation of the conflict, his demands should not be met.
The Shiitic Huthis fight for greater independence from Sunni-ruled Yemen and demand the resignation of the government.
The Huthi People's Tribe has occupied the Jewish capital for almost two weeks.
About 30,000 rebels have built protest camps on the major routes of Sanaa.
In the surrounding countryside, bloody struggles with the Yemenian army are constantly happening.
Kenya registers officials to invade "ghosts"
Kenya has begun to register all government officials biometrically to remove "ghosts" from government wages lists.
Staff who do not register in the next two weeks would no longer be paid, was a government communication.
The government suspects that thousands of people will receive salary payments even after their retirement from the public service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta pledged to fight corruption in the public service on his entry into office in 2013.
A review at the beginning of this year found that at least $1 million (£700,000) per month was lost in payments for "ghosts" and by other abusive financial practices.
The government suspects that salaries will continue to be paid on accounts after a person died or leaving the public service, Wanyama Chebusiri reports for the BBC from the capital of Nairobi.
All officials now have to appear at identification centres in the next two weeks to ensure that their data on biometric registrations is recorded, has been reported in a government message.
Anyone who would not do so without a credible excuse would be removed from the salary list, the communication continued.
"This approach makes a significant contribution to the rationalisation of the public service by identifying the actual number of officials and also refining the salary list at both levels of government - so the" ghosts "are eliminated," said Anne Waiguru, the Cabinet Secretary at the Ministry of Decentralisation and Planning.
The scandal of the Art Adviser Helge Achenbach will be negotiated for the first time in court on 11 November.
Five heirs of Berthold Albrecht, son of the Aldi founder Theo Albrecht, demand 19,4 million euros of damages from Achenbach and two of its companies in insolvency proceedings in a civil trial at the Düsseldorf Landgericht.
That's what a court speaker told me on Monday.
In the application it is stated that Achenbach cheated on the purchase of works of art and old timers and calculated Berthold Albrecht higher than actually paid purchase prices.
The agreed commission was thus also higher.
Achenbach bought valuables for Albrecht for 121 million euros.
Children need roots and wings
He was in school service for 44 years, of which 23 were head of school.
From this time Manfred Richter knows many confessed Petershausener and Kollbacher from their time as a student.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always borne by his desire to see people in the student.
The snow cup is the most famous mountain of the giant mountain.
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motive from his home.
Judge was born in 1930 in Trautenau / North Bohemia, today Trutnov.
After four years of high school, he was already 14 years old.
A year later, the Sudetendeutsche were expelled.
In half an hour, the family had to leave her house.
After a few months in a camp it went to Bavaria in 1946 - in the freight wagon.
That's how the judge slipped into the upper French Senkendorf.
The teacher training took place in Bamberg.
To do this, Manfred Richter had to walk six miles a week to the next train station, drive the train to Bamberg, go three kilometers across the whole town to school and go back in the evening.
After two months, Manfred Richter got a place to sleep in a Red Cross home in Bamberg: together with up to 15 fellow students in a dorm.
In 1951, he made the first and in 1954, after three years of Lehramtsanwärter, the second state exam.
Since Oberfranken had no free teacher's place for him, he went to Oberbayern and came to school in Kollbach on 1 November 1954.
The "Miss Room" was his first "Service Apartment" in the school house.
In 1958 he had a three-room apartment in the newly built teacher's house next to the school.
This house bought Manfred Richter in 1980 after the school was dissolved in Kollbach in 1968.
Until then there were three classes in Kollbach in the school association Petershausen-Kollbach and five in Petershausen.
From the 1968 / 69 school year they were summarised in Petershausen in today's town hall.
When the school association Indersdorf was founded, only the primary school remained in the village.
In order to avoid a reclassification in the now smaller school, the then principal Georg Sigl moved to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Richter became his successor.
But Petershausen grew, and so the children and their teachers were able to acquire the present building, which was extended in 1997 after Judge's retirement.
Manfred Richter commends the uncomplicated generosity of the then mayor Ludwig Götz, who, at municipal cost, had to build a premises and in the 1997 enlargement of cellar rooms, although this was not eligible under the Schoolbuilding Guidelines.
"Mayor Götz was very schoolfriendly," remembered Judge.
During his entire career, Manfred Richter has never forgotten the speech of a government representative who had responded to a meeting of a school council on justice and justice: "One must never forget love." Manfred Judge translated what he had heard there as a young teacher.
"You have to give the children two things: roots and wings," says the 84-year-old today.
And he had to know: "This does not always succeed." Whether he means only his students or just like his own six children, it is not quite clear.
In any case, Judge's act was sometimes unconventional.
When students beat themselves, they didn't get a criminal work from him and were not diluted to sit behind.
At the expense of the congregation, judges had made two pairs of boxing gloves and had the two contractors joined each other, even if there should be a valley.
For the benefit of the school, as the principal, judges had a good relationship with then Mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU).
After his retirement, he moved the unpartially elected judge to apply at least the last of the CSU list for the municipal council in 1996.
However, Judges were elected in place six and joined the CSU.
180 kilometres in three days
HR4-RADTOUR 700 bicycle drivers set in the course park of Bad Salzhausen and Schotten Interim stop
When Radler takes her tour in Bad Salzhausen or Scotland, this is nothing special in itself.
On Friday, however, only the number of resting impressions made: The 700 participants of the hr4 bike tour and accompanied tross enjoyed a break in the lower course park of Bad Salzhausen and later a party under free sky in the Scottish Alteburg park.
Under the motto "Radling and celebrating on newly discovered paths between Nidda and Kinzig" the participants had met in Bad Vilbel on Thursday and experienced a concert from Van Baker & Band.
On Friday it became serious: The Radlers took the first stage, the 60 kilometers over Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and further to Scotland.
In Bad Salzhausen, the athletes were welcomed by Mayor Hans-Peter Seum, who started the bike in Bad Vilbel, and the director of Bad Salzhausen's own business, Petra Schwing-Döring.
For the refreshment of body and spirit, all kinds of good things had been prepared: the landwives from Ranstadt and Nieder-Mockstadt had 85 sheets of apple, twitch, scratch and cheese cakes that were wonderful to the brave cyclists.
"Such cakes can only baking landwives," a participant from Aulendiebach praised while ordering another piece.
Cold refreshments could be created at the drinking stand of the Gusp-Nidda tournament.
The "Duo Bravo" maintained visitors with famous melodies from operettes and musicals and harvested enthusiastic applause.
The beautiful ambience of the park seemed relaxing.
A gentleman also enjoyed a head massage from his partner: "He deserved it, finally he has already reattached jumped bicycle chains today."
Because of that, the mayor and the manager still had to work: they were interviewed at the well in front of the drinking house of Reporter Rainer Janke and used the opportunity to advertise in the radio for Bad Salzhausen.
Tobias Hagen, promoter since the first hr4 bike tour in 2004, was able to snore only a short time, but he had enough to do with the technology on the ground.
His pickup truck, in which he made three phones and a radio device with his employees and the 15-head motorcycle staffel of the police Hessen, wrote Facebook entries and reportages, also needed a check.
"Most of the participants come from the Rhine-Main area," he said, "but also from cast or Fulda, from Lauterbach or the Taunus and even from numerous cities in Westphalia, cyclists have travelled.
The number of participants depends a little on the available accommodation capacity.
In Category I the participants are housed in hotels, in Category II in collecting accommodations.
From the courtyard the bikers had a good impression when they broke up after an hour and a half: "Bye!"
"It was nice in Bad Salzhausen!" they waved to say goodbye.
After the arrival in Scotland, the group was allowed to take a short break.
But in the evening the cyclists were demanded in the idyllic Alteburgpark.
Under the direction of the Scottish Society for Tourism and Urban Marketing (GTS), the park had received a beautiful festival ambience and, of course, they had prepared leakages, such as flammcakes with well-chilled spring white.
Mayor Susanne Schaab, GTS Managing Director Markus Hoßfeld and MSC Chairman Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs in his capacity as board member of ADAC Hessen-Thüringen welcomed the visitors.
The three clearly welcomed the "many operations in Scotland."
DJ Tobias Hagen released the dance stage.
The opportunity for swinging under free sky has been used eagerly despite the sporty operation on the bike.
Among the guests, citizens who were affected by the good mood were increasingly mixed as the big chairs of cyclists.
On the second day for the cyclists, the stations Birstein, Wächtersbach and Bad Orb - including a concert with the trenkwalders - were on the program.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometers of Radelns, the athletes returned to Bad Vilbel.
Dozens of Turkish police arrested for "conspiracy" against the government
A total of 33 police officers were arrested in Turkey because of the suspicion of "conspiracy against the government," local media agencies report.
The police didn't make any direct comments.
Among the arrested are 14 high-level police officers, Hürriyet Daily News reports.
Some of them were involved in the corruption investigations against government co-workers, including four government ministers last December.
In July a number of Turkish police officers were arrested because they allegedly founded an organized criminal association and picked up phone numbers.
The Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who then was Prime Minister) described her action as part of the activities that the Islamic spiritual Fethulla Güllen brought against him and other people in power positions.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school
Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened on Monday (1 September) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsenij Jazenjuk brought his daughter to school.
There he informed waiting journalists that not all schools had opened again, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The September celebrations were not held in every school.
Heaven is not peaceful all over Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful sky.
The whole of Ukraine, a huge common Ukrainian People's Front, must fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksan Pastukhow, head of school in Slawjansk, visited Jazenjuk's daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that there will finally be peace here and that children will receive a education that will be useful to them in the future.
The first school day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated, with the children wearing embroidered shirts, holding balloons in the hands and giving flowers to their teachers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director she needs.
It meets with a proud splendid drag from the banking world, the media management and the inner circle of the Tory party.
And she has her own front experience.
Her career began with the global management consultancy company Bain and Co., where she moved to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world of Pearsons.
She was chairman of the Financial Times for seven years and resigned when the highest position of the parent company Pearson went to a younger male colleague.
It was allegedly almost £1 million.
Their political ranking is also solid.
She was recommended by Lord Browne, former chairman of BP, when he was looking for more private knowledge in Whitehall: she became the consultant of the Cabinet.
Her husband is a former Tory council member.
Already in May I described the task of the chairman with a poisoned cup.
Not only is the BBC a huge and complex unit in the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
Trust works in two directions: inward to the first guard of its own managerial archy in the BBC, but also to the outside as a voice of public concern and unrest when things go wrong.
This ensures an almost unsustainable duopoly, which requires complete, comprehensive reform.
But what new chairman would be at risk of attacking everything and breaking up an institution as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while he might be killing himself.
It's a difficult task.
And as if that wasn't enough, many are still interested in seeing the BBC reduced - power, money and status overtaken.
While competition is closer and new technologies are threatening old, comfortable security, the forthcoming negotiation of license fees for BBC is associated with special risks.
For the modest sum of £145.50 per year, the British public is buying into the world's certainly largest media company.
The BBC tells a good story: she says it reaches 96 percent of all households and each of them costs only 40 pence a day.
And apparently the BBC rises up again on the popularity scale: 53 percent support today, compared to 31 percent 10 years ago.
The visibility and usage habits for the BBC have changed: I get news headlines on my phone today and see missing programs later on my iPlayer.
But she remains a very beloved and remarkable institution.
She needs a remarkable chairman - I hope she found him.
Perry from Texas says that declining Tweet was not authorized
A twist from the official user account of the Republican Governor of Texas, Rick Perry, on Sunday contained a declining comment on the democratic district prosecutor, which is at the heart of a criminal prosecution against him for abuse of official power.
The Tweet was later deleted and replaced by another user account from Perry, who denied the previous account.
Just a tweet has been sent from my account, which was not authorized by me.
"I do not approve the Tweet and have erased it," it was said in the later news.
Personnel of Perry did not respond immediately to requests for comments.
Although the tweets of Perry's official user account went out, it was not clear who actually serves the feed.
In the former Tweet was drawn an unfavorable picture of the district prosecutor of Travis County, Rosemary Lehmberg, who was sentenced to the tax in April 2013 for drunkenness.
Perry set up a veto against the financial support of her office when she refused to resign, which led to a prosecution against Perry - which might be a presidential candidate in 2016 - before a Grand Jury this month in Austin.
The tweets text says, "I don't always drive drunk with the three-fold permissible alcohol level... but if I do, I'll sue Governor Perry if he spells it off."
I'm the most drunk Democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's office was not entrusted with the management of the Grand Jury's investigation against Perry.
This was led by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, selected by a Republican judge.
Perry pleaded for not guilty and called the accusation a political trick.
His high-class team of legal assistants requested the case-warden to reject the charges and argued that the law against the oldest governor in the history of the state of Texas is inconceivable.
Perry stopped $7.5 million of state funds to the Public Integrity Unit of the State - which is established in Travis County and investigated state corruption in Texas - when Lehmberg refused to resign.
This veto provided a public complaint from a left-hand watchdog group.
Perry's official user account is often updated - and sometimes famous.
After completing the election meetings in Iowa during his presidential candidate in 2012, Perry entered speculation that he would stop by posting a twist of a photo of himself while jogging near a lake, with the words "South Carolina, we are coming!"
Berkeley explains housing market again as "normal"
One of the most prominent construction entrepreneurs in London pointed out that the housing market in the south-east of England had returned to normal level.
Domestic homes in the capital were hot and subject to enormous price increases, which the Bank of England, due to the widespread fear of a credit bubble, moved to set ceilings for mortgage loans in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of the high-class construction company Berkeley said on Monday, "Since the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the highest level in 2013," and added that this offers a "stable action environment."
The real estate market in London was well established during the depreciation, as foreign buyers pushed into the capital.
According to information from the Catasteramt, prices in the urban area alone increased by 18.5 per cent last year, much more than the average increase in England and Wales as a whole.
The average sales prices at Berkeley's private, affordable and student offers increased by about one fifth in the past year and were at the end of April by £423.000.
However, in recent months a stronger pound has made real estate property in London less attractive for foreign buyers - some of them have also been frightened by the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetoric for a possible "Villensteuer" before the general elections in May.
The London real estate broker Foxtons warned last week that the mortgage market report for April, which presented more stringent credit bargaining schemes, would also lead to lower market growth in the second half of the year, both in real estate sales and in prices.
New data from the Bank of England from Monday show a decrease in the mortgage authorisation in July, which also indicates that the real estate market is cooling down.
Hamptions International, another real estate agency, corrected its forecast for the increase in real estate prices in London for 2015 downwards to 3 percent, based on an already weakening household price consciousness.
The volume of transactions in the most expensive areas of London such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington has now fallen by one quarter each year, according to the broker WA Ellis.
Nevertheless, the desire for a home in the capital of Berkeley is a blessing, as the amounts due for time sales amount to more than £2.2 billion.
Mr Pidgley added: "The demand for the right, well-planned product at the best locations remained stable and as a result, terminal sales remained stable."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year until the end of April - almost one third more than the maximum level of 2007 before the crisis.
The annual pre-tax result rose by 40 per cent to £280 million each year, the turnover by £18 per cent to £1.6 billion.
In a communication on Monday before the annual meeting of the company, Mr Pidgley said that the revenues for Berkeley in the current year are expected to correspond to current market expectations.
The analysts estimate the annual pre-tax result to GBP 450 million.
Berkeley shares were fixed at £23.96 in London in the afternoon.
Naked photos of Jennifer Lawrence published by hacker on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence is performing at the 85th Oscar ceremony.
Naked photos of the Oscar prize winner Jennifer Lawrence were published online by a hacker who claimed to have a "master list" of pictures of another 100 Starlets.
A representative of the star from "The Tribute of Panem" confirmed that the photos of Lawrence were real and accused the hacker of "unbelievable breach of privacy."
The authorities were notified and will follow all those who pass on the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos originally posted on photo sharing page 4chan were allegedly created by a gap in the online storage system iCloud by Apple. The alleged "master list" of the hack victims includes the names of dozens of female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, reported BuzzFeed.
It is not certain how many of the pictures are real, although Winstead, Star from "Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world" also condemned the hack on Twitter.
"To those of you who look at pictures that my husband and I took years ago in the private environment of our house - I hope you are so really satisfied with you," Winstead wrote on Twitter.
Victoria Justice, however, from the nickolodeon series "iCarly" and "Victorious," argued that the photos are pictures of her and tweeted "These so-called naked pictures of me are GEVELSCHT, people.
Why don't we go back to the beginning? * Word game is intended *.
Buzzfeed reported on the late Sunday that a spokesman of the Popstar Ariana Grande denied the authenticity of the alleged photos of her.
Exclusive extract from Howard Jacobson's highly praised new novel about love and the letter "J."
They flushed, so you could best describe it, they slowly dissolved like a cardboard that you left in the rain.
Occasionally a woman told him he was too serious, exhausting, intense, distant and perhaps a little scratchy.
And then shake his hand.
Kratzbrussig he knew.
He was stubborn, like Igel, yes.
The last sacrifice of this stubbornness was a just beginning affair which had been more promising for the relief of the lonely boredom of his life than usual, and might even have brought him a certain satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomon was a trembling delicate beauty with unnumbered hair and a flattering heart from a village on the North Island, which was even more remote and rough than Port Reuben.
She had come to the south with an older companion that Kevern thought was her aunt, and who inherited a property in a wet but paradise valley with the matching name Paradise Valley.
For several years no one had lived in that house.
The tubes were leaking, in the baths were spiders, naked snails had left their traces on all the windows and believed that they belonged to all this, and the garden was overgrown with weed, which looked like giant coal heads.
It was like the house from a children's fair, both threatening and tempting, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" stands on the Longlist for the Man Booker Prize 2014.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern had been sitting with Ailinn handedly on the broken chairs in the high grass and enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon. Both had been mentally absent in the service console that provided the country with calming music and disturbing news, when the face of their crossed brown legs remembered him to an old song of a long-forgotten black entertainer that his father had liked to slip at closed rolls in the house.
Your feet are too big.
Due to their ureigenic aggressiveness, songs of this kind were no longer played on the console.
Not forbidden - nothing was really forbidden - just not played.
It was successfully obsolescised, as the word obsolescence.
The general taste created what decree and rules would never have accomplished, and how people in books choose the From-plate washer-to-millionaire memoirs, cooking books and love novels, so they chose the ballasts at the music.
In the Euphory of the day, Kevern began to play an imaginary piano and sing in a rough-funny Serenade Ailine's big feet.
Ailinn didn't understand.
"This was a known song of a jazz pianist named Fats Waller," he explained to her and automatically put two fingers on his lips.
His father had always done that to stop the letter J before he got out of his mouth.
It had started as a game between him and his father when he was still a kid.
His father had played it with his own father, so he had told me.
If you start a word with a J without putting two fingers on your lips, it'll cost you a penny.
It had not been a very funny game since then, and it wasn't very funny even now.
He knew that this was expected of him, that's all.
It had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard one before.
Jazz was not played, even if it was not directly forbidden.
Improvising was no longer modern.
There was only room for a single "if" in life.
People wanted to be sure at the beginning of a melody where it would end.
So is the mind.
His unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was a musical mind.
Although he had become 10 years old without hearing from Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew something about jazz from his father's half-secret collection of old CDs.
But at least he didn't have to explain to Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
At her age she probably couldn't remember a time when pop singers weren't black.
Again, no laws or constraints.
A consistent society meant that each element of this society was grateful to the principle of group talent - thankful as those spared from fate.
People with Afro-Caribbean origin were suitable for entertainment and sports through temperament and body construction, so singing and running them.
People who originally came from the Indian subcontinent were blessed by nature with electronic talent and were cared for the task to ensure that no family remained without working service phone.
What was left of the Polish community took care of the sewerage; what was left of the Greeks, broke Teller.
Those from the Gulf States and the Levants whose grandparents had not left the country quickly as WAS WAS WAS SHOULD BE SHOULD - for fear of being accused of firearms, even for fear that the flames would consume them as the next - had opened labs and shisha pipe restaurants, held up and were depressed with the inactivity.
Everyone according to his abilities.
Since she had only heard ballads, it was difficult for Ailinn to understand how the insulting words that Kevern had just sung to her could ever be toned.
Music was expression of love.
"They're not really insulting," said Kevern.
Except maybe for people whose feet are too big.
My father never insulted anyone, but he loved this song.
He spoke too much, but the neglected garden gave him the sorrowful feeling of safety.
Nothing could overcome the sounding of the giant carbon leaves.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why should your father have loved something like that?
He wanted to say that it was a jux, but hesitated to put two fingers on her lips again in her presence.
She thought he was a little strange anyway.
"It seemed funny to him," he said instead.
She shook her head unfaithfully and blocked Kevern's sight.
There was nothing else around the world than her uncombed black hair.
There was nothing else he wanted to see.
"If you say it," I mean it without conviction.
But that doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
She seemed really worried.
Are my feet too big?
He looked again.
You don't have your feet like that.
Maybe your ankle, a little bit...
And you say you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
Hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
That's just the stupid song.
He could have said "I love you," but it was too early for that.
"Your thick ankles are exactly why I like you," he tried instead.
I'm a little perverted.
That didn't sound right.
It was supposed to be funny.
When he tried to be funny, he often put himself in trouble because he, like his father, did not have the soothing charm you needed to embrace the cruelty inherent in jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel too.
Maybe he wanted to be, Kevern.
Despite his friendly eyes.
Ailinn Solomon was red and raised out of her lounge chair, threw the console around, and washed the wine they had been drinking.
Holunderbloom wine, so drunkenness wasn't an excuse for him.
In her excitement she seemed to shake, like Palmwedel in the storm.
"And your thick head is exactly why I feel perverted to you," she said...
Except that's not me at all.
She was sorry for both the unnecessary unkindness of his words and the fear that appeared in her eyes when she turned up against him.
Did she think he'd hit her?
She had not told him about life on the cold northern archipelago where she had grown up, but he had no doubt that it was essentially the same as here.
The same huge and ice-cold ocean broke down here as there on the shore.
The same confused men, with even thicker skin and more devastating according to what happened to their ancestors as smugglers and beach robbers, moved from bar to bar, always ready to raise the hand against a woman who refused or relieved them.
Dickhead?
They would have shown her a thick fist if she hadn't looked out!
They first cuddle - Knutschen was the most commonly used word for an erotic attraction between men and women, a counterpoison to the non-sailing love balloons from the console - they first cuddle and then beat.
According to Kevern, this was an unnecessary refinement, as the Knutschen itself was already an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomon gave him a sign to go through her body.
He raised himself from the chair like an old man.
She also felt bleached, but the wound of his grief surprised her.
That wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
She looked at him as he removed - as from a room on the upper floor her companion to see him - a man complained by something he had complained of himself.
Adam left the garden, thought she.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, although some had raised their hands against her.
A man turned away from her, bowed his back, shamed, defeated, without a spirit of battle - why was this a sight she seemed to know well if she couldn't remember a single time when she had seen something like this before today?
When she was alone again, Ailinn saw Solomon on her feet.
Several years before the just mentioned events, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher on behalf of Ofnow, the non-legislative public atmosphere monitoring body, worked on a brief presentation on the continued violence at a low and medium level in precisely the areas where their reduction, if not abolition, would have been most likely, in view of the money and energy that had been invested in the eradication of this violence.
"Much has already been done, and much still has to be done," she wrote, "to humiliate the congenital aggression of a people who led thousands of wars and won most of them, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country where the sweet breath of human friendliness was rarely known historically despite the highly challenging church towers between the corners.
But some properties appear to be inextinguishable.
The higher the church tower, it seems, the lower the passion he continues to wake.
The people cry when they listen to sentimental ballads, rejoice in stories about overwhelmed difficulties and claim to believe firmly in the virtues of marriage and family life, but yet not only the former raw ness holds the rural communities as well as our urban structures firmly in hand, but there is also evidence for the emergence of a new and deceptive struggle at home, at work, on the streets and even on the playfields.
"They have an unfortunate tendency to exaggerate," her mentor said when he had read the whole report.
I suggest you read less novels.
Esme nut tree lowered her head.
I also have to ask, are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to say that," replied Esme Nussbaum.
Are you a lesbian?
Again, Esme invoked her right to privacy and refusal of the statement.
Feminist?
Again silence.
"I do not ask," Luther Rabinowitz finally said, "because I would be against attitudes, lesbians or feminism.
This is a precedent-free job.
We serve a privileged society.
But certain types of hypersensitivity, which are absolutely acceptable and commendable in itself, may sometimes distort results as you have imagined them.
You yourself obviously have prejudices against the Church, and these things, which you call "perverted" and "raw," could be interpreted by others as well as expression of natural strength and vitality.
If one continues to ride around on what has been done, WELL it is done as if it had happened yesterday, it means taking the country's essential viability.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head, a LED letter in Flamingorosa repeated the advice that Ofnow had given to the country in the last quarter of a century or more.
If you smile at your neighbor, appreciate your partner, listen to Balladen, visit musicals, use your phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence, the singing word is better than the written, but nothing is better than love.
"I absolutely understand what you want," Esme Nussbaum replied with a quiet voice when she was sure that her superior had finished speaking, "and I say nothing but that we are not as effective healed as we are doing ourselves.
My concern is that, without warning, we may be able to recall the mistakes that have been made at all when it was done.
This time, however, it is not the others in which we let our anger and our mistrust go.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his hands.
In order to show an angel patience.
"You go too far," he said, "if you call acts" mistakes "that our grandparents may have committed or have not committed.
They also go too far when you talk about that they would have left out their "anger" and their "suspicion" to "others."
It should not really be necessary to remind anyone in your position that we are talking about "us" and "others" when we understand the past like protecting the present.
There was no "we" and there was no "others."
It was a time of disorder, that's all we know.
"Of which, when we are honest with ourselves," dared esme, "no part of society can claim to have behaved well.
I'm not accusing anyone.
Whether it was bad or good done what happened has happened.
That was back then.
There is nothing more to be said about this - we agree.
And just as no blame has to be attributed, no blame has to be erased if such eradication would be appropriate and if there was a way to eradicate it.
But for what does the past serve if we don't learn from it -
The past serves us to forget it.
If I may say anything about this...
Luther Rabinowitz dropped his pyramid.
"I will remember her report," he said and released her.
The next day, when she went to work as usual, she was overrun by a motorcycle driver who, as passengers described, had been driven on the foot in a kind of "brutal anger."
There are coincidences.
Lesotho military member says that no state strike is planned; Prime Minister stays in South Africa
Officials of the military in Lesotho denied to have planned a state strike to crash the government and said they were taking action against politicians who are accused of armed political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled from the country and announced that the army of the country had converted its office and occupied government buildings in the capital of Maseru.
The Prime Minister brought his family to neighbouring South Africa after he had reported assassination threats.
Military spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said that there is in fact no state strike, but that the military react to the threat by "political fanatics," whose weapons were ahead by the police.
"What happened this morning was that the staff of Lesotho's defense forces acted after having received several intelligence reports that within the police were acting some elements that actually wanted to armed some of the political, party-political young fanatics who were about to cause devastating damage," he said to Voice of America.
South African Prime Minister Clayson Monyela said that the military activity made the impression of a crash.
"Even though no one has claimed to have ripped the government by force on itself, all reports agree that the activities of Lesotho's defense forces have so far shown signs of a state strike," he said.
Speakers of the army of Lesotho announced on Sunday that the soldiers would withdraw into their barracks and that the situation in the capital would be quiet.
In the meantime, the Vice Prime Minister Mothetjoya Metsing takes over the government during Thabane's absence.
Thabane informed him that he believed he had become a target because of his attempt to fight corruption in the country.
In Lesotho there have been great tensions since June after Thabane postponed parliamentary meetings due to the conflicts in his united government.
He said that his actions would not have undermined the government, in spite of other loud accusations.
Production in the euro area at a 13-month depth
The increase in production in the euro area slowed down to the lowest point in the last 13 months in August, a closely observed study.
The final market-management index of the manufacturing industry (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, at a level of 51.8 in July.
An indication of more than 50 indicates an expansion.
New orders went down and factories experienced burglaries in a time of rising tension between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures shall be recorded before the European Central Bank (ECB) meeting on Thursday.
The markets expect the Bank to have a clear plan for dealing with a hesitating recovery of the euro area and for the threat of deflation at a inflation rate of only 0.3%.
There are speculations that the Head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, could provide further information this week on whether it is considering a quantitative relief for the euro area, in line with those made by the United Kingdom and the US during the financial crisis.
"Although a small growth is better than no growth at all, the remedial effects of growing economic and geopolitical uncertainties have become clearer for manufacturers," said Rob Dobson, leading economists at Markit.
The PMI factory for Germany, the largest trading partner in Russia in the EU, fell to the deepest level in 11 months with 51.4.
In the meantime, in the second largest economic nation of the block, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
France remains a caring child, as well as the descent of Italy from a solid expansion to stagnation.
Indicators that growth incentives in the key industrial mechanism are no longer taking place in Germany as well as in Spain and the Netherlands are also not reassuring, "said Mr Dobson.
The decline in industry is likely to disrupt the fire of analysts who expect further monetary or fiscal incentives.
A positive message came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, Chief Business Expert at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing you can say for the purchasing management index of the manufacturing industry in the euro area in August is that after that the sector continues to grow."
He added: "Producers in the euro area are apparently finding life quite difficult at present, as the current increased geopolitical tensions - especially with regard to Russia and Ukraine - increase uncertainties in the still difficult conditions in many countries.
These increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - in particular, and consumer confidence, and are likely to lead to some delays or even cancellations, in particular major contracts.
He said that it would be "increasingly likely" that the ECB would eventually have to launch a type of QE, "although we suspect that this will be limited."
The age of hell of the survivors of Beslan: ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school, as the children in it still suffer today.
Ten years ago more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechnya militia at a school in Beslan in South Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day martyrdom that shocked the world.
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped the death of the cruelty in the classroom.
Just a decade after the horrible siege of the school of Beslan, where 334 people died, including 186 children, the heroic survivors last night warned against a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When fanatic Islamic terrorists captured and killed children and parents on 1 September 2004, the beginning of a new school year, it seemed like the worst of evil.
The tragedy united West and East into disgrace, and then surprisingly turned into action and hope for the future in the middle of the worst misery.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death at the cruelty in the classroom.
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, although the memory of this terrorist hell will persecute them forever.
Your greatest hope?
That the war that is now destroying Ukraine - and in the child as they die - will now end.
The girl that was photographed in trying to climb back into the broken school sports hall
She was photographed by Russian starphotographer Dimitri Beliakov and famous when she only tried in her underwear to climb back into the broken school sports hall after a mine had been exploded.
Aida was completely confused looking for her mother Larissa, now 40 years old.
Both were considered dead, but they survived.
"A woman told me to run around my life, but I couldn't," said Aida.
My legs were blooded.
I got up and climbed back in to look for my mother.
A soldier made her safe.
After a number of operations she thought she was completely healed, but yesterday she said: "Three months ago the pain returned.
I'm afraid I have to be operated again.
Some grenades are still in my knee.
Her goal is now to become a dentist to help people how doctors helped her.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it didn't break me," she says fierce.
"That's what happened to me, and you can't change that.
Once a year, I always go to the sports hall to remember those who stayed there.
My friends and I are trying not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too big.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were little and dreamed of going to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I finish my studies and start my career.
I'm thinking about a family later.
She says that the siege will always remain part of it, although the memory becomes slightly weaker every year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our fears and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in Britain and everywhere.
When I see the photo of me online, how I climb back to school, I think that many people see it for the first time, understand our catastrophe and contribute to that something doesn't happen again.
The boy who flew through the bullet hail in the opinion that his mother was dead
It was his first school day (Russians going to school at 7 years) and survived the three-day siege in his mother Tamara's arms.
As a seven-year-old, he said, "Mama told me to lie down if there was an explosion, and hold her hand."
After an explosion, he thought she'd die.
She said to him, "Run."
Full of fear that she could be dead, he fled and saw on the way a weeping child, grabbed it by the hand and fled through a bullet hail.
His father Vladimir, who locked his son out into his arms, said, "Damir told me his mother died.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In reality, Tamara had stumbled outside and with bone injuries in the hospital, assuming her son had died.
After her reunification, she said, "I cried for joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir was later flew to London (by the newsletter News of the World) to receive the title of a Barnardo's Children's Champion by Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"This horror is following you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering," he said yesterday.
But I can say it's going to bleach in my memory.
I remember throwing away all my toy guns right after that.
But now I can play computer games with shooting scenes and that's no problem for me.
"I am not afraid to go back to the sports hall, but I am not thinking about myself.
I remember those kids I played in the courtyard with, and they didn't make it out.
We never say they were killed or dead.
We say they stayed in the sports hall.
I remember very well my trip to London, especially the toy store where I could pick everything I wanted, and the ride in an upstairs open car.
But now he is afraid of place like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of misfortune he and his friends suffered.
This horror is following you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
"I am so sorry for all those who suffer from the cruelty," said Damir, who worked the last week as a volunteer in a monastery.
I want to help so much.
I want to go to the police one day and hope they'll take me to the school next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said, "37 children from our neighborhood were killed, can you imagine that?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there were simply no children who could call and walk around, and this silence lasted many months.
She remembers her journey to London with Damir alive.
The people in London were crying when I told our story.
I understood how people on the other side of the world could understand our feelings and show their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the price and opportunity to travel to London in the autumn of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and just tell her that ten years have passed, but I still remember the meeting her and her husband in London, and how Damir and I helped.
I remember Damir wanted to eat Borschtsch and called them all local Russian restaurants.
I remember playing with waiters in a restaurant. Damir shot her with his water gun and they ran away and played with him.
And that was just a month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British so willingly shared our pain and supported us.
She said, "I always think that this world has not improved in these 10 years.
In Ukraine the war continues now, and every day people die, and I believe that many children have been killed and are still being killed.
They're just kids like ours.
I think that for many of the war is part of the news they hear when they're bored or busy with something else.
I just know what these people feel, all the horror.
And I can't stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and that is so sad.
Damir grew up and is a very gentle and quiet boy, he is not aggressive or angry at all.
For example, he is not looking for revenge, he is not overwhelmed by the past cruelty.
I know he doesn't like to remember, but he has six close friends from the class and they sometimes go to the sports hall and light candles there.
When he was smaller, he suffered - I remember how he sometimes lay on the sofa, turned his face off us for hours.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he threw all his weapons and other military toys away. Damir is now 17, bigger than me, handsome, intelligent and healthy.
I can't believe I was so sure for a few hours that he was dead and I would never see him again.
When I recovered after the explosion and came on my legs, I looked around, and saw hell around me, with body parts all around me.
I was absolutely sure my little boy couldn't have survived in this hell.
"I remember calling to him," Damir, run, run away, "but I was so sure he didn't hear me.
But he heard it, and he ran away.
And so life goes on for us, unlike many others.
Georgij Ilyin, 17
The boy whose horrible image after the siege became the symbol of the Greuel of Beslan
Consolation: The Beslan surviving Georgij Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege 2004, on the right a picture of Georgij today
His blood-overflow face was drawn by fear when he ran around his life while Chechnya terrorists shot down his classmates.
His image was one of the most shocking symbols for the barbary of Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, had dropped him for his first day of school before she rushed to take her older son Vladimir to the university.
"I left the courtyard about two minutes before the terrorists stormed him, and so my little boy stayed there for three terrible days alone," she remembers.
Not entirely alone, there was a whole family of our relatives, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgij managed to survive.
The closer this date comes, the harder it is to think about it and to talk about it.
There's no single day we don't remember this tragedy.
We don't think it's been a long time, I mean, it would have happened yesterday, some scenes from these days are always following me.
No one will ever forget that, I promise you.
Intrinsically: The image of Georgij (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was consecrated as a statue (right).
I remember Georgij wanted to go to school that day and he said he wanted to hug his teacher.
I only knew he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there is even this statue of the crying Georgij in San Marino.
Georgij does not like to see the picture, and it is hidden at our house in the bookshelf.
I understand that, but I also think that the people of the world feel our pain thanks to this image.
Georgij says today: "It is important that such a thing can never happen again.
"I doubt we'll ever know the truth.
People are constantly investigating such tragedies and never knowing the truth.
And now they're investigating the crash of this Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever find out what caused him?
This world is turning into something horrible.
"I can't understand how that is possible, because if you ask people, no one wants a war, so how does that happen?
Ten years are nothing in such pain.
We need dozens of years to forget about it a little bit.
It attacked my health and I still feel it.
For about three or four years, I had some nightmares for the siege, but then it got better.
I went back to school later in 2004 and was afraid every day.
I was thinking of my friends and classmates who had been killed.
That's why I always go to the sports hall when the 1st of September gets closer.
I want to tribute my old childhood friends tribute.
It's hard for me to go to the sports hall, but I have to do it.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is now part of my past.
I'm not gonna forget it, but I'm not sorry.
My life goes on.
I finished school this year and visit a medical university in Vladikawkaz.
I'm gonna be a heart surgeon.
My first choice was training in the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health didn't let that happen.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that's not going to happen.
Georgij Fanijew, 20
The boy who survived even though he was trapped at the feet of a murderous terrorist
A miracle: Georgij Fanijew was captured to the feet of a murderous terrorist during the siege, but he managed to survive.
During the siege, he was trapped in the sports hall and sat next to the bomb attached to the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It's really a miracle he wasn't killed.
"We feel like it was yesterday," says Georgij, who wanted to go to FSB as a secret agent, but could not do this because of his health damage due to the siege.
It's still with me. It's nothing I left behind.
I am now older and people say that children can easily handle bad experiences - I have to say that that is not true.
"2006 I worked with psychologists and felt a little better afterwards, but I can't forget it.
And I'd like to forget.
2005 - in the year after - was the first and only time I went back to the sports hall.
I lost consciousness.
I will never go back there and please don't ask me to show you where I sat in this famous picture.
Survivors: Georgij Fanijew today, with a photo of himself in the hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is immense and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know I don't like to think about it or talk about it and they never asked me about school.
Physically, I'm fine.
I should be careful with my wounded knee, but I can walk well now.
But because of my health, I couldn't study at the FSB Secret Service Academy in St. Petersburg as I wanted.
I filed my records, including medical records, and they answered that it was not possible.
My second passion was the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I've been behind it for two years.
He teaches the treatment of all animals "from cats to cows."
He said, "I knew I'd never tell my children about my experiences.
Children should not know about this and they should, of course, not suffer it either.
His mother Marina, 42, said, "This pain never leaves me.
He's in my soul, worse when the anniversary comes closer.
I'll go to the celebrations for remembrance.
I know Georgij won't go.
It must be a lot harder for him because he was there and I wasn't.
I waited at home for him and couldn't help.
I am so grateful to God that he was given back to me. Here in Beslan all of them are drawn.
It stays in us.
Georgij is now an adult, but this horror is still inside him.
It's hard to accept that when something so unfair happens to you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't participate because of his knee.
He was operated several times, he can walk, but he can't do sports.
I would say that he has overcome the horror of 50%, but you can never completely overcome it and forget it.
This terrible experience will always follow us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed in the siege and this only increases my pain.
I've lost a lot of people I knew well and they were expensive to me.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift God could make me, but my heart cries for the dead.
I know about families where new children were born, but also about widows who have never married again.
It's hard to accept that life continues, even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget how my heart jumped into me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what's going on in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is now very close to our country and I can't believe it.
We used to be a friendly country, how can it be that we are fighting now?
People and children suffer, I am sure that many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many are still being killed.
If only we could grab all these rebels and throw them out - as far away as possible.
Aljona Czechoslovakia, 10
The baby that was so seized by a special operation command in safety
Rescued: Aljona Cschajewa is secured by a Russian Special Operation Command (left).
It is now ten (right) and does not remember the cruelty at all
The world stopped breathing in 2004 when the baby Aljona was carried in the arms of a Russian policeman from the siege of Beslan.
The terrorists let her go, but in their cruelty their 30-year-old mother, the ten-year-old sister Kristina and her brother Makhar held back in the school sports hall.
Makhar, three years old, escaped, but Aljona's mother and sister died in the murderous slaughter.
Her father Ruslan has married again since then and has with his new wife Swetlana a little girl that he named after his lost daughter Kristina.
Aljona, ten years old today, does not remember the siege and has grown into a smart and happy girl, "neighbours say.
"You are now a great happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to spare them all the memories of the 10th anniversary.
You'll understand why.
Man accused of having overrun girls on pedestrian crossing into fife
A 78-year-old man is in court for a three-year-old girl on a pedestrian crossing in Fife.
Gordon Steward is accused of having hit a girl on the transition to Pittenween in East Neuk.
The charges indicate that Mr. Steward had controlled his Audi Q3 without the necessary care and attention and violated the girl.
Stewart, 78, from Anstruther, denied the charges in front of the Dundee Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC started the trial for January.
4 tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you want to take photos or videos under water, there is a selection of devices.
The cheapest option is a waterproof point and shoot, such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action camera like the GoPro Hero3 + Silver Edition, which are both for about $300.
I took these photos at a family party with several cameras that are all available at a price of less than 350 $.
Regardless of the equipment, there are some rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery compartment and other compartments are tightly closed.
Set your camera also on the photos or videos you want to take.
Some cameras and camcorders have scene and reception modes that optimize the exposure time for the damp underwater conditions.
And before you jump in, check to what depth your equipment is capable of.
Some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.
Find digital cameras in our shopping guide and the reviews for conventional and waterproof models.
Make multiple recordings - because many will not work.
Point-and-Shoot cameras have a LCD that allows you to compose images, Action-Cams usually do not.
Even if you have a LCD, it's hard to watch this under water, and the right image setting is a lucky thing.
So do a lot of footage.
If your camera has a series mode that makes a number of recordings with slightly changed exposure settings, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light gets dramatically worse, the further you get away from the surface.
If possible, stay close to the surface if you take pictures in a pool, a lake or the sea.
This way you can also bring more color to your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Get close to the objects.
This is also a good advice on land, but it is all the more important because of the poor light conditions.
It is particularly important if you work with an action camera: These devices often have a fixed long angle line, which means that you need to get closer to your objects if they are to fill the entire frame.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the kind whose character changes things, even in such a giant organization as the NHS.
As an advisory anesthetic physician, he devoted his career to saving the sick both the agony of the disease and the sufferings of the treatment.
Among his patients, his wife remembers, was a MI6 employee who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that the physicians are important to the diagnosis and diseases, while the treatments are mostly busy with something quite different: pain.
However, one day in 2007 he was the one whose path of suffering began.
"I haven't felt," he wrote in May this year.
I had trouble picking up.
As he fought with the flu-like symptoms, he noticed that he was impatient to his wife Juliet.
"I'd rather do everything right away than later," he noted.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt unusual and undisturbed.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to conduct an X-ray examination of his chest.
Two weeks ago, he was in the French Alps for skiing.
The result of the X-ray examination was available.
He suffered from mesothelioma, an unhealing cancer that attacks the chest, so that the lungs attack the skin of the lungs.
As with most cancer diseases, the exact trigger is usually difficult to determine.
While, for example, some smokers suffer from lung cancer, not all lung cancer patients have been previously smokers.
But Mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is an asbestos load - contact with the fibre material, which was once considered to be "miraculous" but has now been recognised as fatal.
For most of us mesothelioma is a disease that can easily ignore.
Asbestos is a product of the past.
The most dangerous asbestos type has not been used in Britain since the 1960s when the industry voluntarily committed itself to not using it anymore.
Even where it was still used, only people in certain industries worked directly with the fabric - adhesives, construction workers, carpets and shipyards, for example.
As an industrial hazard from another time, he seems to be hardly yet worrying today.
But this self-satisfaction is inappropriate.
Britain, it seems, is experiencing the highlight of a mesoltheliom epidemic today.
There are more deaths due to mesothelioma here than any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, twice as many people die of this disease as in road accidents.
Annual figures of Mesotheliom deaths since 1980 and foreseeable future deaths in the United Kingdom
The reason why we are experiencing the deadly effects now, although asbestos has been illegal for years (all asbestos types were banned in 1999) is that a mesothelioma is developing only after decades.
And the scourge of the mesothelioma is not limited to former workers of the construction industry.
Asbestos was and is often still present in the houses in which we live, the offices in which we work, the schools in which we learn and the shops in which we buy.
And therefore Mesotheliom does not know any class barriers, financial boundaries, professions or age.
The privileged bastions, from the elegant shopping houses in London to private schools, are not a protection room.
Parliament's buildings are asbestos-contaminated.
Even in the hospitals where we are supposed to be healthy, this deadly carcinogenicity has already been identified as an exit.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't a plumber either.
In fact, it was difficult for him to imagine where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he found out.
"It looks like there was a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I completed my training for six years." He wrote.
All - students, nurses, doctors and porters - use the tunnels.
You wonder how many of my elderly people will suffer from the same disease?
Unfortunately, he was able to answer this question at least in part.
"Of the four doctors who have been trained at Guy's Hospital and who have been ill in Mesotheliom for the last five years," he wrote in a letter in 2010, "I am the last person who is still alive."
How many of us will still be sick?
With Andrew Lawson Mesotheliom was diagnosed at the age of 48.
When he died on February 17 this year, he was 55.
That was an unusually long survival.
Fifty percent of all mesothelioma patients die within 8 months of diagnosis.
The disease always ends deadly.
We can therefore only repeat Lawson's question: "How many of us will still be ill?"
The UK's leading expert on Mesotheliom, Professor Julian Peto, assumes that between 1870 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in the United Kingdom is expected to be eradicated, a total of 90,000 of the disease will have been sacrificed.
Most of them have no idea at the moment that they will die like this.

A short look at the files of the courts, to which the persons concerned are often referring for claims for damages, shows how widespread the scourge of the mesotheliom is already.
In June of this year, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted that Janice Allen had neglected asbestos.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987 and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations - one of them the Flagshipstore in Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years when she started her work at M & S.
Now she has two children in the 20s.
"Before this thing," she says, "I had never heard of Mesothelioma, I didn't even really know anything about asbestos.
I never thought this would affect me.
There are only a few people who know a lot about asbestos.
The fact is that the term asbestos does not refer to a substance, but to a group of six minerals.
The name touches from the word "asbestiform," a description of the fibre structure that makes the substance resistant and flexible.
Three of the six were used in construction.
Chrysotil, also known as white asbestos, is the most frequently found asbestos in buildings today.
It was used for roof plates, floor plates, pipe isolations, boiler insulations, even for braking coatings in cars.
It is less fatal than other forms of asbestos, but it is still considered by the EU and the WHO as a "great health risk" with possible death sequences.
However, the brown asbestos (amosite) and the blue asbestos (crokydolith) are more dangerous.
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suspect that "there are clear but indirect indications that this was a main reason for the unique high mesothelium rates."
A staff of Marks & Spencer was exposed to Alamy at the flagshipstore at Oxford Street, London, Asbest
Janice Allen may not have seen himself as a typical mesothelioma victim, but Julian Peto's work suggests that her history is not unusual.
He has presented a study by the interested parties showing that "a significant proportion of mesothelioma without known suspension was caused by work or by asbestos contact in the environment in the home."
Most of these contacts are based on the "normal use and ageing" of our buildings.
It looks like no one can expect to be safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which has investigated the Palace of Westminster, shows how people could have been exposed to the substance unknowingly in the heart of the government.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the service shafts and pipes behind the parliamentary committees were contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibers could be triggered by something as harmless as "strong air movements."
Members of Parliament are often accused of taking care of their own interests, but here it seems to be the opposite.
While the Directorate of the Parliamentary Labour Service insisted that the Westminster Palace had received a "clean health certificate," it is undeniable that one billion pounds of work will have to be spent over several years to renovate Parliament, modernise the electrical installations and remove the asbestos, and that, after the general elections in 2015, Members will probably meet in the nearby QE2 conference centre rather than on the green benches in Westminster.
The Goddard report also pointed out that "the presence of asbestos has not been handled in accordance with the relevant provisions."
No one can know if this mismanagement will cost lives.
All you can do now is wait.
A person who could never exactly determine the contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general doctor.
Like Andrew Lawson, the 50-year-old Abbot suspects that he was exposed to asbestos during his work in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital where asbestos charges were decided positively," he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It's so hard to remember all the places you've been working on, and the data.
What he remembers exactly is the day at the beginning of December 2009, where he got some kind of fever.
He was 45 years old, and just had an operation late in the evening.
Suddenly, I had chills.
It came all of a sudden.
I felt terrible.
I didn't think I could make it home anymore.
As a doctor Abbott knew that the pain of the chest fell, the skin around his lungs was stirring.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect a mesothelioma.
He didn't go to work for a month.
Surprised doctors made X-rays of his chest and put on pleuracathether to extract fluid from the lungs and test in the laboratory.
However, his complaints remained without diagnosis.
His health improved slowly, and he returned to work.
However, from time to time the symptoms returned, often after sports activity and heavy breathing.
In 2011 a patient Abbotts came with similar symptoms in his practice and was later diagnosed with mesotheliom.
But even now Abbott does not associate this with his own case.
Finally, his patient was several decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in the case was clear.
In September 2011 Abbott's condition deteriorated again and his homephysician brought his CT scans and X-rays to an expert group.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott had felt ill for the first time, a probe equipped with a camera was introduced into the cave between the rib and the chest.
I'm an optimist.
He says, "I usually just keep going."
Honestly, I didn't worry so much.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy was in the week between Christmas and New Year: "They told me it was Mesotheliom."
Graham Abbott: Diagnosis Mesothelioma
Suddenly Abbott had dates with Macmillan nurses, one of whom recommended him to take a lawyer.
Only now did he understand the extent of the epidemic.
"It turned out that asbestos was very widespread, especially in large public buildings where pipes were often isolated with asbestos," he said.
The people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now ill.
And so Mesotheliom now meets younger people who have not worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous pipes with asbestos insulation in hospitals were below the ground, so patients were probably not exposed to the substance.
But many of the employees who ate in pedestrian tunnels from one building to another (such as Andrew Lawson) or in underground cantines (as Graham Abbott often did) came with the greatest likelihood of contact with the toxic substances.
It appears that for several decades after the war hospitals may have been life-saving for patients, but life-threatening for the treating doctors.
He's still getting away today.
Pupils put their bunny burners on asbestos mats.
And it's not just about hospitals.
Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and city halls because of its fabulous isolating and flammable properties.
Schools too.
In fact, many people probably had the first asbestos contact in the classroom.
Everywhere in the country, in thousands of hours of chemistry, pupils have turned their bunch burners on asbestos mats.
The topic of asbestos in schools is now frequently addressed on web pages.
And that's why innocent objects in our houses, such as floor plates or scaffolding towels, have contained asbestos as standard.
"It is an industrial poison that is contained in large parts of our property," notes Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his trial against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact that occurred to a woman concerned was the disappearance of a garden shed in the 1970s.
So watch how you tear off your garden shed.
The effects of the diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is unhealing, are immense.
"It takes a while to process it," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to move on, but I realized I couldn't focus on what I did.
I was in practice for two weeks.
Then I knew I had to go and take care of myself.
Well, I'm not going to have another Christmas party.
With the greatest difficulty, the change of perspective was from the position of a doctor to that of a patient.
Like numerous patients before him, he remembers how overwhelming he was from all the information he had to deal with.
"It was very hard to record all this," he says.
"I asked my doctor how long do I have?"
And they gave me about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not going to have another Christmas party.
That's it. "
Mesothelioma is particularly homicidal because it is our life conservation mechanism - breathing itself - that causes fatal cancer.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by asbestos contact.
Asbestos consists of the smallest fibres.
When the asbestos is wiped up and the fibres are inhaled, they can be fixed in the chest, the skin around the lungs.
Asbestos fibres irritate the chest and can cause cell mutations.
"The problem arises with the inhaled needle-shaped asbestos fibres," said Professor Tom Treasure, a heart thorax doctor who switched to Guy's Hospital in 2001.
Just the hospital Andrew Lawson suspects has exposed him to the asbestos is now ironically, a leading centre in the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some others, who were probably also exposed to asbestos during their training at the hospital.
As soon as the asbestos needles reach the pulmonary tissue, Treasure says, "they are pushed from the breathing process to the edge where the skin is.
From nature it's invasive from the beginning.
The usual options in other cancer diseases do not work so well in mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of an operation is, for example, controversial.
Some think it's worth a try.
Treasure denies that.
"You can't cut out the chest," he says.
They don't come around with the knife for that.
Therefore, cancer "does not respond very well to chemotherapy," which "shows effect," but does not heal.
"Sometimes there are long-term survivors," says Treasure.
But at the end they all die.
Fortunately, some patients actually live long, much longer than expected.
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still fighting.
After having contacted Mesotheliom, Abbott came into contact with Andrew Lawson, who four years after his diagnosis had become a one-man support and consultancy office for those affected.
"Hello, Cancer Center," he was happy to introduce himself to calls.
"He was very positive," Abbott says.
He had received his diagnosis 4 years earlier and was still very active.
Originally, Abbott had been offered six chemotherapy cycles that would last four months and probably only extend his life by one month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
However, Lawson managed to "make things appear in a slightly more positive light."
After consulting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, heart thorax specialist at Guy's.
"We had an advantage because I didn't have to be referred forward, I just called and got an appointment," Graham admits.
A normal patient should be given a transfer and have to wait for treatment to be approved.
Money is crucial for mesothelioma sick in order to experience the best available therapies.
But if these treatments finally fail inevitably, many people are concerned by another financial concern - about the future of the families they leave behind.
So they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous for health," says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s is that one realized that a very small burden was also a health risk.
And here the negligence of companies began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital finally studied their case, but it was not what Morgan called a "full compensation," because Lawson was not able to prove with absolute certainty that his mesothelioma was due to an asbestos contact at Guy's.
However, after the investigation of his death, a spokesman of the Guy confirmed that "the asbestos fibres were removed in the affected cellar area in the 1990s."
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
In fact, it is an enormous problem for mesothelioma injured people who are trying to compensate for the fatal asbestos contact of a company or a job - usually decades after the incidents.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance documents may be lost.
And those who oppose claims know that the time is for them, but certainly not with the applicants.
In response to this this year, there have been significant new legislation that makes it easier for Mesotheliom-affected people to claim compensation even if their former employers are no longer found.
The law has set up a fund of £350 million supported by the insurance industry for all who have been diagnosed after July 2012, can prove a contact but cannot sue anyone.
In these cases, the plaintiffs receive 80% of what a court could have attributed to them in a normal compensation procedure - about £120,000.
Approximately 300 successful applications for the programme are expected per year.
Andrew Morgan, like so many Mesotheliom affected, thinks that £350 million represented a "very good work" of the insurance industry.
"This is a deal of insurers for insurers," he says, and suggests that this sum is a quarter of what insurers would have had to pay if the time had not gone over and Mesotheliom-sick found the companies and could normally sue them.
Also Mike Penning, then Minister of Labour and Pension, admitted that the law was "not perfect."
But both Penning and Morgan admitted that, in the face of seven deaths every day, rapid action is necessary.
"People suffer so much and need help today," said Penning during the second hearing of the Mesotheliom Act in December last year.
At that time Graham Abbott has been in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After their first discussions, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation of which he expects a positive effect in contrast to Tom Treasure.
This was accompanied by radiation therapy and chemotherapy - a triple therapy that allows long-lazdunski to present a survival rate of up to 40 percent over five years.
Abbott felt stronger.
"This is of course the most important thing," Abbott says.
You see that all the time in patients.
There's something that makes you go on.
If you give up, you're going to get worse.
Graham Abbott underwent the operation in March 2012.
At the end of August he had the last of the six chemotherapy cycles behind him.
After-care cans showed no signs of disease.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancer spots around my chest.
I just got 50.
That's not life-threatening.
It's life-consuming.
Abbott again underwent six chemotherapy cycles.
Now no trace of tumours is visible.
But the process is physically and psychically very exhausting.
You need to think of practical things - about the money when I am no longer, for example, or show my wife how the boiler time setting works.
If you get bad news, you'll be negative.
You have to look forward.
As Ellie's father, 16, and Tamsin, 14, this is not always easy.
"It's hard for parents," he says.
It's hard to know what to say and how much.
When I got my first diagnosis, I told my girl I had a disease I wouldn't get old with.
They responded quite differently.
Tamsin is very cheerful and unstubborn.
She told her friends and we got a lot of calls soon.
Ellie was more restrained.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients have to go through.
But for mesothelioma patients such conversations have not gone through by hope, not by a trace of hope for survival.
The disease brings a grim security (as is finally the case for Stephen Jay Gould).
As Andrew Morgan says, "Mesothelioma is not life-threatening.

China denies Hong Kong the right to government elections, demonstrators swear vengeance
On Sunday, in spite of the increased call for democratic reforms, the Chinese Parliament decided against the nomination of candidates for the 2017 elections by the Hong Kong electoral community.
This approach probably fires the long-announced protests in Hong Kong's business district, while activists led to planning and mobilisation within a few hours of the deception.
The decision of the Chinese People's Congress allows the Communist leaders in principle to reject all undeniable candidates.
"This does not come unexpectedly, but it makes us angry," said right-wing expert Emily Lau, chairman of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing promised.
They lied to the people of Hong Kong.
And it's clear that we're dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In his defence of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, Deputy Secretary-General of the Permanent Committee of the National People's Congress, said that the admission of public nominations to the Hong Kong Government elections would be too "chaotic."
Since 1997, when the UK returned control over Hong Kong to the Chinese, Beijing promised to let the residents choose the government presidency from 2017 onwards.
The Chinese leadership presented the decision of Sunday as a democratic breakthrough because there is a direct electoral right for Hong Kong citizens, but the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese leadership maintains the process by a nomination committee closely controlled by Beijing.
In addition, according to a new clause, only candidates "with love for the country and love for Hong Kong" should be admitted.
The decision follows a summer in which some of the biggest and most publicly effective protests have taken place in Hong Kong for several years.
Against the prodemocratic campaign in Hong Kong, the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organisers threatened to defeat the financial district if Beijing did not allow a genuine universal electoral right.
On Sunday evening, hundreds of Occupy Central followers had gathered in the rain in Hong Kong within a few hours of the decree.
During the demonstration, organisers said that their movement has reached a new level of civil disobedience and planted protest waves in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any more detailed information to appear to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online communication, organisers informed that the movement "considered the occupation of the Central District only as the last means, an action that should take place only if all the dialogues are exhausted and there is no other choice.
We are sorry to have to say that today all the opportunities for dialogue have been exploited and that the occupation of the Central District will take place definitively.
The Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for the announcement of Pekings for days, and on Sunday before the government building, there were tightened security measures including police forces and barriers.
The unrest is reinforced by the feeling that many people in Hong Kong are slowly losing control of their city.
The attraction of people from the mainland strengthens competition for products and services.
Furthermore, the fear is growing that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are beginning to crawl under the growing pressure of Pekings.
Some criticized the demonstrations of the Occupy Central movement, as it endangered the business - the life sader of Hong Kong.
"The protests that they speak of could cause major economic damage, depending on how many are involved in it and how long they last," said the right-wing expert Regine Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want to show any fear that Hong Kong is out of control.
This impression is bad for investment.
The state-controlled media of China also recently reported about the democratic activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled by Western powers.
This summer, activists organised an unofficial referendum on electoral rights, in which 780,000 people participated - more than one fifth of the voters in Hong Kong.
In July, tens of thousands participated in one of the largest democratic demonstrations in the history of the region.
The tradition of school graduation balls in the USA is now transferred to universities where freshmen shows are offered with the private aircraft.
We are pleased to be able to respond to this demand and to offer the first luxurious travel service of Britain for students today.
In order to achieve a particularly impressive appearance at the university, the company also offers transport options such as private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr Stewart also stated that the service had a security party.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have to skip their habits in a dangerous overloaded car through the country.
Together with our new VIF options, we look forward to ensuring this year that students reach the university with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury.
A business spokesman said that there were no new bookings as the service had just been introduced, but added that "students would book the service in the next few weeks."
The company also informed that, despite the study fees of £9.000 per year, it expects a market for this offer.
Students today are very different in their expectations and demands from the students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago - it is more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with VIF you can do exactly that.
However, the National Student Union criticized the service as withdrawn.
Megan Dunn, Vice President of the NUS for Higher Education, said: "This offer seems completely separate from the life of most students.
Many students who start studying this month face a crisis of living costs, as the available grants in the form of loans and scholarships do not take the most easy-to-live bills with the very rising calculations before they can even think of spending thousands of pounds for something simple as the arrival in the student home.
Feminists criticize race question and police behavior to Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo. at the beginning of this month.
The participants lifted their hands into the air and sang, "Hands up, not shoot," while waiting for the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo, due to the shooting of the unarmed teenager Michael Brown, the blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noted a change in the online discussions of white feminists.
According to their experience, white feminist commentators put the gender before the race when it comes to addressing reproduction law and income inequalities.
However, while the tensions in the Middle West rose and received attention throughout the country, Perez saw that the responses of white women turned around the race to 100%.
Compared to the answers of black women shortly after the shots of 9 August, the personal essays with titles such as "thoughts to Ferguson from a white woman" and "feminism is not only about the repression of women" were relatively late.
But for Perez this meant an important change.
"I do not believe that there are many people in feminism who speak about the white and privileges in such a high-class way," she said.
People felt forced to express something about the incidents.
It is characteristic of the crisis we are in and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnic that they must express that.
For English professor Koritha Mitchell from Ohio State University, Ferguson highlighted problems that black Americans are exposed to every day, but which are not considered as "women's themes" in cultural space.
"I can publish something funny on Facebook about me and my partner and get 150 licks from anywhere," said Mitchell.
If I posted something about how colored people in their own country are under siege, silence is ear stunning.
"How can it be safe for women to speak publicly about a relationship, but not about security in public space?" she asked.
For black women like Mitchell who have studied race, sex and sexuality in the history of the United States, there is no dichotomy between race and sex problems.
For them black women have not had the luxury of separating the topics clean; they live every day in combined reality.
While white women now combine the issues of race and sex in feminist mainstream circles, Angela Hattery, professor of women and gender research at George Mason University, says that their predecessors did the opposite.
"Between 1865 and 1890 at least 10,000 black men were flashed and the reason was almost always the rape of a white woman," said Hattery.
White women had to be involved in history to justify the Lynch murder.
For Hattery, the division between white and black women came at the point when white fighters for women's electoral rights such as Susan B. Anthony analyzed the country in the late years of the 19th century and found that the struggle for electoral rights could only be successful for one group: women or black.
"They made the decision to vote for women's right to vote, and the right to vote for black people should come later," said Hattery.
When you remember such things, you will realize with power why colored women don't trust white women.
We didn't do our job well.
We never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.
Even after having received the right to vote in 1920, it took a decade to organize white women against Lynchen in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group was created almost 40 years after the original request for help from black women, says Mitchell.
For Mitchell, the flood of white feminist reactions to the questions raised by Ferguson - police behaviour, racial discrimination - is a mirror of the time when white feminists played "catches" with the problems with which black women have been separating for generations.
"Would it not be great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms have the right to educate a child as seriously as they do with the right to receive control?" Mitchell asked.
Feminists of the second generation who built their careers on the struggle for reproductive rights and access to receptionist resources are now trying to understand what that means.
The known white feminist activist Gloria Steiner went on Facebook two weeks after Michael Brown was shot and published a posted article by Rebecca Carroll, columnist of the Guardian, in which she demanded more protests from white Americans on racism.
"I hope that women who have a different but parallel reason to understand a danger inherent in the body - and opinions on the race that are clearly different in public surveys - will lead to changes," Steiner wrote.
Although Steiner stands for a rather intersectional feminism, which addresses racial issues as well as gender issues, some of their comments on race enthusiasm in America are astonished.
Christina Sommers, researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who Stole Feminism?" said to She The People that young men in the United States, especially young colored men, "are far more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinem's comments on Ferguson contradict their previous criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently set up a small program, My Brother's Keeper, to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men, there were annoying reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Steiner.
The relationship between the police and the black community is not the only problem that is pressing in the front of mainstreamfeminism.
After the US border police have taken up almost 63,000 unaccompanied minors at the south-west border of the country this year, the issue of immigration reform is also going back to the surface - this time as a woman's theme.
Andrea Mercado, co-chairman of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women for immigration reform, said that for a reviewing the issue as a key woman theme she should only publish the stories of immigrant women.
"These speak for themselves," said Mercado.
When the vast majority of working visas go to male immigrants, the women who accompany them are in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories find a retreat in the women's organizations," she said.
"Pig House" in Ipswich stands for sale
The picture of a house for sale was removed by real estate agents when it became clear that it showed a big pig that had made it comfortable in the living room.
The detached house has a bedroom, is located on a private street in Ipswich and is offered for £120,000.
Among the details was a picture of the living room of the house - one of which also belonged to a pig that had worn his head on a sofa.
Real estate agent Connells said the pig on the photo was the owner's pet.
"However, the photo was published incorrectly and was now removed" said a spokeswoman of the company.
Connells described the earlier meeting house in the house as a "unique single family house with a bedroom."
Although the broker has removed the image from the website, it still appears on advertising material.
The sale of the pig in the social media was of interest when some asked whether the pig was included in the purchase price.
The SW-City Harvey imitates a new millionaire after lottery win
A lottery player from Harvey is on this month.
The search for a new millionaire in the southwest of Perth lasts, with a happy winner who receives almost $1.1 million from the lottery education on Saturday.
A newspaper ski in Harvey pulled the jackpot in the first division for the second time in five years, after $1 million in November 2009.
However, the lucky winner still has to report.
The store owner Steve Forward said that the profit provides for conversation material in the small town in the southwest of Perth.
The city talks about nothing else, and everyone's pretty excited.
We thought that such a profit could occur.
Eight WA winners celebrated gains in the first division last month, a proper graduation for a few happy weeks for the players in the state.
Last week, a player from Canning Vale became one of the five millionaires in August, after a couple from Belmont had won the Megagewin of 7.5 million dollars just a few weeks earlier.
The winner pair had played for twenty years and said that the profit allows them the possibility of a world trip and the purchase of a new house.
The millionaire from Harvey is the 59th winner of the first division in the WA this year, with a total of almost 85 million dollars.
Leonidas prayed to the gladiator arena
Not only the gladiators were kneeling deep in the mattress at the first Rheinbacher Roman day in the leisure park.
But the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract far more than 1,000 visitors yesterday who pressed the rain showers and the autumn cold and were still enthusiastic about the historical spectacle.
There was a colorful set of performances, performances, games, exhibitions and information about the time of the Romans and their importance for the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the Martial Fighter Force of the Gladiator School "Amor Mortis," which used every rainbreak to demonstrate their robust battle art in the Arena prepared with soft sand.
Gladiator owner "Leonidas" proved to be a humorous and expert present and subsequently sent his men into the ring to the heroic double struggle in various gladiator wars.
First the "provocators" were on the row with rectangular sign and short sword as well as legs on the left leg and armrail on the right arm.
It followed the "Essedarii" with chest shield, short sword and worm flanges as well as iron gladiator helmet, leg and arm protection.
Especially impressive was the appearance of the "Retiarius," who met the "Secutor" with a cast grid, triazack and dagger, and after a short struggle, pushed the boys to the ground.
Since the swords were metallic in each other, the shields were created and the worm plants flew surringly through the arena that a fear and fear could become about the health of gladiators.
However, the impressive "Summa Rudis," the muscular arbitrator, had an always attentive eye on them.
"We wanted to revive the Roman everyday life and make the culture of the Roman era more realistic," explains Lorenz Euskirchen, chairman of the organizer "Friendship of the Roman Channel," the intent behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparation from the leisure park, a "Oppidum Romanum," a Roman city was established by Vice-Mayor Claus Wehage in his greeting.
Finally, the Romans have brought not only war and conquest in our region, but also the Roman culture and numerous works that we admire today.
The remaining were also astonished during the Roman day, such as "Aquädukt-Marmor" from the 11 meters high and 1400 meters long Roman Channel Bridge, which was at the time at Lüftelberg.
The Frontinus Society presented water and energy supply once and now, and Managing Director Petra Fricke knew: "We are still benefiting from the knowledge of that time."
This also confirms the degree measurement engineer Ralph Heiliger from the "Engineer Team Two" from Rheinbach, who presented the measurement instruments of the Romans such as chorobat, groma or dioptra.
The Roman villa in Blankenheim presented sketches and models of the excavations anno 1894 as well as bricks from the original hypocheast, the hot air heating that once warmed up the Roman villa.
Impressive also the footprints left by Wolf and Fuchs two millennia ago in the footsteps of sound before they were burned.
In 2011, the Office for Bodenminmalpflege at the Landesverband Rheinland had excavated the remnants of a Roman villa in the Nordic commercial park in Rheinbach.
It has been found that an economic building with a darre for the drying of cereals and for the painting.
The building probably belonged to a Villa Rustica, a farm estate, explained the archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser.
A number of fountains from these excavations presented them in a glass vitrine, including a large plate, several fine glass vessels and parts of a pearl necklace.
The villa had probably existed after Christ from the first to the fourth century, until the Germans entered the then Roman Rhineland, suspects Morscheiser.
The children were also involved in the Roman windmill game, similar to the contemporary mill game, or they wrote their names with metal griffles on wax tables as they used to be.
On the stand of the Roman therms Zülpich, the children were allowed to lay themselves mosaics, bastle at the stand of the glass museum Rheinbach glass mosaics and use at the stand of the nature center Eifel Nettersheim a heavy wheat mill made of stone to paint the flour for a flat bread or garlic.
With the original Roman car built up by two cold flowers, visitors drove through the leisure park and also passed the impressive state of the city's gymnasium, which presented the results of their "Romans' project weeks."
With a Roman week from 13 to 21 September, the municipality of Wachtberg will also enter the Roman year 2014, which was called to remember the death of Emperor Augustus 2000 years ago.
Together with the home and history associations as well as the Wachtberger-Verein, the Partnership Association and the Laienspielkreis Oberbachem, we offer thematic hikes, a lecture, cooking evenings and guided tours for school classes and remember the Roman past Wachtberg.
For example, a Roman legionary is told about his work on the upcoming Wachtberg, presented plants as living monuments from the Roman age, and offered a fun lesson in international understanding between a group of Wachtberger "Germanen" and attracted Romans.
The Adendorfer Primary School is dedicated to the Roman theme in the context of a project week.
With the Roman Week, the numerous, often but no longer visible traces of the Romans in Wachtberg will be restored.
In the Wachtberger Rathaus a small presentation will remember the fund of the Berkumer Matron Hospital in 1879.
Ebola: The epidemic burdens Westafrica's economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a serious blow to the economy.
Markets are custom - and international companies go away.
The devastating Ebola epidemic raises the economy of West Africa.
The harvest is rotting on the fields, the mines are abandoned and the markets are preserved - the virus has severely added to the region.
Some international companies are already on distances.
"The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis but also an economic one," judges the head of the African Development Bank, Donald Kaberuka.
Liberia is most affected
"It is a total disaster, we lose a lot of money," says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells on the second largest market in the capital of Liberia Monrovia clothes.
Only anyone who wants to buy food or something for disinfection against Ebola comes on the market.
Liberia was the hardest hit by the virus, here alone fever was sacrificed more than 600 people.
Recently the health authorities stated that the disease was pressed in every corner of the country.
The virus also spread in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.
In total, more than 1,500 people died, and thousands of others died.
Foreign companies withdraw employees
Firms cease to operate anywhere in the resource-rich countries.
Foreign companies such as the Arcelor Mittal steel group withdraw their employees, several international airlines are no longer flying the regions concerned.
The local dealers and peasants also react: only a few merchants leave their homes to get back.
In some areas in Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are under quarantine, among other things, the cocoa and coffee beans that are important for export rot on the fields.
The peasants don't dare leave their home for harvest.
Foodstuffs are scarce
"People will travel less and less," says Phillipe De Vreyer, Paris expert for the Western African economy.
For example, the man who usually goes on the market and sells his vegetables would rather stay at home.
The population will therefore feel the consequences of the epidemic directly and urgently: food is scarce.
In the markets, the supply of basic nutrients such as rice is declining.
At the same time, the region that is heavily dependent on international companies is threatening an image - with far-reaching consequences.
The greatest danger is that international companies will avoid the area for a long time, says Philippe Hugon of the French Think Tank Iris.
It is crucial how far and how long the virus will spread.
Investors could have the impression that "it is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and thus invest," Hugon warns.
The disease also burdens the straightened government budgets of the States
The disease also burdens the already strained government budgets of the States concerned.
The Moody's rating agency fears that its budgets are heavily strained by the high spending on the health system and by the deteriorating economy.
The African Development Bank has already promised to help the health systems of the countries concerned with 60 million dollars (45 million euros).
The effects are also felt in Nigeria, where only a few Ebola cases have been diagnosed so far.
Although the oil-rich region of the southern Nigerdelta has not yet been affected.
But elsewhere, many people are already at home for fear of infection.
Reservations in hotels are also clearly declining.
Shooters celebrate her 50th anniversary
The Protector's Association "Tannenwald" Berngau celebrates its 50th anniversary of its founding party from 12 to 14 September.
On high tours at the Protective Association of Tannenwald, the preparations for the 50-year-old foundation festival run from 12 to 14 September.
Planned on Friday, September 12, a great entertainment evening with the group "Dorfrocker."
On Saturday, the big bullet shooting is at 6: 00.
Then in the large tent the mood evening is with the "Stoapfalzer Spitzbuam."
Blow chapel takes care of the music
Highlights on Sunday are the Festgottesdienst and 9.30 o'clock in the parish church and the great fortress at 2 o'clock.
In the afternoon there is also the price distribution of the Federal and Gaußens.
A particularly beautiful view will be the 25 celebrities with their Dirndln.
Hard chapel is the Blaskapelle Berngau.
Mayor Wolfgang Wild and State Secretary Albert Füracker have taken over the mayor.
The original name "Protective Company Tannenwald Berngau" is from 1907, when the association was founded on 21 March for "social entertainment through exercises in room shooting and small caliber shooting."
The NS regime had induced the dissolution of the association in 1937.
Only in 1964 were 19 young men found again, who lifted the "new" Tannenwald "Berngau out of the baptism in the Lukas Hospital on 30 April.
Karl March and Adolf Ried led the club as guardian through a difficult start time, in which it was mainly about finding a club location and installing the shooting operation.
Already in the autumn of 1965, the protection association started the Leininger Hospital with two teams in the round battles.
In the following years, the sports guards, which were now organized in seven teams, were established in all classes up to the first Gauliga.
The club records were purcelled annually and the magic border of 380 rings was reached for the first time in 1980 by Rudi Meier.
As the performance of the active shooters has increased, the number of members has also developed positively.
After the club's local "Leininger" has no longer satisfied the demands of a modern protection association, the then board, under the leadership of Johann Rinn, has decided to create a future domicile in the cellars of the new "Landgasthof Härteis".
After a work performance of 2700 hours, Pastor Strasser gave the church blessing on 8 May 1988 for the new protection rooms.
One of the great highlights in the history of the association was certainly the 44. gauge shooting, linked to the solemn ceremony of the new shotgun fahne in July 1991.
On April 23 and 24, 1994, the protection association celebrated its 30-year anniversary.
In 1995, a group of Böller was founded.
Josef Schmalzl became a Böllerreferent.
A major challenge for the "Böllers" and for the association as a whole was the direction of the 2005 Bayerische Böllentreffen.
In many hours of voluntary work, the members of the association have modernized the rooms and the shooting facility at the Berngauer Hof last year and thus upgraded the technology.
Elf teams in race fights
It can also be seen the sporting services of the Protector's Association.
In total, eleven teams currently participate in the round battles: six air guns teams, an air gun team, a sports gun KK1, one youth and two AH teams.
The first team with Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi Grad and Kerstin Kellermann went up to the district League 1 in the 2013 / 14 round of the Gauoberliga (the highest League in the Protective League ANB).
The second team with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml went from Gauliga Nord to the Gauoberliga.
In addition to the shooting sport, events such as bouquets, fashionable and royal balls, club excursions and Christmas celebrations have tradition.
With this, the shooters are also at the parties in Pfarrei and the municipality.
Tony Stewart suffered an accident when he returned to the race route
Tony Stewart's return to the track ended halfway through his race on the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart went against the wall for the second time after his right front tyre crashed in round 172 and ended his evening.
Stewart drove his damaged car into the garage and left it without talking to journalists.
His team chief Chad Johnston said his 14-head team was disappointed, but now focus on the race next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish we had a better bet and a better result for him," said Johnston.
We'll go to Richmond and hope we can do better there.
Stewart used to run on Sunday evening after a collision with Kyle Busch into a wall and had to repair the right side of his car.
"I went to a good result today with quite good hopes," said Johnston and added: "It just didn't work."
Not long after the second accident, Stewart's car was loaded into the trailer and the team had packed and was ready to leave.
Stewart dropped three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car hit and killed another driver at an ashtrains race in the north of the state of New York.
He decided to return this week and win either in Atlanta or at the next race in Richmond to win a place in the persecution.
He returned to his workplace during an investigation into the tragic incident leading to the death of the 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who had entered the track during a race to confront Stewart.
The authorities announced on Friday that the investigations on the cause of the accident will continue for at least two weeks.
No decision has yet been made on whether Stewart has to expect an indictment.
The three-time champion was received with great applause when he was presented before the race.
After a start at 12th position, Stewart had been pushed forward to the first 10 and was temporarily on place four.
After a restart in round 122, bushes came
Car with number 18 out of control after the exit from curve 2 and collided with Stewart, with both cars driving against the wall.
Stewart continued, but fell back to place 21.
Dance joyful descendant sought
Simply try: Laura, Lena, Lisa, Marie, Bettina, Emma and Director Lisa Neitzel (from the left) are looking forward to a contest.
Like many other associations, the jazz groups in the TV Jahn of full-day teaching at the secondary schools also create.
After the summer holidays, some groups have been heavily decimated.
Now more young people are sought for a sport that is healthy and makes great fun.
In the two Jazz and Modern Dance groups of Lisa Neitzel, formerly dancer in the Jazz and Modern Dance formation "Spirits," there are only nine children left.
"Three in the group of eight to twelve years old, six in the group of twelve to 15 years old," says the 20-year-old.
With more active, the whole thing would be much more fun, "you could dance quite different choreographs," she says.
If you want to dance, on Thursday between 17 and 18 o'clock or on Friday between 17 and 18.30 o'clock in the dance sports room at the former Hotel Meyer, Freistraße 9, can insert the training hour without obligation.
"Training starts regularly with a heating program," the trainer says.
After that, various choreographies are practised.
JazzDance has the feature that there is no defined form and is therefore open to many styles.
Items from folklore over classics up to sports and acrobatics are processed in jazz dance.
Of course, there is no shortage of emotion either.
"We also go to dinner, watch dance movies and we have stayed in the dance room once," says Lisa Neitzel.
In the group you could close friendships, share a beautiful hobby and do a lot for your own motor development.
Whose jazz dance is not so, it can also cut into one of the other offers of the TV Jahn.
Children and adolescents can always sneak into classes in children's dance / jazz dance, bambini ballet, video clip dancing and hip hop.
The dance coach is Francisco Afonso.
Adult couples are welcome to the dance evenings on Monday and Wednesday.
Anyone who wants discofox, slow rollers, Wiener Walzer, Rumba, Cha-Cha-Cha and Tango may come by and join.
Bulgarian prison inspectors protest nationwide
Hundreds of prison workers from all over Bulgaria have organised a country-wide protest in front of the Ministry of Justice in the capital of Sofia.
In the peaceful demonstration they reiterated their demands for the restoration of their old working conditions, which have recently been changed.
Also higher wages are on a demand list to be discussed with Interim Justice Minister Hristo Ivanov.
Officials have been protesting the new working hours for a month and demanding a return to the previous 24-hour shifts.
Despite the meetings between the trade union of prison workers and representatives of the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached, the national Bulgarian Ratio (BNR) reported.
The negotiations are ongoing, the Director-General for the implementation of penalties, Rosen Zhelyazkov, shared the BNR.
The protest of the prison workers is expected to be supported by members of the trade union association of the staff of the Ministry of the Interior.
Ukrainian Army has abandoned Luhansk Airport
The Prorussian fighters are still on the forefront in the East.
After heavy fighters, who were allegedly also involved in Russian tanker battalions, the Ukrainian army has abandoned Luhansk's airport today, Monday.
At the same time, the army informed us that seven soldiers had been killed in the last 24 hours.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroschenko had previously drawn personal consequences from the severe defeats of his army in the fight against the separatists and announced changes in the supreme army, without mentioning details.
Prorussian separatists shot off aircraft
In the fight against Ukrainian government troops, Prorussian separatists have, according to their own representation, again shot off a fighter aircraft and two military helicopters.
In addition, around 100 soldiers had been injured or killed in the Donetsk region, according to the rebels on Monday Russian agencies.
Coastal Guard ships lowered
The rebels also claimed to have for the first time lowered two boats of the Ukrainian coastguard in the Asosian Sea.
The Ukrainian border guard confirmed that two of his ships had been shot by Mariupol on Sunday near the port town.
Seven border guards had been injured, a spokesman in Kiev said to the station at 112.00 a.m.
Two crew members were supposed to be missing.
Local media made Russia responsible for the incident.
The separatists also reported that several localities in the Donetsk region have been under their control.
Diplomatic offensive in Minsk
In the White Russian capital of Minsk today the Ukraine contact group meets.
In addition to representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE, a separatist from the East Ukraine should also participate.
In advance, all stakeholders took advantage of their actions to publish their requests.
NATO does not want to break agreements with Russia
NATO will not break its agreement with Russia due to the planned stations in Eastern Europe as a result of the Ukraine crisis.
NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels that NATO would comply with the 1997 NATO-Russia Council's founding agreement.
However, the NATO boss accused Russia of "a violent break" of the agreement.
"Today we have to face the reality that Russia does not regard NATO as a partner," said Rasmussen.
Documents and comments from the Russian side show that "they regard us as opponents."
Strengthening NATO presence
Rasmussen has also announced its intention to strengthen NATO's presence in Eastern Europe.
A "Readiness Action Plan" to be adopted at the NATO Summit in Wales will ensure that "we will have more visible NATO presence in the east as long as it is necessary," said Rasmussen in Brussels on Monday.
Kiev and Moscow agree on new gas talks
According to official information, Russia and Ukraine have agreed on new talks to resolve their gas dispute.
The negotiations are scheduled for next Saturday, said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Nowak on Monday.
It is still waiting for a decision by the European Union to send a representative to the talks as well.
Because of the dispute about the gas price, Ukraine has not been getting fuel from Russia for weeks.
Last but not least, EU Energy Commissioner Günther Oettinger had provided between the two sides.
Ukraine had warned that Russia could also interrupt gas supply for Europe.
Europe receives about one third of its natural gas from Russian sources, of which a large part flows through Ukraine.
Merkel speaks power word: Maut will come "very clear"
Now the Chancellor confesses again clearly.
But it is not a free letter for all the complicated details.
Considerable concerns from the CDU against the car toll have been arrested by the CSU.
Chancellor Angela Merkel has spoken a power word for the introduction of a car toll after persistent resistance from her CDU.
"To make it very clear: it is in the coalition contract and it will come," the party party said on Monday after meetings of the CDU top bodies in Berlin.
But Merkel was not based on a detailed model for the moment.
The black-red government programme calls "certain parameters."
Federal Minister for Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) has "made a proposal, and it is now being worked on."
The NRW CDU, however, maintains a toll on all roads on its no.
Merkel stressed that also Minister for Finance Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) was constructively involved in the deliberations for a draft law.
In addition, he also spoke with Dobrindt about further ways of activating more private capital for investment in infrastructure, such as broadband expansion.
"There is nothing special about it." Schäuble had left a "mirror" report uncommented on Sunday, his house examined a own concept to pay motorway investors with toll revenues - after the election 2017.
CSU Chief Horst Seehofer then warned against developing toll concepts in the Cabinet against the leading minister.
CDU-Bundesvize Armin Laschet confirmed his objections.
"The coalition agreement never assumed to embrace all circular and federal roads," said the North Rhine-Westphalian CDU country president.
In this respect, it is an important signal that Seehofer has now announced to speak again on the subject.
Resistance to the plans also comes from the CDU-Landesverbände Baden-Württemberg and Rheinland-Pfalz.
Background is the fear that a toll will affect small border traffic to neighbouring countries.
Seehofer had asked for coalition for the toll criticism of the CDU's series.
The Left sees the plans as failing in view of the dispute in the Union.
"The Murks-Maut is dead," said Parteichef Bernd Riexinger of the "New Osnabrücker Newspaper" (Monday).
"With the toll, the minister fails." Dobrindt wants to introduce a vignette obligation on all German roads to start in 2016.
However, domestic car owners must not be subject to additional burdens under the coalition agreement.
Therefore, they should receive full compensation for the toll via the car tax.
However, the model must not disadvantage foreign drivers under EU law because of their nationality.
Genetic disorder often misdiagnosed
A British says she thought as a result of a misdiagnosis for many years that she would die.
Karin Rodgers lived almost all her youth in the belief that she had only a few years to live after she was diagnosed with another disease.
She actually suffered from the Charcot Marie Tooth disease (CMT) - a group of inherited disorders that damage the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord.
Charity CMT UK informed that misdiagnosis is a common problem in people with CMT because so little is known about this disease.
Approximately 23.000 people in the UK are likely to suffer from CMT, which can lead to motor disorders such as muscle weakness, an unsafe course and crooked toes.
Diseased also suffer from numbness or pain. The disease is unhealing and progressive, which means that the symptoms become worse with time.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed that she suffered from Friedreich-Ataxie (FA) - a disease with very bad survival chances.
Rodgers thought she'd sit in the wheelchair before she was 18 and die before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children, who are 51 years old today, said, "As a child, I knew that I could not do the same as the others.
I fell down all the time and everything took longer with me.
I was never able to ride with the other kids wheelshoes or skateboard and was often taken to school because of my kind of walking and hanging.
Rodgers said that at the age of 13 she saw her medical records after several operations to relieve her aphiles and stretch her feet when her doctor had left the room and read that she suffered from FA.
"I felt guilty because I was curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but I went home, searched for the disease in the library and wrote to the FA society," she said.
When I got an answer, I was shocked and panicked terribly.
I thought I'd be in a wheelchair at 18 and die at 25 and slowly lose all my skills in between.
I made it all up with myself and planned my own funeral.
She said when she was 17, she realized that her abilities had not been as strong as she imagined and questioned her doctor.
He just got up and hugged me and said, "My love, I don't think you have that, otherwise you'd already be in a wheelchair."
I think you have something far less life-threatening.
After some genetic tests, their CMT was detected.
"When he told me what CMT was, I felt like I was a winner," she said.
Charity CMT UK has started a CMT-Awareness month to draw attention to this disease.
Stabsfeldwebel A.D. Berni Diether has been working as fireworks since the closure of the former force practice site
For almost ten years, the former force practice site has not been shot in coins.
Nevertheless, lethal ammunition appears every month in the heart of the Biosphere area of the Swabian Alb.
The grenades are sometimes still so dangerous that they need to be exploded on the ground.
An ear-stunning bump occurs in the explosions over the heart of the biosphere area.
In December 2004, the last sharp shot fell on the troop practice site Münsingen, which was closed at the end of 2005 after 110 years of military operation.
Since that time, the 6500 hectares of the area have been the core of the Swabian Alpine Biosphere area, which is open to hikers and cyclists on 13 routes.
Taxation of businessmen in the Washington area rises with economic recovery
Recovery of the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax ratios for companies in the country rose slightly last year, while economic recovery accelerated, such a newly published study last week, and the companies in the Washington area did not form an exception.
Companies in District, Maryland and Virginia jointly paid $27.6 billion to state and local authorities in the financial year 2013, an increase of 3.8 percent compared to 2012 revenues of $26.6 billion.
The government and local tax burden of companies increased by 4.3 per cent last year to 671 billion dollars, compared to 3.9 per cent in the previous year, and it was the third year of growth following the several years of declining modesty in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes increased more than local taxes by 4.3 per cent, according to the study carried out by the Services Agency Ernst & Young with the Centre for State Taxation, a tax policy group.
More than half of District's tax revenues, 56 percent, come from corporate taxes, while 36 percent of Maryland's revenues come from companies.
Virginia achieves the lowest tax revenues from companies at 28 per cent.
Most of the increase in tax revenues is due to a recovery of company real estate values, the researchers say that this year's real estate taxes increased by 3.7 per cent after the three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1 per cent.
While a large part of these profits came from large states such as California, New York and Texas, the course seems to be also true for Washington.
Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia jointly paid over $10 billion to state and local real estate taxes last year, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012 - an increase of 4.2 percent over a year.
But the apparent recovery of real estate values in Maryland is not so effective in increasing government and local tax revenues, as real estate taxes amount to just over one fifth of corporate tax ratios.
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay almost half their state and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes.
"In Maryland: a large part of the real estate, especially in the tax area around D.C., is either owned by the government or by non-profit organisations that do not pay real estate taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, Managing Director of the Center on State Taxation.
Maryland is therefore forced, for example, to rely much more on income taxes in order to provide the same services that other countries offer.
The latest recovery in corporate tax revenues cannot be attributed solely to the recovery of the real estate market
Business revenues seem also to recover, so the data.
Companies in the region reported income taxes on government organisations of $2.3 billion compared to 2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland took $1 billion into corporate income taxes, the highest amount of the region.
While the trend goes in the same direction, the local tax burden on enterprises does not rise evenly in all three places.
The rate of increase in the district was 4.3 per cent of the national average, while the increase in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9 per cent.
Only Virginia reported an underaverage tax income of 4.1 per cent.
Virginia has, at 6 per cent in all three official areas, the significantly lowest corporate income taxes (in all three there are fixed corporate tax rates).
The corporate tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 per cent and 9.975 per cent in the district.
A comparable study by the US Chamber of Commerce at the beginning of this year showed that in Virginia, lower government and local corporate taxes are required and a better tax environment exists overall than in Maryland.
The study did not investigate the District.
Despite the advantages Virginia is under pressure by its southern neighbours.
North Carolina has adopted laws to reduce its corporate tax rates this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, the same rate as Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 percent next year.
If the State continues to achieve its income targets next year, this law could reduce the State's corporate income tax rate to 3 per cent by 2017.
In the meantime, small businesses in the Washington area seem to be doing better, and they therefore pay more government and local taxes, according to the latest study.
Business taxes paid as personal income taxes by small businessmen - a transitional structure according to which most small companies are organised - in the District, Maryland and Virginia rose by 20 percent to 2.4 billion dollars last year, a significantly faster rate of growth than corporate taxes as a whole.
Researchers say that the trend and increase in corporate taxes throughout the country is likely to continue this year, with an increase in the general VAT revenues for the state and local governments by 6.2 per cent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period of the previous year.
Nevertheless, the Washington area could fall behind if the Federal Government's reduction in expenditure has an impact on the labour market in the region.
Partner City: German beer for Guangzhou
Hops and malt - also in China a popular combination.
German beer enjoys an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurts partner city in China now wishes a brewery and also hopes for a direct flight connection between the two cities.
German beer, brown in Frankfur's partner city of Guangzhou - that is the urgent desire of the Chinese officers.
"We would be very pleased if a German brewery were to be settled in our city," said the Vice-Party Secretary of the South Chinese Metropolis, Li Yiwei, this week visiting a SPD delegation in his city.
In the course of the conversation, the Chinese Communist Party's official always returned to this concern of the 12 million metropolis.
Guangzhou, also known as canton in Germany, is one of the richest cities of China, warmed Li.
Therefore, people also possess the purchasing power to afford German beer.
The Hessian SPD chairman Thorsten Schäfer-Gümbel, who led the German politician delegation, told the host that he would listen to a possible partner for the project in Germany.
"For beer it doesn't need much: good water, grain and joy of life," he added to lunch with the party top in Guangzhou.
This joy of life already embellishes Mr Li, he flattered the host.
After that, the Guangzhou functionary encountered with shepherd dust - but with red wine, which was served for the food.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao returns to German brewery.
Tsingtao beer is brewed according to the German purity commandment.
More business
A second wish of the Chinese hosts would be a direct flight link between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said Vice-Party Head Li.
Lufthansa had offered the flight earlier, but in 2012 it was deleted for economic reasons.
"It would be worth again," the local politician showed himself convinced.
"The trade between our two cities continues to increase."
At the moment travellers had to take the route over Changsha in the province of Hunan, complained Li.
The Guangdong province, whose capital is Guangzhou, is also in charge of the airline.
The Deputy Governor of the province, Chen Yunxian, put this wish at the forefront of his conversation with the Social Democrats.
"This is a very good idea," replied Schäfer-Gümbel - the Chinese Deputy Minister Li Jinjun, an intimate Knower of Germany, nicked in agreement.
Preliminary partnership
Guangzhou's arbitrary vice-leader hopes that he will be able to visit Frankfurt next year at a partnership meeting.
Li Yiwei was already on the Main, but not yet in this function.
He only entered office this year after his predecessor had been promoted from the office for crimes of corruption.
Wan Qinglian also had to leave.
The action against Guangzhou officials is part of a country-wide campaign against corruption in the party and administration, which is hardened by Heads of State Xi Jinping.
The new top politician Li Yiwei had worked for an American company before his party career, which is highly unusual in the Chinese Communist Party.
Before joining Guangzhou, he worked as a senior official in Fujian, where the VW built a large work.
Frankfurt has officially entered into more than a dozen urban partnerships.
The connection to Guangzhou 9000 kilometres away belongs to those who are maintained by both sides, for example with an exchange of students.
Last year, the 25-year-old existence of the German-Chinese association was celebrated.
The southern Chinese metropolis on the pearl flow are almost as strong as the whole of Hessen with their economic power.
Next year she wanted to reach a gross domestic product of €250 billion, reported Li.
Family of Joan Rivers "presses the thumbs"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious three days ago since she arrived at a hospital in New York City, but her daughter was hoping today that the 81-year-old comedian would recover from her illness.
"Thank you for your continued love and support," said Melissa Rivers today in a message.
We're all pushing the thumbs.
According to her mother, sources were sent to the Mount Sinai hospital on Thursday after an emergency for heart failure at a clinic at the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy.
The doctors deliberately keep them seated and under close observation until they are more satisfied with their condition, which is still described as "serious."
The reactions came from many sides, also in the form of a overwhelming online support of Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Environmental vacuum cleaners and rising wages
For cars and vacuum cleaners coming into circulation from today, more stringent environmental standards will apply in the future.
Similar to refrigerators and washing machines, new vacuum cleaners will receive a label from 1 September on which the buyer can at a glance detect central data such as the energy efficiency of the device.
For new cars, more stringent nitrogen oxide values apply in the pollutant class "Euro 6."
There is also more money for the growers: they receive a national minimum wage of 10,25 euros.
Amazon buys Twitch for 1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed what information reported on Monday morning: The online retailer - and video producer, and a variety of other things - buys the video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion ($970 million).
The announcement comes surprisingly, not because nobody expected a takeover of Twitch, but because it was widely assumed that YouTube would acquire the company.
Three months ago it looked like the sale of Twitch to the video service of Google for a cool billion decided thing, and cooperation also appeared naturally.
Twitch, which was founded as Justin.tv three years ago, was launched as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who wanted to publish their bravo pieces in games, a "YouTube for live games," such an insider.
The Twitch interface.
And "let's play," a videogenre, in which the better wiser give the (mostly older) games a stroke of secrecy theatre, are already very popular on YouTube.
It is just that YouTube is often called when you want to describe Twitch, so the message that YouTube Twitch wanted to buy was somewhat bored, a lecture book example of an established technology consultant who purchases a potential competitor.
It is a mystery why the deal with YouTube did not come true, as the company reported that it was willing to pay as much as Amazon.
All we know about this right now is this statement by Emmet Shear, President of Twitch: "We have chosen Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term visions and they want to help us get there faster."
Another secret is, frankly, the incredible success of Twitch.
For Snobs like me, who explain that they prefer to do sports rather than watch it, it is hard to understand the attraction that is likely to watch others play instead of even taking the control console into hand.
It's one thing to look a friend over the shoulder at 3: 00 in the morning, while she slips through Resident Evil, and something completely different to watch a madman watch him get shot 20 times in Call of Duty's head.
You could look at all these games right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are ego games, so adding without your own control of the perspective can be a really good recipe for headaches.
I admit that the fast runs in which the Roger Bannisters of our electronic age complete games in record time are entertaining.
But as long as there is no game or humor virtuosis, his Twitch channel is probably not very interesting.
But what do sceptics like me know about it?
Twitch is called by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic tips.
And how exactly does Amazon want to make money from it?
It's hard to imagine that Twitch is integrated as elegant in Amazon Instant Video as YouTube Twitch could have just swallow.
But Twitch has something that every company would like: thousands of young men who are converted as advertising customers.
As the president of Twitch, Shear, said, Amazon and Twitch "both believe in the future of gaming," and the medium does not show any signs of shrinking, even - luckily - as a spectator sport.
There was a lot going on at the Hüpfburg at the Burggartenfest on Saturday night.
The concept of the organizers matched.
Despite the strong rainfall on Saturday night, an estimated 1200 musical fans came to the open air festival in the castle garden.
In time, the entry had to be stopped.
"That was annoying," said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Saltwedel l Light and fun.
From two Spanish words Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem formed the name Amula.
For the Open Air in the Salt Palace is to disperse brightness in the day and evening through various shows.
Well, the fun comes from alone anyway.
This appeared early on Saturday when the first visitors went to open air.
The organizers promised a feast for all generations.
And they succeeded.
Around the supply positions on the castle garden wiese it had made itself more salty, but also guests from the nearer and further surroundings comfortable.
They tracked the first live performances, wrapped with the foot in the handle, enjoyed cool drinks - briefly: relaxation purely and enjoyment were announced.
And that across the generations.
While the one on ceilings on the extra-carved white sand fled at the beach bar, others labelled in a quarter of wine in the vinothek, the youngster popped on the Hüpfburg, which was a great attraction for the smaller guests.
But even in child makeup, the volunteers had to do all their hands in the true sense of the word to become Lord of the demand and to enchanting imaginative creations in the small faces.
The larger used the Kickertables or participated in a skateboard workshop that the Goodfoot crew made of salt welds.
Until the big rain came.
Shortly before 5: 30 he prayed down on the visitors, especially families searched for widespread and dry.
But the attractiveness of the festival did not stop this.
"There were more people than expected," said Ron Sem, who spoke of a "success all over the line."
That is why a repeat of the big party will not be prevented next year.
Although the content and size of the event still needs to be worked, Sem made clear in a first balance on Sunday against the referendum.
In the meantime, he said that he had to stop the entry.
Obviously, the security company had been booked with too little power.
The result: Some who had already paid did not come to the site anymore.
The resonance would have been very good.
In a first cautious estimate, the Salzwedeler co-organizer spoke of about 1200 visitors who fumbled in the castle garden.
There were problems with sound technology.
The Salzwedeler Hip-Hop Band Blocks' n'Rox broke off her appearance for that reason.
The technicians were not able to create a half-wise sound.
The planned shisha lounges could not be built because the tents could not be brought to Salzwdel because of a tyre.
"But next year they will be there," said the organizer.
The premiere of the Amula Open Airs was more than successful by the visitors' numbers.
And that in bad weather.
However, the organisers have made some mistakes that will continue to perish the first time, but have to be eliminated at the second edition.
Also in the social network Facebook, the organisers need to insert criticism.
"Sorry, but for 12 euros you have just been expecting more," Melanie Meier says on the event page.
"Unfortunately, you have taken over a little bit," Ele Zimmermann says in the same place.
Others do not see the initial problems very closely.
I think it's very good that some people don't just talk stupid, but actually try to put something on their feet.
Hut off! "writes Stephanie Jenß to Amula.
Now the organizers will have one year to stop these criticisms.
New Radom in Berkum: Wachtberg's landmark shrinks
This is not expected to happen.
Instead, the ready component awaits to be used in the marked building.
The action is in the context of a major measure: almost 50 years after the establishment of the Space Observation Radar TIRA, the shell, the so-called Radom, is completely renewed.
The new radar will be slightly smaller with a diameter of 47.5 meters than the old one.
However, the size remains world record.
The last step to complete the new hull is the barrel exchange
The upper quarter of the old hull is separated and removed with a crane.
After that, the last quarter of the new hull will be set up.
If the weather is in play, the action should go over the stage at the beginning of this week.
Participant in the Ice Bucket Challenge
Isabelle Roberts from the UK shouted so much when her ice-cold water was cast over her head that she hurt the bone structure of her face.
This ice-bucket challenge went down painfully.
A woman was introduced to the hospital after she had so much screamed at the Ice Bucket Challenge that she was getting rid of the jaw.
Isabelle Roberts from the United Kingdom circled so much when her ice-cold water was poured over her head that she hurt her facial structure.
"The water was so cold that I screamed, and while I did it, my jaw just stayed standing," she said to The Mirror.
Ice water is shaken over the 20-year-olds.
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but I couldn't, the jaw was chopped, and then I realized that something was wrong.
My mother and my sister saw this too and almost smiled, but I had to go to the emergency.
The 20-year-olds from the United Kingdom were sent to the hospital to get the jaw back in after participation in the viral trend on Tuesday.
The clip was linked to an Internet sensation and thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
Will the castle clubs be pulling back on a string soon?
Last but not least, there was always a difference between the two Wolfratshauser castle clubs.
Now the boards are thinking about possible cooperation.
As an example for the reconstruction of the Wolfratshauser Castle, the deceased Richard Dimbath, former chairman of the Wolfratshauser castle friends, introduced the project in the French Guédelon.
A year ago, there was no good climate between the castle club and the castle friends Wolfratshausen.
The views have so far appeared to be very different, as with the history of the Wolfratshauser Castle and a possible reconstruction to be addressed.
Now the two camps are moving towards each other: discussions will soon be held on a common approach.
This is confirmed by the Association Presidents Torsten Sjöberg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burgfreunden) on request of our newspaper.
"I called Mr Piffl and suggested that we could sit together once," says Sjöberg.
In his view, all members of the two associations could be rejoiced in the future.
Thus there are faster visible successes.
While the castle friends around the suddenly deceased Richard Dimbath had a reconstruction of the castle on the mountain forest in sight, the castle club around Sjöberg stands at the forefront of the "exploration and experiencing" of the site.
Herbert Piffl, second chairman of the castle friends, was very pleased according to his own information about the call.
Since Dimbad's death, he's been in front of the castle friends.
A new chairman will be found in a member meeting in mid-September.
According to the 74-year-old, the association currently counts about 40 members.
"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath, we first let the union activities rest out of respect." This "thinking phase" had been necessary to "consider how it could go on."
According to Piffl, the new chairman is to go to the conversation with the castle club.
Until then, the castle friends could also make an up-to-date ballot within their grouping.
Piffl says there is not yet a candidate for the presidency.
"But I am confident that someone will find himself." He himself does not want to apply because he has his residence in Bad Tölz.
The new chairman should be a Wolfratehauser.
The Tölzer would like to work on the project "but would like to continue to work."
The different positions on reconstruction will probably remain in the eyes of Piffls in the near future.
He appreciates Dimbath as a "missionary," who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.
Two similar, far-advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not an airlock.
They are a tourist magnet by means of a high participation of the population and by volunteers from all over the world.
Piffl: "I too was sceptical at the beginning.
But over time, I have become more and more convinced that it is useful to advance the project. "It could be created a" single setting feature "for the floating city.
There's nothing else here.
Furthermore, Piffl believes that the project could be financed by EU grants, visitor tickets and potential sponsors.
"I personally do not want to throw the idea of reconstruction on board." He hopes that the castle club may move at this point.
Their goal of documenting history is "important and good."
After that, you could keep looking.
Cdeliver ways to save in university curricula
Since the cost of university curricula for many students is more than $1,000 per year, the fast-second semester student Matt Schroeder considered a clever savings idea.
He invented a rental system for books of higher semester students and offered a nominal compensation to delay resale.
"My math book usually costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a chick file A cookie," said Schroeder, 19 who visits Covenant College in Georgia.
The books needed for the last semester would have cost him $430, he said.
He spent $120.
Collective leadership informed students to spend more than $1,200 per year on curriculum and study material, but there were various cost-fighting options for students.
Online shops and creative approaches such as the screws are increasingly the solution to the choice for students.
Rent of textbooks becomes more popular, and so students can use a book for a semester, often at a much cheaper price than when they buy.
Neebo Inc, who operates more than 250 university bookshops, announced that the rental of textbooks has doubled since 2011.
Surveys in the industry show that about a quarter of the books were rented in college bookshops last spring, said Neebos Vice President Tevor Meyer.
Less than half of all the textbooks are purchased according to the trade association National Association of College Stores in Campus bookshops.
Here's the one for the best deals.
Buy online
Some new books cost online only one third of the price for which they are available in the campus bookstore.
The ninth edition of "Calculus" vno Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs almost $290, but can be purchased from the specialized textbook retailer Chegg.com for $239.99.
Buy Used
If you don't care about the notes of other or normal traces of use, used books are a good option.
"Calculus" is needed on Chegg.com for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, graduate at Brigham Young University, says he spent 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used edition of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business."
The book was sold new for $48.
Academics such as Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls, recommended students to ask their professors whether earlier issues are admissible.
Sometimes the updates for seminar work are not relevant.
In such cases older expenditure can often be purchased for a fraction of the costs of the latest issue.
Apart from Chegg and Amazon, Half.com of eBay Inc is also a popular alternative for used books.
Rent
Renting curricula is worth considering if you treat them fairly well, think about returning them and don't want to keep the books after completing the course.
You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a newly purchased book.
For example, a student could rent "Calculus" for the duration of a semester for about 20 $.
Please inform yourself about the provisions of the business in which you rent, including the penalty fees that may be incurred for writing notes, submissions or traces of use.
Attention: If you do not return the book, the penalty fees may even exceed the price of a new book.
E-Books
E-books are also an option instead of conventional textbooks.
Sometimes these books are actually rented by providing an electronic license for a certain period of time by wholesalers such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc..
With Chegg, you can rent "Calculus" for 6 months for about 61 $.
Bracey says that students in literature courses often find the best offers, as many classics can be downloaded free of charge today, while scientific and engineering teaching books can be very expensive.
I'm sure you'll look around.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon visit Pepperdine Law School, recommends the ISBN number for pricing in books, as you can be so sure to find the right teaching book.
And before an online order you should check, so Gault, if the book is actually stock.
He learned this lesson on the hard tour.
He bought a book that had four weeks of delivery and finally paid the full price in the college bookstore.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" has not been a cashier
"The Expendables 3" by Sylvester Stallone recorded less than 30 million dollars of its 90 million dollars budget in the USA, while "Sin City: A Dame to Kill For" only recorded 12 million dollars of its 70 million dollars budget.
The film "Sex Tape", cut to Cameron Diaz, recorded only $14.6 million at the opening week, while children's films such as "Dragon Shoulder 2" also disappoint the revenues.
An article by the Telegraph film critic Robbie Collin suggests that in the children's films the lack of quality could be the reason for the films themselves.
In 2014, Collin described as "the worst year" for children's movies and described "Dragon enamels easily made 2" as pure "functional" fantasy continuation.
In the case of movies for a slightly older target group, however, it seems that the quality of the movies is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average cinemaScore- and metacritic evaluation for each summer film start, which was shown between the American Memorial Day and July 20, 2013 and the current year on at least 2000 canvas.
The results are based on the views of cinematographer and cinematographer and indicate that this year's film hits are equivalent to last year's.
Some commentators believe that the development is due to changing vision habits and the growing popularity of web streaming services such as Netflix.
Director Jon Favň, who is currently working on Disney's soon appearing jungle book film, said to the Hollywood Reporter website: "I think the times are changing."
We must accept this and not try to follow the past.
Unlike the current weak cash outcomes of Hollywoodproductions, Netflix recently achieved revenues with the streaming content of 1.2 billion dollars, almost twice as much as last year, where turnover was 837 million dollars.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the film studios for focusing too much on comics and prophecies a "core melting" Hollywoods.
In the light of the current deterioration, some commentators argue that his darker prophecy could certainly contain a true core.
However, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic due to the potential cash strikes to be expected in summer 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World:
The producer of X-Men, Simon Kinberg, recently described the fall in cash results as simply "cyclical" and said to Hollywood reporter: "The next summer will be the biggest summer at the cinema bank at all, and no one will worry about the business anymore."
When a few years ago the second table tennis class was deleted for the streamlining of the league classification, that was a step in the right direction.
Now the German Tischttennisbund has launched an additional 3rd Bundesliga.
The result is that those who did not rise have gone down.
Thus Göttingen's highest-class team torpedo in the Oberliga relegation has avoided the descent, but in the next season is only five-class.
Four-class torpedoes remain ladies, despite their magnificent crossing into the regional league.
The boys and girls of Torpedo start in the Lower Saxony League, as well as the boys of SC Weende.
SG Lenglern and the Torpedo Reserve join the new Verbandsliga, and Göttinger Clubs are no longer represented in the Landesliga.
= = References = = = = External links = = * Official website
What looks like a better district class is now the new district sovereign League South.
This is where TSV Seulingen, VfB Lödingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Einbeck, Hammenstedt, Oberder SV, Langenholtensen, FC Weser and TTC join.
In the district league as regional representatives of Dransfeld and SC Weende, in the district class of TTC II, Red-White, the upper SV II and the teams of TTV Geismar II and III. The district division of the ladies at least begins in Sollstärke.
Güntersen, the TTC and the TTV Geismar II are here with the party.
Torpedo III and Sattenhausen / Wöllmarshausen run in the district league.
With nine teams each
The SC Weende sends his girls to the small district league.
The district league season of the SCW boys - where Torpedo II is still starting - is also not complete.
In a district class, Geismar, Tuspo Weende and Oberder SV go to the season.
In the first season of the newly founded regional association, the two Gottinger circals start with nine teams each.
In the West season, the Red-White II, Oberder SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Mielenhausen and SG Lenglern II.
In the East season, Sattenhausen / Wöllmarshausen, Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen play.
The women's circular league consists of Sattenhausen / Wöllmarshausen II, Bilshausen, Hemelen, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weende and SG Rhume.
This is still better than in the district of Osterode, where there are no women's teams at all at circular level.
Concerning that none of the six 2nd circle classes should achieve strength, here the innovative and reluctant circle board will have to think already once.
NATO Summit: First Protests in Newport and Cardiff
At the weekend there were protests from opponents of the NATO Summit in Newport.
On Saturday hundreds gathered in the center of Newport to an anti-NATO march.
On Sunday about 150 people met in Cardiff in front of the city hall to hold a so-called counter summit.
Stephen Fairclough has followed developments for us this weekend and talked to demonstrators who travelled to Belgium from Bridgend.
Teenagers flew out of the Blue Mountains
Two young buwlers were secured with the rope winds after they were caught the night in the Blue Mountains in NSW.
The 16-year-old girl and the 19-year-old man broke out for their tour shortly after Sunday afternoon in Govetts Leap in Blackheath.
Anxious relatives called the police at about 8 a.m. when they hadn't returned home.
A search team from local police and rescue services broke up and the couple was found at about 23 a.m. near Bridal Veil waterfalls.
The girl had hurt his knee and the man had crashed and hit his head.
Rescue forces stayed with the couple overnight, and they were flown out on Monday morning.
They were delivered in stable condition with an ambulance to the Blue Mountains Hospital.
Escalating government hostile protests in Pakistan
The approximately 1,000 demonstrators had been pushed by soldiers from the PTV building, said Minister of Information Pervaiz Rashid.
The transmitter resumed the broadcast after about half an hour.
PTV Director Athar Farooq said the demonstrators equipped with sticks had damaged devices in the editorial work.
Dead or injured have not been reported.
The demonstrators call for the resignation of the Head of Government, to whom they accuse election fraud.
The police announced that about a kilometre away from the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif there had come again to collapses of about 3,000 demonstrators with security forces on Monday.
According to hospital records, a cop was injured.
At least three people had been killed and more than 500 injured in the weekend when demonstrators tried to move to Sharifs residence.
They demand the resignation of the Prime Minister.
On Sunday night after a meeting in the Army Headquarters, the powerful military had called for a political solution to the conflict to "waste no time and apply without violence."
The communication also said: "The army remains committed to its role in ensuring the security of the state."
The escalating violence has been worrying about an intervention by the military, which has been more frequent in the past.
The protests directed by the opposition policeman Imran Khan and the preacher Tahirul Qadri have lasted since the day of independence on 14 August.
Sharif refuses to resign.
Khan and Qadri had called their followers on Sunday to withhold.
"We will not go back without forced Sharif to resign," said Khan.
Qadri said something similar.
Khan argues that Sharif had won the parliamentary elections last May by cheating.
Qadri calls for the resignation of the central and provincial governments.
Then a transitional government should reform the electoral system and proclaim new elections.
More than 40 000 security forces are in use to protect the government district.
The demonstrators had first held out peacefully in front of Parliament until Khan and Qadri called them on the weekend to step forward to Sharif's residence.
Hütteldorfer after second season victory on place three of the table.
With the 2: 0 over size, for Rapid a bitter week on Sunday took a reconciling end.
"The victory is very liberating," said Trainer Zoran Barisic, whose team had reached an intermediate in the Europe League on Thursday.
"The success experience was extremely important," confirmed Captain and Torschtze Steffen Hofmann, who came to place three with green-white.
With the second season victory, Schrammel-Traumtor brings Rapid to win Rapid has shown the right response to the disappointment against Helsinki and goes with a success experience into the country's game break.
"We wanted to show a positive reaction," said Outsider Defender Thomas Schrammel, who with his magnificent leading Volley from the Sixteenth Age in the 14th minute put the paths on victory.
"I thought I'd put all the fruit in from Thursday and cut it under the latte," said the 26-year-old smiling.
When scramble had hit the last time in a federal League apartie on November 13, 2010, it was still for Ried.
The first championship hit in the Rapid Dress will therefore remain in special memory.
"For me this is a very special thing, I am from the Rapid generation," said Schrammel.
Because of Mario Pavelic's short-term basin blasphemy, scratch moved from the left to the right side of the defensive and also made his thing very good there.
He has enough experience that he can exercise this position in a mirror way.
He deserved the gate, he has already provided some assists today, "praised Barisic.
Team shows character scratch also delivered the flank to 2: 0 by Hofmann after about an hour, which finally brought the decision.
Because before that, the guests could have written it down.
"Thank God we have had some luck today," also noticed scratch, which played on the blast of performance and result in recent weeks: "The results have not voted, but the playful was always good compared to the last year."
Barisic even found that "in many games before today, one had been better than" against "the strongest team that played this season in this stadium."
The first three points since July 26 have therefore proven that the team's structure is intact despite the retreats: "Today my team has shown that it has character."
Not less happy for him: "We finally played to zero again."
Much work during the country's play break Also the fact that with Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger have to complain about several failures, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl, as well as Philipp Schobesberger, made the victory even more valuable.
"One must not forget that," Barisic, who lost with Behrendt and Pavelic players in the past three days, "who have been very stable lately."
For this reason, the country's playing break had to be used to "lick wounds and add a little bit in the physical field," Barisic, who has five U21 selectors in his row.
One of whom the break seems to be particularly located is Captain Hofmann.
He breaks up for the team, goes over pain.
In this difficult phase he has shown that he is a very important player for us, "Barisic said.
Hofmann gave the game Rapids before his exchange in the 68th minute not only the structure, but also achieved the second gate.
For the 33-year-old who completed his 350. Bundesliga game, it was the first hit out of the game since November 2, 2013 (4: 2 about the Admira).
Hofmann: "Can't believe that everything is good now" "We must have had a bit of luck too, but at some point happiness must come back to us too.
Now it was high time, "said Hofmann.
He said, "You can't always see it black and white.
We haven't played as bad in the last few weeks as it has been shown.
But we must not believe that everything is okay now either.
He was unable to contest the importance of his role for the team.
It's a very young team that I can help very much at the moment.
They will stick to me in certain phases, "said Hofmann.
Grodig-Coach Michael Baur had little to blame for and his team.
He regretted the rapid counter "from the category of magician," as well as the regular gate of utility in the 40th minute, which had been wrongly rejected by arbitrator colleague.
The only accusation I can make to the team is that we were not specific enough towards the gate in some phases.
There were too few graduates.
Interior defender Maximilian Karner looked like it: "It just started badly, but then we found in and even made a gate.
In general, there would have been more in it.
Under this whistle, Ruh reigns
We showed a powerful tribe in our puzzling task of the summer series "My piece of Rhine's happiness" last Friday.
Several of these trees still exist in the countryside, the illustrated specimen is the "peace of mind" above the Underweißenbrunn.
A hollow foot path leads up to the approximately 600-year-old oak.
It passes through couplings, basalt stone hops and basalt stone meadows.
A piece below the quarry from the Bauersberg, a kilometre north of the road to Weisbach, it stands there.
Vital looks like the natural monument, it stretches beyond the other trees of the surrounding area and reminds of an American mammal tree with an area of more than eight metres.
A small Buddha on a tree stump suggests that it is a spiritual or mysterious place.
However, despite intensive research, there were only indications of name origin.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider has consulted the Bishofsheimer archive and consulted older people from underweißenbrunn in order to find out what attitude it has with the vocal vocation.
The result of his research remained the rather sober explanation for the name.
So until about 80 years ago, the goat shepherds were supposed to have driven their animals from underwhitewell to the muddy roasted and free meadows.
On the foot of the tree, the animal guardians who were exhausted from the rise should have rest.
Meanwhile, the area has gained its meaning back, because on the meadows actually pasture goats again.
The area has also been declared the core zone of the biosphere reserve, Schneider has further found out.
However, when entering the rock collections one should be cautious, because the basalt heated by the sun is also a popular place for cross-otters.
A hiking path leads from underweißenbrunn to the tree, but it is somewhat hidden.
Further paths are signposted, the direction of the high rhino rise and invite to an extended hike.
Where's the waterburg?
However, a waterburg which is sought for our next task is rarely to be found at the height.
The mirror in the tomb already gives a good impression of the construction, but we have some historical buildings in the countryside to which the building conterfei might fit.

After weeks of pigeon, Italy's Prime Minister and President of the EU, Matteo Renzi, passed the nomination of his Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini as head of EU foreign policy against strong conservative resistance at the EU Special Summit last week, and she will be the successor of Britin Catherine Ashton.
Renzi considers, as the government's near daily newspaper La Repubblica reflects, that his Mogherini, also in the government team, is the favourite one to strengthen the position of the Social Democrats and its own in the EU.
He also expects a drive for his "reform package" in Italy.
Not least, Renzi hopes to make sure that the left party base that is constantly appealing against him is calm, because Mogherini is assigned to it - though rather in a moderate way.
Concerning the conservative representatives with President Jean-Claude Juncker and the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Donald Tusk will be appointed, according to the predominant opinion in Rome, with a view to making political compensation.
The EU's chief diplomas will also be the Vice-President of the Commission, Mr Juncker.
The still outstanding agreement of the European Parliament is considered to be safe.
Otherwise, President Giorgio Napolitano would hardly have called the nomination of the 41-year-old politician of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) a "important recognition" of the role of Italy in the EU.
La Repubblica disseminates optimism that the Mogherini, known for its ambition, has been proving for almost two decades in leading party offices, will show itself the "enormous challenges."
The born Roman woman is married and has two daughters.
Her party career began with the graduated politologist in 1996 in the youth organization of the then Demotici di Sinistra (Left Democrats), which joined the Margherita Catholic Central Party in 2008 to the present Social Democratic PD.
In 1999 Mogherini became Vice-President of the European Community Organisation of Socialist Youth (European Youth Social Democrats) for three years.
When she was elected to the Left Democrats' Party Council in 2001, she entered the high party policy, working in the Department of Foreign Policy, whose head she soon became.
It occupied traditional priorities of Italian foreign policy such as the Middle East, was known by studies on NATO operation in Afghanistan, in which Italy is involved with a force quota, and had contacts with the Social Democrats in Europe and with the Democrats in the United States.
Since 2008, she has been a member of the Chamber of Representatives, in which she is an expert on defence and European and international affairs.
When Renzi became a premier in February 2014, he called Mogherini to his Foreign Minister.
If today the PD has a better relationship with the strong peace movement in the country, which contributed to the more than 40 percent of the party's votes in the EU elections in May, Federica Mogherini has a share of it, as it is noted in PD circles.
The events in Brussels, the new EU foreign representative has too little diplomatic experience, so if there is no substance, the PD will discuss them.
In Brussels, especially by Poland and the Baltic members, Mogherinis's mistrous realistic accent to the crisis in Ukraine is being pursued and disseminated as a "Russia-friendly course."
It supports the South Stream pipeline operated by the Russian company Gasprom, which is intended to be transported directly to southern Europe via Russian natural gas, with the exception of Ukraine, which also serves to secure energy from Italy.
After Renzi was appointed EU President in July, Mogherini travelled to Moscow for the first time.
Photos they showed with Putin at the shake-hand were taken in Brussels with remorse, as well as inviting the Kreml leader to an economic summit in Milan in October.
A total of nine young people started their training on Monday at emz-Hanauer in Nabburg.
Among these is an Azubi who has already completed another training in the company.
In four training professions the new employees will be active in the future: electronics (three trainers), mechatronics (two), tool mechanics (two) and process mechanics (two).
All Azubis come from the district of Schwandorf: Tobias Braun and Thomas Bücherl from Schwarzach, Stefan Brickl and Florian Rewitzer from Schmidgaden, Johannes Beer from Neunburg form Forest, Felix Domaier from Oberviechtach, Daniel Sorgenfrei and Sebastian Zahner from Pfreimd and Ferdinand Strebl from Teunz.
The new apprentices previously visited primary and middle schools and real schools.
From Wednesday to Friday, the trainers of all the years and the trainers go to a team training event to Oberammergau, where, among other things, a full day walk and rafting on the Inn are on the program.
The company has 435 employees across Germany and 950 employees worldwide.
The number of trainees distributed over all years is 27.
The Socialists in France should "shut up and set up France," said the most important ally of Francois Hollande.
Mr Valls called on the deeply split left to show "their love" to the controversial socialist president whose cabinet conversion has been disapproved by the vast majority of the French.
The President deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to remain at his side," he said with great applause.
As a humiliating gesture, the Prime Minister insisted that his government would not question the controversial 35-hour week in France, despite severe demands for a relaxation of the regime by Emmanuel Macrons, the new economic ministers.
On Saturday, Mr Hollande urged his co-socialists to show "united" with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the Minister of Justice, scattered the sand into the gearbox in which she appeared at a meeting of a separated Socialist MEP and criticized the Socialist Party for taking the French "faith in their future."
Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader of the National Front, mocked the constant grave struggles of socialists and said that she could not imagine that the new valley government would last for more than a few months.
Francois Hollande is the emperor without clothes, but Prince Manuel Valls has neither, they are forced to form a new government if the old man has not even survived a summer.
"And the new will also not survive the autumn or winter," said Miss Le Pen to supporters.
She repeated the call of her party after a resolution of Parliament and said that she was confident to be victorious in premature elections and was ready for government.
The ruling party of France suffered a defeat in the municipal elections in March and the right-wing national front was ahead in the EU elections in May.
A survey in the Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche showed that 76 percent of the French believe that the Socialist Party is exposed to the risk of falling into several rivalry groups before the end of the term of office of Holland in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Sciences Po University, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government did not improve the economy and record unemployment numbers.
"There is a small window for possibilities, but public opinion must feel quickly that things change," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could continue to deteriorate.
Norwegian Cruise shortly before a deal with Prestige Cruises of 3 billion
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the third largest cruise provider in the world, leads advanced negotiations to acquire the competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc for about $3 billion.
A deal would give Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to the luxury cruise ships of Prestige Cruises and its prosperous customer, while there is competition with larger rivals such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
An agreement could be announced this week, the sources said on Sunday and warned that the talks could also end without results.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private equity company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N) also owns a 20 percent share of Norwegian Cruise.
The sources asked to remain anonymous as the negotiations were not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, while a spokesman for Apollo rejected a comment.
The company Norwegian Cruise, managed in Miami, operates 13 cruise ships on routes between North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
His revenues were $2.57 billion in 2013, an increase of 13 percent compared to 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also located in Miami, acts under the brand names Oceania and Regent, who jointly operate eight cruise ships on routes to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenue for 2013 of $1.2 billion, an increase of 6 percent compared to the previous year.
The cruise industry is around $29 billion in total and in the coming years it is expected to benefit from the strengthening of the middle class in emerging countries such as China and India.
The companies try to position themselves for these new customers as the best choice with the cruise providers.
Prestige Cruises applied to the US regulatory authorities in January 2014 for the stock exchange.
Apollo has been the majority shareholder of the company since a $850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was founded in its current form in 2000 by a merger with a cruise provider owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a leisure and casino group under the control of the Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise went to the stock exchange in January 2013.
According to the licensing authorities at the end of June, Genting held 28 percent of the shares, Apollo 20 percent of the shares and the private equity company TPG Capital LP held an 8 percent share of the company.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise share more than 82 percent of the passenger capacity of American cruise ships according to the original application documents for Prestige Cruises.
Pro Hong Kong activists condemn China the day after the election decision.
A poetry-faithful group swinged the Chinese flag nearby.
On Sunday, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress adopted a framework law allowing only two or three candidates for the leading election in Hong Kong in 2017.
All candidates must first obtain the majority of the support of a nomination committee, which is expected to be occupied with trustworthy members.
This decision makes it almost impossible for opposition Democrats to be elected and induced pro-democracy activists to perceive their threat and to discourage Hong Kong's financial place with "Occupy Central" protests.
Political reforms have long been a controversial issue in Hong Kong, and China's leadership fears that the call for democracy will extend to other cities.
After the publication of a Pekinger White Paper, in which China's predominance over Hong Kong was explained in June, democratic activists held an inofficial referendum on the electoral procedure in the special administration region, where hundreds of thousands marched into the city's business district and organised a sit-in there.
Lis interrogation is organised by the government in Hong Kong and the Chinese liaison office in Hong Kong.
The Deputy Chairman of the Legal Commission of the Standing Committee, Zhang Rongshun and the Deputy Director of the Hong Kong Office and Macaus State Council, Feng Wei, should be consulted during the course of the day.
Student activists announced to gather in the afternoon in front of the leading office in Hong Kong.
Great Britain did not provide any democratic elements until the final phase of the 150-year colonial government in Hong Kong.
Putin asks Kiev to take up "State talks" with the Ostukraine
According to Russian President Vladimir Putin, Russian media reports on Sunday that the Ukrainian government will cease fighting the separatists in the east of the country and start immediately with negotiations on the "state" of the demarcated region.
His spokesman, Dimitri Peskov, later made it clear that Putin did not mean that the area of the East Ukraine under the control of the separatists would become part of Russia, but that its status with regard to Ukraine had to be redefined in order to give the Russian-speaking region the power to represent its rights and interests.
However, Putin's call for the Kiev Government to negotiate at eye level with the pro-Russian rebels fits with the strategy he seems to have followed since the start of the tensions five months ago: aid to the separatists taking areas and pressure on the Ukrainian government to allow the newly proclaimed region Novorossija factual independence for an alliance with Russia instead of the West.
In an interview with the state television channel one, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to reconquer the areas held by separatists in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were taken in March and April after Moscow had annected the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on 18 March.
The Kremlin and the Separatists have recently called the area "Novorossija" or "Neurus Land," a term that remembers the prerevolutionary glory of the Russian Empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who, in the course of Ukrainian politicians' campaigns for the elections on 26 October and during government groups of civilian communities in the areas held by separatists, are hoping to "be caught in their illusions," reported Itar Tass.
"We need to begin detailed discussions immediately, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organization of society and the state status of the South-East Ukraine in order to preserve the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskov said that Putin's reference to the state should be seen in the context of the greater autonomy that has been discussed by the Kiewer leadership for months to disseminate fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are jeopardised.
Only the Ukrainian government can give the Eastern Territories the necessary autonomy, said Peskov.
This is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it is not about a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but about an internal conflict in Ukraine."
The clarification of the Kremlsprecher on the correction of the "misinterpretation" of Putin's remarks underlined Russia's leadership in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the east, in contrast to the direct accusation of Crimea, where the majority of the two million inhabitants are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have far greater difficulty in approaching the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and surveys from the time before the conflict gave a broad majority for staying in Ukraine.
The autonomy addressed by Russian diplomats on international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine power to negotiate their own trade agreements and external relations, giving the Kreml de facto control over an area that connects the Russian territory with Crimea.
The peninsula annexed five months ago in the Black Sea is the home port for most of the Russian Navy as well as an important commercial port and historical coastal region.
The regions between the Rostov area in Russia and Crimea are also rich in mines, factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian military.
The Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed in his speech on 7 June that the Ukrainian legislation - after new elections - should consider additions to the Constitution, which would give the respective areas greater control over their finances and the status of languages.
But his imagination of autonomy seems to be in sharp contrast to those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels whose arms and rebellion Moscow is accused of.
Putin's last call to Kiev to negotiate with the Separatist leaders at eye level followed a further call from the rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks penetrated the previously peaceful region along the Asosian Sea into the East Ukraine.
The separatists supported by Russia took over in the hand line, which, according to the fears of Ukrainian security officers, is the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to Crimea, the control of Nowoasowsk.
For this reason, massive civilian and military preparations have begun to consolidate Mariupol, a steel industry harbour with 500,000 inhabitants, which lies between Nowoasowsk and the narrow access to the Crimea peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke at a meeting of the EU leadership in Brussels on Saturday and urged action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet Republic which has been independent for 23 years.
"We are at a point where there is no return," said Poroshenko.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU Summit did not decide on any concrete action, the leadership demanded the draft further sanctions against Russia to enter into force in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowajsk after two Russian tanker columns and 1,000 soldiers entered the Donetsk region last week to support the sieged separatists, said Colonel Andrij Lysenko, spokesman of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council Reports on Saturday in Kiev.
The first suspected 63 Ukrainian soldiers, including the Russian invasion in Ilowajsk, were exchanged on Sunday against 10 Russian parachute hunters who had been captured on Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko informed on Sunday.
Naked photo scandal around Australian Promis and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Edelsten did not make a hero for his trouble about hackers who probably stole naked pictures of his fiancée Gabi Grecko and a who is who the A-Promis from Hollywood.
The film city is in excitement after a series of clear photos of a naked Jennifer Lawrence appeared in a hack candal around promis on the Internet.
The hacker who is responsible for this has probably 60 naked photos of Lawrence, star from "the tribute of Panem" and superstars, including the models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, the singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, as well as the actress Kirsten Dunst.
Of the Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Grecko from Melbourne, private photos were allegedly also published due to an iCloud gap.
There are 101 promis on the list.
Edelsten, who had engaged to Grecko last month, said to Confidential, "It's disgusting."
All private letters and pictures should remain private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and passed on to others.
Grecko, currently in New York, reported that a news website said that the hack was "shameful" and that the affected people felt "injured."
The hacker probably has 30 pictures of Palmer with her ex-friend Scott Speedman, including two recordings in which she is on top without a pool.
Among the film works Palmers include "Love is unvictorious" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck-Star Strahovski and the actress Browning from Sucker Punch were not available yesterday for comments on the hacked images.
A representative Lawrence 'said to TMZ: "It is a terrible breach of privacy."
Actor Seth Rogen condemned the hacker in his tweet: "Hacked images from a cell phone are nothing but the sale of helmsware."
In legal terms, the spread of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Radler, Jogger and Wanderer attended the 8th Radling on the Great Feldberg yesterday and thus supported the association "Help for Cancer Children."
The tour, for which one was a torture, was an easy training for the other.
In one, however, everyone agreed: it was fun.
Thomas Studanski must have slept well last night.
For the first time in his life, the chief of the Oberurseler Brauhaus drove the bike to the Feldberg yesterday.
For the good purpose.
He can easily put away the little muscle cater, since his participation in the 8th wheel on the Great Feldberg in favour of the Association "Help for Cancer Children" (Frankfurt) has also personally brought a valuable insight into it.
That's a great thing.
"I know now that I can do this - fine!"
Little pussy on the way in the applause curve?
No, if I had stopped once, it would have been over...
Like Thomas Studanski, who is sitting for the CDU in the Oberurseler City Parliament, many of the 718 participants tore themselves to mountains yesterday morning and approached the exhaust but happy arrival on the plateau.
Others, on the other hand, it was easier to overcome the roughly eleven kilometers long distance between Hohemark and Feldberg.
Norman Dießner, for example.
The whole green politician from the circular day - red dress, red bike - made a little bit of understatement at the start ("A lot of professionals, there's arrivals the target!"), then proved to be half a professional on the mountain and went through the goal after 45 minutes without breathing.
He also went through the route in a slide, as did Nina Kuhn, press princess of the city of Oberursel, who had gone along with Frank Grüneisen.
For the two triathletes, the "Feldberg-Radeln" was not necessarily a sports challenge: "This is about Charity, we would be happy to be there - we would have made an exit today anyway," said Kuhn.
On the way they had met Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The boy (12) had gone down to Oberursel in the morning to strap back to the height immediately thereafter.
The Frankfurter Florian Zierz had swung home at 9: 00 in the morning in the saddle, "made" the Feldberg twice to roll home with fun.
It was also fun "Fritten-Toni."
For the head of the Oberurseler Kultkiosk, cycling tours over the Feldberg are simply included.
He had spent 40 minutes with his 6.5 kilo racing wheel.
It's a crazy event.
For this purpose - I would like to be there, "said Andreas Balzke.
The trained Mainzer says that he is an ambitious racer.
He must also be, because he was on the "Fixie wheel," although they are racing wheels, but without a switch...
Not only the 20 hikers who climbed over the White Wall and the Fuchstanz to the summit without a bike loose went up to the top, but also a jogger who pulled a car pipe with weights behind him on a cordel.
The mountain guard doctor Professor Volker Lischke, who was equipped with his team, equipped with Allrad Bully and Quad, said: "I know him from Frankfurt, who trains for a special sled rail only that he keeps pulling the sled himself." So the man is somehow his own sled dog.
The 718 participants - and so many as never before - had been sent to the route in groups in the morning.
The hikers first at 9: 30.
It followed the first bikers and runners at 10 o'clock.
Five minutes later, the first mountain bikers started.
Bent Hansen, Chairman of the Association "Radeln on the Great Feldberg," gave the launch commands and wished the participants a nice trip.
Next year he hopes that it will be possible to lock up the route to Feldberg to the safety of the participants.
