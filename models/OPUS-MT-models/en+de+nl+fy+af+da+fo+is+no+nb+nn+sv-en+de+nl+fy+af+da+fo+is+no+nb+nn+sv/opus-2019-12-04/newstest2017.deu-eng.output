28-year-old cook found dead in San Francisco Mall
A 28-year-old cook, recently moved to San Francisco, was found dead in the staircase of a local shopping centre.
The victim's brother said that he can't imagine anyone who would want to hurt him, "At last he went up again."
The body found on Wednesday morning at the Westfield Mall was identified as the 28-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco, notified the medical department in San Francisco.
The San Francisco Police Department said that death was classified as a murder and the investigation is running.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, informed the ABS transmitter KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who used to work as a cook in Boston, had taken his dream job as a chef at the Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago.
A spokesman of the Son & Daughter said that they were "shocked and destroyed on the ground about his death."
"We are a small team working like a tight family and we will miss him badly," the speaker continued.
Our thoughts and our condolences are with Frank's family and friends in this difficult time.
Louis Galicia stated that Frank lived in Hostels first, but that "things finally went up for him."
"He found an apartment, he had a girlfriend," said Louis Garcia KGO.
Louis Galicia said he couldn't imagine anyone who would want to hurt his younger brother.
He was a friendly person with a great heart.
His way of connecting with his family was always to cook us something to prepare for dinner, "said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to take part in any kind of dispute.
He was the brother who was swimming with the power.
"With everything that goes wrong in the world, he was this uncarved diamond that lit light every day," he said.
Any person who has information on the case is asked to call the SFPD's dedication phone under number 415-575-4444.
Jennifer Aniston: I always get stuck in drawers
Jennifer Aniston doesn't always have to be perfect or successful.
The Hollywood Star has made this clear in an interview.
"I am always stuck in drawers or get attached from outside labels that usually have little to do with me and reality."
"I myself do not wish to always be perfect and successful."
"Honestly, these things are more snapping to me."
Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh that she is considered "Miss Perfect," as she explains in the current "Cosmopolitan."
The actress's favorite time is at home, in front of television with loose dutt and Mexican food, it says in the magazine.
To the white glut she brings the question of the child's wish: "We women don't have to be married or have children to be perfect," says the Hollywood star.
In her new film "Mother's Day - Love is not a children's game" Aniston is seen as a single mother of two sons.
The film is running with us from August 25th.
Golfer Langer receives the sports pyramid
His experiences on the horse are obvious.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer and some colleagues sought a little change with a trip on the beach.
It was a premiere for the 58-year-old.
CHIO: "Golden Sports Pyramid" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes, the horses remembered their holidays, they chased home in the fast Galopp to feed.
A mile at this pace, I was scared.
"It wasn't a good experience," says Langer.
And so the riding career ended again.
On Saturday, Germany's best golfer of all times - 101 tournament victories - was again near horses.
He and his family were guided by the system of the ALRV, and he didn't even swing on a horse for photographic purposes.
Langer was the first time in Aachen and thus also at the CHIO.
The reason was quite convincing.
The German sports aid provided the Golden Sports Pyramid to the man from Anhausen in the framework of a small gala.
There is no lack of awards for the sympathetic athlete.
Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silbernes Lorbeerblatt, Champions-Tour-Player of the year...
Even the British queen has already adored him.
Long is the 18th prize winner of the sports pyramid.
In Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.
"This award means a great deal to me," says Langer, "because it is not only forgiven for sporting successes, but also for social commitment."
For decades, Langer has been promoting young people.
And so he passed on the prize money of 25,000 euros.
With 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time US masterseller was added to the Hall of Fame of German Sports on Saturday.
Among the distinguished are the Leichtathleten Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Gienger, the Fechter Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the rudder Peter-Michael Kolbe, Bob driver Meinhard Nehmer, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the Springreiter Alwin Schockemöhle and posthum of the handballer Erhard Wonderlich.
Many of these sports legends had come to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illustrative society migrated to the Springstadion, where the Lavazza Prize ran.
Bernhard Langer kept a distance from the big animals.
Clintons and Trumps Economic Policy Comparison: It's all about the money
Investing in infrastructure and preventing the trade agreement TTP - that is what Clinton and Trump want.
However, the two US presidential candidates differ in tax and energy policy as well as in a question of principle.
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.
The one about the role of the state.
Trump wants to keep it in doubt rather small and warns about how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wanted to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death, he said.
He himself would be completely different, says Trump.
It will bring down regulations massively, and it will be strong in favour of a far-reaching tax reform with lower rates - for private people and for businesses.
Clinton, on the other hand, says that the State has certain tasks to fulfil, it has disadvantaged opportunities to open and needs money for it.
That is why taxes would be increased for the rich, she says.
Interestingly, both are very close to the issue of infrastructure.
Trump and Clinton say that they must be invested.
The democratic candidate even announces the largest investment in new jobs since World War II.
State investment programmes in infrastructure are classical democratic policy and are strictly rejected by the Republican government-critical teaparty wing.
So Trump could still come up with partial internal discussions.
The differences in energy and climate policy are clearer.
Trump wants to build coal power plants and restore coal production in the United States.
Oil production should also be possible in protected areas so far, and the Paris Climate Change Agreement is intended to be cancelled.
Clinton, on the other hand, explicitly wants to expand renewable energy with its investment programme and calls for: "A country will be the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs."
"It will be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be."
But not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far away from each other.
TPP, the Transatlantic Trade Agreement, does not want both to sign.
At the same time, however, both do not want to isolate the United States from international trade - but simply protect only American jobs better.
They are to be paid better then, about Clinton demands.
The current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars was a hunger wage.
She wants to raise him to 15 bucks an hour.
What Trump wants to do on this issue is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must rise, then he says that he must not be changed.
But the great debate over the next few months is likely to be more evolving around the tax policy of the two camps.
On the one hand, Trump wants to relieve the economy and the citizens in order to stimulate growth.
His critics pretend to him that would only increase the budget deficit.
On the other hand, Clinton, who at least wants the rich to pay more taxes, and whose critics say that more taxes are not the solution either.
Escape: "Every escaped woman has experience with sexual violence"
Sexual violence belongs to women who run alone, almost to everyday life.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.
A house offers refuge.
There are four women in a large kitchen.
Everyone has a baby with it that's not more than one year old.
One put her little son in the arm.
He looks curiously into the room with big eyes.
His mother's staring at the table plate.
Until she realizes she's being watched.
She smiled short and kissed the kid.
The scene seems normal.
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.
She is a branch manager of Condrobs, a subsidiary for social assistance offers in Bavaria, and deals among other things with the issue of women on the run.
The four women in the kitchen are poultry.
They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralised accommodations for single-fledged women and their children in Bavaria.
In January Condrobs opened the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Aid.
It was officially opened recently.
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.
There are no men - nor as visitors.
The exception is a guard outside the door.
"It is not excessive to say: every woman who arrives here has experienced sexual violence on her escape," says Bahr.
"Men escape for wars because they are being politically persecuted because they are threatened with torture or death or because their families send them to Europe as hopes."
In women, other reasons for escaping are outweighed: "Many people steal from it secretly because they see no other way out."
In their home, they have experienced sexual violence, forced sight, honorary murders, slavery or forced prostitution.
That's what drives her away.
On the run it goes on.
"That draggers, for example, require a bottle of water a sexual act is not a rarity," says Bahr.
And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.
Who believes that when they arrive in Germany, the end of it is crazy, says Bahr.
Here too, single women in refugee accommodation are often considered to be inferior and are most abused.
This means that about 90 percent of the women living in the accommodation in Munich's north are traumatized.
"Some of the children have certainly not arisen voluntarily."
Many women are so used to saying nothing.
"Or they don't trust to speak openly about the experienced because the shame is too great."
Since they often don't know how to help, it only needs more accommodation for them, asks Bahr.
In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.
The question of whether they were aware of a similar project as in Munich in their field of competence is answered by some with no.
In the Oberpfalz and Oberfranken, for example, there is no such thing in the sovereignty of governments.
Even in Schwaben, women are not separated from refugees alone, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press spokesman of the government.
In Oberbayern, under- and middle francs there are floors or own houses for single women and their children.
The exception is Niederbayern, where there are two central accommodations exclusively for women.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament also calls for women to be housed separately from men.
In a study published for the Committee, it says: "It is very important that men and women are kept separately."
"If there is a lack of privacy or if men and women are placed together, violence against women can occur - more persistent."
In particular, the laundry rooms should be separated and easily accessible to women, is included in the study.
How much women feel this need for protection, you can read on the request that is available on the house in Munich.
"Since we have been around, we have a long waiting list," says Bahr.
You could easily open a second house.
Assistant doctors strike: Requirements for new work fighting measures
Deputy assistant physicians have called on their trade union to approve new work struggles in their disputes concerning a new contract.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has asked its entire council to approve more work fighting from the beginning of September.
The JDC stated that Minister had forbidden to address the concerns about the Treaty.
Assistant doctors and medical students voted in July on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA.
He was rejected by 58% of his members who voted during the elections.
In a letter to the members published on Twitter on Thursday evening, the chairman of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government had remained "persistent quiet" to problems, leading to the rejection of the Treaty.
She said, "In view of this, the JDC Board voted to reject the proposed new treaty completely and called for official re-negotiations on all your concerns."
In response to the silence of the government, the JDC Board has today made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing programme of escalating work fighting measures beginning in September.
The disputes resulted in assistant doctors striking six times this year, the first total failure in the history of the NHS.
The head of the BMA assistant doctor Dr. Johann Malawana resigned after the election to reject the agreed contractual terms recommended by the BMA.
He informed the members of the BMA during the meetings which were held before the vote by 54,000 assistant doctors and medical students that the contract was beneficial and should be adopted.
After the vote, Minister for Health Jeremy Hunt said that the contract for doctors in England would be forced to be introduced.
Russia and Turkey: A "Alliance of External Sides"?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give themselves hands and to proclaim an official end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish opponent in the golden hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot resist the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation most.
There was the hand hit, yes.
But Putin's smile seemed narrow-lifted and he hardly radiated heat, even for his restraining conditions.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his "dear friend" Putin - according to a report all five times.
I couldn't count it anymore.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve.
The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan had acted as if nothing bad had never happened.
His enthusiasm seemed to me to be the opposite.
But one of Putin's radiant, sustainable cooling showed that Russia's head of state had not forgotten anything.
Instead, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the shooting of a Russian fighter aircraft at the Syrian border through Turkey.
Moscow's response at the time was wounded.
Putin distributed and accused Ankara of falling Russia in the back.
The crime was even bigger since it was committed by a suspected friend.
Reconstruction of veto will be difficult, if not even impossible.
The public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media conducted a violent, unlimited attack on Ankara.
Suddenly, it seemed like the Turks were blaming for everything.
The most serious accusations by senior officials were that Erdogan's own family would have benefited from the illegal oil trade in Syria areas controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He has disputed this veil.
But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.
Finally, this meeting was only because Putin received the apology he wanted to hear from President Erdogan.
Russia could book some sort of victory.
For Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are clear.
Erdogan primarily needs all the friends he can get after he was almost dismissed last month in a failed state strike.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey also shocked him.
But there are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The number has fallen by almost 90%.
In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be facilitated when the flights are resumed.
They count on a late seasonal storm to the Mediterranean Sea.
This week, the state television predicted cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports were allowed again.
A report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows: "tourists there along, tomatoes here."
But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West, as it considers its reaction to the attempted takeover of power as a weak answer.
In addition, the persistent cruel over the sloppy tempo of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is pointing out to benefit from the cool mood and to reduce Turkey's relations with the West.
The Russian Head of State certainly won a bonus in Ankara for requesting support for the elected state bodies after the attempted state strike.
This is a self-understanding for Moscow, which itself has deep-seated fears of change of regime.
The summit in this shiny palace on the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to present one, as an analyst once described to me, "Alliance of External Sides": two countries who have failed and felt ill treated from the West and now become allies.
Nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.
The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently played its role as a peacekeeper, but where Russia and Turkey support opposite sides.
It could be noteworthy that after almost three hours of first talks, both Presidents at the press conference said that they had not even strained the subject.
The President of Turkey avoided deliberately answering a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasise them.
There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found on Syria.
But after months of open hostilities - and given the potential for a complete disaster when NATO member Turkey shot off the Russian fighter - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State at least speak again.
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside Scotland
According to the Board of Directors of the Bank, the RBS brand is to be reduced to a backoffice role.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan informed the BBC Scotland that the brand RBS was connected to the bank's global ambitions.
The bank has been distanced since eight years ago when it almost collapsed and had to be saved.
During this time, brands "RBS" used to protect other end-user financial brands.
She supported international sport with millions of pounds of sponsoring, from Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon Winner Andy Murray.
But now she has decided to focus on more national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland but will not be initialized.
In England and Wales, all RSB references, the decentralised headquarters and the stock exchange are switched to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller brands for the retail business that will become more important - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a tour of customers and employees in Inverness-shire.
He informed the BBC Scotland: "The RSB brand will become our investor brand as well as the brand under which our employees will be employed, as we will now become more a bank of brands."
When the bank became a global brand itself, RBS became a global brand.
I am now saying that we are not pursuing global objectives but local objectives.
Each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will no longer continue its six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the visibility of the different brands in its sport sponsorship.
"It is time for us to develop into the bank of brands, because how do we concentrate inside (we asked) on making this a better bank for customers?" said the Executive Board.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and launched these brands.
But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think, you will see many changes.
We can launch these brands again, so I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori achieves his 3,000th profit at Newmarket on predilection
Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket, which brings him 3,000th gain
On Friday, Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British win at Newmarket.
He was trained by John Gosden on his local race track with his second win of the night a milestone.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth Jockey who reaches the milestone in the flat race.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.
The three-time winner, Dettori, who won on Ghayyar before that, said, "It's something special."
I'm very emotional because my family is here too.
I'm very happy that it happened at Newmarket because I landed here 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a banal Friday night with 20,000 people.
I'm relieved and very modest.
Dettori takes the cheer when he takes the victory on predilection
Two Jockeys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jockey Richard Johnson and the retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who reached more than 4,300 victories in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, the ninth Derby winner had 4.493 career victory
Frankie is one of the best Jockey of the Modern and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone that few have reached before him.
He has style and is strong, but it is his tactical intellect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room.
He is a fantastic ambassador for races, his enthusiasm and Charisma has been enthusiastic fans for this sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he'd already gained 6,000 wins if he wasn't just a weekend and big tournament jockey!
Frankie's been driving winners in GB for almost 30 years, which is great.
He has a living personality, which is good for a British race, but in addition, he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount
From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the trailer of the British flat race for two decades.
It was nervous.
A whole series of major tournaments including his famous "Glorious Seven" in Ascot in 1996, but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug ban.
Three years ago, he had some difficulties when he returned from his six-month lock, but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to confront his doubts and return to his best form.
And he's not finished for a long time - Dettori used to say that he wants to continue in competitions up to his at least 50,000-year-old age.
Russia's Putin fires Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly released his Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov was a member of Putin's closest trust circle for many years.
The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for Environment and Transport.
In a statement by the Kreml it is stated that Putin had "ordered Ivanov to be dismissed from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration without any reason."
Anton Vaino, who has been a substitute for Ivanov since 2012, was appointed his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in 1972 in Tallinn, Estonia, he graduated from the renowned State Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
On the Kreml website, it is said (in Russian) that he was later the protocol head and staff head of the government staff.
About his appointment he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
I believe that it is the most important task of the government to support your work as Head of State on draft laws and controls to implement your instructions.
Putin informed the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.
Are the smiling faces convinced?
This step has made Moscow secrets.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putins' closest trusts and works for the Soviet Secret Service, the KGB.
As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, broadcast on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff would resign on his own request.
But despite the smile for the cameras, only a few are convinced of it here - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So is this the result of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows that right now.
But the official assertion - that a man who was once praised as a potential president wants to lead Russian environmental policy at once - was based on great scepticism.
In his comments to Putin, quoted on the Kreml website, Ivanov said, "it is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 to entrust me to this very complicated post - you might almost say - difficult post for four years.
As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian Bureau for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took the position in December 2011.
Previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the KGB State Security Service.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin reached power, he named Ivanov as one of five people he trusted most.
It was once assumed that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second term of office, as a third term of office would have violated the Constitution.
But this post was taken by another close ally Putins, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister before he became president again three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds Star Thomas Gibson fired after he hit the producer
Gibson was involved in a physical struggle last month in the Los Angeles series set.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced its dismissal in a joint opinion.
Gibson, who played the Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized publicly on Thursday before announcing his dismissal.
On the set there were artistic differences and a difference of opinion.
I regret the incident, "he said in a communication.
Details on how the character of Gibsons from the series, followed by a team of FBI agents, is expected to be published at a later date according to the comments of ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old who had previously played in the Sitcom Dharma & Greg has been involved since the first season of the series in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have put all my heart blood in the last 12 years," said Gibson in a communication published on Friday.
I was hoping to be there until the end, but that won't be possible now.
I would just like to thank the authors, producers, actors, our wonderful crew and, above all, the best fans you can only wish for a series.
The planned broadcast of the twelfth season is scheduled for September 28th.
Rätsel around fish landed in garden in Banff
A residents of Banff called for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks that the 75 fish could be sandals that were spiced out by a fountain.
Mr. Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, published on Periscope a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could light on the appearance of the two inches long fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife
The £1.35 billion expensive project will be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the North Deck of Queensferry Crossings to the Viadukt - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four locks of the "blanket" that approach the completion around each of the three towers of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 cranes.
The £1.35 billion expensive project will be completed by May 2017.
Economic Minister Keith Brown visited the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.
He said, "This is a historic and symbolic moment when building the Queensferry Crossings.
We are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic measure in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel which were used alone for this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the Viadukt and the Bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for the plotting.
In total, almost 79% of the entire bridge decks are at their place and the last section of the deck gets a concrete cast for the deck today in Rosyth, which means that the entire deck is ready to be raised on the bridge to its place.
Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "The first closure is a significant milestone for each bridge project.
With this fantastic project, the closure is a forward-looking high and deep construction.
After the installation of the last road cover section and its connection to the North Tower deck in progress, then we had to close the remaining gap on the north or country side.
This was achieved by pulling the northern bridge 700 millimeters south.
This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.
Massive, as the Viadukt is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled up at a climb of about 3%.
Heikel, since the tolerances that the team is working on were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Save in Moelfre Bay: Three men have "lucky to be alive"
Three men are lucky to be alive after they were thrown from their fishing boat in front of Anglesey.
The RNLI rescue station hit the alarm on Friday at 13: 20 BST after a crew observed the event in Moelfre Bay.
The three men had difficulty swimming safely, while their boat moved on from their own strength.
"We saw the boat turning around and imagined the worst," said the head of the rescue station of Moelfre Vince Jones.
"Fortunately, the strong winds have already waved the boat beyond its reach until we left water," he added.
Two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and found hanging on a bow without a rescue vest.
They all came aboard the coastal rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station.
Mr Jones said, "The three men who were thrown into the water are lucky to be alive.
Although the boat engine had an emergency stop line, it dissolved from the person who controlled the boat at the centre of the boat.
Someone's been watching over these men today.
Heavy injured - man sticks on his ex-girlfriend
A man attacked his ex-girlfriend in Hamburg-Harburg with a knife and severely injured.
As the police told yesterday, the 50-year-old had got the key to the apartment to get his personal things.
Instead, the alcoholized perpetrators cut his ex-girlfriend's clothes.
When this one came into the apartment, he stepped on her twice.
The 44-year-old was injured by the hand and the body.
The police could arrest the perpetrator.
While the 50-year-old destroyed his ex-girlfriend's clothes, he called his mother.
This then alarmed his sister.
The 45-year-old wanted to calm down her brother.
But she couldn't get him to leave the apartment.
That's why she went out of the house with her husband.
On the street, they met the husband's ex-life companion.
When the two women again entered the apartment, the 50-year-old pushed his sister aside and attacked his ex-girlfriend.
Who builds Brunswick's cheap apartments?
The SPD and Greens say that investors will be much more committed in the future.
How do you respond to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments in the coming years?
The SPD proposes to the next Council meeting a "action concept of housing."
But fight is programmed.
First of all, the question is: who should actually build the cheap apartments?
There has been a lack of regulation so far.
SPD Group chairman Christoph Bratmann says: "We agree with the Greens: whoever wants to build on urban areas will have to identify 20 percent of all apartments as social apartments in the future."
However, the favorable apartments can also arise in the stock.
But the big point of dispute in the city hall was, Bratmann said, "How do you deal with investors who want to build on private land?"
"We want investors to build at least 10%, but as much as 20% of the apartments as social dwellings."
A new urban housing support programme, which will cost millions and still needs to be funded, will provide incentives.
The problem, Bratmann said, "There is no agreement between the groups at the moment."
The CDU wants to make as few rules as possible for investors.
The left wants harder conditions for investors.
Despite this, Bratmann said that the situation on the housing market would be tightened up.
If the action concept is implemented, it will provide additional tasks in building management.
More staff is needed.
It is unclear whether we will get the professionals.
But the programme does not yet stand completely: for the approx. 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.
But how do we compensate for the loss of further approximately 1300 favorable apartments, whose promotion will expire in the coming years?
By 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments.
In order to prevent this, according to the planning spokeswoman Nicole Palm, decoupling ties should now be purchased from the city.
In addition, consideration should be given to bringing apartments back to the price bond.
This is possible in the West Town.
The problem could be solved on a hit.
Because in the West Town deadlines run out at the end of the year.
Around 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price bond for cheap apartments.
Only: that's what the owners want, not the housing companies.
For if the number of social dwellings in the West Town is increased drastically again, one is removed from the objective of so-called interference.
There should no longer be a concentration of social weaknesses in just a few parts of the city.
The Greens expect that there will be still movement in the discussion.
The group chairman, Holger Herlitschke, says: "For a broad majority, the CDU must go to the boat."
It has concentrated on more construction sites for single-family houses.
But that does not mean that a compromise cannot be found.
Pokémon Go, a hunting for health and happiness that is worth it
It's fascinating to see the world change.
That teenagers and children are no longer going out to play, but rather prefer to spend their leisure with staring on screens, has been complained by many in the last decade.
Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active.
The time on the screen was initially on the TV, then on video games and last on smartphones.
It is therefore great to see that technology and activities outside do not exclude each other.
I am referring, of course, to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters that were originally created for the video games in the 1990s (later created a drawing series, playcards and other spin offs).
How many phenomena of pop culture sank the interest before the publication of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July.
The market introduction in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that overloaded the servers.
Within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, the players go out with their smartphones and look for Pokémons that are tracked with a GPS and, once found, can be "photographed" (via a screenshot on the phone) or "captured."
A generation that played the game when she was younger joined the madness and jumped for the search from the sofa.
In the United States, the game led to a significant increase in steps that relieves the "average" person every day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch tracking 35,000 users, recently informed Washington Post that within two days of the launch of the game, the number of persecuted people who train 30 minutes each day, rose from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data to increase performance.
Many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to "take 30 minutes," "coming from the sofa" and "being active every day" came on deaf ears because many public messages on health are boring and come from people who look miserable.
Nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overestimated.
Those who regularly run sports reduce their chances of suffering from cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps to control weight, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to guide them here.
But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it makes people do something on the outside that makes them enjoy.
This covers three pillars of health - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.
Some people even close new friendships on the hunt.
As ever, there are murky gambling devastators who always have to complain about something.
And yes, someone could walk against a door.
What's the matter?
There's been a breakthrough.
Even though smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to do sports as this game does.
The new one will lose its irritation and the use will drop over time.
However, due to the success of Pokemon, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with becoming active in the real world and will help many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.

Simone Biles creates gold in the ladies' tower
Forget the pressure.
Forget about the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all this.
Dynamic on the jumping horse.
Hard on the beam.
Breathtaking on the ground.
All the way brilliant.
And now, finally, Olympic egress.
On Thursday, the 19-year-old American tournament declared a multi-fighter title and enlarged the gap between itself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the light of the Olympic Games.
Her overall result of 62.198 was clearly before the silver medal winner and "Final Five" crew comrade Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.
The Americans Simone Biles tours on the floating beam during the single multi-fighter event of women at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles is the fourth heterosexual American who wins a multi-fighter title and in total the fifth, while fasting her reputation to be the best of her generation or even even at all.
She broke out in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey found an end at this moment.
This success puts her in the same league as unique athletes as Michael Phelps who brought her sports to new heights:
Biles has dominated her sport in the last three years, 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic winner of 1984 Mary Lou Retton said that she was "the best tournament I've ever seen."
She expected a final exam in Brazil, a competition that did not go so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a burden of oversized expectations.
Not returning with a handful of gold to the family in Spring, Texas would be considered disappointment.
The Americans Simone Biles, on the left, and Aly Raisman hug each after they have won gold and silver in the single multi-fighters of women at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday
Biles picked up the first medal on Tuesday, while at the farewell celebration Martha Karolyi, the team coordinator who wanted to retire, served as a call mark.
Although Biles insisted on never planning the future during her long journey, it is not true.
Some of their floor exercises - which contain their typical Tumbling Pass - are adapted to Latin American music, which would fit at home on the street outside the Olympiarena in Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
This girl, who was adopted by her grandparents as a child and discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother during a school trip to the gym, where Boorman trained, became a force.
She has not lost a multi-fighter competition since summer 2013, a victory series that will stop as long as Biles wishes.
Even though Mustafina led easily through two rounds, the picture consoled.
Swimming beams and towers - where Biles holds the world championship - laughed.
She picked up again with 15.433 on the swivel beam - and put another one on the ground with a 15.933.
Raisman hugged her gently when she was expecting her final victory - a pure formality - and tears streamed on Billy's shiny red, white and blue eyeliner when the vision she once described in her collection book became reality.
Raismans' performance was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place, but the bronze medal went to Mustafina in a tear brake.
This time, the 22-year-old crew captain, called "Grandma" by the Americans, had a leap forward.
After her ground practice, she threw to the audience kissing halls, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes seemed doubtful.
As far as Biles is concerned, the rapidly expanding tweet of the 19-year-olds from the beginning of this week has a very new meaning:
Police: 3 victims in serial murderers shot during listening to music in the car
According to police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot who have been killed in one of the deadliest attacks for a decade in the first serial murder of Phoenix while they were talking in the car and listening to music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis's daughter Maleah were shot on June 12, while the car was parked in an entrance, said the authorities.
The perpetrator fired eight shots from a hand firearm while standing on the side of the car and then fled with another vehicle, is read in the report.
The police informed that the triple murder does not seem to be the result of a robbery, since the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2,900 that were owned by one of the adult victims.
The policeman of Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting led the investigators to get a closer look at whether it was associated with four previous attacks.
In total, seven people were killed and two more injured in Hispanic residential areas within four months in nine attacks.
"It happens in a residential area in front of a house," Howard informed the KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, at the beginning of the month.
It is assumed that the suspect has used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose the evidence they led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized due to her injuries and died later.
Liner, 31, and Ellis's daughter Maleah died on site.
A witness informed the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a car parked and listen to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting that was aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before the three-fold murder and is assumed that it was the serial killer's work.
Investigators found cartridges and secured a bullet from the seat as well as bullet fragments from the engine room.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephaly: "It's getting better"
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But like the least of his elderly friends, Edmund has microcephaly, the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Picciuto didn't know about during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was, I can't do it.
I can't do this.
I didn't agree to that.
What's wrong at all -- of course, she said, "she said.
Her husband Vincent and her was told that Edmund might never recognize her and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even went so far that they suggested to institutionalize him.
"My first answer to this was' I didn't know that people still do '," said Picciuto.
Edmund can walk with a walk.
Edmund could neither sit nor crawl until his third year of age and still cannot speak.
But he's making progress slowly.
He can walk with support and ride bicycle.
He also loves playing and singing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the drawing language Edmund has figured out for "Please sing something to me".
"We teach him drawing language," said Picciuto CBS News.
But it's not a typical drawing language -- says she. Edmund invented some characters alone.
Microcephaly has a variety of causes: genetic as in Edmund as well as infections with viruses such as measles or the cicavirus during pregnancy.
The symptoms and forecasts may vary greatly.
It is too early to say how it will affect the life of those infected with the Zikavirus.
Picciuto remembers the emotional price of an unknown future.
I kept asking you what's going to happen?
What's going to happen?
And she still doesn't really know.
I haven't asked about the forecast for a long time because I don't expect someone to tell me.
But Picciuto has a hopeful advice for mothers of infants with birth damage caused by the cica virus.
It's getting better.
You know it's gonna be better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rainfall, flooding gives rise to rescue in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rainfall and large-scale floods in Louisiana forced the governor to call the emergency on Friday. More rainfall is expected all Saturday.
Numerous rivers in the southeast of Louisiana and the south of Mississippis flooded their banks and threatened with large-scale floods following extreme rainfall, the National Weather Service reported.
The Governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards informed that government officials are in constant contact with local authorities and that assistance to the communities concerned is already on the way.
Mike Steele, a spokesperson for the Governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, announced that the requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandbags increased.
Steele said that only the municipality of Tangipahoa would have demanded tens of thousands of sandbags.
A flooding warning system will be used over large parts in the south of Louisiana until Saturday.
The weather service made it reasonable that in this area additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall.
In the south of Alabamas a flooding early warning system was used on Friday, while it continued to rain in the area of Mobile.
The River Comite near Baton Rouges and the River Amite near Denham Springs, both located in Louisiana, will probably reach record levels over the weekend.
Metereologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the suburbs near Baton Rouge.
He also said that a downstream flooding in Ascension Parish is a danger, as it will flow slowly into Lake Maurepas over the rivers.
The Tickfaw river, south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level ever recorded on Friday at 9: 00 a.m.
Rescue teams still popped people from the flood water in the districts of Amite and Wilkinson in the southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and his stepson were among those who were saved on Friday near Gloster.
Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house, increased sharply over the night.
He said that another stepson who lives nearby had warned him.
"We woke up and the water flowed and flowed in," said Hansford.
It reached my waist.
His wife told Hansford that in the 48 years she lived there, she had never seen such a high level of the river.
Hansford said that he and his family members had all the disabilities and he was the only one who could swim.
Hansford said that Nothelfer had saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire guard in Gloster, where they were housed by Friday.
Krautmann said that flooding had "spread quickly," as there were still severe rainfall and that the authorities are considering evacuation instructions.
According to Krautmann, an observer near Livingstone reported from midnight to Friday morning from 13.75 inch rain.
Krautmann said that the ground has been substantially accomplished by the rain falls since Wednesday.
The authorities indicated that severe rainfall and road floods caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and educational failure in five school districts.
The CBS subsidiary WWL reported that an assistant in Tangipahoa reported 200 flooded houses.
The inhabitants were evacuated into two churches that were now flooded.
The head of the municipality Robby Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets that were washed by the flood.
In the cities of Amite and Hammond, emergency accommodation was set up to accommodate the evacuated.
"As soon as the water begins to go back, they will be able to go back to their houses," he said.
In the town of Hammond of the municipality of Tangipahoa almost two dozen roads were closed due to the flood and sandbags were provided for the residents who hope to keep the water from their houses and shops.
"The last major flooding we had was in March," said Lacy Landrum of the city administration.
This seems to be a similar incident.
In Mississipp, the emergency manager Rupert Lacy of Harrison County said it was still raining on the Gulf Coast.
According to his information, a handful of houses were reported to be flooded on Thursday, but on Friday no one has been reported so far.
Keith Townson, manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before," said Townson, "and it's still coming."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "passed by bullets," survived shooting in Philadelphia
The police tell us that the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia this week already the second time that a 6-year-old child was shot.
The grandparents of the boy identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
The grandparents indicated that Brown suffered several gunshot injuries, including in the lend, leg, arm and abdomen, but that he was conscious during his transport to the hospital.
"He's been through a lot, his little body was blown out of bullets," his grandmother Delores Melendez informed the transmitter.
I just can't believe it.
The condition of the boy was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations.
The boy's family informed the station that it is expected to recover.
He should have started the first class in a local primary school.
Brown was one of four people who were shot in Germantown.
Three men were also shot: two at the age of 29 and a 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition; the other two victims are in stable condition according to CBS Philadelphia.
The boy was found shot in the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old who is in a critical state, the station reports.
The other two victims were not in the car and the police are just investigating whether they could be among one of the injured men of the perpetrators.
Investigators informed CBS Philadelphia that there was apparently a cross fire between several shooters.
Cartridges for storm guns that were tracked back to various storm guns oversaw the crime scene.
It seems that this was clearly a continuing struggle.
On the street, on both sides of the road, there were wells.
So there seem to have been several armed fighters who were very actively involved here, "police chief Anthony Ginaldi informed the police in Philadelphia the transmitter.
Several houses and vehicles were also hit in the area.
There were no arrests and the police are currently checking the surveillance video.
On Tuesday, another six-year-old girl was hit by a cross-defeat on her arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of the West Oak Lane.
She's recovering and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That's what I'm imagining under the women's Olympics in the tower for more than one reason.
First of all, I have been with every summer Olympiade since 1984 and the United States has never been so dominant.
And secondly, this team has three tournaments, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, which have inspired many young girls of other skin colors.
The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jewish, and Madison Kocian, the Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team finally reflects the United States.
It has consolidated the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.
In the last four years, the number one under the female tournament was a African American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were # 1 and # 2.
That shows strength.
At the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America cheered.
Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three-fold world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez as she delivered unexpected but masterful gymastic routines.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth heterosexual American who won gold at an individual multi-fighter event for women.
Aly Raisman won silver.
We're experiencing the top of this sport, but that's not how tournament classes all over the country look.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same path as Aly and Madison to get it into the Olympic team.
They are the "Last Five," because the next Olympic team will only have four tournaments in the team. Moreover, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer.
But the reality is that towers are a expensive sport and Turner is primarily present in private tournament clubs maintained by parents who are responsible for the training, installation, travel, competition and hotel costs (for trainers and their tournaments and families). The list can be continued wherever possible.
The majority of these tournament clubs are located in prosperous suburbs that can support the business.
In these clubs the Turners receive their entire training and this is a expensive and long-term commitment to families.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since they started the tournament.
We must allow the communities of countless young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie to have a more viable and easily accessible tournament training.
I founded my 20-year-old tournament.
At my events we offered free and affordable tours in Harlem for over 15,000 urban young people (especially black and hispanic) and trained national and international winners.
In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer high-quality tours to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Turns develop strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the spirit.
This combination offers life-long benefits for health and for school and professional success.
It's the inspiration of this team that makes thousands of young girls interested in the tournament and that's great.
It's so important to participate in sport, especially for girls.
This is such an exciting time.
Thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" by holding the Olympic team gold and thanks, you get so many young girls with different backgrounds motivated to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
Assistant doctors want to organize further strikes after they have rejected Jeremy Hunt's proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute about the changes by adopting a reformed contract with the British Medical Association officials, but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistant doctors who voted on a election rejected him.
In July, Hunt had revealed plans to introduce the contract by force and said that the NHS found itself in a "no-man country" and any further delay would be harmful for employees and patients.
The first assistant doctors are to receive a new contract containing changes to night and weekend work to improve the care at inhospitable hours.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, the chairman of the BMA Committee for Assistant Doctors, announced last night in a communication: "Assistant doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will heat up the current labour crisis and allow it to treat all doctors fairly."
If only eight weeks remain until the first group of doctors falls under the new Treaty, progress must be made and time expires.
The efforts of the BMA to resolve disputes by means of conversations arose with the government on the hostility to take part and sometimes to silence the ears.
This happened to a promise that Jeremy Hunt had only made last month that his door would always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt has to act now, lift the constraint and address the concerns of the assistant doctors."
If he does not, the assistant physicians have made it clear that they are prepared to carry out further work struggles.
The last strike at the end of April foreseen a postponement of almost 13.000 routine operations and 100,000 dates, since nurses and specialists were involved to cover doctors on the stakeholder chain.
The Ministers had hoped to end the dispute about the changes by adopting the reformed contract with the British Medical Association's officials.
The BMA wants a better weekly wage for the 54,000 assistant doctors who will be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, Director General of the NHS staff, asked the assistant doctors to end the strike.
Mortimer said: "Work struggles do not achieve anything of just little, but burden already overloaded teams and service providers and prepare patients, nurses and their families only concern, distress and interruption."
In the last two months, we have spoken to the Committee of Assistant Doctors and responded positively with the Ministry of Health as well as other ministries to the concerns regarding the premise and the whistleblowing.
Employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from a professional time period, training courses, mutual recognition of the curriculum, training leave and gender pay differences in medicine - were a sign of the seriousness of employers, health education England and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.
The £2-per-day drug that can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £2-per-day drug, after the authorities recommended to administer this more people for a longer period of time.
The anticoagulant medicine Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease.
The medicine has been administered for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or another heart attack.
The NICE Regulatory Authority of the NHS recommended a four-year dose to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
The NICE Regulatory Authority of the NHS recommended a four-year dose to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
About 140,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer another heart attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by collections of fatty material in the artery walls that form coatings.
If the coating breaks apart, it can cause a blood clotting that stops the blood flow to the heart and causes a heart attack.
If the blood clotting is resolved, it can flow through the blood stream and constipate the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
Persons who have already had a heart attack are at a higher risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, which is produced by the British company AstraZeneca and distributed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots unlikely.
The draft instructions of NICE, published today, recommend a 12-month dose of 90mg Ticagrelor followed by 60mg with a twice daily dose of aspirin for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, Director of the NICE Health Technology Evaluation Centre said: "Despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have a further heart attack or a stroke - often with disastrous consequences."
The fear of a renewed heart attack may have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person.
Experience shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
With a provisional recommendation from Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.
Information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years. The draft instructions do not recommend treatment that goes beyond this period.
Culture of Political Correctness makes election fraud blossom in Muslim areas
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from the office last year on the occasion of a government report on corruption
A culture of political correctness has led to widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities being ignored knowingly as a devastating government report today.
The former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally attacks the police, electoral observers and town houses to have ignored evidence of electoral abuse due to "ethnic and religious hypersensitivity."
The former Minister for Integration and Local Government, which is now an anti-corruption clever, said that the intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up bands outside electoral cabins to protect disadvantaged voters.
It recommends that voters carry an ID to prove their identity in elections.
At present, a voter only has to mention his name and address.
The report proposes to put unremovable ink on the finger of a person when they vote in order to prevent someone from choosing twice.
Whistleblower should be given more protection, says Sir Eric.
He called for the press to have more access to municipal documents and decisions of non-official committees or working groups.
"This serves not only against electoral fraud, but also to protect the municipal government from the broader corruption and financial fraudulent culture associated with this," he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of Tower Hamlet's electoral scandal in East London.
Last year, a special electoral court decided that the acting mayor Lutfur Rahman should be dismissed after a litania of corrupt and illegal practices of his office.
The court found that Rahman had "perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community in a cynical way" and that he had brought his critics to silence with racism and Islamophobia accusations.
Rahman should have "led his campaign on the basis that it was the relievable duty of Muslims to choose him."
Up to 300 votes were either questionable or the result of an imitation in which one person chooses as someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud throughout the country.
He was particularly alarming about the fraudulent election of letters - the elderly members of the Muslim community would have put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice.
Sir Eric, illustrated, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including the driving of I.D. to prove the identity
In his report, it says: "As proof that pressure has been exercised on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, in particular women and young people, in order to choose according to the will of the elderly, in particular communities with Pakistani or Bangladesian background.
"There were concerns that... government institutions had knowingly ignored such a behavior due to" politically correct "hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to cleanse the system, including the prohibition of political activists working on letters to stop "electoral harvests."
The report, considered by Theresa May, also calls for more rigorous registration reviews in order to avoid the use of the electoral register for immigration and social fraud purposes.
Consider options to ask voters for your ID before choosing.
Use unremovable ink on the finger of a person once she has given her voice to prevent someone from choosing twice.
carry out systematic checks on the nationality of a person in order to ensure that they are optional.
A three-year limitation on requests for an automatic choice of letters.
Prohibition of political activists to process complete letter elections and envelopes of letter elections.
The police have the power to set up blocks for electoral stations.
A law change facilitating a prosecution for intimidation in accordance with the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Prohibition of photographer in electoral stations.
Requirement that only English should be used in the electoral stations (except Wales).
Intensification of training to ensure that employees enforce the rule that voters go to the electoral cabin alone.
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "astonishing" that after the Tower Hamlet case no criminal charges were made.
"The electoral court has declared Lutfur Rahman and his deputy inappropriate because of a litania of corrupt and illegal practices," he said.
He was known to be sufficiently guilty for a number of reasons, in accordance with the high standards in criminal proceedings.
He also criticizes the ineffective "abhack controls" of the electoral registration departments of the town houses.
Sir Eric said, "Last year's judgment in Tower Hamlets was a warning signal.
Our country, as the mother of the parliaments, has a proud heritage, but the worrying and concealed spread of electoral fraud and the denial of some authorities threatens this good reputation.
Crazy after Kates Radler double walker and other famous double walkers of Olympic athletes in Rio
This week, fans of the Olympics 2016 in Rio have been advised about the French cycling athlete Pauline Ferrand-Prevot except for the edge and band, which has proved to be an impressive double-walker of the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympic Ionicin is far from the only athlete who fights gold, who has its own famous double-walker - at least not if you are allowed to give faith to the social media.
In honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that are currently flipping on our screens, FEMAIL has created a list of Olympic ionics that have more than just a certain similarity with Hollywoodcelebrities.
The hunter and the wolf: Team member of the US team in the archery Brady Ellison, left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since his childhood
Except for Kates double-walker on the bike track, many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain archery of the twin of A-Promi Leonardo DiCaprio could be.
The team member of the U.S. team in the arc shooting Brady Ellison caused a storm on Twitter, after images on which he looks terribly similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star emerged.
In fact, the archer got the madness in the social media and admitted that he has been getting to hear that he looks like Leo since his childhood.
"I myself see no great similarity, except the facial haircut," Brady informed the Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I guess I'll take this as a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly focus even more on this year: the remarkable similarity between the British Broadjumper Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian tournament Aliya Mustafina with her big, expressive eyes should be able to go through as a double-walker for Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the swimming pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared for years with Glee Star Matthew Morrison.
A course higher: This user believes that Nathan is the "athletic version" of the Inception Actor
Another persistent comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who has similar heavy eyebrows and lips.
The Russian silver medal swimmer Yulia Efimova has more than only the sun-brown skin and blonde hair as the actress Annalynne McCord, while the American Nathan Adrian was attacked by fans to match a "athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt."
Strong Women: Football star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have a similar facial form and eyes
Not the only one: A Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the similarities
Theory placed in the room: According to this user there may be a reason for the similarity of the couple
A Twitter user explained her satisfaction that "the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are almost identical."
In fact, the US football star Hope Solo and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar facial form and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney and the gold medal winner in the tournament Gabby Douglas, which has its own beautiful, wide smile similar to that of Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union.
CBC commentator for the Olympic Games apologizes for his statement that Chinese swimmer "died like a pig"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of the fourth place of the 14-year-old Ai Yanhan at Dr. 4x200m Freistilswimmstaffel upset spectators of the CBC live transmission of the Olmypic Games on Wednesday
The Canadian transmitter CBC had to apologize after one of his commentators said that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "went off like a mug" and during the race as "a pig died."
The commentator Byron MacDonalds thought that his microphone was turned off when he gave his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m flood season.
MacDonald, who had been taken on board to give more "color," said: "This little 14-year-old Chinese has lost its connection, baby."
Too excited, went off like a pig, died like a pig.
Thanks for that.
The Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swammed the second stage of the swimming season 1: 57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, allowing Canadians to unlock the gap to China.
Citizens across Canada responded quickly online after they were shocked by the tone and language
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Did the CBC commentator just say that the 14-year-old swimmer from China" died like a pig??????
The idiot didn't understand they were still on show. "
Ai Yanhan from China was described at the final 4 x 200m free floating season for women as follows: "This small 14-year-old Chinese has lost connection, baby."
The criticism of Byron MacDonald on Twitter came fast and hard, in which many spoke to him
Twitter User didn't hold back when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user Sarah Paradis wrote: "Wow, # ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and make us all look like racist. # disgusted.
Shortly later, Scott Russel, who moderated the CBC broadcast, apologized live for MacDonald's comment and said, "We apologize that the comment was broadcast about a swimming power."
It was an unfortunate wording, we're sorry it happened. "
CBC finally apologized for over 90 times with the people who responded to the Twitter note
The comment colleague Scott Russel had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald
CBC copied and added his apology to more than 90 other Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald's comments
The network also apologized quickly and issued a communication.
We sincerely regret that these statements have been made and that they have been broadcast.
We apologized to our viewers for broadcasting and our followers in the social media last night.
To clarify one thing, Byron's comments related to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person.
However, they were inappropriate and an unfortunate wording. Byron is very sorry what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized in the show and tried to justify his comment by saying that it was not his intention that it would be interpreted as a personal attack.
"I would like to take a moment to apologize for the comment that I made after the women's swimming season in the CBC Olympics show, he said.
"I referred to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person."
Of course, there was no intention of neglect and I am very sorry. "
Buyer in Primark is upset about woman who tastes shameless underwear in the middle of the business
The buyers didn't know where to look when a woman took her clothes off in the middle of a primark to try underpants.
In order to aggravate the situation, she patented the way she looked in it, pulled her out and put her back in the shelf.
She continued shooting and tried four pairs of underpants in a business at the Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestone.
The Primark business at the Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestone, where the woman tried the underpants before she put her back in the shelf
A mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was at the same time in business, said that after the mysterious woman had tried the underwear, "she went back and left the business without buying anything."
She said, "People could not believe what they saw."
In the middle of the sales surface she took a pair of underpants from the outfit, pulled out her own pants and pants and tried them.
"She didn't even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she was just standing there, freaky like Oskar."
"Everyone stared when she withdrew the underpants that she obviously didn't like when she put them back in the shelf."
She repeated the same thing with three more underpants before she finally decided that she didn't like to turn back on and go out.
"She didn't seem to disturb the fact that she was watching - or thinking about the person who might possibly buy the underpants she had tried."
Ms. Davidson, 33 who lives in Kent, said, "How disgusting to think that someone would take underpants home that had another person on and who were not washed."
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Mrs Davidson added: "As I noticed, the employees tried to pull the garments out of the sale after she went - which is as good as that."
"I would hate to go home with a new couple of underpants and find out that another woman had her on and moved out again and she wasn't washed."
A speaker from Primark said, "Primark is aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday 9 August in our Folkstone branch."
All the products in question were withdrawn from the sale.
How to protect yourself from weapons attacks with Krav Maga
The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video of Dailymail.com could make it a little safer for you.
We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close distance.
Regardless of whether to approach you from the front or from the back, this video will show you how you turn the spit for your robber.
When approaching you from the back, you should turn around first, so you can see your attacker and "get out of the gunline," says Mizrachi.
Then grab the gun between your front arm and your shoulder before you hit him with your free elbow in the face.
Then hit him with the knee in the bar and turn, while the attacker collapses from pain, the gun out of his hands. Hit him with the run into his face and move back while they aim the gun on him.
In attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the gunline, take the gun and turn it off so that the attacker can't shoot.
At the same time, place the weight on the weapon and hit the attacker on the chest, then turn the gun out of his handle before they move back and aim the weapon on him.
Sounds hard?
Look at the video to see exactly how Mizrachi pretends.
But remember, a robbery is safest to hand over your money unless you're a Krav Maga Grand Master.
Traveler Ian Wright shabs his tongue for a tour guide at the most dirty places in Europe
A British traveller underwent a serious examination of his immune system and spikes - by rejecting some of the most dirty and disgusting places in Europe.
The moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk, put his train on a euro ticket, a runner at Piccadilly Circus, a washing button of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to demonstrate the resistance of his immune system.
Before draining each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he's going to let into.
But the experiment, filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results to the daylight.
The idea of licking the rinse button of a tow toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely disruptive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen rinse.
During his journey through Europe, Mr Wright spoke to doctors and medical specialists about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing left in his mouth that he turned off left more than a bad aftertaste.
Mr Wright became known to test the resistance of his intestine by traveling through the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
From public terrain to railway stations to washing buttons of toilets, the task definitely placed its immune system under a sample
In the film he said, "As a child, I was already relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all kinds of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water."
In the film, he was definitely entitled to his reputation.
The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
His sample drain showed a luminometer number of more than 4000 units.
In comparison, the luminometer number of fresh washed hands is less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to leak after their luminometer number was over 4000 units, while fresh washed hands have one of less than 60
Mr Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of milk products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom
In the movie, he says, "That's close to the worst thing I smelled in a toilet."
There's nothing more dirty than that!
I'm not gonna look at anything here because it's disgusting in here.
The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of milk products Valio.
The company provides Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.
Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.
We carried out crazy brainstormings that ended up saying, "Let's call Ian."
They claim that interest in intestinal health will become a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary film we were able to provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who was the director of the film, added: "Let me say this - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked some of the things I instructed him to lick, like the disgusting Russian toilet that is shown in the film."
Of course, there were things where it was easier to make Ian lick it and others where this was quite difficult.
I'm glad we recorded some of these dirty delicious things on film. "
In a 2015 survey conducted by Valio, 84 percent of all respondents associated with lactic acid bacteria, especially with the well-being of stomach and intestine, and 58 percent said that they at least occasionally use products containing added lactic acid bacteria.
Asocial family destroyed before delocation social apartment in Saltash, Cornwall
An asocial family left her social apartment after a delocation with a damage of £50,000 because she had terror her neighbours.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her estate in Saltash, Cornwall.
After being violently removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing cooperative found the property in an irreparable condition.
The walls were hollow holes, wooden parts were torn up, garbage was scattered on the floor and graffiti was forged to the walls.
The family has been relocated and it is assumed that she now lives in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, who works for the house administration at Cornwall Housing, said that she fears that the apartment should no longer be repaired.
She said, "It was an absolute nightmare for people here and I believe that people don't have to live this way.
There are many things to take into account, as this property is likely to be regarded as not such a beautiful part of Cornwalls.
The family is notorious and its reputation is also.
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had added included street fights with baseball hunters, intimidating residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screaming, arguing and cursing.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease contract, received an order for anti-social behaviour in June.
In some rooms of the house, which may be torn off, old trash was found
In the property where drugs were traded in the past, the wooden parts were torn up
Neighbors said that they saw them fighting on the street and had to be called the police regularly
Cornwall Housing relocated her and her partner violently from the property this week, after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to withdraw voluntarily.
The devotion was applauded by relieved neighbours who said that their lives were made hell.
One said, "You didn't care about anyone."
We lived next to them for 20 years and it was always bad.
The countless times we tell the police here are incredible.
"We couldn't sleep this morning."
We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to it!
Now that they're finally gone, it's gonna be nice.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that it had failed the family to cooperate with the local authorities.
The family lived in the house to which the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years
On the overgrown side of the community house, garbage and old toys were thrown down
He added: "It is a shame that the tenant has failed to accept any responsibility for her behavior and that of her family, as a delocation is always the last step to consider Cornwall Housing.
This was a very difficult case, as the behaviour was extreme and their actions had to be horrible for their neighbours.
I appreciate all the work my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, as well as members of the community who have been brave to us and have provided us with the information.
I hope that this development will give some neighbours consolation and give the message that anti-social behaviour is not tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20.
A dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the bedroom of the house after the delocation
Workers of the house administration will now have to remove garbage mountains surrounding the house
In 2014, the police carried out a razzia in the house and found over 70g cannabis as well as waves, paraphernals and cash worth £1,700.
Skeldon received a fine after she had known to be guilty of the possession of a class B drug in commercial terms.
She claimed that the money for a tombstone of her son Lee Skeldon was killed in a car accident in 2013.
After they were without a home, it is assumed that Tanya and her partner now live in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many room walls of the house were covered with graffiti.
The police say she's going to trick tenants who don't comply with the rules of the house.
Angela Crow from the Devon and Cornwall police told us that the delocation is a clear warning to the other tenants who do not comply with the house order.
"This goes to those who think that they can behave without self-accusation and to those who were damaged by such a behavior," she said.
The Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour, which will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal panicked after a tiffy military jet flights over the beach
Sunbeds in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
A Portuguese P-3C Orion aircraft of the air fighting forces set an incredible crash flight
The Air Force indicated that it was on a training flight but insisted that there was no safety risk
This was the moment when frightened tourists began to panic, after a deep jet crashed over a full beach.
Dramatic video footage showed how the military plane flew almost in tangible vicinity over the sun beasts on the beach in Aveiro in the north of Portugal.
The holidaymakers jump up when they were understandably starting to worry about the noise of the dye engines, without first seeing what happened to them through the clouds.
The incident occurred last afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many vacationers who posted videos about the dramatic flyby in the social media, said, "It flew twice really very deep and there was a moment when it looked like it was crashing."
Nuno Arroja added, "I was just surfing and it felt like the plane was falling down on me."
Tourists on the beach of Aveiro were panicked when the plane came out of darkness and flew incredibly deep
The Portuguese Air Force today stated that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and had to fly so deep that this was the only way to recognise them.
The spokesman said that due to the bad sight of the jet, land fires in the vicinity flew a little deeper than usual, but the air forces insisted that safety was not at any time endangered.
This summer, land fires destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland, where four people were killed on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force today stated that the pilot had to fly so deep because of the conditions - strong fog and fire smoke - which restricted his view
The plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise
Supercup: Barca with concerns about Seville
Sevilla - FC Barcelona is fighting on Sunday for the first step towards the first title win in the new football season.
The catalans are in the duel around the Spanish supercup outside against the FC Sevilla, the replay rises three days later in Camp Nou.
The Double winner must refrain from Neymar, in the power race with the subtle Cupfinalist and ruler Euro League champion, who strives with Brazil for the Olympic football tournament.
In addition, Goalie Marc-Andre is also missing Stegen.
The German suffered a change in the knee during training, which at least clarifies the request for entry at Barca for the first time in favour of Claudio Bravo.
The Chilean International and Ter Stegen have been competing in Barcelona for two years about the status as number one.
Coach Luis Enrique has so far refused to make a clear decision and left Bravo in the league, but Ter Stegen in most of the other candidates.
Before the first mandatory game of the new season, there are doubts at the Spanish Master about the fitness state of the team, which was humiliated on Saturday in a test game by Liverpool with 0: 4.
Even at 3: 2 in the Probegalopp against Sampdoria on Wednesday, Lionel Messi and Co did not really convince.
Sevilla again has to digest the 2: 3 defeat after extension in the European Supercup against Real Madrid and strives for the second triumph at the "Supercopa de Espana."
Barcelona is with 11 successes of the record winners in this application.
Ma Long in a separate league to table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis player.
On Thursday, the 27-year-old in Rio de Janeiro defeated his landman and "title defender" Zhang Jike 4: 0 (12.5.4.4) in a one-sided final.
The first world rankings brought the Golden Grand Slam with successes at the World Cup, World Tour Final Tournament and Olympia.
Bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mizutani.
The two Chinese made it to the final game as expected and made the title one another.
It was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would get the single title in the sign of the five rings.
The last non-Chinese on the top Olympia staircase was the former SVS-NÖ legionary Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Ma and Zhang were left on the plate alone, between the sentences and at time-outs they had no coaches with them.
They had withdrawn to the tribe and released their protectors on their own in a fair competition.
"The matches up here I played for my country."
"In the final I play for myself," Zhang had rightly said.
After the party, gold and silver medal winners posed with the China flag.
The match itself was unexpected unilateral.
Ma had only really to fight with his 28-year-old opponent in the first sentence.
After that, he determined the speed on the plate and left Zhang only 13 points there.
Through the superiority of Ma, the expected matching match did not develop.
However, there was enough breathtaking ball change to be seen.
Mizutani won the game to bronze against the 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonow 4: 1.
In his quarterfinals, the White Russians had suffered a rib injury against the German European Master Dimitrij Ovtcharov, followed by medical treatment, and had to "eventually" plead.
By the way, Sweden Jan-Ove Waldner (38 / 2004) and Jörgen Persson (42 / 2008) had become in similar high table tennis age Olympia fourth.
Donald Trump clears up "huge problems" in the campaign
The leadership of the US Republicans is plagued by massive concern to repay their majority in traditional conservative states.
President Donald Trump now admitted weaknesses in his campaign in the former Republican High Court Utah.
A rare moment in which the multimillionaire who usually appeared with great and self-confidence expressed some concerns as correspondents reported.
After throwing 16 rivals out of the race within his own republican camp, the doubt about his success in the struggle for the White House is growing.
"We have huge problems in Utah," Trump said to evangelical Christians who he asked for support in important states such as Ohio, Florida or Virginia.
It was wrong to report his candidature, and he resumed his famous media records.
Wrapping Republican highcasts
Utah is usually a safe bank for the Republicans.
According to a survey by SurveyUSA in June, Trump and his competitor, Hillary Clinton, were the same.
Other institutions see Trump at the forefront, but not at the distance that is common for Republican candidates in the state.
Arizona and Georgia are also considered at risk.
In an interview by CNBC, Trump replied to the question of how he wanted to stop Clinton's premarch again: "Just as I have done so far."
And afterwards, this will be "either successful, or I will make a very nice, long vacation."
He does nothing but "telling the truth."
If it is not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, that is all right, Trump continued.
Then I return to a very good way of life.
According to press reports, Trump's party is supposed to have threatened to delete funds to support his campaign, he should not be able to present better surveys.
Instead, the Republicans' candidates for the Congress would be more intense.
Olympia: Dreister fraud in doping test
The IOC intends to set up a disciplinary committee on the case.
After the second doping affair at the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games, Kenya's body members are threatened.
After a fraud attempt at a doping control in the Olympic village, Kenya sent a coach home.
The International Olympic Committee informed us to set up a Disciplinary Commission immediately to examine the case.
A Kenyan official had announced that the former Sprinter and today Coach John Anzrah, in the Olympic village, had given a urine sample under the name of the 800-meter runner Ferguson Rotich.
This was reported by the Doping controllers to the team management of Kenya.
The IAAF has asked the IOC for information on the case in order to initiate its own investigations, a IAAF spokesman informed.
"Depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent measures of the IOC, the IAAF will carry out an evaluation," was said in an IAAF declaration.
"He (Anzrah) went to the Doping Control Station and spent himself as Ferguson Rotich, leaving and signing the sample," said Kenya's chief of mission Stephan Arap Soi.
He was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete who was on the list for the training controls of the World Anti-Doping Agency.
Ferguson Rotich had become more than 800 metres in Beijing in 2015.
Four days ago, the Kenyan Head of Delegation for Body Tletics, Michael Rotich, had been withdrawn from the Rio Games.
He should have informed athletes of ongoing doping tests against money payments in his country.
According to media reports, he was supposed to have been arrested when he returned to Nairobi Airport.
Kenya has been under special observation in the IOC for a long time after numerous doping crimes.
In the announcement of the more than 2000 Doping target controls imposed by the IOC before the Rio Games, unusually earlier, it was pointed out that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia are being seen.
The World Anti-Doping Agency had exerted a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti-Doping law and a functioning control system.
The law was adopted a few weeks before the start of Olympia.
As a result, WADA took Kenya from the list of countries whose doping is in line with the rules of the WADA.
Kenya is considered a great runner nation.
At the 2015 World Championship in Beijing, the country's corpses won most medals.
A number of ARD's television reports repeated accusations that there is easy access to doping in Kenya and that there should be a significant mentality of sport fraud.
IOC member Richard Pound last asked for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had hired them in Russian body lethology.
It has been demonstrated that this sport has been extensively and systematically dipped.
Russian body members were then excluded from the summer games.
Salzburger "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli
In the Shakespeare year, the Salzburg Festival presents the "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as a tragic love pair, similar to Romeo and Julia.
With a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.
A musical conquers Salzburg: the West Side Story, Leornard Bernstein's masterpiece.
The artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classics and met with the role of Mary a youth dream.
In the orchestra, the Simón Bolívar orchestra led by the Venetian conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of rhythm," he swarms.
We always say it's very Latin American.
There are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and melody.
It's a wonderful mixture, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I'd say we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!
In this stage Bartoli plays an older Mary.
She remembers her love with Tony while the younger Mary plays and dances.
The role of Mary has always fascinated me.
First of all, because she is musically extraordinary!
And then there would be Mary's personality.
She says it in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright."
So she's smart, of course naive, and very passionate.
"She is very similar to me, my Italian character, which I have as a Roman woman," laughs Bartoli.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."
It's such an honor for us to work with her.
She's a tremendous generous person.
And Bartoli returns the compliment: "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!"
Directing is a necessity for him.
You see it in each of your moves, in his eyes, it's his life!
It is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a happy approach to life, which is at all very important!
For the American director Philip Wm. McKinley, the "West Side Story" is highly up-to-date: "This piece is about prejudices and fanaticism."
Today we have the refugees, then the Puertoricans went to New York, and the New York residents did not want them.
They are the same topics and they are as powerful today as they were at the time.
59 years later, the piece is still relevant.
London schoolgirl who joined the IS was killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join the IS, died in Syria.
The lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said that her family learned a few weeks ago about her death in Raqqa, Syria.
It was suspected that she was killed by a Russian air attack in Raqqa, the bollwerk of the group in the country, reported ITV News on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and died, according to her family's information, shortly after she was planning to leave the war-driven country and return to England.
"One can only hope that the only good is in it - as a warning and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going to a war area - to prevent people from ever making this decision," said Akunjee.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other school girls from East London climbed into a plane towards Turkey and then entered a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family was told that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within a few months.
Reid says Clinton will stay in case of election victory at Garland as a candidate for the Supreme Court
Harry Reid, leader of the Democrats in the Senate, is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, will nominate Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.
The Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garland's confirmation since his nomination by Barack Obama in March.
The majority leader of the Senate Mitch McConnell believes that the next President will appoint the successor of the deceased judge to the Supreme Court of Antonin Scalia.
Reid said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects Clinton to select Garland "with a certain degree of certainty."
A speaker from Reid later said he hadn't talked to Clinton if she'd nominated Garland and he speculated.
He praised Garland and said that Clinton's team would not cause trouble with a new candidate.
Garland is the highest judge of the U.S. court of appeal for the District of Columbia.
Raid said Republicans were blocking Garland's nomination, being lacquers and helpers of the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also noted that Donald Trump was inappropriate for the presidential office.
Treats wants naked calendar for "Women and for Men"
The Treats magazine works with photographer David Bellemere to bring out a 1970s Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of famous naked people, they want to find the next generation of top models for their NU Muses calendar for 2017.
The chief editor of Treats Steve Shaw told us at the beginning of this year that his naked magazine differs from Oldschool Playboys, since "Playboy is for men."
I'm doing this for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar does.
"We must return to the representation of timeless and classic nudity, in which both women and men feel well and are inspired by these images of a female body," said Shaw in a press release on the publication of the calendar.
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit their images online or personally at an open casting call in Los Angeles and New York.
Turkey: Kurdish community expects mass escape
"Those who do not adapt and praise Erdogan sit on packed bags," says the chairman of the Gülen-nah Foundation Dialogue and World, Ercan Karakoyun.
In the short term, the Kurdish municipality Germany expects tens of thousands of guardians who flee from Turkey to Germany.
In the medium term it could even be "a few hundred thousand," the federal chairman Ali Toprak believes.
Due to the hard action of the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the Putschtest, the Kurdish municipality Germany expects a mass escape to Germany.
"In the short term, I count on tens of thousands, in the medium term, with a few hundred thousand protectors from Turkey in Germany, when the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition," says the federal chairman Ali Toprak of the "world" of Friday.
Because the government had already overtaken Kurdish highcasts months ago with criminal factions, 500,000 Kurds within Turkey were on the run.
After the seduced Putsch, secular and opposition ethnic Turks were added.
Many will want to start over in Europe if they continue to be oppressed in Turkey.
"It cannot be that a state that absorbs refugees itself produces refugees in its own country," said Toprak.
The Head of the Association complained about the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish but also in Alevitic cities.
In this way, Erdogan wanted to increase the exit pressure on the remaining Kurds.
"You are the last great minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have been eradicated or displaced in the last hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a CDU member.
The Head of the Association demanded that the federal government "positioned itself as sharp as Austria against Erdogan and its followers."
A "witch hunt" against Erdogan critics is also taking place in Germany.
For the first time in the last few months, I don't feel safe in Germany.
The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad.
More Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and Oppositionals.
The brand marking as a Gülen trailer destroys the professional existence of teachers and other academics.
"He who does not adapt and praises Erdogan sits on packed bags, by the way also the chemalists and seculars," said Ercan Karakoyun, Chairman of the Gülen-Near Foundation Dialogue and Education, the "world."
As the newspaper reports on the numbers of the Federal Ministry of the Interior, the Turks presented the largest group of asylum beneficiaries recognised for political persecution in Germany before the Putsch.
On June 30, this would have been 11.386 people and almost 29 per cent of all recognised as eligible for asylum (39.625).
This survey does not identify those who fled from war, poverty or unprospective.
Asylum entitlement under the Basic Law is exclusively political, that is, from the state side, individually persecuted.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: "Go where it hurts"
Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: The local people will not get anything from the summer election with - and the holiday from North Rhine-Westphalia will not be allowed to choose the country day.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.
In 2021, the Landtag election will not take place again directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schweriner Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.
Because it can't be more stupid than so far: summer holidays, heat and country election - that bits.
The locals who are supposed to be convinced by the electoral fighters are on vacation.
Most of the holidaymakers in the country on the way to Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are not native, so they must not choose the farmday.
Practical problems arise: In the holidays, helpers hanging up the posters, blowing up balloons, distributing flyers and counting votes are just hard to raise.
Until 4 September 2016, the election day and the last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern must once again have a few days past the people.
The hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun.
And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD / CDU coalition, must fear his office.
The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in surveys.
It becomes exciting how strong the new AfD cuts off and what is left at the end of the coalition.
Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 head of government, is doing a almost unnoticeable campaign, one refrains from his big posters.
He travels through the country, distributes roses and talks a little with people, just as his legendary wortkarger predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.
Otherwise, Seelering has got cold feet and blames Chancellor Merkel for the blossom of the AfD.
Their refugee policy, her "We can do this" has accelerated the rise of the legal politicians, which is likely to cost him the beautiful office now.
The CDU with its top candidate, Minister of the Interior Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is when you take the right place of election at the wrong time.
She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to large-scale events; Merkel Bundestag electoral district is located in the North East.
But the target group did not vote, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony there as Mecklenburger and Vorpommern.
"There was probably the majority from other federal states," complained Vincent Kokert, Secretary-General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in the NDR.
But no one from other corners of Germany is sorry to listen to Angela Merkel.
Otherwise, the North-East CDU will largely refrain from the usual election campaigns in market places and in front of shopping centers with parasols and balloons.
That, according to Cockert, only play a "subordinate role."
The Union has also noticed that it is breaking the ground on the country, that it has to make a very effort to find a wire to the people again.
It is like the left, the SPD, the green: barely present in the country's widens.
However, the council of the CDU electoral fighter Kockert to his fellow fighters is also self-evident: "You must go where it hurts, namely where people are: Dorfeste, Golden Weddings, every birthday celebration must be used."
Because much is at stake, Sellering has now called his SPD to a particularly committed campaign.
In surveys, the Social Democrats last stood at 22 percent behind partner CDU (25) and only close to AfD (19).
At the 2011 election, the SPD had won with 35,6 percent before the CDU (22).
The Greens, small party with seven percent in the surveys, are expected to make the leap into the countryside.
They make a modern virtue from the holiday-need and move their campaign to the Internet on a large scale.
"Online Electoral Campaign," called the national president Claudia Müller.
Otherwise, green electoral fighters are looking for local voters among the vacancies.
Silke Gajek, the top candidate, is just curving through the Mexican lakes with a houseboat and still enjoys it.
Your impression: "Voting holidays in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a punishment."
B27-Restoration: Hospitals suffer from blockage
At the speed with which the B 27 is restored, there is nothing to mecker with.
For those responsible for the construction work, who begin at 5.30 in the morning and only end at 8: 00, there is a full praise.
"They've made everything pretty tasty," Elvira Tetzlaff tells us about the jet gas station.
This is a super team.
There is no delay either.
The construction site was able to be moved to the south at the beginning of the week to half-time, and until the end of October everything should be finished.
It is also commendable to meet those responsible for construction, for example when it comes to the establishment of shelters.
Since the construction site has migrated to the south on Monday and the barrier of the Aspergstraße in Oftersaker has also been abolished and thus the connection to Rottenburg is restored, the traffic situation has relaxed within the place.
Citizens can now go back to both sides from the B-27.
The escape traffic through the place seems to go back.
"There were some significant complaints," says the Deputy Head of State, Florian King, responsible for the transport management of the rehabilitation.
The inhabitants of Bachsatzstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because many slopes sought and trusted their Navi rather than the shield.
Which led to some of the trucks being lost in residential areas.
As the speed limits were also not complied with, the municipality called for the measuring vehicle from Mössingen.
"There were significant crossings," says King, who once made himself aware of the situation on the ground.
There's been two to three flashes a minute ago.
The fastest was on the way at 77 hours in the speed-30 zone.
Since the construction site has continued, but it has become quieter.
For businessmen at the B 27 it is only a small consolation that the road is now open for customers from Rottenburg.
You don't like to look in the maps.
But that the B 27 refurbishment has led to sales breaks, let everyone who is asked look through.
However, some are more and some less affected.
Whoever has less to do with the "end customer," that is to say, produces for other companies, the restoration has little consequences for them.
Thomas Sulz also speaks of a "maximum slight decrease," but also recognises that "the knowledge of the careers is missing."
The locals along the street are the strongest.
J. Albert Göhner, owner of the steakhouse, former crown, finds clear words.
This is already a threat to existence.
Not only him, but all the hospitals hit it "hard."
The customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.
We must be happy about every euro's turnover.
The loss of turnover is estimated at "far over 50 percent."
The road restructuring has "thrown its operation back by two years."
Half his employees had to get rid of him.
If I had a company with 4000 employees and half of it had been dismissed, politics would have reacted differently.
Instead, President Jörg Schmidt replied to a question by Göhner, whether there could be a financial compensation, with the indication that otherwise the host will benefit from the benefits of the situation at the B 27. Now it must also bear the disadvantages arising from the rehabilitation.
Göhner knows about other districts where something so generous has been handled.
In all cases, Göhner is sure that his hostel will continue.
Finally, the family business has been located here since 1715, he refers to the long history.
He can understand that other tribal guests are now less frequent due to complicated traffic management.
If you can't drive here, it's beautiful somewhere else.
That his family clients return after the end of the rehabilitation work, Göhner has no doubt about it.
Despite the crises with BSE and avian influenza, Göhner considers the impact of the B 27 construction work on his customers to be the biggest crisis that his host has experienced in its long history.
Six months of construction, that's brutal.
On behalf of the fight against terrorism, the law is constantly being screwed up.
After the recent attacks, Minister of Interior de Maizière is now presenting a thick security package.
But what has a concussion status to do with terror?
And what does the coalition partner say about all this?
Thomas de Maizière gives the reconciliation.
All his proposals were "politically reasonable" to the coalition partner, "says the Federal Minister in presenting his new security package.
They don't exaggerate anyone.
Other further points would first be discussed within the parties.
That's what I'm trying to do.
However, as the Minister of the Interior, he was placed on results and on a "achievable consensus" within the coalition.
After the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, de Maizière has spent a little time before presenting his conclusions on security in the Republic.
But they are all the more extensive in this respect.
Some are already known, proclaimed, specified: that a new security authority should deal with the cracking of encrypted communication is not new.
Nor does the fact that Germany has to implement several EU standards on passenger data and arms law.
The call for more video surveillance and staff for the security authorities is also not surprising.
In part, de Maizière launches a second start for proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD: he wants to punish sympathy for terrorist groups and dictate jihadists with dual citizenship the German passport.
"These will be difficult points for the SPD," the CDU man clears.
He nevertheless believes that this is reasonable and does not demand anything that does not have any chances for the coalition partner.
A few new ideas also present de Maizière.
They have it partly in themselves: He plans rapid procedures for deportations and more ways of imprisonment of people before deportation.
Refugees who are targeted to land should have their smartphones checked in advance and disclose social media accounts for a security review.
In cases of refusal of asylum seekers, he wants to make some worse than so far - such as offences committed or deliberately throwing away their documents to hide their identity.
Some of these are politically and legally delicate.
Some of them also seem unprecedented and leave questions open.
And on some points - for example, in the case of the inequality of tolerated persons - the question arises: what does this actually have to do with security and terror?
Yes, de Maizière says it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terrorism.
But it cannot be construed that the assassins of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
In addition, many people were concerned about security in view of the high number of refugees.
And things that were deeply employed by people could not be hampered out in election times.
Internal security is a huge focus.
First the attacks in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
Insurance is big.
And yes, there are electoral struggles.
The Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly addressing the issue of internal security.
In the past few days, there has been a high level between the two parties.
First a scary dispute about the equipment of the federal police, then about a security policy collection of some EU internal ministers, in which Ressortchefs also demand a Burka ban and a departure from dual citizenship.
The Maizière also cares here about reconciling tones.
He won't hold anything from turning away from the double pass.
We have satisfied the discussion in Germany.
Open it again, don't make any sense.
And with a Burka ban, he has constitutional concerns.
Whether his own package is constitutional at all corners and whether it is actually "reasonable" for the coalition partner, yet to show itself.
There's a lot in it that could cause a fight.
But the SPD is also currently trying to prosper on the issue of internal security.
Parteichef Sigmar Gabriel signals cautious readiness to talk and says: "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security."
Volkswagen's still running through.
Despite diesel scandals, extradition numbers are increasing worldwide.
But not all markets are running around.
There is a wiring about a term in the back-up faction.
Volkswagen starts in the second half of the year when deliveries take place.
Although Europe's largest car fleet can continue to present a plus in the previous year despite the diesel affair thanks to its many brands and some well-running markets.
However, in July the core brand VW weakened mainly in Western Europe and thereby again burdened the total sales as the company listed in Dax reported.
The VW brand sold in July with 449100 cars 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than in the previous month.
In Western Europe alone, after China, the second most important market, sales were 14 per cent below the previous month.
In the home market Germany, deliveries fell by almost a sixth.
Trademark sales manager Jürgen Stackmann returned the weaker figures from July mainly to two sales days less in Europe.
In addition, in some core markets, there had been a retention of purchases through "changing economic conditions."
In addition to the situation surrounding the Putschtest in Turkey, a speaker explained that the British vote had also been burdened to leave the EU.
In the USA, where the exhaust affair first escalated, there is also a minus to book.
Big support for VW is the Chinese market.
Overall, the mainly affected home brand of the Lower Saxony is still further glowing through the diesel scandal: after the first seven months only one delivery minus from 0.9 percent to 3.37 million vehicles is booked.
Group sales manager Fred Kappler was able to continue to present a sales lease from January to July.
1.3 percent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen in this time, around 5.904 million worldwide.
Volkswagen had manipulated exhaust tests with a software.
In Germany alone, VW calls around 2.5 million cars for refurbishment to the workshops.
In the course of the refurbishment, VW confirmed that the reconstruction of cars did not have any negative effects.
After refurbishment of vehicles, there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power.
After refurbishment, the car owner shall issue a "guarantee-like" certificate to the customer but shall not speak of a "guarantee" as it was called on Friday in business circles.
Reasons are legal foolishness.
The "Focus" had reported that Volkswagen has given his German customers a warranty for refurbished diesel models.
This would have been confirmed last Monday by VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport.
The Ministry of Transport confirmed that there was this meeting.
"VW must fully fulfil the requirements of my investigation commission and the KBA."
"Derogations are not accepted," said Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) according to the Ministry.
VW has assumed the guarantee that fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance after refurbishment will not deteriorate and that all type-approval relevant vehicle values remain unchanged.
Volkswagen itself does not use the term "guarantee" as it was called in business circles.
In the broad term "guarantee" Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers, for example, come to a workshop six months after the refurbishment with a motor damage - and this could lead back to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
In the interests of customers, it is also important to avoid any other damage that has nothing to do with the exhaust scandal from the point of view of possible guarantee schemes, as it was said.
Therefore, VW does not use the term "guarantee."
The Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee requires rich savings in the future - as the second institute in Germany.
Banking manager Josef Paul said on Thursday, "It's only about 139 customers parking 40 million euros on Giro or Daily Money Accounts."
The Bundesverband Deutscher Banken speaks of a single case and does not see in it any signal: Normal sparers should "not be afraid to pay for their savings penalty rate."
If banks store money at the European Central Bank (ECB) at night, they have to pay their 0.4 percent penalty rate.
This fee will be recovered from the Raiffeisenbank Gmund from September from private and corporate customers for deposits of more than 100,000 euros on current or daily cash accounts.
"The first 100,000 euros are free."
"The next 100,000 will cost 400 euros a year," said Paul.
He has been saving 40 million euros for some time, which could be raised from one day to another and which he could not benefit from.
"These are on my central bank account and cause 0.4 percent of costs," said the bank manager.
"I can't put $4000 for every million."
He now forwards the costs according to the polluter payer principle.
The cash simply to leave in the vendors of the Raiffeisenbank would be far too dangerous: "I've already experienced four robberies, I don't want the fifth!" said the banking board.
Most customers had understanding and switched to other forms of investment.
Only a few walked to other banks.
The Bayern cooperative association said: "The ECB's extreme monetary policy rate is causing considerable costs for all banks."
It is not possible to carry it on its own on a permanent basis.
Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management, credit cards or transfers.
With penalty interest on deposits from three million euros, the Thüringer Volks- und Raiffeisenbank Altenburg Land had made headlines with its Skatbank branch in 2014.
Michael Kemmer, head of the Banking Association, said: "We do not expect private customers to have to pay flat-rate deposits, so competition in Germany among banks and savings banks is far too strong."
A banker said that at Tegernsee there is "a client that is somewhat more equipped by the fortune."
"This can become a problem for a small bank," if it protects money for free.
The Gmund cooperative bank, founded in 1911, has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.
In the region are known actors, athletes and entrepreneurs.
Bavaria's cooperative association "is currently not known for any other banks that calculate a deposit rate for private customers' deposits," said spokesman Ernst.
The President of the Federal Federation of German Volksbanken and Raiffeisenbanken (BVR), Uwe Fröhlich, had said at the end of June: "The threshold to go into the negative towards the private customer is very, very high."
Competition is hard, and it threatens the emigration of investors to competition.
Customers in Germany will not like this in the width.
Destination plates: who actually buys sound plates?
Lonely men of middle age love plates.
Before you hurry to the comment part to overlook him under the Pseudonym Non-Single Men Medieval with rough insults, this statement is derived from current data.
According to YouGov, the well-discussed restoration of sound plates is not due to a boom in Millennials that wants to welcome the novelty of physical objects, but to midlife nostalgia.
Those who recently bought a record are expected to be between 45 and 54 years old.
In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely buyer group.
It is also not a horde by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers keep their feelings more for themselves (56% vs 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs 66%).
But are the results of YouGov right?
If this blog was a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wear a modest grey suit and steal wild before I stand, hold my hands and say something definite like, "So, let's take a closer look at it."
So, let's take a look at it.
Even though the heart Sohos slowly burdens its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where independent sellers were established - there is still a handful of fantastic record specialist shops.
I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part, where I am in direct proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observing.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, which I follow from Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three men of middle age) to Reckless Records (data number: eight men of middle age, a woman, probably around 20) is a day for a meeting in London and goes through the business to fill the few hours.
Is he a collector, I ask?
"I guess," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.
These sound plates, shown above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I didn't follow him home), dress off the walls of his living room.
The reason why he has such a significant number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy plates he couldn't afford when they appeared and again buy items he sold when he was young and broke.
"Many things I buy are from the late '60s, early' 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12. Things where I was probably a little too young to buy them to me," he says.
He agrees that those who buy plates are more introverted and like to spend time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink much.
That's my truck.
Wez, 25 who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets are true to the YouGov profile.
However, he also noticed a new wave of people that are influenced by the media hut, people who have heard about the comeback and have made themselves get back to buying their old plates.
Of the conversations that I have conducted, people usually got rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their disks to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their disks again, "he says.
That would explain the boom to followers of the record revival of a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates?
It only takes a few seconds in a business like Phonica to realize that record business offers a reassuring community of aliens.
According to Wez, some of the older customers started the contact-free payment system.
Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of trusted record shells, from objects that wake up happy young people's memories.
"I think sometimes it can be the filling of an empty or the possession of material property as a kind of comfort," Wez says.
That's what I do as a collector, and I think it's a lot of people.
It's a simple way to work mentally.
"We are like their social workers!" a staff flushes out of a record pile.
An ICM survey in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record do not have a record player.
At this time of the news report I would probably look very worried while I browse through a pile of Bossa Nova complements.
Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (number of data: three men of medium age), has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the Revival.
"Someone just came in here and said," I don't own a record player, but I'd like to buy a radio head record so I can put it in the shelf, "he says.
This is not a big percentage, but it is definitely happening.
More product-resistant, less musical.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
These are younger people, not older people who come in slowly.
Fopp, who devoted almost a whole floor to the sound plates, has a bunter audience than I'm getting in.
There are couples around the 70, tourists who take photos, teenage youth and women of middle age.
Although the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts latest synthesizer and sex-packed pop instead of experimental jazz dreams out of speakers - it is good to see such a diversity among customers.
None of them look strange lonely, but nailing mental trauma are difficult to detect when you stand next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been running around in business for a few minutes and looks at the variety of the plates to be sold.
She's more of a showcase bummer than a big buy-in.
She doesn't deserve much, so collecting plates is not a real option, she says.
It costs a lot.
It is easy to hear music from a computer or in another way, but the beauty of plates is... "she drives off with a beloved sieve.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I seem to pattern the jeans hotpants, I observe a group of young teenage girls who are grouping around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter think about buying a crosley record player.
On the left there is a staircase, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far up that it is impossible to touch them.
It's just "record art."
But given that every attraction for these objects means more money for the industry and some customers could send into the deep sohos for more, there is nothing to complain about.
It is no surprise that a group of people who have more time and money than others is also the one who spends the most for luxury items such as plates.
Even though my research showed that YouGov's results are correct, they do not take into account, at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors who are in reality, record stores and online forums.
These people probably work hard in school or in offices.
They will certainly not spend their Thursday morning with the bumping through the record shops of Berwick Street and the leaves through plates while avoiding the staring view of a horrible, 30-year-old wrong moderator who asks about the shoulders of no pretending men of middle age.
The Greenland shark is the longest living vertebrae - video report
Scientists say that the Greenland shark has the longest lifetime of all vertebrae animals on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who investigates shark, says that the record was with a female who is assumed to be between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long
French court refuses to offer via dismantling of shops in the jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais to descend dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.
During a trial this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the State should be empowered to tear down 72 temporary shops in which persons selling goods within the warehouse, from cigarettes to energy drinks, to offer hairdresser services, or to sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants.
Calais prefecture argued that these places should be ripped down because they would constitute a parallel economy which would not be taxed and which would pose a fire and sanitation risk.
Humanitarian groups informed the court that the shops and restaurants were important, as the free meals offered by the state-supported association and other groups would not offer enough food for the growing numbers in the warehouse.
They also stated that the temporary shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.
A court in Lille decided that there was no legal basis for identifying people who run the 72 provisional transactions, but acknowledged that the concerns of Calais prefecture were "absolutely comprehensible."
Judge Jean-François Molla said that food shops, cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than just feeding people who "live in extremely precarious conditions."
He said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened by the defeat was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which operates non-profit and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as an advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the Kids' Café.
In a letter to the Guardian, it was said that the closure would "be a disaster for these children, of which the last eight years are old."
On Friday, the two aid organisations Help Refugees and L'Auberge of the migrant estimated that the number of people living in the jungle camp had increased to more than 9,000 people - the highest number so far - after a steep increase in new arrivals during the summer.
Despite Olympia disappointment: Martin remains struggling
In spite of his disappointing appearance in the Olympic era, Radprofi Tony Martin does not want to be interrupted.
"I keep an eye on the World Championships, remain confident and continue to fight," the 31-year-old wrote on Thursday before leaving Rio de Janeiro at Facebook.
He doesn't have an explanation for his miserable twelfth place on the sugar hat.
"I honestly find it difficult to comment on yesterday's timing," Martin said.
He had to analyse the reasons for debakel in peace.
At the time-driving Championship in October in Katar, Martin actually wanted to join the title.
"I'll look at everything we've changed lately."
"This also includes my position," wrote the three-time World Champion, who had lost more than three minutes on Wednesday at 54.5 km at the Olympiasieger Fabian Cancellara (Switzerland).
Olympia: Tennisprofi Siegemund missed half-finals
The victory of Laura Siegemund ended in the quarter finals of Rio: The world rankings 32. from slaughterhouses missed by a 1: 6, 1: 6 against Monica Puig (Puerto Rico / WTA No.
34) the semi-finals of the Olympic tennis tournament.
The merge, which was plagued by back problems, was able to carry out its supplement only once and seemed powerless compared to the previous rounds.
On Thursday, Angelique Kerber (Kiel / Nr. 2) still had the chance to jump into the front round.
The Australian Open winner met the Britin Johanna Konta (No. 10).
As the last German tennis professional, Tommy Haas had taken a medal (silver) in Sydney in 2000.
Two German DTB-Starters in the quarterfinals of summer games had last been in 1992.
A German duo has never been in an Olympic single semifinals.
Group increases at start-up for live video game transmissions
Other people watching video games is a giant thing - Microsoft wants to benefit from it.
The technology company buys the start-up beam that specializes in this hobby.
How much money goes on for the acquisition, Microsoft did not notify on Thursday.
Beam started with his offer only in January and already has more than 100,000 users.
You can watch others play, but also intervene yourself.
For example, they can abandon the players' missions and counteract enemies and provide equipment.
The playground Activision Blizzard launches a new HD video service for the booming world of e-sport.
On the way to global media event is intended to help Facebook.
The advertising industry is already listening.
The employees of the start-up, which has previously been established in Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington, move to Microsoft headquarters in the California Redmond, as Beam co-founder and chief Matt Salsamendi announced.
Therefore, for customers, the acquisition is not meant to change anything.
Beam is integrated into the video game department around the Xbox console according to Microsoft.
The market of live streaming of video game activities is currently growing rapidly.
Known platforms are Twitch and YouTube Gaming.
Twitch was purchased by the online dealer Amazon in 2014 - for almost a billion dollars.
YouTube Gaming belongs to the Google Mother Alphabet.
Here comes the Enforcement Trailer
Germany's racers have to adjust to the next generation of speed meters: In various federal countries, including Hessen and Brandenburg, new lightning devices are being tested to transfer temposünder particularly effectively.
For example, the futuristic enforcement trailer of Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used at accident points where it would be too dangerous for a mobile police measurement.
For example, at motorway construction sites or bridges to be refurbished with temporary tempolimit, there is often no infrastructure necessary to ensure that there is a stationary lighter to ensure compliance with the speed limit.
However, a permanent mobile structure may be too dangerous or too costly.
The Enforcement Trailer is autonomous: its battery lasts five days in continuous measurement operation, the case data are transmitted via a modem.
In addition, laser measurement technology enables all vehicles to be recorded simultaneously over several tracks.
Variable speed limits as well as transit prohibitions by time, roadlines and vehicle class can also be monitored.
You can move the trailer according to the manufacturer in high-speed condition with each car with a trailer coupling.
In order not to be easily stolen, it is lowered in the measuring operation, so that the wheels in the armor and, by the way, also bulletproof outer shell disappear.
In addition, a built-in alarm system is intended to protect the lighter from vandalism.
Since 2015, the trailer has been tested by Vitronic in various federal countries and is now also used.
Also foreign authorities blast with the new technology: most recently, France has subordinated 100 pieces, after an order of 150 pieces last year.
Great Britain picks silver in the 7th Rugby after Fiji Masterclass gets gold
The impressive performance of Britain at the 7th Rugby in the final on Thursday evening came to an abrupt stop at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis when they were hit here in Rio with a result of 43-7 in the Deodoro Stadium.
Fiji granted a master class in action, side stepping, reverse, line run and raw strength to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat was caused by the not too bad price of the silver medal - the fourth of Britain on that day - and they were quite proud of their efforts in this tournament where they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The clear defeat of the box, 7-5 in the semifinals on the same day could fall back on them in the final.
But regardless of this, Fiji would have hit a 15-man team in best shape.
It could be a comfort for GB - but probably will not - that at least one British will have a gold medal hanging around his neck tomorrow: Fiji's chief coach Ben Ryan, the former head of England from Wimbledon.
GB had a difficult way to get behind it.
Eight years ago, they lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens under Ryan.
They only lost one here.
This slope will hurt, but progress is amazing.
Fiji began wonderfully and made the attacks blow off GBs for fun.
It felt like Captain Tom Mitchell and Co. were running in driving buses. The World Series winners went up 5-0 when Osea Kolinisau hooked up in the corner.
With four minutes of playing time, Jerry Tuwai put another attack out of the right corner that he converted.
12-0 and GB barely touched the ball.
A heavier tachle of Mitchell stopped the mountain of Mann Leone Nakarawa to achieve a third gate, but it only stopped Fiji.
In the seventh minute Jasa Veremalua ran a touchdown in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa added a new one since the restart pfiff and there was still over a minute playing time... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou preached by further weak tackling of the GB team and stormed to the line to make a gate.
The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.
It's like Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB is still learning.
That's the way it is.
GB made fundamental changes to half-time and closed the Fijian gap for four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-life until Josua Tuisova went through after a brilliant interim play by Fiji.
Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game had been going for a long time in favour of the South Sea Insulans whose fans sang, flew flags and danced on the tribüne.
It was not difficult to admire Fijis's playful approach.
Mata Viliame set the i-pile with another attempt in the last few seconds.
The Pfiff peed, the Fijis hugged themselves and GB kicked devastatingly beaten in the lawn.
Earlier that day, Fiji had defeated Japan in the half-finals with 20-5 and Britain pushed South Africa into a short half-finals match from the race - UK's conversion of the difference.
Kyle Brown brought the box forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke through the line with an impressive footwork and achieved a gate under the post in the second half.
A brilliant late tackling by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-side team, secured the win - and hence the silver medal.

There won't be any more emotinal gold than these games, and that's what it means.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
Even though only the two were sitting on the rowing, there were three voices in the boat. The echo of coach Robin Williams, was present when they were roaring into the second Olympiagold in the two without a tax woman, the first women in the history of British sports that laid such a scale.
Their dominance was absolute, after all, its 39.th unstrived effort, which is also unprecedented.
What we see are two brilliant athletes that slide over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the kind of triumph to geese.
Behind every gold in the rudder is a battalion of willing helpers who contribute to the incremental progress that makes the difference and it was no one more helpful than the coach who didn't know 30 months ago whether he would survive this day at all than he was diagnosed with cancer.
Like he said, he was risky.
I had bladder cancer that's operational and they did.
If you don't, he'll spread everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes the view a little.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The Trio was lucky that he was able to start his treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, if that is the right term in such circumstances at all.
I needed money, so I had to get better soon.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and walked around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said a few steps would be enough.
That's how it starts.
Rowing itself is already a challenge, but that makes it even bigger.
In the instability of victory, their first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nervous morning talking something more than usual and trying to process his own fears.
Stanning, who was a captain of the Royal Artillery Regiment in an operation in Afghanistan, said, "I was an emotional wreck this week. This may be something extreme, but it means so much."
It only repeats how much that means to me, how much I and Helen and Robin have worked.
It was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anyone, so a massive thank you to him. He's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have wanted a better person to train or a better coach.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the last five years.
The couple had a hard rhythm that their opponents couldn't keep.
Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to unlock, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very trapped right now.
Helen called, "Stay in the process, stay in the process."
It's really important not to get involved.
We had a good start and at the same time we weren't ready to do something great.
We didn't want a fireworks today, we just wanted to achieve a good result, go out and win the race, whatever we did.
The couple will take a break for a year before it will make decisions about its future.
Glover has to appear on a wedding next week, her own with the TV adventure Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say this was my last race.
That would have meant too much pressure.
In London, it took about six months to understand that I was an Olympic governor.
It was all so new to me and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes here.
That feels so much better, "she said.
For 31 years, good for clarity
The managing director of the Veitstein Group, Ruppert Göller, retired.

A small French drinking water association as an example for the large water producers.
This is what it was called in the original alton a while ago in a contribution from the Bayerische Rundfunk.
A little later, the Water Forum of the Government of Unterfranken appreciated the purpose association.
The work of the Veitensteingruppe was "prominent in the long term."
All of this is Rupert Göller, who was 31 years in the special association, of whom 28 years as Managing Director.
He was now retired at the age of 65.
The drinking water association of the Veitstein group based in Kottendorf, municipality Breitbrunn, promotes approximately 150000 cubic metres of water each year and provides 32 places and pairs with about 5500 inhabitants.
The municipalities are Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and Baunach.
There are water supply contracts for other cities and municipalities.
The current chairman, the mayor of Breitbrunn Gertrud Bühl (FW), reminded us that Rupert Göller was hired in 1985 and was appointed as managing director of the special association in 1988.
"His tasks have been very diverse, and they ran from water management and maintenance work on office and organizational activities, budget planning, calculating fees and contributions to emergency operations on weekends," the president said.
As an outstanding event, it referred to the start-up and inauguration of the new fountains (1994), land purchases in the new fountains (1998) and compensation for farmers, the restoration of the high containers (1999), the re-acquisition of a central computer control (2004) and the partial renewal of water pipelines.
There has been no standstill and there have been repeatedly innovations because water means life and drinking water is the most important food.
In her Laudatio she praised Göller's loyal, reliable and correct service over 31 years.
He has worked with a lot of blood for his water utility association and he has lived the water utility association properly as if it were his own company.
A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was allowed to present the success concept of the Veitstein group for nitrate reduction in front of the water forum of the district of Unterfranken.
He has received a great deal of recognition and praise for this.
Rupert Göller himself praised the watermate of Alfon's Griebel, who had worked with him for 28 years.
He's the best water man and he was a faithful button.
Together, we were an unbeatable team.
As a highlight from his point of view, he described the construction of the well and the restructure of the purpose association.
But the biggest challenge and the most difficult effort was the pipe break on the high container at church lords on January 3.
Here, at minus 17 degrees, will work all night, so that the localities could be supplied with water.
The supply of Neubrunn could have been maintained once only because the Pettstadt high container was filled with hoses.
The management of the drinking water association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who will join the succession of Rupert Göller.
Sopranist Anna Netrebko is openly dealing with the autism of her son Tiago - and addresses other affected parents: "They must have the courage to talk about it."
"Medicine has made great progress," said the 44-year-old Italian newspaper "Corriere della Sera."
When the disease had been recognized with her son, she believed she had to die.
However, the eight-year-old Tiago had made good progress and now learns private in New York where there are the best therapists.
"To give an example: If I ask him something which was two years ago when I sang at the Milan Scala, he does not remember anything," said Netrebko.
But he's the happiest person on earth.
Tiago comes from Netrebko's connection to the Bassbariton Erwin Schrott.
She is now married to Tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
Relationship State in Bargteheide - Man shoots at life-threatening woman
A 35-year-old man shot his partner at a multi-family house in Bargteheide (Stormarn County) on Friday at 10.45 a.m.
"The man himself called us and said that he shot his life companion," said a policeman.
The perpetrator was on the run, after him was thrown public.
Meanwhile, it's federal, because Sven S. could be on the way by car.
The man is about 1.80 meters tall, muscular, brown burned and has a glow.
Meanwhile, the police have published a photo of him.
It's a few years old, though.
Meanwhile, the man wears a glow.
The man should not be addressed directly.
He could still carry the gun, says the police.
If you see Sven S., call the 110.
The police are talking about a "Relationship State."
The victim was the year 1988, the perpetrator in 1981.
The competent police in Lübeck first wanted to provide no information on the Tathergang or the relationship between perpetrators and victims, but confirmed that a human being had been killed.
"This is a murder offence."
"That's all we're saying at the moment," said a policeman in Lübeck.
According to eye witnesses, a special operation command (SEK) was at the crime scene.
Steel - Light view for German steel industry
The crisis-driven and energy-intensive German steel industry is spared from additional costs in millions.
Financial burdens threatening the sector from eco-electricity production are off the table.
It remains to be exempted from the renewables-energy levy in the stock installations for so-called self-electricity production in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "Western German General Newspaper" (WAZ, Friday edition).
"I am really glad that after two years of tough negotiations we have finally achieved this."
The European Commission had therefore first planned to ask steel producers, which use high-furnace gases to generate electricity for their own consumption, for cash.
According to Germany, the steel industry threatened additional costs from €120 to 240 million per year.
Gabriel told the WAZ that there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission after discussions with Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
Only when the generators are replaced in the steel works will an EEC levy of 20 percent apply.
But this is not charged in the steel industry either.
The IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the EU Commission on self-generation.
This largely defines the status quo of the previous scheme.
The successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry are of particular importance.
"With regard to our campaign 'Steel is the future' this is a first step."
"More must follow."
"Climate and employment objectives should also be balanced in the context of the reform of emissions trading," said IG Metal Chief Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt.
Since the financial crisis in 2008, the steel industry in Europe has suffered from overcapacity and significant price pressure.
Last year, the situation continued to exacerbate as the world's largest producer country China threw massive steel to the world market in view of the weakening domestic demand.
European producers claim price dumping for Chinese steel groups.
In the course of this spring, the situation has relaxed a little.
On the one hand, import duties imposed on imports of steel have been shown to have been effective, and on the other hand, the economic outlook in China has eased.
It is unclear how sustainable price recovery is.
The German industry primus Thyssenkrupp remained careful on Thursday.
Last but not least, prices would have stagnated again.
The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.
Thyssenkrupp did not want to exclude closures of individual works.
At the end of 2015, around 86000 people were employed in the German steel industry.
In July, the German steel manufacturers remain careful despite rising prices and increasing orders.
They produced, with 3.4 million tonnes, nearly six percent less crude steel than in the previous month, as the steel business association announced on Friday.
After a short increase in May, the quantity produced now declined the second month in succession.
Since the beginning of the year, production has been below the previous year's value by 2 per cent.
The association expects an increasing output in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation.
Community, Spirit, Health: Sing does senior good
The singing has been with Ursel Kipp all her life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, in the doctoral study she performed the field music, and today the 78-year-old is singing in a senior choir.
"Sing moves me - emotional and physical," she describes.
After a sample she feels more balanced, happy and more alive, she says.
By the way, she does something good with her health and her mind.
Because singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler of the German Seniorenliga.
Most of the seniors sing in the choir and share the joy of music with the same minds, describes Hackler.
Due to regular intercourse, seniors can establish and maintain social contacts.
Because often social and family structures dissolve at age, a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.
This experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir: "To meet and organise, to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of union."
Sing can be exhausting in a positive sense, says Hackler.
Because in doing so, seniors train deep and controlled breathing.
Anyone who regularly asks for his lung doesn't get out of the breath so fast in everyday life.
Even if it's about getting the sound of the voice at age, singing is an optimal hobby.
Singen often has a very special effect on older people, says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Labour Community of Senior Organisations.
In the elderly generations the common singing had a much higher priority, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in leisure, she explains.
Lenz often observes that singing or hearing songs in older people gives rise to many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth time.
Through lyrics and especially melodies, dementia-affected people are remembering long-standing events.
When singing the head is also required a special performance, Lenz explains.
At the same time, focusing on your own voice and on a given rhythm, adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.
Especially older people who live alone practice so not only to focus on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition learned by singing in the choir, says Hackler.
An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.
The self-esteem also grows through singing in the choir.
To show myself: If I practice for a long time, I will be better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens.
So good reasons to start singing are enough.
Anyone who wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent, advises Lenz.
You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who's listening when a sound goes down?
Looking for the matching offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler.
If someone from the acquaintance sings in a senior choir, you can just join us.
Many cities also provide overview of the choirs in the area.
If you want to sing in a church choir, you can contact the church or the church champion directly.
Many senior chores can also be found on the Internet.
Anyone who has no access to the Internet can ask for help in the Internet search.
Anyone who wants to sing should be joining a choir, advises Hackler.
Sing does the soul well and has something liberating - that applies to every age.
Cats react more sensitive than cats to screams of young animals
Biologists have examined the effect of calling cat babies on adult animals in Hannover.
To their surprise, the mowing didn't make the males cold - but they were always the same in contrast to the females.
Female cats can see the excitement rate of cat babies at the cheek of the little ones.
They react by ten percent faster to the sounds of cats that are mentioned in great distress, as scientists have found out from the Veterinary University and the Medical University of Hannover (MHH).
Kater also responds to the calls of kittens - but always the same.
"Apparently, the acoustic differences between the chewing of fewer and heavily excited young animals are either unperceivable or not of significance for the males," said Biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MHH.
She is the first author of the study published this Friday in the magazine "BMC Evolutionary Biology."
In a previous study, the research team had already found that the duration and sound of kittens screaming differs from the urgency of their need for assistance.
A total of nine adult cats and eight cats from MHH were observed.
They were played on the one hand by little ones who were taken out of the throat box for three minutes and separated from mother and siblings.
On the other hand, they were confronted with cries of more excited cats, which were also raised up.
In spite of the low sample, researchers consider their results to be meaningful.
"All females, even those who had not yet had their own offspring, responded differently to the screams," said Konerding.
They turned faster to the speaker when this call was played by the very tougher kittens.
This ability may be born or evolve with gender maturity.
"A surprise was that the males have responded at all," said the biologist.
In the past, scientists have been investigating the reactions of women and men to baby noise several times in humans.
Some studies also showed that women responded more sensitive to infants, whether they were mothers or not, the Biologist Marina Scheumann reported.
Podolski grabs with "Gala" to Supercup
Hakan Sükur is a football legend in Turkey.
In Turkey, an arrest warrant was issued against the first football star Hakan Sükor.
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
For the first time after the pussy attempt, an important football game will be held in Turkey again.
Before the duel of the Archdivalence between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolskis Galatasaray Istanbul around the Supercup in Konya, the official line is clear: "Business as usual."
Already when the state of emergency was suspended after the war attempt in July, the government insisted that the everyday life of ordinary citizens should not be affected.
This does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who are made responsible for the attempts of the poetry.
It does not stop before football.
The prosecutor issued an arrest warrant against the former Starkicker Hakan Sükür.
It is therefore accused of being a member of a terrorist group to be a member of the South Cours that now lives in America.
South Korea is supposed to be a supporter of the Preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is made responsible by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for the Putschtest.
Although the exception condition initially applies for 90 days until October, it actually has virtually no impact on the lives of most Turks.
The night "Democracy Guards" in public places throughout the country has declared Erdogan to be terminated on Wednesday.
Sport is divided - like the whole country - into trailers and opponents of Erdogans.
Especially fans of the workers' club Besiktas are traditionally not among the president's friends.
However, in view of the dramatic experience of history, the great part of the Turks is the strict rejection of military puppets.
There even the fans agree - whether their heart beats for Galatasaray or Besiktas.
In the case of Pokalsieger "Gala," Lukas Podolski will return to the city.
The Cologne demonstrated his sporting value during the expired season: with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions, the 31-year-old ended his first season as the top scorer of his association.
In the final game against Fenerbahce he achieved the 1: 0 victory.
The newspaper "Fanatik" congratulated him: "He was the best in the square."
He finished the season in an excellent way and secured the pocal to his team.
Thanks to "Poldi," the disappointing season for the record champion found a reconciling degree.
= = References = = = = External links = = * Official website
In the South Lig it was only ranking six.
The season wasn't good.
The pocal was the only way to win something.
"We did that and that is the most important thing," said Podolski.
For Master Besiktas the game year was better.
Especially thanks to Mario Gomez, who laid the base for the 14th title with 26 seasonal hits as a Souper-Lig-Torschützenkönig.
This is also why the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31-year-old.
In doing so, Gomez, which was contracted with the AC Florence and was only lent to Besiktas after the pussy attempt, had not returned due to the political situation in the country after his EM vacation.
"If Mario wants to come to us, he only has to say it," the magazine quoted "Kicker" Clubchef Fikret Orman.
However, the stormer should be prepared to refrain from leaving about one third of his annual salary estimated at 7.5 million euros, Orman said: "We cannot pay his salary at Florence."
Despite doping: These athletes still have medal opportunities at Olympia in Rio
The 34-year-old Justin Gatlin was already locked twice for doping (2001 and 2006).
Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblowerin Julia Stepanowa is not allowed to start in Rio.
Other transmitted body-tathletics sinners can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio for medals.
The theme Doping continues to determine the headlines at the Rio Olympic Games.
The Russian swimmer Julija Jefimowa, who had complained about her start-up right shortly before the games, was wrapped out and booked at the start (100 meters breast).
There was a currile scene: with a smile set she was still stolted into the hall and had provoked with her appearance.
When it was established that she wouldn't get gold, the audience broke out in a jewelry storm.
But there are still many other athletes who are starting at the Rio Olympic Games despite doping past.
Here's an overview:
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100-m-season / USA): The 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in the body lethology.
He was already locked up for doping twice (2001 and 2006 to 2010).
Since his banner, the 2004 Olympic leader and the former world champion have run even faster than before, he is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9.80 seconds and is considered to be the largest challenger of Usain Bolt.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100-m-season / Jamaica): The two-time Olympic and seven-time world champion had to sit a six-month barrier in 2010 after proving the intake of oxycodon.
She had severe toothache after an operation, the 29-year-old defended herself.
Sandra Perkovic (Diskus / Croatia): 2011 was tested positively for the forbidden stimulant methylhexanamine in 2012, the 2013 World Champion and the 2010-2016 European Champion.
Perkovic disputed the knowledgeable intake and was locked for six months.
This year's four largest spikes go to the big gold favourite's account.
LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400-m-season / USA): The Beijing Olympic Guide and two-time world champion over 400 m had been tested positively in 2010 and had been blocked for 21 months.
A means of penis enlargement had been responsible, warned Merritt.
This year the 30-year-old is over 200 and 400 m the fastest man in the world.
Iwan Tichon (Hammerthrow, Belarus): hardly an athlete has been recognized as many medals afterwards.
Tichon lost his 2005 World Championship title nine years later, after he was found with Testosteron Doping.
In 2004, the 40-year-old had to deliver Olympia silver for steroid dopings and the EM title 2006 for testosterone abuse.
In 2008, he was retired from the 2008 Olympic Games' bronze medal on the basis of a judgment of the CAS International Sports Court.
= = References = = = = External links = = * Official website
Liu Hong (20 km walking, China): The world recorder and gold favourite was tested positively only in May, but can still start in Rio.
At the 29-year-old world champion, evidence was found of the intake of a prohibited food supplement, the World Anti-Doping Agency WADA's blockade was slight and expired on July 13.
Bomb enterror in Thailand - Austrian injured - Several Dead
The Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, said the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Thomas Schnöll, Friday morning.
She suffered cut wounds and had been treated in the hospital but could have left it again.
She was planning her home trip for the beginning of September.
Whether the further explosions on the holiday island of Phuket as well as in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon are also affected by Austrian citizens are still unclear.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with local authorities in this respect, so Schnöll.
At about 200 kilometers south of the capital of Bangkok Hua Hin, two bombs were first exploded on Thursday night in an exit quarter.
According to the police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.
On Friday morning, two more explosives went up, with another human being killed according to the authorities.
A bomb explosion was also reported by Phuket in the morning.
A taxi driver was injured by the Detonation near the Patong beach that was popular with holidays.
In Surat Thani on the south-east coast of the country, another bomb exploded that killed a city employee.
According to the authorities, the explosion set had been exploded in a flower bite in front of the coastal police department.
Finally, there were several detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the southwest coast as well as in Chumphon on the southeast coast.
It was called a connection to the explosions in Hua Hin.
"The bombs bear the same handwriting," said Army General Danai Kritmethavee Friday morning in front of journalists.
"We assume that this is a coordinated attack."
It was too early to express itself on possible motives - but it was probably about the actions of Muslim rebels.
The Thai media also wanted to recognise a pattern in the attacks that is typical of the Muslim Separatists bombing in the south of the country.
On the other hand, the Thai police said that the assassinations were not related to the Islamic Rebellion or to international terrorism.
"This is only local sabotage limited to limited areas and provinces," said a spokesman in Bangkok.
Instead, it is assumed that the bombs were placed by opponents of the ruling military junta.
In recent days, the authorities would have received secret evidence of forthcoming attacks in the south of the country, although they had not been informed of the exact time and places.
It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks.
The police instructed their officials throughout the country to strengthen security around important government buildings as well as airports, railway stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment areas.
In Thailand, there are always smaller bombs, but they are usually not directed against tourists.
In Hua Hin is a palace used by King Bhumibol Adulyadej for years.
According to the bombing explosions now, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends on its homepage to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities.
High safety risk (level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and surroundings.
After conflicts between security forces and Muslim sections of the population, unnecessary travel to these provinces is advised.
Increased safety risk (level 2) applies to the rest of the country.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a contested referendum on a Constitution prepared by the military junta.
This gives great influence to the military in the coming years.
Junta Chief and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said that the bombs have been an attempt to create chaos while the country is moving towards stability, an improvement in the economic situation and tourism.
The military base, which had taken power in 2014 after a phase of bloody disturbances, holds itself in favour of having led the kingdom back to stability and order.
However, the military has not managed to get the insurrection of Muslim rebels in the ultimate south of the country for years.
More than 6500 people have already been killed in the conflict.
About a year ago, 20 people were killed in Bangkok in an attack on a popular Hindu-Schrein - most of them foreign tourists.
It was the bloodshed attack of the country's younger history.
The right "Identitary Movement" has come into the vision of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection.
After several country offices, the Constitutional Prosecutors in the Confederation also observed the group.
"We see the 'Identitary Movement' evidence of striving against the free democratic constitutional order," said Head of Constitutional Protection Hans-Georg Maaßen of the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Thus, immigrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are diffamated in an extreme way.
That's why we're watching the movement.
The "Identitary Movement" is a group of French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012.
It is opposed to "Multikulti-Wahn," "Uncontrolled mass immigration" and "Loss of its own identity through xenophobia."
Constitutional protectors in nine Länder - Bremen, Bavaria, Hessen, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thüringen - are already observing the "identitars."
Maaßen said that his authority had closely coordinated the decision with the country offices.
"Groups like the 'Identity Movement' try to pick up their target group where it stands," said the Head of Constitutional Protection.
In general, extremists try to speak to them with a juvenile language, often with puppy music.
That would be Islamists as well as right extremists.
This is not a dubious advertising for your own business.
I want the propaganda to address people emotionally.
Young people are particularly vulnerable there.
This is dangerous.
Last but not least, there were reports from several federal states on the contacts of the "identitars" with AfD politicians.
Maaßen said he had no knowledge of that.
Possible contacts of this kind are only relevant for the protection of the constitution from a certain point of view.
It is important whether the respective party - in this case the AfD - changes its target by certain people who are extremistic and become so extremistic.
It is therefore crucial whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party.
This is not apparent.
In view of the significant increase in legally motivated crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee accommodation, Maaßen said that he would not speak in this context of new rights of terrorism.
But we have seen in recent years that there can be legal structures.
There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Friday group.
It may well be that other legal terrorist groups or micro-groups are planning attacks on asylum seekers, on refugee homes or attacks from other right-to-right extremistic motives.
However, a German or European governance of legal sterrorism is not apparent.
The previous groups had been created at the regional level or in social networks.
Maatten expressed concern about many attacks on the account of people who had not previously appeared in the right scene.
That's the worrying thing.
Many of the suspects of attacks on asylum accommodation had not previously been known as criminals, politically motivated criminals or followers of the right scene.
"So many people have committed crimes that had nothing before with right extremists that might have been politically indifferent or, for example, have chosen CDU, SPD or left, which have then radicalized themselves through right-right extremistic mood."
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros Habte becomes an online website
The Olympics or World Records do not always determine the headlines at the Olympic Games.
This shows the brave appearance of Robel Kiros Habte at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.
In the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia swim so slowly that he was no longer seen in the TV pictures.
He simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut was chosen.
In the social networks, Habte became a viral internethite.
In fact, the 24-year-old completes his prerun with a residue of 48 seconds and occupied the 59-year-old place of 59 Starters.
But it was rather his not exactly sporting character that attracted the attention of the international media.
Why does the 24-year-old still participate in the Olympic Games?
The Ethiopian was granted a special right of start from the International Swimming Association.
This is distributed to make swimming more known in underrepresented countries.
Since most athletes run in ethopia, Habte just wanted to do something else.
Preparation is all: Robel Kiros Habte is ready for the big race.
Quickly, the first nicknames made the round.
Some media called him "robel of whale."
In line with a "prosperity belly" the English Boulevardblatt "The Sun" with "Dad Bod" made fun of him.
His time, he only hit with one minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters free style, didn't matter there.

At the 2000 Sydney Olympics, Eric Moussambani's race provided medial attention.
The appearance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea was unforgettable when he had to go on his own in a course of more than 100 metres.
In French, Moussambani was fired at that time.
The 22-year-old learned only eight months before Olympia and had never completed such a long distance before the competition.

An open industrial often in DTLA receives a cozy makeover
We celebrate the 90.th birthday of the central library of L.A. with - what else? - a new book
Geretsried - The owner of a store at the New Place has been stolen.
According to the police, the 67-year-old Geretsrider left her business on Monday at 5: 30 and forgot to close a window on the ground floor.
When she came back the next morning at 8.15 a.m., about 250 euros had disappeared from the cash box.
Traces of the killer could not be found.
There is also no video surveillance.
Trump doesn't see the threatening election defeat so tight
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at a campaign event in Florida.
If it doesn't happen to be a US President, Donald Trump already has an alternative video.
He'll just go on vacation.
If Donald Trump loses the US presidential elections in November, it would be quite irrelevant to him: "In the end it will either work, or I have a very, very nice, long vacation," said the Republican candidate in a phone interview with the US TV station CNBC.
If it is not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, that is all right, Trump said.
He named the U.S. President Barack Obama and the candidate of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, as the founder of the Islamic state terrorist militia (IS).
Within his party, more and more resistance occurred.
Post increases in the trading of electrical transport
An electric supply vehicle of the German Post in action.
The interest of other companies in the vehicle seems to be great.
The post plans to sell its electric vehicle StreetScooter as well.
Shortly, the group wants to start trading with the transporter.
The post wants to offer its electric transports from next year on the free car market as well.
"We want to get into the sale to third parties," said a post speaker on Friday.
The company has been checking for months whether it is intended to sell its self-developed StreetScooter, with which letters and packages are delivered, to other companies.
The post board of Jürgen Gerdes had said that there are always questions, such as craftsmen.
According to information from the news magazine "Der Spiegel" the Bonner Group is about to enter the mass production of the vehicles.
In the post-owned factory the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift.
Gerdes had announced that the group wanted to significantly expand its fleet of electric cars and in the long term a complete transition to environmentally friendly vehicles.
"We will take a very, very robust step towards 2020," he said at the end of July.
I can imagine we're switching the entire fleet.
The StreetScooter has been active on Germany's roads since 2014.
GfK leadership descends after disappointing business figures
The consumer research company GfK exchanged his boss Matthias Hartmann.
The resignation came suddenly - but not surprisingly.
The difficult situation of the market research company GfK assumed that the chair of Chief of the Board of Directors Matthias Hartmann is becoming more uncertain, the longer the successes he promised.
Turbulence at the top of the Nürnberg market research company GfK: After once again disappointing business figures and the resignation of corporate management, the world's number five of the industry is at a new start.
GfK Board Chief wants to leave the company at the end of the year.
The chairman of the CCC Supervisory Board Arno Mahlert is already leaving the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September.
The leadership of the board takes over the former board member Gerhard Hausruckinger on 1 September, informed the company.
He should officially take over the function of a "board speaker" until a successor for Hartmann was found.
As a reason for the resignation, the company called "different views" on long-term business policy orientation.
Details a business spokesman didn't want to mention on Friday.
Those who will be the leader of the market research company in the future are still unclear.
In investor circles it was said on Friday that the shareholders had last been very disappointed about the continuing successes of the restructuring started years ago.
Mr. Hartmann has been at the GfK top since 2011.
"The fruits of the restructuring are not yet to be seen after 5 years," he said.
In view of the last bad GFK business figures, each shareholder will eventually be uncalm.
"If that were the case with BMW, the Quandts would do so," he said.
The company would not have been able to stop its loss journey even in the second quarter of 2016 after a drop in the previous quarter.
With EUR 361.2 million, turnover was 6.1 per cent below the level of the comparable quarter of the previous year.
With reference to the first half of the year, sales decreased by €721.2 million by 3.4 per cent.
Profit in the second quarter has mainly burdened the company's shrinking value in view of its difficult economic situation.
The EUR 139 million corporate valuation write-offs needed in the Consumer Experience business accounted for a loss of EUR 148.2 million to the group under the line.
In the second quarter of 2015, the GfK had still generated a group profit of 19.7 million.
Accidents - Bus slips in crowds in ditches: Eight injured
In the event of an accident in a bus with 43 seniors as passengers, eight people were injured on Thursday in Krummhörn (district Aurich).
Two of the inmates suffered serious injuries, the police informed them.
According to the 66-year-old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisenach, he had to avoid a truck that was part of the counter-track.
The bus came to the right from the street and slipped into a ditch, as a spokeswoman from the police told Aurich / Wittmund.
"Because of the location of the bus, people could not leave the bus independently," she said.
The fire department cleared the inmates.
Six rescue cars and an emergency car came to the accident site on the National Road 2.
The uninjured travellers were brought back from a line bus to the Krummhörner Stadtteil Pewsum.
There they should wait for a replacement bus from the travel company.
The investigators asked the truck driver and possible witnesses to report to the police.
The fees per cubic meter of wastewater from 1 October 2016 for the area of the sewage plant Neudorf / Reuth / Welschenkahl 3.44 instead of 2.10 euros so far; for Zultenberg / Lindenberg / Lopp 3.36 euros (so far 2.26 euros) and Azendorf 3.64 euros (so far 2.18 euros).
At the Azendorf plant, the wastewater fee will be increased again no later than when appropriate improvement measures are needed.
After a overlap calculation, the waste water price in Azendorf will then be at 4.37 euros per cubic meter.
As Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, during the approval of the budget by the Landrat Office of Kulmbach, it was found that these waste water plants are subject to undercoverage.
The Kasendorf market is obliged, on the basis of the legal basis, to operate the installations in a cost-effective manner.
From 1 October 2016, the citizens, as well as the commercial and industrial companies from Welschenkal, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to take deeper into the purse.
The fee increases are between 48 and 67 per cent.
As Managing Director Herbert Schmidt showed to the board, a new calculation of the fees for the sewage plants of the market community was necessary.
For the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- or undercoverage from the previous calculation period should also be compensated.
The serious increase in fees caused Schmidt to be relatively small facilities with a very low waste water attack between 6800 and 12000 cubic metres per year.
For example, due to the low distribution base, expenditure on necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact.
In addition, waste water supply in all three plants was slightly reduced.
In addition, in the declining period, all three plants had been significantly affected, not least due to their age of rehabilitation and repair applications.
The plant in Azendorf was almost 30 years old, the plant for Welschenkal, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years old.
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be exchanged in the waste water plant Azendorf due to damage.
In the pumping plant Welschenkal the nearly 20-year-old support facilities had to be overtaken from ground to ground and at the peak cleansing plant Lopp had to expand after almost 20 years of operation the first sewage sewer, dispose of sewage sludge and install an additional ventilation facility to continue to comply with the water requirements.
Schmidt: "These extraordinary costs were included in the advanced maintenance and maintenance costs to be taken into account in the new calculation period."
The same applies to electricity costs which were still significantly below the current level in previous calculations in 2011 / 2012.
Steinhäuser made it clear that in the case of the low drainage in the three plants, the costs for the operation and maintenance were "fully passed."
In addition, Schmidt retained the market community from large maintenance costs for waste water plants over the last 20 years.
The situation for the abovementioned plants will continue to be precarious in the long term, since the supply area of the Friesenbachtal sewage group could not be extended to these plants because of the lack of facilities.
Bulgaria booked inflation for the first time in 8 months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% on a monthly basis in July.
This is the highest value (since June 2012) and the first over zero since October last year when positive 0.2% were booked.
The annual average inflation of the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was measured according to CPI -0.8%.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
In July 2016, a price increase of the following groups of consumer goods was observed: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); leisure and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.2%); various goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell for clothing and footwear (2.2%); furniture, household appliances and routine expectations (0.5%); health (0.1%).
Prices remained as in the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco; apartments, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communication; and education unchanged.
Snapchat "Anime" effect criticized as Asian cartoon
Snapchat says this filter is animated, but some observers say it's insensitive to races.
With its filter tool it allows Snapchat about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that is already adjacent to the absurde.
You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
The filters are unflooded, property-twisting tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies per day.
All missteps come to the public.
Snapchat filters have in the past attracted criticism in which they were accused that the app blackface would provoke or white skin as beauty sideal.
When a few users proposed a filter this week, which had their eyelids, false teeth, and dipped cheeks, some critics called a racist caricature of Asian - "Yellow Face."
They wondered whether these repeated controversy indicated a greater problem that the company has diversity.
The news and the disgrace were widely distributed on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat announced that it had deactivated the feature.
The company offered an excuse: the filter was thought to be a homage to anime characters and not as a caricature of Asian people.
But outsiders who have experienced racism reminded the filter of injurious clichés.
Others decided to reject the Anime comparison.
In an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet about the photos was widely distributed, wrote that the filter was "injurious and unpleasant."
She added that "it was difficult to argue with the contradiction of a very disgusting Asian caricature and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not yellowish, but that the yellowish face has been pulled into the depreciating extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural plumber wire.
American culture seems to be involved in an endless struggle for diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in our hands.
And Snapchat's big audience of young people - who are in the race of different than their older counterparts - could rather assume to expect sensitivity.
If one of Snapchat's filters produces a picture that is offensive to a user, "it is much more difficult that such things remain unnoticed than before," said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu, who works as product manager and engineer for medium, decided to delete her snapchat account and asked others to do the same.
In an essay for medium and in a phone interview she said that she believes that racial controversy reflects a lack of diversity in recruitment practices in snapchat.
Zhu criticized the mostly white, only male leadership and ended her essay with a Hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.
"Either she has no different representation of people with other skin colors in her staff, so that they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors working there, but are not in positions where they feel safe or well to say anything about it."
Others share their opinion, a complaint which has largely left Snapchat unanswered.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its staff and points to its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural background of his employees, but according to a spokesman, the company recently hired a staff manager who focused on underrepresented groups and on internal integration efforts.
Zhu said, on the other hand, that she would close her snapchat account and added, "I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not OK."
Military leadership falsified ISIS Intelligence Information, Congress Committee notes
Military members of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information in order to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic state in Iraq and Syria than it would have allowed the actual conditions on the ground, a Congress investigation committee reported in a report on Thursday.
The provisional report, prepared by a task force of the Republican members of the Military Force Committee, the Secret Service Committee and the Military Budget Committee, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command Intelligence Analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments of American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.
The Central Command, shortly Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"Intelligence information typically recovered by high-level Centcom commanders regularly drew a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism than it would have allowed the actual conditions on the ground and were consistently more positive than analyses of other intelligence services," a newspaper article quoted the report.
"What happened at the Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," said Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives.
The leadership errors in the Centcom range to the top of the organization.
The 10th-page report shows in detail constant problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi armed forces.
Although there is no direct evidence that government leaders under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts were exposed to pressure from their laws to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic state, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"During the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, opinions and statements were much more positive in front of the Congress than the facts" noted the report.
For example, a Centcom citizen publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could begin in April or May 2015.
Mossul, the second largest city of Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic state.
"After months of investigation, so much is clear." Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, said in an opinion.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the leaders of the Central Command changed the intelligence reports to reduce the risk of ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans called the Task Force after they were told that analysts were concerned about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic state.
The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings while the investigation is continuing.
In addition, further investigations of the Centcom reports are under way by the Secretary-General of the Ministry of Defence.
Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday, which were consistent with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
"In 2014 and 2015, the Centcom created an excessively limited process for the production of intelligence assessments on ISIL and Iraqi security services," announced the highest-ranking democracy in the committee, member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff, in an opinion.
This process, according to Mr. Schiff, "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," damaged morality among analysts and "gave too little room for differing opinions."
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats indicated that they did not find any evidence of an intervention by the White House with the Centcom analysts regarding a "specific political opinion."
The preliminary results of the Congress investigation were published on Tuesday by The Daily Beast.
Last August, the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon General Inspector, which were recorded after complaints from Centcom Analysts.
Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a press spokesman of the Pentagon, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on Congress reports while the investigations of the Inspector General were still under way.
But he also stated that "experts sometimes have quite divergent opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that news services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence."
The investigation has repercussions beyond the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim made by an increasing number of members of the Ministry of Defence).
However, the accusations made last year raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
The criticism of secrecy information about the Islamic state reminds us of intermediaries of more than ten years ago, when a Centcom Analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a document about how the then government under George W. Bush, contrary to the recommendations of many analysts, provided only a small crew force in Iraq and lacked time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current reporting of the Islamic state.
Last year, the team around Mr. Hooker, according to government agencies, noted that, contrary to government statements, air attacks against the Islamic state-held refineries would not have any significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these provisional refineries would have taken place to sell oil on the black market.
However, this knowledge was not published, the Times reported in September.
Centcoms then commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the Legislative for his excessive positive assessment of the war situation in a hearing before the Senate.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel at the Central Command.
The US wins fourth match in the field hockey of women, a showdown with Britain is ahead
One day after she shot three gates during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two gates for the American fieldhockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3-0.
Five gates in two games should actually be a memorable achievement, but Bam (27) said she couldn't remember ever doing that.
"I have no idea." She said.
I'm not one of the people who keep their gates in mind.
However, she knows that the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are also in their group with the British in the first place that remain unbeaten after their 2-0 victory against Japan.
The UK and the United States will meet in the last game of the first round on Saturday.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarterfinals, the game will decide which of the two within their group of six teams will gain the first and second place each.
The first placed will go a little longer away from the strong Dutch women who lead the other group.
Regardless of how much the game may end on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising swirl through their success history, four years after they landed at the last of 12 places in the last London Games.
Bam was part of this team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had a hockey bat in hands for the first time at three years (her two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), with 16 years she became a national player of the United States, the youngest in the history of the team.
She missed the Olympics in 2008 because she could not qualify for the cader.
Then came the year 2012, where everything went wrong for her and her team.
In the following year, Craig Parnham, an English trainer of the National Team, began to turn things to better.
"A cultural change, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam.
We didn't have the work break in London that we have now.
We've been able to rip the rudder completely around.
On Thursday night, Bam opened the tower in the first half of the game with a back hand from the nearby area.
India had gone to the game without victory in the tournament, but the team showed itself surprisingly tear and held the playground from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into her hands.
She made a jump with the flat ball over the left flank, then pulled into the middle and ran the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.
The shutout was the first of the entire tournament for the US Torhüter, Jackie Briggs, who had to book a gate in each of the previous games.
She's got a run.
Just like Bam.
"We are in a good position," said Parnham, but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday.
In the middle of the rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the Trampolins
Wherever you are, no matter how late it is, it's the Olympic Games.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel persistent and inevitable, a racing season between competition and striving.
It's like the Olympic torch itself is a burning staff that is enriched from the armchest to the swimmer to the Turner to the triathlete.
You cannot turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor in the waiting line in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who is in the Olympic Games for the first time and is a woman's swarm with dimples, could have been among these well-known names, which are sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and charity TV advertising, if he were a swimmer, Turner or even Fechter.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold in the Olympic trampoline tours.
The Olympic Flame does not light every event alike.
Further from the center, partly in the shadow, there are sports that are not widely recognized: air guns, archery shooting, bathing minton, taekwondo.
We will always have the breast swim and may rule it for a long time.
But if I may make modest arguments for my particular love, then let me draw attention to the discrete charm of the trampoline.
Although the trampoline jump has been an Olympic event since 2000 when it had its debut in Sydney, it has been perceived so sparsely in the last 16 years that many of those I had questioned did not know that it was an Olympic port at all.
This could also be regional ignorance.
Although the United States sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in the trampoline jump and had an athletic who made it until 2012.
The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.
The trampoline jump has a certain outdoor charm, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unclarified ear for a clown school than that for the Olympic Games.
At this point, I should admit that I'm not an expert, but just an earthbound enthusiast.
It has a humorous potential - the cartoonic triggering of its never ending inclination - but also the grazie of the tournament and diving, the two sports that it essentially unites.
The word "trampolin" comes from the Spanish El Trampolin, which means as much as "jumping board."
Successful winners jump on a giant trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements (rotation, heels and saltos) before they land on their feet.
According to the official Olympic programme, they are evaluated according to execution, difficulty and "flight time."
Two-thirds of athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will face each other in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.
In their striving for gold, medal hopers have to go further, faster, up and over, sometimes to the goal, sometimes to and back, up and down on the playground.
They are chasing not only the target line or the starting wall, but also another haircut in the television transmission: the world's or the Olympic chord.
The target striving is noble, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even touch a spectator to tears.
But it is also what I even feel tired when watching these games.
Of which the trampolin offers a breath break.
The trampoline jumper's vector is upstairs.
A forward movement is not the goal.
He or she blows off, apparently severely like an astronaut, goes upstairs, then downwards, then hesitantly back upstairs.
There is also a competition here, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant abolition of time and gravity.
It's as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can be.
Women's qualifications and finals will take place on Friday afternoon, on the streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.
NBC will broadcast the final round as part of a afternoon block on two days from 14.00.
In the middle of the Olympic Mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in general Tumult.
If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved through the accumulation and the objectification of male athletes - as the male US Turners recently suggested - then Mr Dooley expects his new fantasies ringing to the air.
"One generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the United States
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators demanding political change in Ethiopia came to the government's violent resistance.
Witnesses say that ten protesters were killed during the collision with the police during gunshots.
Is Ethiopia about to collapse?
In the last ten years, it has been one of the most stable countries of Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.
But in recent months, protests against the government have shaken the country and expanded into more and more areas.
Last week, thousands of people rushed on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.
According to human rights organisations, the government's response was unmerciful.
Witnesses indicated that cops shot and killed a dozen unarmed demonstrators.
Videos in circulation about the protests that are probably from the last or the beginning of this year show how security officers beat young people with sticks while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall.
The head of the UN Human Rights Authority is now calling for an in-depth investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is estimated by the West.
American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats beyond the region, especially in Somalia. Only few countries in Africa, if ever, receive so much Western aid.
Ethiopia's economy expanded at a significant pace.
Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new pendulum train in the capital of Addis Abeba.
The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have consistently referred to the repression of the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, with dissidents being effectively silent.
Many were sent to exile or to prison, killed or driven into the waves of the desert.
But that could change.
"If you suppress people and have no other options except to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopia.
The whole youth is protesting.
One generation protests.
There are numerous complaints covering everything from the land use to the grip on the power of the ruling coalition.
After a widely criticised election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the final seat of the opposition and now control 100% of Parliament.
At the same time the tensions along the border with Eritrea rise; a struggle for this sacred, controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogades, which have been conquered more or less in recent years, will exploit turbulence and be able to rearm.
Several factors explain why the feelings of bitterness after years of preoccupation under the surface are now exploding.
The first seems harmless: smartphones.
Only in recent years have many Ethiopians been able to communicate through social media, as cheaper smartphones have become more and more frequent and Internet services have improved.
Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they are staying.
Several young Ethiopians indicated that they gathered in such a way as to protest.
The second factor is that there is greater solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.
Since the aeons, the Amharas, which come from Ethiopia mainly Christian highlands, have prospered in politics and economics, while exploiting the ormos, of which many are Muslims and live in flat-country areas.
But that's changing, too.
"We are coordinating under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.
The biggest protests took place in areas of Amhara and Oromos.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, which account for about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in military, secret, trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr Meles, a former rebel leader, was 17 years of Ethiopia's Prime Minister until his death in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think of corners.
Analysts say that he was particularly decorated in experiencing early signs of dissatisfaction and using Special Representatives to process opponents and make them harmless.
"The current regime lacks this basic skill," said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, was selected for relatively intransparent reasons to take Mr Meles' position.
Unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray region of North Ethiopia, Mr Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he doesn't enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by Tigray.
Many are afraid that the result will be more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such a rebellion was in 2005, after thousands protested against elections which, according to analysts, were apparently fucked up by the government and then stolen.
During the subsequent razzia many protesters were killed, even if it was less than in the last few months and this time of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, and for their measurable progress in the fight against poverty.
But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the internal misgivings of the Ethiopian Government.
And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters attacked in Gondar, an amharian city, managed by Tigray, and hatred towards Tigray is becoming more and more common in social media.
Analysts say that the protests bring the United States and other Western allies into a strange position.
The American government used Ethiopia as a basis for drone flights over neighbouring Somalia, even though it recently announced that it closed that base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile area.
"This," said Mr Abdi, "is a very thin congratulations migration."
Donald Trump explains his claim Obama had founded ISIS was "Sarcasm"
On Friday, Donald J. Trump tried to disperse the last controversy surrounding his campaign by stating that his repeated claim, President Obama and Hillary Clinton, had not been serious about the "founders" of the Islamic state terrorist group.
This clarification raised new questions about the communication capabilities of the Republicans' presidential candidates, whether they were able to communicate clearly and comprehensively with the American public.
It also brings its counterparts, who are trying to protect him during an eventful phase, into the very position of having to explain statements that he could not have meant at all.
After making the announcement at a campaign event on Wednesday night, Mr. Trump returned on Thursday's allegation and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to announce that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.
But in an early morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was just sarcastic.
The Tweet was the opposite to the previous day when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews he meant the accusation completely serious.
When the conservative radiomodor Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump to weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate didn't want to know about it.
The last storm of criticism is crashing down on Mr. Trump while he tried to focus his campaign on falling surveys on the economic situation.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton spoke about the economic situation in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this topic again.
He warned about Twitter that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring.
Mr. Trump has already presented sarcasm for his defense.
At the end of July he took strong criticism when he said that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he said, "Of course I meant that sarcastic."
This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic boundaries into politics and then to reverse as necessary.
"I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive, and then, where appropriate," clarify "depending on how the reaction fails." said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates.
But I also think he's smart enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.
Instead of dismantling the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has adopted an even more nasty tone as his survey values have continued to decline.
A new survey by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, published on Friday, showed a leadership with great leadership in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.
While Mr. Trump generally tries not to apologize for his provoking statements, he often accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstanding his humor.
But while he has been focusing on the attention of the last few months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump's jokes have brought his loyal fellow strikers into the uncomfortable situation, to have to stand at him, regardless of how provocative his statements may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trump's most prominent speakers, made a great effort to defend the candidates today in a CNN interview from Thursday.
"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments" said Mr. Giuliani, questioned about the correctness of Mr. Trump's statements, whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic state.
It is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown small organization, he called them backbands, completely wrong, and therefore it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Foreign Minister, allowed ISIS to spread by preventing the situation in the Middle East from being aggressively controlled.
Before the election campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and presumed them to ride around on each of his words and to be presumed against him.
He humiliated the "poor, pathetic" TV hexperts trying to understand him and said, "You can't!"
Some of the Democrats spotted Mr. Trump's apology as just another proof that he was inappropriate to the presidential office.
Once pushed over the price from the market, café comes back in Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a scary café in Williamsburg, where you could only pay cash that had no Wi-Fi but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the prices from his Bedford Avenue shop front were pushed out.
The business Soap Cherie, which replaced the Verb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
Local people mourned it as the last loss in a gentrifying city.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is change, but I still can't believe CBGB dead, excluding Chelsea Hotel and Verb is now a soap store."
But if New York is a change, then it's also a new invention.
A revitalized Verb Cafe opened in Greenpoint last November, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same employees and a similar simple atmosphere.
The coffee is still good.
The new owner of the Verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-standing employee of the old café, who is the owner and managing director of the new café.
He started working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.
When a customer offered him to provide money for a new exterior, he was excited to do it, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, kept up a lot.
Verb uses the same distributor for the Bagels bought the same espressomaschine model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment too.
He introduced new ingredients.
There are sandwiches on the menu with bacon and cheese and there are garnitures like capers and sour onions.
There are natural travel boxes.
The café no longer serves beer, for that there are fresh juices.
After nine months, Rodriguez said that he noticed a current to old stem customers.
"Many old customers were also displaced by Williamsburg prices," he said.
Recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.
Oliveira, 34, used to live in Williamsburg and visited the Verb regularly.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she would take her way.
After the verb had closed, she gave up the coffee drink for a while, she said.
"I realized that it was in the coffee and culture that I liked," she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, even if on that day she ordered a blended Chai tea instead of her usual ice coffee, which is another new addition.
Tom Rosenthal has been a long and loyal customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003.
He went there before work and inevitably always ordered the same thing.
"I came four after seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my everything bagel with butter," he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and include new ingredients in the menu.
Nowadays Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he changes his everything bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez said he didn't ruin the fact that the soap business took the old business room.
In fact, the owners of the soap Cherie offered to produce a special soap for verb with the cold-burned coffee of the café as an ingredient.
"I think we're still going to respond to her offer," said Rodriguez.
And the traditional Polish inhabitants Greenpoints have also accepted the café.
A new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said he's planning to issue it soon so that his new neighbours feel welcome.
The site also has further advantages.
A local juicroom wants to fill and sell the cold-burned coffee in the bottle.
There is a chance that the café will expand to a neighbouring building.
For many customers a new verb is sufficient to get their old favourites.
Joseph Witt was a tribe and said he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed.
When the new café opened, Whitt said that entering the local and ordering a new coffee felt like a return home.
"I had to smell this," he said.
The depressing food of the economic crisis in "a rich meal"
In March 1933, shortly after his appointment as president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.
President Roosevelt had a faible for refined Delicateships of Fifth Avenue such as Pâte de foie gras and Maryland waterturtle soup.
His menu on that day was a little more modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, potato puree and a pepper pudding as a dessert.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," Jane Ziegelman said.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to the Americans how to eat."
The couple live in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coes last book "Chop Suey" was about Chinese cuisine in the USA, while Ziegelman tells her book "97 Orchard" about life in a living house on the Lower East Side from the food perspective.
Her latest collaboration, "A decent meal," which will appear on Tuesday in the Harper publisher, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when they met a reporter at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, scratchless ice cream in the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the 1929 Stock Exchange crash.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, turkey with potato puree and vegetable mixture ate.
When the reporter ordered Hackbraten, this considered the couple suitable for a discussion about the food in the era of Great Depression.
"Rich food was very popular," Ziegelman said.
There were peanut bread, liver cheese and beans bread.
They were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap that stretches the ingredient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve as dinner.
Coe smiled.
"It must have been lying in the stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, the table was in an American household, especially in rural areas, an all-you-can-eat buffet.
Women's teams cooked for male field workers and fresh pasta was served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the first World War. "A Square Meal" records the ways with which the country was dealing to no longer be the Slaravia country.
"It was a time when food became a central, tense theme for the Americans," Coe said, "why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Also tense was the new budget diet: mysterious food such as bread and casserollen became basic nutrients that casserolle as a "wonderful way to reuse food remains," Ziegelman noted, since cooks could hide unappetic ingredients under a creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, which was the centre of the American cuisine for years, became a rarely served luxury.
Strange mixtures were tested as a calorie-rich and nutritious satisfaction had priority over taste or even healthy kitchen understanding.
During their research for the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a court from this epoch, baked onions with peanut butter.
"There was no popular addition on lunch," says Coe.
Ziegelmann continues to say, "It was surreal."
Peanut butter and baked onions don't match each other.
It was typical for many of the household recipes.
As never before or ever since, household economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - have so much to do with the eating habits of the country.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "household politicians" and to meet the challenge of turning pamps like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.
"A Square Meal" is a festival of historical leakbits.
In particular, the reports on the government's response to the hungry citizens are tasty, such as President Herbert Hoovers's let-me-cake-food attitude.
As he publicly praised the simple Iowa farm kitchen of his kitchen, he spared like the millionaire man of the world he became.
"He liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce," said Coe.
He ate in an almost gold dining room and wore a smoke.
He was magnificent alien to reality.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not asked him to statuate an example with his stomach.
As described in the book, the hiring of a housekeeper with no interest in flavors by Mrs Roosevelt led the White House to produce the boring food in Washington, but also one of the most trendless prepared. "
Many of the species from the era of the Great Depression to deal with food were thrown away as soon as the country came back on its feet.
The legacy lies on our advanced focus on calories and food, said Ziegelman, as well as on how science was applied to food.
The pair gave to having better understood the eating habits of Ziegelman's mother-in-law when writing the book - for example, how she couldn't throw away food.
"She was really afraid of the waste of food," said Coe.
Ziegelman remembered, "She actually made people sick."
There was the windbag incident.
After the plates were cleaned off at Eisenberg's, they and Coe raised a dessert that they had prepared at home: the plum dessert that President Roosevelt ate at lunch.
"It is called Prune Whip," said Ziegelman and added that it was a common trick to miss modest recipes a good name.
There was no beaten cream, only plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone dipped something reluctantly in a spoon in the tight, brown glibber.
Amazing it didn't taste bad.
Coe picked up three times.
Like a can-do budgeter, he said to his wife, "A few hacked walnuts would help."
Killed by bombing: He was Aleppo's hero
He risked his own life to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar devoted his life to the people of Syria.
He risked everything to save other people's lives.
Now the 30-year-old has died even in an assad regime bust attack.
Omar was a member of the White Helmets, a civil protection group that, according to the picture newspaper, has saved nearly 60,000 people's lives so far.
2900 volunteers put their own lives at risk to pull people out of bombed houses and to provide first aid in the war area.
They are the heroes of war in Syria.
Omar was the group's face: A video of the civil protector, which shows him in the 11-hour rescue of a baby from the ruins of a house, was about the world in 2014.
It made the Syrian a brilliant symbol figure in the grey of war.
But as a hero, he never saw himself, said the picture: "For me this is the real Jihad."
"When I die saving lives, I think God sees a martyr in me."
Shortly before Omar himself fell victim to an attack, he had spoken in a video about the last bombs in Syria.
The helicopters threw four barrel bombs over the Alzadia district, one was filled with chlorine gas.
One woman and two children died, seven people suffer from respiratory distress.
"We now remove the toxic remains of the bomb so that children don't play with it," the picture quotes his last words before he died.
The Assad regime's deadly bomb should have hit terrorists.
Greenland shark: The oldest vertebrae is almost 400 years old
Rare sight.
Greenland sharks usually only come to the surface in winter.
This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the Sanna research ship.
He was born in 1624 and swims with well a 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - so far today.
Greenland shark is only born at 150 years of age.
The Greenland shark swims along the bottom of the North Atlantic, on average in an hour it reaches just 1,220 meters.
Only when it comes to it, the five-metre-long animal speeds up 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal at this maximum speed.
However, this life style, characterised by slowness, seems to be a patent recipe for a high age.
Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" in any case of a Greenland shark that could be 392 years old.
"Awesome," Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock commented on this lifetime, which means a world record for spicy animals.
Although the evolution biologist has long suspected that Greenland shark will become stone-old.
Only the evidence was missing.
Greenland sharks are difficult to observe, eventually they live mainly in the ice lake off the thin-populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitzbergen.
Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear on the surface only in winter.
About the lifestyle of the Greenland shark scientists know little accordingly.
Their time guitar empo made them when they equipped six animals with a transmitter in front of the mountains.
Beute still makes these sharks: In the stomach of an animal scientists found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jaw bone of a young ice bear.
They may hunt sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice cream and search for cadavers that torch down from higher water layers.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now investigated 28 Greenland sharks that caught fishermen in front of Greenland or Spitzbergen from the depths of the North Atlantic between 2010 and 2013.
The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest 502 centimeters were measured.
In order to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed with the carbon 14 method the lens core of the shark.
This centre of eye lens is created before the birth of shark, the protein contained in it is no longer renewed.
The two smallest sharks had noticeably a lot of carbon-14 in the lens core.
Their birth should therefore be after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons attempts slid larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
On the other hand, the lens core contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons attempts with 220 centimeters of length, so it should have celebrated its 50th birthday in its investigation in 2012.
On the other hand, all the larger Greenland sharks had normal carbon 14 quantities in their lens core, resulting from cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
In fact, the carbon 14-clock for a 493 centimeters long Greenland shark showed an age of 335 years, while the record shark with 502 centimeters should be even 392 years old.
It was known that Grönlandhai females will not grow until they are longer than four meters.
Now the researchers of the length were able to assign an age.
Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters was probably at the age of sex maturity and its age was determined at 156 years, Greenland shark is apparently allowed to grow at least one and a half centuries of time.
This too is likely to be the world record for spicy animals.
It is not a coincidence that such methus alemes live mainly in ice waters.
Also the previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale, in whose bacon a 120-year-old harpoon tip on the neck, was captured in front of Alaska.
Through the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on sparkling flames.
So they mature later - and aging slower.
In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals often become particularly large.
Because the volume grows much faster than its surface through which the animal absorbs heat.
The heat loss of a gram of mouse is therefore much greater than with a gram of elephant.
Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.
"A smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should focus on having as early as possible many descendants," explains the evolution biologist Scheuerlein.
A very large animal, on the other hand, should invest its resources in a long life.
Construction area in double pack
The municipal council has focused on the issues surrounding construction at the recent meeting.
With ease, the board noted the announcement by Mayor Robert Putz that "finally the marketing of the newly identified residential areas can begin."
After clarification of land, parcel and exploration questions and applications for measurement were made, the sale of land in the residential areas "road road" and "Schönau-West" (Binderstraße section 1) is no longer an obstacle to interested parties.
The municipal council is convinced that the areas in the rural and quiet community of Schönau address young families as well as tougher seniors equally.
As it was said, construction volunteers can report to the town hall immediately, the municipal council is expected to advise at its September meeting on the award of the parcels.
In order to be able to respond to requests for the establishment of other industrial establishments linked to job creation, the Municipality Council decided to change the plan for land use in sub-sectors, which was newly established in the spring of this year.
In the field of undertime larn, the industrial area already identified there is extended by two parcels towards the State Road 2112.
Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
The city am Main therefore has the best opportunities in competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg to attract relocated jobs and companies from London.
"It is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Brexit vote," says Michael Voigtländer, head of the field of competence financial markets and real estate markets of the IW.
After the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether money houses may continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU.
The so-called EU passport has so far been admissible in the UK.
It's using big US banks right now.
Several banks have already announced moving jobs.
The Frankfurt Main Finance Lobby Association expects 10000 new jobs on Main within five years.
For Frankfurt, according to the IW, the seat of the European Central Bank (ECB) speaks, unites responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks of the euro area, as well as other important authorities such as the European Insurance Supervision EIOPA and the ESRB Risk Board.
Although the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has its headquarters in Paris, it is less important for the financial sector than the ECB.
"The proximity to the bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervisor," says IW-Professor Voigtländer.
Although Luxembourg has a large fund sector, it is more difficult to cut down in infrastructure, as well as Dublin.
Frankfurt would be much easier to reach thanks to the large airport.
The city also points with easy-to-use commercial property.
"In Paris it is not so easy to find free high-quality offices," Voigtländer says.
On the Seine are also the rentals for first-class commercial real estate by 50 percent higher than at the Main.
In addition, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime.
In a ranking of Mercer's corporate consultancy, the city is on place seven, Luxembourg on place 19, Dublin on place 33 and Paris on site 37.
Although quality of life is a matter of preference: "With its already strong position as a financial location for the European internal market, Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors," the IW follows.
In spite of Brexit's vote, however, London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe, according to the economic researchers.
This is also the case with the power relationships: in London, according to figures from the Landesbank Helaba, around 144000 people worked in the banking sector at the end of 2015, in Frankfurt there were 62500 people.
Gilead receives legal costs from the hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
A US official judge decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to reimbursement of the legal costs incurred by the Hepatits C dispute with the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was exempted from a compensation of $200 million for the violation of two patents of Merck, which were associated with the Blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni of Gilead, after an American judge discovered a pattern of malconduct by Merck, including the opinion and other unethical acts.
At the hearing of the lawsuit on Thursday, US judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead has the right to discharge the costs incurred during the defence of the case.
Merck tries to treat Gilead, which dominates the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013 when Gilead and Merck accused each other and took possession of laboratory work based on sofosbuvir, the active substance in Gilead's medicines.
United States-supported troops say that they have recovered full control of Manbij from the Islamic State
The United States-supported troops have recovered full control over the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters in the city left them, said a speaker of the group on Friday.
The democratic forces of Syria (DKS) now come through the city after the withdrawal of the remaining group of fighters who have buried within the city.
They have freed over 2,000 civilians who were held hostage by the fighters, Sharfan Darwish informed the Manved Military Council of Reuters, associated with the DKS.
"The city is now under full control, but we are just doing refreshments," he told Reuters.
Clintons earn 10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2% of federal taxes
Hillary Clinton published her tax statement for 2015 on Friday, which produced an income of USD 10.75 million for the presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2%.
In 2015, Clinton spent USD 1 million for charitable purposes, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton generated nearly USD 5.3 million in speech fees; the former Foreign Minister gave an income of USD 3 million from the publisher Simon & Schuster for her book on her term of office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Clinton's candidate for the vice-president, Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia, published his tax declarations together with his wife Anne Holton over the last ten years.
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards on financial transparency," Clinton's campaign helper Jennifer Palmieri announced in an opinion.
Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and retreats with regard to his previous promises to publish his tax declarations.
It is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations, although they are not required by law.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have indicated a tax check by the tax authorities as a reason for his refusal.
"They are on the train," wrote Clinton's campaign assistant Ian Sams on Twitter, regarding the publication of the presidential candidate of the Democrats.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump's special consultant, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish something before the tax checks are completed.
Trump's critics, including the Republican presidential candidate of 2012 Mitt Romney, have already made alleged that his refusal raises questions about assets, his donations to charitable organisations, his business habits and various other links, especially with Russia.
Clinton has already crashed on the subject and released a video on the Internet on Friday, in which high ranks of Republican Trump ask to publish his tax declaration.
On Thursday, she also spoke on the subject during a speech on the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in the last decades and to publish his tax declarations." She said to the crowd.
Politico has reported that Trump has paid no or very little taxes for two years during the 1990s, and an economic journalist from the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advisers on Friday, indicating that this could still be the case.
Federal taxes have become a subject in the campaign.
Clinton supports a scheme named after the billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, which would ensure that people who earn more than USD 1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30%.
President Obama also supports the proposal.
During a campaign event for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska called upon Buffett, whose seat is Berkshire Hathaway Industrial Conglomerate, to attend a meeting to exchange their tax declarations.
Buffett said that he was also subjected to an IRS tax check and Trump was "afraid" of the voters and not of the tax authorities.
Clinton's campaign has published tax declarations back to 2007.
The Clintons now living in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average effective federal tax rate of about 32% between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5%.
The 2015 Clinton tax statement showed that it only received USD 100 of its income as a wage, unlike most of all Americans.
Its main money facility was a cost-effective index fund from which Clinton's dividends and revenues of USD 109.000 were taxed.

Condoms with chilipuder, fireworks promote Tanzanias Elephant Protection
Natural protectors in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to prevent elephants from going into settlements inhabited by people - they throw condoms on them that are filled with chilipuder.
The method has proved to be effective and the Honeyguide Foundation, which had the idea of it years ago, has intensified its promotion together with US nature protection by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a violent four-stage method to protect their houses and harvest without damaging animals.
Previously, many spears used to defend themselves.
Friday is World Telephone Day dedicated to animal welfare.
"Since we have developed this... Toolkit, we have been able to observe within these communities a change in their attitude, while they are much more confident that they can stop the elephants from their fields without damaging the elephants," the Managing Director of Honeyguide Damian Bell said in a communication.
The first two steps include lighting the elephant with a torch and blowing into a horn.
If it is not frightened, a so-called "chilicloud" is thrown.
Chilipuder mixed with earth is packed together with a fireworks body into a condom whose end is turned up to the ignition line.
When it is lit, the condom will blow up with a bump and spray fine dust on chilipuder into the air.
A hook usually already out to hunt the elephant.
One last option is a thrower that shoots a gold fireworks in the air, causing a loud, bright explosion.
City Council decides unanimously: No kiosk reconstruction on St. Goarer Rheinofer
Normally, the St. Goarer investment projects of commercial operators with Kusshand are considered to be clearly expanding in the core city.
However, the city council now unanimously rejected the request for the new construction of a sales ski at the Rheinufer in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine Balcony.
"In principle, we welcome new commercial operators, but at this location in an exposed position on the Rhine River, this kiosk does not fit," said Michael Hubrath on behalf of the CDU Group.
Jewish director breaks Berlin Hotel because Israeli Dialcode was removed after "Arabic" invitation - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots unveiled a media rebellion after he had told that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list any Israeli predecessors, as it had "requested" Arabic guests according to a staff member.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary "Shoah" released his trouble at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel's country preference list.
However, the country was not listed between the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible that Israel was eliminated and deleted in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, Kempinksi Bristol offers an opportunity to choose Israel via its own call center.
After an explanation searching, the director turned to the hotel reception.
The answer he received there was "shocked him," as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel employee said that the measure is a "deliberate decision of the management of Kempinski hotels."
The reason behind it was even more rage in the director.
"Most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the dictionary be deleted," the staff of Lanzmann was quoted.
The Israeli ambassador in Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a "great disgrace," reports the South German newspaper.
We were shocked and disappointed by this event.
That's really embarrassing.
The fact that this has occurred in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even more shameful.
That doesn't require an explanation.
We expect the hotel to "draw the right conclusions," the official said.
The incident triggered a pretty big resonance on the Internet, where people called it a scandal.
Some said to the Kempinski Hotel that it would have "responded to the alleged invitations of Arab guests."
"Shame on you," it was said in another post that pointed out that the hotel located on the noble Kurfürstendamm is close to a synagogue.
The hotel quickly rejected all accusations and called the incident an "accident" and "apologized" at Lanzmann, reports the mirror.
"There was never a direct instruction" not to include Israel in the quick list, "the South German newspaper quoted a spokesman of the Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the country code has now been added.
Police use tear gas & rubber shoots against protesting Brazilian students
Students joined the police on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo, when they gathered to demonstrate against the government's reform of the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber shots against the demonstrators.
The difficulties began when police officers tried to tear up the students, which led the police to use rubber shoots and tear gas.
Several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their disgrace over the plans.
According to the suggestions of the Governor of the state of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, slightly less than 100 public schools are closed, while 300,000 students are being implemented to save money.
Some of the protest participants saw Graffitits spraying against the provisional President Michel Temer on walls.
The recent protests occurred a few days after demonstrators went on the streets to support the suspended President Dilma Rousseff, who had been dismissed by a Senate's vote for their dismissal from the office.
Trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71% - RT business
With the abolition of sanctions, according to the Russian ambassador in Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, the annual trade turnover between Moscow and Teheran increased by 70.9 per cent.
Since the international sanctions against Iran have been abolished, Russian companies' interest in business in the country has increased greatly, the Ambassador informed.
Russian companies have existing links with Iran, while new companies are willing to access the market.
Of course, further trade expansion is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran, "said Dzhagaryan.
He noted that trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 per cent in the first five months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and was $856 million.
In particular, Russian imports to Iran increased by 91.5 percent and amounted to 697 million dollars.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The recovery of trade has been achieved through the supply of machinery, land vehicles and weapons, "the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan assumes a record of Iranian tourists in Russia for this year.
Last year, the Russian foreign representative issued some 35,000 visas, primarily travel visas, to Iranian citizens.
Iran also reached the top 20 of the countries with regard to the number of tourists in Russia.
One could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year were broken, "he said.
At the same time, only relatively few Russians visit Iran, something which the ambassador hopes will change.
"I personally can recommend the visit of the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, who have received monuments of ancient Persian civilization in a good condition," he said.
Witnesses searched: Beverage market robbed in woodbread
A robbery took place on Thursday night on the drink market of Rewe XXL at the forest broler Gerberstraße.
Under the pretext of a gun, three dark dressed people who had mocked their faces asked the staff of the drinking market to issue cash and then escaped first on foot and then probably with a silver-colored VW golf.
How much money has been exploited, the police won't let you know.
The perpetrators were supposed to have been between 1.60 and 1.70 meters, so relatively small.
The beverage market is accessible directly from the park deck of the rewe market and is badly visible.
After the robbery towards Gerberstraße, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg, the perpetrators must be run away from the parking lot located opposite the entrance to the parking house with the silver-colored car, possibly towards B 256 (Sladernring).
Anyone who has made observations at the time of the crime (at 7.45 p.m.) in connection with the robbery should immediately report to the police.
Nagold: Game and fun at summer vacation
Eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and adolescents of the social pedagogical daily group / social group work of the Nagold family with their guardians on their summer leave in Nussdorf, near Mühlacker.
In the quiet recreation of Hardtwäldle, the life-happy group was quartered during the first school holiday week.
Several full-day excursions were on the program.
On the one hand, it went to Bretten with the visit of the string zoo.
On the other hand, to Maulbronn, where there was a special children's guidance in the world-famous monastery.
The third trip led to Pforzheim.
In the Keltenmuseum in Hochdorf, the group learned a lot about everyday life and the food of the Celts.
On the hot days, the group at the deep sea in Maulbronn was enjoyed, which invited to jump, swim and plank.
Culinary children and caregivers were spoiled with their self-prepared body food such as the Sure Spätzle, the Seebronner Phenne, Iselshauser-Bloff, the English-Breakfast and Tübinger Bolognese.
In workshops, a handsome piece of jewellery was created from pearls and stones or made of wood a Roman mill game.
Other highlights of leisure were fishing in a nearby pond, the evening at the fire and the final "Colorful Evening."
On the day of the journey the sun laughed and the children and adolescents returned home satisfactorily.
Haigerloch: Pilgrims to the Gate of Mercy
The ministrants from the Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna seal care unit were on their way on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.
Four stages were managed together.
In order to bridge the time to the next Romwall journey of all ministers in two years, the Supreme Council of St. Anna has decided to prepare and implement a multi-day pilgrimage.
Several pilgrimage goals were examined and finally decided for the Bishops of Freiburg, where a special pilgrimage was required this year at the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy with the doors of Mercy opened for this purpose at the Freiburger Münster.
16 Minis of the brothel, Gruol, Haigerloch, and holy rooms went on the way.
In the evening before, Reverend Storost sent the pilgrims at a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrimage and gave the pilgrimage blessing.
From Horb on, a train was driven to the starting point of Villingen, where also a coin of Our Dear Lady stands and thus the pilgrimage of the coin was taken by the coin.
The individual day tours were surrounded in the morning and evening each by a short impulse with different prayers, songs and fonts.
But also on the way, the Minis made a lot of field crosses, chapels or churches again and again to sing a song of specially assembled pilgrimage.
For the nights there were parish homes of the local parish.
At the stage goals, Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a tasty and strong dinner and breakfast.
The second day went over Furtwangen to Gütenbach.
On the next day, the stage to St. Peter, which was the toughest route, had to first descend around 500 meters of heights and then be cleaned again.
The earned reward was a common barbecue at the bathtub in the evening.
After the morning impulse on the fourth pilgrimage day in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter, it went to the final stage to Freiburg.
Visually facilitated and happy the Minis arrived later in the afternoon at the Freiburger Münster and passed through the gates of mercy.
With a small impulse, God was thanked here.
At the evening fair in Münster, the Minis arrived at the pilgrimage by Kooperator Markus Obert was welcomed.
After the service of God, the pilgrims were able to visit the Sakristei and the high altar.
The next day was still time for the Breisgaumetropolis.
In the afternoon, it went back by train to Horb.
Finally, all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were characterised.
Scotch Callum Skinner storms home when British gold blows for cycling
Scotland's Callum Skinner rested last night in the men's team sprint in the Velodrom in Rio to glory when the British team defended the title of London 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor role that his countryman Sir Chris Hoy had made himself own. The Jepund made the legend proud when he stormed home to conquer a victory of the favorites of New Zealand.
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy picked up the fifth of six Olympics medals.
They repeated the trick after getting a modest sixth place at the London Railway World Championships in March, despite the resignation of Hoys.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of driver Jamie Staff.
They did this in time as a hint.
Hoy's retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.
Skinner was the man they stayed with when they saw potential in the Scotland that has now evolved.
On the other hand, Kenny - who won with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner put an Olympic record in the qualification rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealand won in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel with gold.
After his round, the team was close back, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.
A change of strategy made up a large part of the transformation, where the hinder drove in a higher course to slow him down and enable Kenny and especially Skinner to keep the pace.
Hoy looked from his position as an BBC expert and noticed Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they climbed on the podium.
The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said, "It's a flattering comparison."
I'm just here to do my best and make myself a name.
In the final round, we set up an Olympic chord and defeated the world champions.
It was just incredible.
There is no better way to win this.
After the triumph of 2012 on Kennys and Hoys, he admitted that after a weak start he deliberately fell on the track.
He later withdrew this statement and there was no objection from England's rivals.
In such a surprising victory, there was no such problem this time.
Behind said, "It feels like the whole GB flags on the tribune like London."
We've been together in the last three months as a team.
We got away so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympic Games.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation that was won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and in London.
If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, that expects us to succeed five days in Velodrom.
With the form Kennys it is possible that he repeats Hoy's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.
This would mean for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (an apparently holy date for British sports; on that day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a exploitation of six gold medals and a silver medal.
That's what Hoy would be like.
Kenny is next to the sprint, which begins today and will go for three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I'm just enjoying this for the moment."
The team event is always best.
You can win it with your colleagues.
It feels lonely to win alone.
Behind said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight."
It was the only medal contest of the day, but there were other good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-mile race.
They arrived at the target in 3: 51,942.
The world record, which won in 2012 in London Gold, was at 3: 51,659.
The first and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will certainly be in focus.
He had argued with officers yesterday before qualification, when functionaries called him to measure his body size.
Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in World Record Time in 4: 13,260 in the corresponding women's competition, which will be continued and ended tomorrow.
The GB team relies on its strong track wheel team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to get a set of medals.
After a truly extraordinary presentation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, expectations for Rio were reduced.
Dramas was played in the background, so the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April in the midst of sexism and mobbing accusations as well as the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, when you look at the first night of the competition in Velodrom, it looks like the now legendary reputation of GBs, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, could be repeated again.
Future of Portland's melting due to the abolition of energy
The future of the aluminium melting of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - is at stake, as the operator terminates the energy supply contract and will thus abolish all supply contracts as the supplier informed the energy company.
This step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year not to grant any further subsidies for the operation of the plant.
A 20-year subsidy will expire in November.
Up to 2000 jobs at Alcoa's site in Portland are at stake.
Not less than 2000 jobs - directly and indirectly - could be at risk of closure.
In addition, domino effects could occur as the melting industry consumes about 10 percent of the total generation of electricity Victorias.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry melting, which led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoa's melting in Portland loses money and risks closing.
This step follows the years of speculation regarding the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the electricity price for the plant.
AGL, which supplies the large aluminum melting with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that it is expected that three more owners will terminate their contracts.
The plant is owned by the majority of a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.
"AGL assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means a further physical demand for electricity by the melting industry," the company informed.
AGL continued to state that the contracts are so-called "collateral transactions" which should have entered into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so they will end in 2017.
"Therefore AGL assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenue in the financial year 17," the electricity supplier said.
All potential effects on revenues on AGL from GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong termination markets for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL informed that it had already written down the value of the contracts in its annual financial statements of $187 million in "expectation of termination."
Alcoa said that the decision to cancel the contracts does not affect the ability of Alcoas to operate the melting or to ensure electricity supply to the melting industry.
The US company said that it had concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which should have entered into force from November this year, even if it still owes an explanation why it withdrew from the contract.
Analysts warn about the possible closure of the Portland melting plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the bad economic conditions of the industry.
In reference to the statements of analysts at the beginning of the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland consumes about 600 megawatts and tomago every year about 900 megawatts of electricity.
If both plants disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [electricity market].
And it would not be good for us as a power generator, "he said.
More than just a Kardashian reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September edition of Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner Clan Kris is on the cover of the desired September edition of the US Vogue.
Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder, ran on the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced on Thursday the news on her Instagram account.
"In a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover made me cry," Kendall wrote.
The discovery of the cover followed a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians similar?), scripted reality video that shows the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (with the exception of the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn as well as in the presence of the world's most popular showbiz uncles and producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest) as she forgot the cover of her sister and ending with a classic turn: they all planned a surprise party.
This represents the cliché-conscious act almost every birthday episode of a child's show (Seacrest put the phrase, "You thought we'd forgotten you?" with the honesty of a cartoon canine in a broadcast at 8: 00 a.m.), but Kris had to let her other girls participate in this publicity somehow.
With regard to the Vogue's September edition, a new era of the Kardashians has certainly begun.
Kendall's great sister Kim likes to beat her about the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were on it in April 2014), but the cover of the September edition of the magazine is a league for themselves.
The September edition is the most sold edition of the year for Vogue.
With a size that is more similar to a picture band than a fashion magazine, the edition attracts a large number of advertisers (according to Fashionista were from the 832 pages of the forest 615 pages advertising).
The discovery of his cover star is expected to be so seemingly that in the last two years pictures of the magazine were searched before the official announcement.
Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years there have been clearly more "celebrities, models" than "models that are celebrities" on the cover.
Oscar prize winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga was honored.
But even with the small chance that Mrs Jenner - which is described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls under the former category, she is in good society.
These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or teenagers of today who know how to make a good snapchat video (even if all of this applies to Jenner).
They are really talented women who are distinguished in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade.
Of course, Jenner's success doesn't like everyone.
With her reality TV story, Jenners' position in the fashion world was always a bit tense.
In June, the lonely Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized and called her "the bitches of the moment."
These feelings boiled up again when the message with the appearance of Jenners came out on the Vogue Cover.
But riding around on the misery seems to be going on at the point.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the Vogue September edition.
She's a supermodel in the real sense of the word.
She's running for Marc Jacobs.
She's making advertising for your foundation of Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters sell pictures of themselves on their respective Paywall apps.
She sold her pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to the magazine LOVE.
And in her leisure time she is in reality TV. Probably just to see her sister Kourtney and her children.
Municipal law centres declare 160,000 people annually
More than 160,000 of the country's most helpful ones are annually rejected by the municipal law centres, while the sector is concerned with the impact of further reductions in funds on already overloaded transactions.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly elderly people, immigrants, needy workers, victims of violence and those who do not have funds for unjust delocation and similar - are already denied their request for free legal advice and legal assistance.
Legal services of the municipality, which are already overloaded, are ready for further reductions.
From June next year, these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal resources.
The director of Queesland James Farrell's community justice centres said that the last survey of the National Association of Municipal Law Centres showed that thousands of people are already rejected every year.
Farrell said that the situation would only get worse without a revocation of the federal government's decision.
"Queensland's community law centres are chronically underfunded, which means that thousands of people of important services you need are rejected," he said.
People who leave violent relationships, people with incomprehensible and oppressive debts, families that go through separations, workers who were unjust dismissed - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot receive the help they need.
From June 2017, the federal government will reduce the funds by 30 percent, which means that thousands of people in need of help from Queensland will be forced to deal with their legal problems without any help.
We call on the Federal Attorney General and the Federal Minister of Justice, as well as the Senators of Queensland George Brandis, to abolish these cuts immediately so that people can receive the help they need in legal problems.
Last year, the national government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of community law centres and their customer communities and to invest Palaszczuk in this important work.
Donald Trump Prosecutor's campaign after the employee allegedly pulled a gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was charged with alleged inactivity after she was told that her campaign leader for North Carolina had directed a gun to a employee in February while they were on their way in a jeep in February.
The incident is described in an indictment written by Vincent Bordini, a former software programmer for the campaign in this state on Wednesday at the State Court of Charlotte.
Bordini announced that he had waited for months that the matter would be settled internally before he realized that "this would not happen."
The campaign leader, Earl Philip, "pulled a gun, put his right finger on the trigger, and hit the race in Vincent's kneekehle," Bordini announced in his charge.
After complaining at the local and regional campaign leadership, Bordini found that at least four other people had already made the same experience with Phillip, he announced in the indictment.
"Arms don't have to be fired to cause damage," Bordini said.
The accusation comes only two days after the Republican presidential candidate triggered an upheaval when he said to a crowd in North Carolina that the Second Amendment People should take action if his rival Hillary Clinton is elected and the judge should be appointed.
Trump's campaign made it clear that the media had ripped his words out of the context and that he would not encourage violence.
Bordini's complaint requires damages from the campaign for violation of custody and Philip for body injury and persistent mental damage.
Trumps Pressepreacher Hope Hicks was not available for an opinion.
Attempts to contact Philip also failed.
WCCB, a local news station in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer a member of the campaign.
Call at his consulting company, Innovative Consulting Services, has not been responded.
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has so far run a controversial campaign.
The procedure is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Supreme Court, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Berlin / Schwerin: Survey before country elections: losing SPD and CDU
During the forthcoming elections in the Länder Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (4 September) and Berlin (18 September), there are significant losses for the government partners SPD and CDU.
This resulted in representative surveys of INSA opinion research institute for the "picture" newspaper (Friday).
While the red-black government coalition could barely continue to rule in the north, this is not possible according to the survey values in Berlin.
In both Länder, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and would thus have a good chance to continue presenting the Head of Government.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD dropped from 35,6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.
According to the survey, the party was only close to the CDU, which could return to 23 percent.
The third place is disputed between the left and the AfD.
The left would be 19 percent (before 18.4 percent), and AfD would represent 19 percent for the first time in the countryside.
In spite of light losses, the Greens return to the Schweriner Landtag with 6 percent (previously 8.7 percent).
NPD and FDP would not be represented in the country day with 3 per cent each.
According to the survey, the SPD would only reach 23 per cent (2011 election: 28.3 per cent).
The CDU reached only 18 percent after 23.4 percent.
It was still behind the Greens with 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but before the left with 15 percent (before 11.7 percent).
The AfD would be represented by 14 per cent in the House of Representatives for the first time.
At 5 percent, the FDP could hope for a return that the pirates would miss the entry in contrast to 2011.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: The first smartphone
E-mail and Internet in time lupe: 20 years ago the Nokia Communicator came to the market.
The successor today dominates the world - his manufacturer experienced a disaster.
The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.
It was thicker and bigger, so it wasn't good in the hand either.
On the contrary, it was pretty clumsy.
The built-in memory was at first eight megabytes, which would be enough today for about two selfies with high resolution.
An iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.
The Nokia 9000 Communicator came to business exactly 20 years ago, on 15 August 1996 - and it was the first smartphone.
For a few euros lovers can still buy the devices on the Internet, but they are somehow from the stone time of the Internet age.
However, 20 years ago, the Communicator was a sensation.
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the Cebit Computer Fair in Hannover as an office in the Western pocket format.
In fact, the new mobile phone could be sent and received a lot for then standards: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, also by fax was the communicator to be reached.
Even the access to websites was possible via HTML browser, though tormenting slowly.
A pocket computer was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a small antenna, and the phone could be folded like a laptop.
Then there was a small keyboard and a black-and-white screen.
Pretty proud was the price: 2700 D-Mark, so about 1400 Euro.
The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.
In August 1996, no one knew that the communicator would be the beginning of the smartphone era.
Everything's been different since then.
The smart phones are a success story, though not for Nokia.
The Finns' mobile parts experienced an unprecedented disaster, was finally sold and settled to Microsoft.
The market is dominated today by suppliers who all came much later than Nokia.
Always and everywhere online, this is today for a lot of people everyday.
In 2015, there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide.
About 1.4 billion devices were sold, Samsung and Apple alone account for 555 million pieces.
Global sales of equipment are around 400 billion euros.
This includes the well-running business of the countless app providers and the telecommunications companies.
A whole industry has now emerged around the smartphone.
The decisive breakthrough to the mass market came only in early 2007, then Apple Chief Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the iPhones on Mac World.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a phone and an Internet communicator, everything easily to use by touch screen.
Apple's victory began, yet today the iPhone is the most important product of the group.
Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who dominated the market, had the reckoning.
They finally disappeared, Blackberry has to fight.
The command now has Apple and Asian providers like Samsung.
The smartphone is self-understandable 20 years after its invention.
In average, every German now looks at his cell phone 88 times a day.
"We all need to learn to put the smartphone away," Janina Kugel said just now, in the Siemens board responsible for staff.
Permanent accessibility is now regarded as a curse and blessing at the same time.
England must guide the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London, but throughout the country.
For me, this was the biggest attraction to Heathrows, just as in 2012 in London, when we did a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games.
The Olympics brought great benefits for Stratford and the East End.
And that will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for locals and companies close to Heathrow.
For our local communities alone, we will already create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment.
As they were ahead of us in London 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of enlargement Heathrows is too great.
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will embarrass ourselves on the world stage.
The twins were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong at Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcoming, but Heathrow answers every question he has asked.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many and not for individuals.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion in scientific growth and a legacy of skills and jobs to leave both the airport and the whole of the UK.
We have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion expensive infrastructure investment programme in time and budget, from T5 - which was elected five years later to the world's best airport terminal, until the T2, which was built in the middle of the two most frequent moves in the world.
Now they are ready to deliver a third step, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment.
The 2012 London Games were a great success for GB and I am confident that the enlargement of Heathrow will also be one.
It is time for us to guide this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, thereby securing our future trade and creating a legacy of skills and jobs that England can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook in the "cat and mouse game" regarding display blockage
For companies who make money with online advertising, one of the software manufacturers says that attempts to handle display blockage are the same as a "cat and mouse game."
On Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that it would block display blocks on his desktop page, Adblock Plus published a blog post in which it announced that users could update their filters in the program to reblock advertising in the social network.
On Tuesday Facebook informed that his desktop page would change the encoding regarding his advertisements to make it difficult to detect advertisements detecting which part of the page advertising is.
But Adblock announced that there was a new way to circumvent the new codes.
In a blog post, the spokesman of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of Hin and Her struggle between the blocking open source community and the surrounding community has been going on since the invention of display blockers," and that it is possible that Facebook soon comes with a new solution.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has joined the struggle is a strong indication of how worrying the industry has become scoreblockers.
According to a study from last year of Pagefair and Adobe around 200 million people use advertisement blockers worldwide; almost four times as much in 2013.
With 1,03 billion active users per day accessing Facebook via their mobile terminal devices, mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of the advertising revenue of Facebook.
The company has it off display blockers on desktop PCs, as mobile display blockers have no effect on Facebook's mobile app for the social network and Instagram, a spokesperson informed.
Advertising on desktop PCs accounts for a sufficient proportion of revenue, so Facebook seems to be worth investing such a step.
On Tuesday Facebook announced that it would update its "scoreboard preferential tool" to have people more control over targeted advertising.
On Thursday Facebook claimed that Adblock's new filters would be worrying because they would also block content on the page that is not advertising.
"For users this is not a positive experience, so we plan to address the problem," a spokesperson from Facebook informed in an email message.
Display blockers are a stubborn means, so instead we have focused on developer tools such as ad preferences to put more control in the hands of people.
Running a woman in suspected suicide on the Swiss highway
The victim was on the highway in the middle of the night.
The police call witnesses after a woman was hit in the early hours of the morning on Thursday in a suspected suicide by several vehicles on a motorway.
The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Waadt shortly after midnight.
A woman lay in the dark "in an act of despair" on the street and was hit by several cars, the police said in Waadt.
It is obvious that a Swiss woman aged 49, who was overrun by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill herself.
She died on site.
Several drivers have already been heard, but some have still not been identified, the police who asked them and any witnesses of the incident to report.
An investigation procedure was opened, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter informed Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed.
Was a collapse avoidable?
This is something the prosecutor has to decide, "said Hofstetter.
Two similar cases over the last five years show that drivers are not being held responsible.
In each of the two cases - in which one person ran in the dark on the motorway - it was decided that the drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian runs on the motorway in the middle of the night, as it was called in the newspaper.
Last year, a policeman of negligible killing was released after she had hit and killed a man who was on the A1 in August 2014 near Payerne.
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and has become unconscious on the street, heard the court.
The court found that the policeman - who had responded to an emergency call - drove in a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a "completely exceptional and unforeseeable situation," the judge said.
Anyone who has more information on the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to the police under number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44 44.
NASA Climate Model: Venus was once habitable
According to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably once living.
Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of the NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers.
The model was designed to determine whether the Venus could once have established soil-like conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere.
Scientists have previously pointed out that the slow turn of the Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that the Venus could have had a thin, soil-like atmosphere and still slowly moved on.
The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.
The planet probably had more dry areas than the earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to preserve life and protect from rapid evaporation.
The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.
"In the GISS model simulation the slow turn of the Venus expresses its daily side of the sun for almost two months," said GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which works like a umbrella to protect the surface from a large part of the solar heat.
The result is average temperatures which are some degrees cooler than those of the Earth today.
The model produced a history of Venus, which is similar to evolution presumed by planetary scientists.
Although it was probable once, the Venus - over more than billions of years - was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.
Their oceans were diluted and their water vapour was burned away from the ultraviolet light.
When their hydrogen depleted, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect remained behind -- the Venus that we know today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus Climate Model in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy returns as a coach of the Avalanche
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday as a coach and Vice President of Hockey Operations of the Colorado Avalanche and introduced too little participation in the team's decision-making process.
Alternate President / General Manager of the Colorados Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will seek a new trainer immediately.
"Over the last three years, I have fulfilled my duties as chief coach and Vice President of Hockey Operations of the Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," Roy, 50-year-old, expressed his opinion.
I've been thinking a long time and a lot about how I could improve this team to give him more depth, this needs it and bring it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the vision of the coach and Vice President of Hockey Operations must be perfectly matched to that of the organization.
He must also have a right to participate in decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me about this decision today," said Sakic.
We all appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future.
During his debut season, Roy was awarded the Avalanches 2013-14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Awards as the best coach of the league.
He led the club to 112 points and to the first place in Central Vision, but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the playoffs of Minnesota and missed the afterseason in each of the last two years.
The Avalanches recorded a 39-39-4 brand in the 2015-16 season and fell behind the game for a second Wildcard spot at the Western Conference by five points.
As Hall of Fame Torwart Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea Oil Workers Recording Discussions, Discussion
The work struggles on remuneration for North Sea oil workers are suspended, while all the parties sit at the table for a new round of talks, said negotiating leaders.
Strikes against the Wood Group oil field service provider were carried out sporadically on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group as well as the Unite and RMT trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the resolution process of the current dispute," it says in a joint statement.
We will hold a few full-day meetings in the coming weeks, which will begin at the beginning of next year to address the problems again.
The trade unions said that their last strike, which is the first in over 25 years, is a protest against possible wage reductions of up to 30 percent.
This year, Wood Group has reduced the rates to its contractors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure.
The reduction in the rating of the company follows a 10% decrease for onshore contractors in 2014.
The company said that additional reductions give the company the space needed to get through the market deviation.
For its part, Shell has released thousands of people and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas business in up to 10 countries, as it rationalizes its business as a result of its Mega merger with the UK Energy Company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure because of the lower crude oil prices, an economic situation which had been strengthened by the British decision to leave the European Union in June.
The Scottish Parliamentary Member Dave Anderson met with workers' leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest work disputes that had taken place in the North Sea for a generation.
The North Sea is important for the regional economy, he said.
"In the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy that works for many and not only for few," he said in a statement.
In 2016, less than $1.4 billion of spending on new projects in the North Sea is expected compared to average about $7 billion in the last five years.
Kepler measures rotation rate of stars in the star bunch of plejades
The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalogue of rotation rates among the stars of the Plejades.
The new data helps astronomers to understand why stars rotate to different rates in the star hook and in what context the rotation periods are with the planet's emergence.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other stars, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.
The pejades are located 445 light years away from the earth.
Many stars in this star bunch, which arose about 125 million years ago, now reach the adult age.
They're turning the fastest now.
At peak rotation rates, these mature stars exhibit large amounts of star winds.
As these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.
When a star ages, its rotation rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a visible star spot - like sunshine -.
The latest catalogue of rotation rates indicates that more massive stars turn slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars with dancers, with larger stars turning slower pirouettes than smaller.
"In the" ballet "of the Plejaden we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, while faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," Rebull said.
Since the temple of the Plejaden is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotation rates.
"The plajaden star pile offers an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," Rebull said.
We still have a lot to learn about, like how, when and why stars slow down their rotation rates and, in other words, hang their "dance shoes."
Rebull and her colleagues reported in three newspaper reports on their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the Plejaden, which will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal.
A controversial baseball star goes off
The tears ran faster with Alex Rodriguez than the US baseball star in best days from base to base.
After his emotional resignation, the 41-year-old professional on August 12 against Tampa Bay Rays will last wear the tricot of his New York Yankees.
"I love this game and this team."
"I say goodbye to both," explained the 14-time All-Star Game Participant of the Major League Baseball (MLB).
Rodriguez was chosen three times as the most valuable player in the League, and in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yankees.
His signature under a 10-year contract has given him 27 million dollars a year since 2007.
Until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017, he will be a consultant and youth coach - with full salary.
As a player, Rodriguez paid back for a long time with performance.
With 696 Homeruns, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his team ("Runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994-2000), the Texas Rangers (2001-2004) and since 2005 he created some milestones.
With the Hall-of-Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two other baseball players have similar values in the main statistics.
However, the 41-year-old should not be included in the baseball hall.
Because so successful Rodriguez - nickname "A-Rod" - was on the field, so controversial is his appearance outside the square.
Already in 2009, the Superstar admitted to taking steroids prohibited between 2001 and 2003 at ESPN.
In August 2013, he was blocked for 211 lots by the end of 2014 due to a process in the so-called biogenesis scandal.
Rodriguez is considered to have been the main suspect of having received benefits for years through an anti-aging clinic in South Florida.
After a dispute, the barrier was reduced to 162 meetings.
"The league could even have done me a favor for 2014, because I played 20 years without a break," said Rodriguez at that time addictive.
Even his resignation days don't run out of noise.
While many baseball legends get the big stage again in their last games, Rodriguez often had to sit on the bank.
"My job does not include a departure tour."
"My job includes trying to win every game," yankees coach Joe Girardi pissed.
After all, Rodriguez, who was married to the actress Cameron Diaz, was denied the relationship with Popstar Madonna and actress Kate Hudson, sympathy to the fans of the Yankee Archrival Boston Red Sox.
"We want A-Rod," the followers sang at the 4: 9 defeat against the Rodriguez team.
Olympia 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are the first doping cases
Detached: Because of a positive doping sample, Adrian Zielinski from Poland must not start in Rio.
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overtaken by the first official doping cases.
A caught athlete almost won a medal.
Before the seventh day of the competition, the first official doping events became known for the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
The Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000-metre barrier runner Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and the Polish weightheber Adrian Zielinski were tested positively and excluded in Brazil - immediately before the beginning of the critically buried Leichtathletik competition these messages come to the time.
In Chen, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, used as a masking agent for doping substances, had been demonstrated last Sunday.
The International Sports Court CAS confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon.
On Sunday, the 18-year-old had occupied the fourth place in the final over 100 m butterfly, but only by 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.
On Friday Chen should have participated in the curves over 50 m free style.
Chen has requested the opening of the B sample and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
The national association takes the matter "very seriously and requires Chen to cooperate fully in the investigations," said Xinhua from a communication: "We will cooperate with the International Sports Court CAS and will accept the judgment."
For the first time in history, it is not the IOC anymore, but the CAS that is responsible for punishing the athletes with positive cases.
Also in the night of Rio, the news of the positive sample at Danekowa went through, the 33-year-old himself went into the offensive.
"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," this was "an incredible shock," she said to the Bulgarian TV station BNT.
She was innocent, "the only explanation could be food supplements," explained the Body Journal.
According to the report, the prohibited substance is to be the blood doping agent EPO.
Danekowa was provisionally suspended, according to BNT the B sample should have already been successful.
Bulgaria's Prime Minister Bojko Borissow immediately criticized the Athlete.
"I don't understand why the athletes don't draw the right conclusions," he said, "We Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded."
For example, all the weights of the chronically doping-burdened nation are not allowed to participate in Rio.
On Friday the case "Adrian Zielinski" was also known, and the London Olympic player in the class up to 85 kg was tested positively three days earlier, like his brother Tomasz, on the anabolic steroid Nandrolon.
Both disputes the intake, but they must not start in the class up to 94 kg.
In particular, the Danekowa case is another serious blow to the reputation of the entire sport before the start of the body members.
The World Federation of IAAF had forbidden the launch of the entire Russian team until an exception due to systematic doping, including the runner nation Kenya produced many bad news in Rio.
In the swimming sport, the former crimes in China also led to serious conflicts between the athletes.
So the French Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic player Sun Yang harsh.
"Sun Yang pinkelt purple."
"When I see the podium over 200 m free style, I want to surrender," Lacourt said on the French radio.
Sun was also at the heart of a dispute with the Australian Mack Horton.
"I have no time and no respect for doping fraud," said this one.
Sun had been tested positively at the Chinese championships in 2014 on the stimulant trimetazidin, but had only to sit off a three-month barrier.
Data Lay: So perfide blackmail hacker their ransom
Programmers of blackmail malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful in doing so.
According to a recent survey of Malware Defense specialists Malwarebytes under 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the companies surveyed were at least once in the past 12 months, partly multiple victims of an attack with blackmailer software.
In Germany, nearly 20 percent of the companies were already a target of ransomware blackmail.
40 percent of the victims voluntarily paid the ranks required by the perpetrators to reuse the systems and data attacked.
According to Malwarebytes' observations, the perpetrators are increasingly specializing in attacks in company networks.
If they succeed there, the potential payroll to be blackmailed is much higher than in private users.
"We are currently observing a terrifying rapid evolution of damage software," Malwarebytes Chief Marcin Kleczynski explains in conversation with the "world."
In 2008, most malware programs were still designed to send advertising.
Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.
First, private users were the target, but the transition to corporate attacks took place in recent months terribly quickly.
Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: Once active on the computer of a victim, she is looking for recently modified files such as Word-, Excel- or Database files as well as for archives of images and videos.
These files encrypt the ransomware and delete the originals permanently.
The software then presents the demands of the blackmailer.
In order to get the final encryption code to the files, the victims have to transfer money - mostly in the form of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin -.
However, where the personal photo database is at stake for private users, companies are dealing with sensitive customer data or project databases without which production is stopped.
Accordingly, the damage is higher when a ransomware hits.
22 percent of the affected German companies reported sales losses due to Ransomware, 13 percent even had to completely interrupt business, in one case people were in danger of life.
In Germany, several hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients may be threatened by the loss of medical records.
"We always say to the victims: Don't pay, you only promote the problem," explains Kleczynski.
But 80 to 90 percent of the companies that pay get their data back.
For managers it is difficult to reject the perpetrators' demand in the face of a standstill in the operation.
The hackers again know that and try everything to build a good reputation.
In a recent study, the security researchers of F-Secure have examined the user's surfaces and contact with the blackmails and come to the conclusion: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money.
They explain to their victims by chat how they can pay by Bitcoin, set freely accessible support websites or unencrypt for free example files.
And if private people are redeemed after payments of a few hundred euros, companies have to negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums to get their data unencrypted.
In view of the potentially high and relatively risky profits from Ransomware blackmail, the hackers become increasingly professional and share the work, explains safety experts Chester Wisniewski from the antivirus provider Sophos: "One person can write a Ransomware around within a week."
However, it is more likely that they are three or four persons.
The programmers then sell their damage software in the form of a software building box to the actual blackmailer.
The previous malware kits were created by purchasing the malware itself, consulting and additional tools for a single fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.
"There is an adjustment tool in the range of deliveries so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.
The blackmasters then seek further hackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims.
We live in a service economy.
So you log in in one of the forums in the underground, buy the set from a criminal and instruct another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.
The payment is per infected computer.
"Normally the criminals then commission spammer with the spread," explains Wisniewski.
The risk of Ransomware is now known to many companies that better secure their data.
More than 50 percent of the companies responsible for IT in the Malwarebytes survey trust to defend Ransomware using file backups and scanner software.
Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.
"If the encryption of data alone is no longer a sufficient threat to successful austerity, the perpetrators instead threaten the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," Malwarebytes Chief Marcin Kleczynski explains.
As a result, the potential for damages is, depending on the type of data, a much higher than before.
In the future, the perpetrators could also take full new goals on the Internet of things.
At the Hacker Conference Defcon, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.
In the middle of winter, the release of such a blocked heating could be worth some sacrifices.
If then the perpetrators instead of heating in the future block a whole manufacturing road in a factory, Ransomware could also become a subject in industry 4.0.
One for all cases
HONDA HR-V is flexible and everyday
In the small HR-V Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and also the versatility of a minivan.
Sounds pretty overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, is actually proving to be extremely flexible in everyday life.
Although the HR-V is only 1,60 m high, passengers have a lot of space both in the first row and in the fund, it doesn't work in any place tight.
The materials of the interior are well processed and seem pleasant, only the cockpit top falls slightly.
More versatile than comparable vehicles are the HR-V in the storage room.
There is not only a trunk of 453 litres available for upwards and 1026 litres for folded back lines, but there are the "Magic Seats."
This is less magical than it sounds: the seat surfaces of the back bank can be folded up like cinematographic boards and thus provide storage space, which is 1,24 m high from the ground to the ceiling.
The trunk can be well loaded, but the loading height with 650 mm is slightly higher than the corresponding peugeot in 2008.
The 1.6-l diesel tested at 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V very vigorously thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed areas.
However, he should do his work a little quieter.
The everyday consumption is pleasant of 4.7 l / 100 km.
There is another motorisation: a 1.5-l petrol with 96 kW / 130 hp.
An all-wheel drive is not offered.
Driving behaviour is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.
But the steering should be a little more direct.
The equipment leaves no wishes open in the top version "Executive" tested.
The City emergency brake assistant (working up to speed 32), the collision warning system and the trace stop assistant are among the security systems.
The collision warner sometimes irrites because he evaluates many obstacles when ranging as "accepting objects."
The remote light assistant works very reliably.
And the intelligent temporal regulator responds to traffic sign detection and, if necessary, reduces speed.
The full connectivity is available only for top equipment: 7 inch touch screen, Navi, app integration and more.
Two USB and a HDMI bushes are below the arm and are therefore somewhat ambiguous to achieve.
The approximately 29000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.
If you don't want to invest so much, you will receive the fuel from 20000 euros, the diesel from 23000 euros.
The engines meet the Euro 6 exhaust standard.
With the HR-V, Honda offers a versatile and everyday car.
Airline is not liable: crash on passenger bridge
An airline is not liable for the collapse of a passenger on the passenger bridge.
The Oberlandesgericht Düsseldorf (Az.: 18 U 124 / 14) argued that liability was only possible in the case of hazards that are typical of air transport.
The plaintiff had broken a knee disc in the fall.
However, the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life, according to the court.
The airline didn't have to pay the man any compensation.
Disease case: When the organiser pays
Sick vacancies get money back after their journey only if the cause of the illness is unquestionably found at the hotel.
However, this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests show the same symptoms.
In the negotiated case, a family was severely sick of diarrhoea and vomiting on the second day of her Turkish leave.
She spent almost all the vacation in the room.
Their illness led the vacancies back to a defective sewage system which allegedly had disintegrated the sea water.
The family considered that the journey had been lacking - and complained against the organiser.
In court, the applicants did not succeed.
Although the sewage plant was in fact defective.
However, the organiser only learned about it shortly before the applicants left.
He had to assume that the sea water was fine until then.
So he didn't violate his information obligations, so the judgment.
No impurities were found in the samples of the water.
The illness of several hotel guests - possibly through infection between themselves - is part of the general risk of life.
Of 691 guests, only 38 were ill.
De Maizière said that after the violence committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people were concerned about further attacks.
At the same time, the state had to react to terrorist threats and resolute action.
Certainly, our country will not answer the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and divisions.
This triumph will not be good for the terrorists.
However, if criminals had to leave the country faster, this would increase security and strengthen the public's consent to refugee policy.
De Maizière intends to implement the proposals until the Bundestag election in 2017.
He also announced a further personnel strengthening of security forces, namely "in medium four-digit order over several years."
Sympathy for terrorism must again be punished.
The aim is to improve video surveillance, to innovate arms law in such a way as to make it more difficult to purchase weapons on the Internet.
The last much discussed obligation to remain silent for doctors should be respected according to the words of the Maizières.
However, in dialogue with the physician, he wanted to find solutions to reduce the danger of citizens, he said, for example, with a view to psychological sensations.
In order to prevent the radicalisation of refugees, the Minister considers that better social care is necessary.
Teachers should be better prepared to deal with traumatized people.
For the persecution of criminals in specific areas of the Internet (Darknet), de Maizière plans to use hidden investigators.
SPD Chief Gabriel said, "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security."
It is important that the Minister of the Interior has clearly opposed action.
"This was an ear coat for the scarves in the CDU / CSU," Gabriel said the newspapers of the Funke Media Group (Friday).
De Maizière had previously rejected calls from the Union for a Burka ban and the abolition of double nationality.
It considers that a general ban on full coverage is a constitutional problem.
You can't prohibit everything you refuse, and I refuse to carry the Burka.
You could talk about rules, for example in road transport or for witnesses in court.
Green Chief Simone Peter presented to the Minister that he wanted to simulate with ever-new anti-terror packages reality and ability to act.
Left Party Chief Bernd Riexinger said: "Fleet Speech and tightening up the right of residence will no longer bring people in this country security."
Better traffic flow on the motorway carrier
It is regularly located on the surrounding road - here is a picture of November.
However, this is to change: the legal spur is to be extended.
This is a good news for all car drivers who are on the road of the environment every night when they drive over the motorway (A 43).
On the next Tuesday and Wednesday (16 / 17 August), the national road construction company extends the right trail by 700 meters in the area between the Hammer Straße and the departure of Weseler Straße.
Car drivers can then turn right from the Hammer Street.
The great advantage is that traffic is divided early, thereby improving the overall flow on the much-experienced section of the Bundesstraße 51.
The idea of the prolonged exit had the CDU group in the district representation Münster-West.
The train tightening on the trailer nerves the drivers especially between 17 and 19 o'clock.
Work day the rear stau extends to the bridge over the Albersloher path and sometimes beyond.
= = References = = = = External links = = * Official website
From here, traffic is only narrowly directed over the motorway bridge.
The second trail had to be reconstructed about a quarter of years ago.
The reason: Static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer possesses the necessary load power to include, in particular, heavy load traffic in two-purely.
The duration of this shortage and the working-day situation will not be able to tell the competent national operation.
However, years are expected: the bridge has an official residual usage until 2034.
For the extension of the legal base, the national operation deliberately selected the weaker time in school holidays because of disability.
Traffic is carried by the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Intercultural Travel: Cultural Offers for Schools
The international class of forest school visited the theatre "The Invisible House."
The Association Nima's and the Young Theater are planning a music project now.
The Association Nima's allows young people with migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The "Class International" of the Forest School Kinderhaus has visited an idea of the award-winning piece "The Invisible House" of the Young Theater Münster.
In the context of the "intercultural journey" initiated by the Association Nima's, 19 students between 11 and 15 years attended the concert in the small house.
Since the beginning of the year, the association, which has set up the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee background, has offered schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster under this project.
Most of the class's young people came to Munster from Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria between September 2015 and March 2016 and spoke little German.
Thanks to the choreographies, the scenic images and video animations, they were able to follow the course of action, so the press release of the Young Theater Münster.
The Association Nima's, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Sprakel, and the Young Theatre will work together in the forthcoming playtime as part of a music theatre project.
From October to December, young people with and without escape and migration background between 14 and 20 years will be given the opportunity to visit professionally guided courses in the areas of singing, dancing, acting and music.
Offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theatre language mediation are in the planning.
The project "Intercultural Travel" continues.
In view of the increased numbers of refugees, the association expects many classes to participate.
Rain instead of Sternschnuppen: hope for weather improvement
The weather has made a line through the bill to the Starscopping Guckers in the Southwest of Germany in the night to Friday - but there is still hope.
The night had been badly suited to observe the sky spectacle because of clouds and rain, the chairman of the Stargate Welzheim, Hans-Ulrich Keller, said on Friday morning.
Our hope is on the night to Saturday.
The weather is supposed to be good, then we'll see a lot of star snaps in the sky.
The star shovels are a perimeter, which is one of the fastest star cutters per hour at 216000 kilometres per hour.
They have their names because they seem to be coming from the star picture Perseus that goes up in the north-east.
Relaxing Night: Tips for Sleep Disorders
In the evening you roll around forever, in the night you are awake for hours, in the morning there is no longer much to think about sleeping before the alarm ring.
That's all but relaxing.
After all, you are in good society with such problems: According to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of the adults have sleep disorder and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently as not reassuring.
How do sleep problems or sleep disorders express?
There are several forms of sleep disorder, and there can be a variety of causes behind them, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weeß, board member of the German Society for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine.
What you can understand in the long term is insomnia, which is an insomnia and a sleep disorder.
It is precisely the sleep that many people feel unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, board member in the German house medical association with practice in the Dutch Varel.
What's behind sleep problems?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex.
This may include organic, mental or behavioural factors, but also medicines.
Not rarely the sleep disorder is the expression of another disease.
"Very early awakening is common especially in depression," says Weeß.
And it may be that different factors depend on each other.
For example, if you have a band disc incident can be bad, wake up every two to three hours and might begin to grovel about everyday problems and caring, Weeß gives an example.
This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.
When should you get to the doctor with sleep problems?
If you are not sleeping well in at least three nights per week for a period of one month and are affected by the day, you should go to your doctor.
The impairment may look quite different: one is defeated, tired, unslept, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood fluctuations or physical symptoms such as stomach or headache.
In order to alleviate the sleep disorder, it is important to find out their causes.
Treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy or medicines - classical sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and for a maximum of two weeks.
There is hardly any low-grade sleeping doctor in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleep medical centre of Charité University Medicine Berlin.
Therefore, in case of sleep problems one should first contact the doctor, advises Weeß.
He can investigate whether the problems have a physical cause.
Who was supposed to go to the sleep lab, and what's going on?
For example, in the case of narcotics with respirators, sick daily fitness, sleepwalkers or if you do not find the cause of sleep disorder, Fietze explains.
You don't have to prepare yourself for the investigation.
You should spend the day normally.
"Just don't sleep for lunch," says Fietze.
After the cabling, you go to bed at your normal time.
In addition to the electrodes on the body you wear a nose glasses, a chest belt and a feel on the finger.
In addition, a camera on the ceiling records the sleeping end.
How can people get the problems under control?
There are quite a lot of job screws that can be used for a better sleep.
Weeß counts up: regular sleep and rising times, not too long in bed, not sleeping on the day, not television to sleep, avoiding alcohol and not looking at the clock at night - then you start to calculate immediately, and that is absolutely not beneficial.
What the jungle camp has to do with missing medals in swimming
The former German swimmer Markus Deibler has expressed himself on Facebook as a disappointing section of the DSV team at Olympis.
In December 2014, he first picked up gold at the World Championships in Doha, while at the same time drawing up his first world record.
Now, the former DSV athlete Markus Deibler has stood up to protect himself from his ex-teammates in criticism via Facebook.
"In a country where an Olympic player receives €20,000 premium and a jungle king €150,000 should no one wonder about missing medals," the 26-year-old wrote on his Facebook page at night to Friday.
The sponsorship system in swimming sports is bad, but doping controls are very good.
We cannot thus compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not look so closely or even operate on the subject of doping.
"I am not saying that the controls should be stopped here," he further explained.
If he wanted to start a comeback, Deibler should have been reported nine months before his first launch of the National Anti-Doping Agency Germany (NADA).
That is how it should be kept with countries.
"Those who cannot be controlled by independent WADA / FINA controllers for a certain time before the WM / OS may not participate," calls the election hamburger, who now operates an ice diel.
Airport: Bands of luggage thieves arrested
Professional thieves at Düsseldorf Airport
Civil fathers of the Düsseldorf police succeeded in arresting two women and two men aged 50 to 61 on Thursday.
The suspects had taken several pockets and luggage theft as a gang.
At 9: 30 a.m. civilian officials in the Düsseldorf airport recognized a band known to the police from previous theft offences.
The two women and two men had committed several offences since mid-July this year and had been doing so in a community, workable and particularly professional way.
The specialists of the Criminal Commissioner 34 can prove four actions to the thieves who had travelled to Germany specifically for the purpose of committing crimes.
They had exploited over 15,000 euros.
Old buildings, a few linen beams, in the meantime a rest of the headstone plaster: The Rigaer Street in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not work that way at first glance, but the police count them among the "dangerous places" of the city.
If you go along the road from east to west, you get past playgrounds, a freshly stripped kindergarten and a biolade.
Someone sprayed "ugly!" to the façade of a grey house.
Contrary to a Lidl, which is to be demolished soon, a house with high windows and 133 new rentals will be built by 2017.
However, articles about this "trendy part of the city," as the competent real estate company Friedrichshain calls, are preferred in recent weeks with burning cars.
The house is with number 94: once it was occupied, now the residents have leased contracts, but on the ground floor still occupied rooms and are used for events.
Since the beginning of the year, Berlin's inner senator Henkel had repeatedly expressed his support for a hard action by the police against the project, the area called "no-go zone" for police officers and the 94 starting point of autonomous violence.
After the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, had been cleaned with 300 police officers on June 22, the police patrol three weeks of official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three crew cars on the ground, blocked parts of the road and prevented visitors from entering the house with number 94.
Meanwhile, construction workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown owners.
On July 13, a Berlin administrative court decided that the clearance had been illegal, and one day later, police and construction workers withdrew under the applause of sympathizers and residents.
This summer afternoon the road works peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the courtyard in front of the houses in the sun, others entertain themselves in front of late.
A primary school and kindergartens are located close to the house projects.
Left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who has raised three children here, are particularly annoyed by the police presence.
With the residents of the house projects they share the concern of rising rentals and gentrification.
It doesn't sound like a kiez that most of the police protection wanted to come up against vandalizing left.
The tomb opened by the Berlin internal senator and the police between house crews and their neighbours does not appear to exist.
Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional labour district, which has a low average income and high risk of poverty compared to the rest of the city.
Household occupations and their housing projects have been part of the kiez for a long time: in 1990 many houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainzer road close to the Rigaer.
While the Mainzer had been cleared in a regular road battle under a large police offer, many of the projects were legalized in the Rigaer and are sometimes still inhabited today by the people they had occupied 26 years ago.
At the same time, in recent years, the district has become a magnet for tourists and electoral advisers from all over the world: with them now inhabitants from GDR times and former houseoccupants share their kiez.
This is also noticeable in the rentals that have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 for new rentals.
Many of the new buildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: you recognize them on engraved discs or freshly stripped facades that were thrown with color bags.
No other road was mentioned so often this year along with the words "left-hand violence."
One reason why not all neighbours consider this a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes such as crime are almost exclusively directed against police.
Most of the offences constitute material damage, which tend to hit the new buildings and newly renovated houses.
For Kerstin Neugebauer, who for 17 years has lived in a rental house next to the controversial 94, there can be no mention of uncertainty.
As far as violence is concerned, it is humiliating: the people in the 94 are their neighbours, which were certainly not.
Even the famous burning cars are no longer available directly in the Rigaer.
For the educated architect, their street is not a criminal focus, on the contrary: "Here you help each other, live together on the street and get more from each other than anywhere else."
New building has deliberately moved into the Rigaer street - and remained.
That is why it was so important for her to get the inhabitants back their road: from the police, politics and the media, who suddenly claimed the clarity of the city in July.
But in the eyes of residents like newcomers, the road continues to be taken away from them: Through faceless new buildings in former building holes that displace the old residents.
"These are ultimately property apartments that are not interesting for many here - here are more people who are not well-informed," she says.
"I can't accept violence and destruction at all."
But what should you do if you never listen to anyone?
There is frustration on all sides, including the police and the residents.
Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for attractors who are annoying about color bombs: the house projects and the left scene were part of the kiez.
Those who move from here should be aware of this - just as someone who moves into a bar district can complain badly about noise there.

Urbach: Annika Deuschle is a new refugee representative
Annika Deuschle is the contact partner in terms of integration and organizer.
She is also a social worker on site.
Since July, Annika Deuschle has been the refugee officer for Urbach.
The social pedagogue supports the team of the administration around Achim Grockenberger.
It sees itself as a contact partner for all actors: refugees, the workshop of refugee assistance, administration, authorities and who else is involved.
Regine Customer from the working circle suggests that the honorary officials are more than grateful that Deuschle is here now, the eager wool milchsau, which has a particular problem.
For example, some - less spooky than rather aimed at the many desired areas of work - meant when the administration wanted to describe the body.
An administrative expertise was sought with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long experience in the field of social work, just an eagle wool milk sheep.
But administrative work is not their central area, according to Annika Deuschle.
In particular, it is about organization, work with people on the ground and also behind the scenes as well as network activity.
The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.
It has limited a 50% position to three years.
"It was high time," says Regine Customer that Annika Deuschle supports honorary and chief actors.
There are large and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.
Soon new containers will be on the Wasenstraße
A serious problem has been to find apartments for the connecting refugees that have been recognised for some time.
The municipalities are responsible for the connection accommodation.
They must accommodate refugees in their own or rented living rooms.
The costs of building, renting or renovating these accommodation must be borne by the municipalities themselves.
Responsibility shifts from the county council to municipal and employment centre.
Problem: There are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.
The search has been very difficult for some time.
In fact, the administration does not find any private apartments.
It does not work so far, because it is dependent on private apartments, according to Deuschle.
It is therefore necessary to provide public housing as it is called beautiful.
So new containers will soon be set up on the Wasenstraße.
But only with apartments is it not done.
Perspective is the keyword, Regine Customer and Annika Deuschle agree.
In addition to a permanent stay, there are trainees, training centres, school places, one-euro jobs and aid activities for refugees and migrants that need to be found or set up.
"More places would be good," says Regine Customer.
Many work in the Bauhof or help masters, do non-profit work - and that motivated and very proper, as Annika Deuschle reports.
It hopes that work for the community will lead to a positive external impact.
This is "no employment therapy."
Activity does not only mean work.
The day needs a fixed structure, says Deuschle and customer.
People need to develop a sense of belonging.
So it needs offers such as sport, contacts with local people and, above all, language courses.
Professional courses are weird.
So this is where the administration and honorary officers jump in.
It is central that refugees feel that they are desired and welcome in Germany.
The long duration of the proceedings is a problem.
You must explain to the refugees that it takes a long time and that they can bridge the time in a meaningful way, for example with language courses.
Anyone who develops the feeling that he could not help anyone in Urbach should not work and be useless, he will never integrate.
The clear majority was motivated.
However, there are also problems, says customer honestly, "people who do nothing at all." The work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others.
All of this is already a "mammum task."
A difficult question: are they afraid of radicalisation after the recent events, even in a small community like Urbach?
"No," says Regine Customer quite clearly, "what some may call naive." However, a residual risk could and would not exclude them.
But the helpers are already conscious.
These incidents were also the subject of refugees.
They'd be afraid that the assassins would put them completely in disgrace.
"They want to show that they have nothing to do with this," says Regine Customer.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
So the main and honorary officials on the ground and in the region need to look for activities.
They always have in the background that a new blow to refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.
Does Germany need a ceiling?
To answer this question clearly, politics is shocking.
Actually, it's unfair to put them on site.
"We have not yet arrived in Urbach where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle.
No new refugees, that would relax the situation.
Regine Customer also makes it clear that the Urbacher are already loaded to properly integrate the previous people.
These are currently about 100 people, mostly young men.
But when people are in need, they need to be helped, both women agree.
The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.
Schorndorf: Interrupters searched with helicopter
The police helicopter flew various areas for about an hour - unsuccessful.
Two unknown men entered an apartment in a multi-family house in the Lindenweg on Friday morning at 8.50 a.m.
The residents surprised the two of them, and beat the disguise into the escape.
The two men were about 1.65 to 1.70 meters tall, probably masked, both wore bluejeans and black capucous pulses.
They escaped to downtown.
The police used several troops as well as a police helicopter for the capture.
The capture went without success.
Possibly the unknown fell near the apartment or in their escape before the deed.
