Triumph of the legal populists in Austria, total they come to 29 percent
A marked weakening of both sides of the former large coalition and a marked strengthening of the legal populist parties brought the premature parliamentary elections of Sunday in Austria after the first provisional results.
In particular, the Austrian People's Party (OPP) suffered serious losses, where the position of former president Wilhelm Molterer is seriously on the hook.
On the other hand, the electoral leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the Kärntner Landeshauptmann Jörg Haider, stands up for a triumphal return to federal policy.
According to the previous results, social democracy (SPÖ) remains the strongest force in the country with 29.8 percent of the votes, but against the last elections in 2006, it loses 5.5 percent of the votes.
Even worse, the PPP cut down, which loses almost nine percent of the votes at 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in the Austrian post-war history, and this is a truly catastrophic result especially in the People's Party which had requested the previous elections.
At the beginning of July, when the ÖVP had left the coalition, the People's Party had a clear advance in front of the SPÖ.
But the voters probably punished the party for having the government fail.
In the first reactions to the results, there were speculations about a possible resignation of the party chairman and former Deputy Chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could be the case already on Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the Party Executive.
Such a development would probably pave the way to the most likely way out of the electoral debris, that is to renew the large coalition from SPÖ and ÖVP.
In view of the strengthening of both political parties - the Liberal Party (FPÖ) received provisionally 18 percent, the BZÖ 11 percent of the votes - the Social Democrats expressed their fear that the year 1999 could be repeated when the People's Party with the Populist Agreements (at that time the FPÖ was still uniform, in 2005 it divorced from the BZÖ) with regard to a common government, which even led to sanctions from the European Union.
Obviously, Jörg Haider, who has already stated that he is willing to cooperate with each party and is going from a return to Vienna to Austrian federal policy.
The Green Party also moved into Parliament, but suffered minor losses and slipped from the third to the fifth place among the Austrian political parties.
No other party is likely to have mastered the four-percent warehouse and therefore did not enter Parliament either.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can cool down
If it is not possible to resolve the problem with the Czech scientists accused in India for the illegal collection of beetles, the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg believes that some cooling of Czech-Indian relations could occur.
This was emphasised by the Minister in New York after today's meeting with his Indian colleague Pranab Mukherdshi.
"If this is not resolved, then surely, there will be some cooling," he explained after a meeting that took place on a Czech initiative.
Mukherdshi said after the talks that in judicial matters the executive could only intervene hard.
In spite of all, he argued that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was released from the charge and received a fine, the central government wanted with the local government in Dardjiling, in whose case the case falls.
"His problem could be resolved," the Minister said.
For Emil Kučera, who was sentenced to three years of imprisonment, Mukherdshis believes it would be the best way to appeal at a higher authority.
He could so ask for bail and wait in free for his judgment, said the minister.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner also expressed his views during negotiations.
"He recommends an appeal to a higher court, then a pardon would be in question for him," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in the whole matter is to lend the convicted "competent legal support," the Indian Minister pointed out.
At the same time he said that such aid was already offered to them through the Indian side.
"We have a great interest in maintaining good contacts with India that have a long-term tradition.
The Indians also admit this, "said Schwarzenberg.
At the same time, according to the Czech press agency ČTK, the Czech Republic was very important to the problem of Czech entomologists before its partner.
"We really think it is a big mistake to detain and sue these Czech scientists," he said.
An answer to the question of whether he has received the commitment from the Indian side to deal with the matter, the Minister asked.
"I've already been promised a lot," he just said.
A Czechoslovakia guides over the ring around the seabed
It comes to an electronic map on which Australia and the adjacent sea areas are pictured.
However, he does not care about the continent, but about a small point lost in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and together with it also the adjacent sea ground.
The area is as large as the continent itself, "said the Italian jurist Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the thirty-headed team of staff of the UN Divison for Oceans and Maritime Rights.
His head, the Head of Division, the Czech Jurist Václav Mikulka, follows the interpretation and complements it.
There is work and enthusiasm here.
The sea soil has so far been a very little known world that is rich in natural sources.
Here is oil to be found, the other ore and other non-growing raw materials, but also unknown living organisms, which, for example, bear the key to the development of a medicine against cancer.
A sea ground, larger than the mainland
Today, the coastal states announced their rights to the new sea areas.
After a UN convention, they use their rights to which they agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay on Jamaica.
It is mainly the area of the so-called continental shell, which often reaches to a few hundred kilometres from the shore of a country to the sea.
According to the Convention, this country has exclusive rights to all sources of continental shell.
"Simplified, as a continental shelf, the part of the seabed and its soils is considered, which represents a natural continuation of the continent below the sea surface.
It crosses the boundaries of the ocean, often also the boundary of two hundred nautical miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone, "explains Mikulka.
The request submitted by the relevant country to the Commission to establish the external borders of the continental shell must be supported by a comprehensive scientific and technical documentation based on many cost-intensive studies and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide legal and technical assistance to the Commission.
The Commission has so far negotiated five requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Until now, only the three latter countries have succeeded, "Mikulka adds.
The success of Australia, which was the first country to greatly expand its sea areas, has recently emerged from an international echo.
However, New Zealand is also a winner - the extension of the sea floor approved by the Commission last week is about 1.6 million square kilometres, which is about six times more than the size of the state itself.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in the investigations.
The profits that will come to them in the future from the use of the seabed will, as they promise, have an unappreciable value.
Other countries will also submit their applications gradually.
You can do this for ten years from the moment they ratify the Montego Bay Agreement.
Where the continental shelf ends, the area of the ocean soil, which is referred to by the Convention as "common heritage of humanity."
Then no state has a special position in here.
The right to promote in this field gives an international institution established by the Convention.
"But the seabed is not a gold graveyard," means with some excess director Mikulka and adds, whose "individual areas are legally defined and the system is contractually anchored."
Czechoslovakia
A part of the seabed belongs to the Czech Republic today.
It shares it with other states of the former East Block within the framework of the Joint Organization "Interoceanmetal."
In 1991, as well as the investors of some less other states, it was given the status of a so-called "rail-breaking investor."
The organization has the right to promote in the ClarionClipperton zone in the Pacific Ocean between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area to be examined by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The seabed is divided there, it is a kind of Tatra on the seabed.
"Promote there on a total area of 75,000 square kilometres.
The area is a rich foundation of polymetal concrete containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese, "another jurist, the Inder Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian staff of the Rober Sandev Division brings such a concept as a pattern.
She reminds me of a small potato or, with some imagination, of the sophisticated shame that the legend has raised to life after the Golem.
German Special Forces were on-site in the event of hostage liberation
The Egyptian government had requested assistance from Germany to resolve the hostage crisis - the experts came.
When it became serious, the special units were ready, but they were not used.
The circumstances of liberation of eleven European tourists kidnapped in Egypt are becoming more and more detailed.
According to the Ministry of Defence and Home Affairs, German specialists were indirectly involved in the rescue operation.
According to this, both specialists of the Federal Defence and officials of the GSG 9, the flight season of the Federal Police, the Federal Criminal Office and logistics experts of the Technical Assistance Office were at the place of liberation.
However, as ministers' spokesmen announced on Monday evening, the German forces were not needed because the hostages let their prisoners run and flew when they had recognized signs of violent liberation.
The Egyptian Government has accepted the aid offered by Germany to involve them as support forces on the ground.
"Fortunately it has not come to this," said a speaker of the Federal Ministry of Interior.
Attackers had kidnapped the five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian and their eight Egyptian companions on 19 September in South Egypt.
After kidnapping in a desert area in the south of Egypt, the hostages in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad had been dragged down and down.
The identity of the hostages remained unclear until the last time as well as the details of the exemption or possible redemption payments.
The Gereteten have now arrived well in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the free hostages were in the custody of the German Embassy.
He did not comment on details of the release.
In Berlin, there was no information at first when they returned to Germany.
According to the "picture" newspaper, the five vacancies and the special forces are to be flew out with an airbus of the Air Force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
US Representative House rejects rescue package
The first Chamber of the US Congress has made the $700 billion heavy rescue package for the financial markets very scarcely fail.
Dow Jones ran into the depth.
With 206 votes to 227, the US House of Representatives rejected the government's rescue package for financial markets.
Despite all the appeals made by US President George W. Bush and the leaders of both parties, there was no majority for the programme to reduce the chaos in the financial markets.
In a dramatic action, the supporters had desperately tried to convince the critics of the 700 billion dollars heavy package.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic negotiators, had called on the Members to agree, even if the plan was unpopular.
"It is difficult to obtain political recognition for avoiding something that has not yet occurred," he announced.
In the course of the vote, Dow Jones broke in by more than six percent or by 600 points.
The investors were concerned that the state rescue package could fail.
He recovered shortly before the end of the vote, and then, after the failure was announced, again.
Experts now expect further serious turbulence on the international financial markets.
For the programme to come into force, the consent of both the House of Members and the Senate is necessary.
Organizers record rising booking numbers
It seems to be a good winter for the German tour operators:
In the case of travel bookings for the coming months, revenues have increased significantly compared to the previous year, according to a study - even by more than 30 per cent for the winter season.
In spite of weak economic prospects, Germany's travel livelihood remains unharmed according to a study.
In the winter season, the travel offices recorded a turnover increase of 31 per cent compared to the previous year period, as announced by the German Travel Association (DRV) on Monday in Berlin.
According to the investigation carried out by the market research institute GfK, accounting figures have already increased for autumn months.
For example, the turnover plus of the travel agencies for October amounted to around 11 per cent compared to 2007, the DRV informed.
The basis for these results is figures of the GfK, which evaluate monthly booking data of 1200 German travel agencies and upwards for the overall market.
The travel bookings were recorded by the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar rate, travelling to the US was asked in particular, the DRV informed.
Here the bookingincrease is about one third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as the local fields of the Germans, are particularly demanded destinations.
In particular, holidays would be high in the course, said DRV President Klaus Laepple.
In view of the rising cost of energy and food, the costs are "more predictable for the customer than for individually organised holidays."
Money could save consumers, among other things, by early booking discounts or all-inclusive offers, said Laepple.
The summer months had also been very well booked, so that a turnover plus would again be recorded compared to the previous year - although according to another study the number of Germans who took a trip decreased compared to the previous year.
My first time Octoberfest
Ballermann-Apres-Ski-Hits in the endless loop, beer made of litre-crutches and celebrity in Designer-Dirndln.
It's a Wiesn debut.
Susanne Crown sugar and I don't really have much in common.
She is blond, TV moderator and has a tailor-made Dirndl.
I have dark hair, I'm a student and my dress is second hand.
But one thing connects us: hardly three minutes on the Wiesn, already the photographers crash on us and squeeze the memory cards full - very flattering and that at my first meadow visit.
That's how you make friends.
The cheap Dirndl seems to fulfil its purpose.
As Wiesn-Touri, and actually located north of the white-wormmaker, the well-being in the mood was still limited until now.
But first arrived at the Theresienwiese, everything is half as bad.
Almost everyone wears Dirndl or leather hose; no one watches or touches embarrassed - everything completely normal.
Strange eyes on the chocolate banana stand only harvest my dirndlaps.
A coin teacher reminds me that I had wrong tied the apron: "Left hoast free, middle virgin, forgiven right, remembered."
At least I'm frightening the rope from the back to the left.
"Fits," said it and laughed.
Others make less effort to subtle flirting techniques and wear simple fireplace hats on which "To drunk to get dressed!" and stretch against an unasked naked back.
The young man with the exhibitionist attites is called Bob, comes from England and also visits the Oktoberfest for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous," with a long-drawn "ooooo."
That's what he tells me after he drowned off his previous measure.
Right next to one of these hydrants, all of whom think he's a trash.
So Bob is one of those notorious "Wildbeeslers."
Others are not lucky to get rid of the alcohol in this way.
At eight o'clock in the evening, sanitaries run in scissors over the parking lot, which must take care of the poor sluggers.
The nurses always appear in the pack - always four at once drag a covered carrier from tent to tent.
This works like with most Wiesn visitors: Learn to, fully back.
Anyone in the Promille coffin underneath the plane can't be seen.
"Des are what goarnimmer packs," one of the sanitarians called me on request and disappeared in the mess.
Name of the accident victim announced by the police
The name of a 63-year-old female foot walker who died in the hospital after being hit by a vehicle in Essex was announced.
Carole Paulson, living on Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the accident on Friday afternoon on Shenfield Road in the middle of the city.
She was taken to Queen's hospital in Romford, but died later.
A 51-year-old man was arrested after the accident for suspicion of light driving.
Meanwhile, he was released on bail.
Turkey expands the diplomatic horizon
Long before Turkey sought to join the European Union, the European forces were interested in entering the country behind Turkey.
On the eastern side of Bosporus, perhaps just 20 steps within Asia, one of the finest relics of this failed imperial endeavour.
The Hydarpasha railway station was designed by the two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in the Neo-Renaissance style.
At least that's what the travelers tell you.
The building is sitting gladly at the end of the railway steps with a tower at every corner of the front and thus looks like some provincial German town hall.
The rock is dirty.
The whole building is crashing about
But once you are within the wrapped ticket switch, there is no doubt about the magnificence of the project whose western access was this.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolia-Bagdad Society.
Germany, which was a spear in the imperialist game, had before its ambitions to dominate the Middle East, through a train connection to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond what is today Saudi Arabia.
But Germany's imperialist projects were slopped during the first World War.
His railways were attacked by Lawrence from Arabia and his Arabs.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, created by the inevitable boundaries of the cold war, has disappeared.
British forces withdrew from Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies from Palestine and Syria
And there was also bad news for the Hyderpasha train station.
In 1917, an ammunition train flew into the air, destroying the artificial roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then it has slowly disappeared, far from history.
Today, however, this railway line, at least symbolic, serves as a gate to Anatolia and all east of it to highlight the expansion of the diplomatic horizon of Tükei.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the ACP, has introduced a modest new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the neighbouring regions, created by the boundaries of the Cold War, has disappeared.
Now there is a policy of convergence.
It is noteworthy that the Turkish Government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian split groups Hamas and Fatah, with Iran and Iraq and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
In order to assess the cornerstones of this new foreign policy, I have taken the night train to the Turkish capital Ankara to visit one of the ACP's leading foreign policy experts, the Turkish Member Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning, about ten and a half hours later, after a hollow ride on tracks that produced the equation of the old world in the well-known documentation "The Night Mail," I arrived in the Turkish capital, which is considered to be a new city, for the new global state project, to the back of the Ottoman past.
However, the ACP, known for its Islamic roots, represents a paradigm change in Turkish unity.
This has triggered a lot of suspicion in the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi has brought me to the main business office of the ACP, a specially manufactured, ultra-modern stone and steel construction, in a developing suburb surrounded by semi-finished shopping centres and pubs in which medium managers met in suits, both men and women, to complete the first business of the day.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a middle-right politician of almost every other political party in Europe.
Dress up, tie, I'm sure he even packed a blackberry.
"The objective of the party's foreign policy is now to reintegrate Turkey with its immediate neighbours.
The cold war was an exception, "he tells me.
Turkey had been cut off from its backland.
Nowadays she has to look at the east and west at the same time.
There wouldn't be either the one or the other.
She should do both.
"But certainly Turkey could sometime," I asked, "being forced to decide?"
"Turkey," he said, "did not want to make this decision."
He then highlighted a point that almost everyone I spoke with almost routinely said up: Turkey's relations, not only to the Middle East, but also to the Caucasus and around the Black Sea, are equally beneficial to Europe and the United States as they are to Turkey.
With Turkey on board, it seems to be the message, Europe as a whole can go east towards Asia and the Middle East as a whole.
Back at Hydarpasha's train station, after another largely sleepless night, I thought of these two German lords Mr. Ritter and Mr. Conu who had watched this construction 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to know that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East could now be in Turkey's hands too much.
And when I waited at the parking lot for the ferry that was supposed to bring me back over the Bosporus, I remembered that Turkey was always called "the sick man of Europe" in those days.
At least there did not seem to be much doubt about which continent should have a right to this fascinating country.
In memory of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical director since 1962 Vernon "Death" Handley (revocation on September 11) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic and Choir.
As part of his music program for the city, he founded his great youth choir, Proteus, in the following year.
He was meant for young people up to 21 years, but when the choir sang last time in 1979, some of us were already at the end of 20 - we simply refused to leave the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological form change) stood for the choir's willingness and ability to attack any piece of music that was presented to him, whether it was a Madrigal or from the Messiah, whether a capella or with full orchestra.
The musical versatility of such a young choir was often astonishing, always exciting and existed alone thanks to the inspiration of that man and his enthusiasm for the music that never left behind for years.
How many times did death make us "let the music speak for themselves."
He used to say, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all in the music.
So sing it! "
His way of conducting was absolutely clear and precise but never surplus.
As high as the musical level was, he always demanded an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any conductor had to be beaten to the knight, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well in the last two decades, from 1962 to 1982, where he led the Guildford Philharmonic.
In the last 40 years, I have written critics for over a hundred of his concerts and I can sincerely say that I was never disappointed by one single - often I was inspired by them.
Death Handley was that rare combination of size and personal modesty.
He despised directors who, according to his words, simply went "with one or two known sculptures in the world."
So many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In your resignation for William Woodruff (September 25), you write that "in 1946 he took over the teaching of economic history in Oxford and received a Houblon-Norman research scholarship in 1950... while at the same time studying for a BSc, a MA and a PhD.
This is a conclusion from a author's remark in Woodruff's book "Jenseits von Nab End," but it is not true.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a lecturer of economic history at the University of Nottingham and during this time he wrote a doctoral work on the British rubber industry under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers, later published in 1958 as "The British rubber industry."
He spent the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York in the United States in the course of a Houblon-Norman scholarship.
In 1953 he finally left Nottingham and went to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff wanted to cover this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Philological Faculty.
'I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino 'Flamenco and life' because his photographs in black-white, in documentary style are fantastic.
They made me aware of them because of their simplicity and the power they emit, as they always deal with the protagonists with respect.
An exhibition that shows many feelings.
Resino knows to find the magic moments. '
Second round of excellent sales at Honda.
In November, Honda is catching the second generation of Honda Jazz.
While his predecessor model had a large interior, this large space limousine offers a much larger one.
This includes the technical finishes that allow even more comfortable driving and saving gasoline.
Changes before the upcoming revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although, aesthetically speaking, the new jazz has a similar line to its predecessor, the changes made in this large limousine are numerous.
Among other things, the innovative design, the new space flexibility, the larger dimensions of the car and the new mechanism should be emphasised.
Nevertheless, before you start analyzing the new model, you have to say that this new jazz appears six years later after the first generation had appeared on the market.
According to the first observations, Honda, compared to the other manufacturers, managed to renew this model for a shorter time.
Although the Honda Jazz is less known in Europe, this model is a phenomenon of its sale on the other markets.
This is a case in Japan, in the country where jazz is the most sold car in 2002 and also in the course of 2008.
After the jazz appeared on the market, around a million models were sold in Japan alone.
The second market was the Old Continent, with about half a million cars sold in six years.
Nevertheless, Honda tries to increase the sale of the new jazz model within the segment.
In this way, while Japanese company sold a total of 83 000 Jazz models in 2007, the expected estimates are 10 000 cars. That is 17% of the expected growth in the European market.
As far as the Spanish market is concerned, Honda has sold 8 000 jazz models since 2002, which is 6.7% of the total sales in Honda in Spain.
With regard to the new generation of the model, the directors of the branches in Spain expect to be able to sell 2 000 jazz models per year.
More specifically, the appearance of the new Honda Jazz model allows to cover the reduction of sales in Spain.
In reality, the leaders of the brand hope to complete the year with total sales of 22 000 models. That's 4 000 cars less than in 2007, a 16% reduction.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain to 1.8% compared to the previous year (1.6%).
At the same time, the Japanese company hopes to reach the 2% in 2010.
In order to achieve this proportion, Honda puts on the appearance of a new model.
It is Insight, a hybrid with 5 doors and a compact size of 4.7 meters long, the Japanese company hopes to sell around 200 000 models a year around the world.
According to the Japanese manufacturer's market estimates, 50% of Insight models are sold in the United States, while the remaining share is distributed on the Old Continent and Japan.
The appearance of insight on the market is planned for the first months of the year, and for the first time its public presentation will take place in Valencia in January.
With regard to the first generation, the new jazz grows in all its sizes.
Its length is 3.90 meters (plus 5 centimeters), its width is 1.69 meters (plus 2 centimeters) and the distance between the axles is 2.50 meters, which leads to the assumption that it has become 5 centimeters larger.
The height, on the other hand, does not change and remains 1.52 meters.
Together with increasing dimensions, the interior is also enlarged.
This success is due, on the one hand, to the new space flexibility programme and, on the other hand, to the central position of the fuel container, a solution which was also used in the predecessor model of jazz.
The capacity of the trunk, which has a system of double loading area, also reaches up to 339 litres, i.e. 19 litres greater than the capacity of the first generation trunk.
It must be emphasised that these measures are present in the version with a 1.4 literature petrol engine, because the capacity of the Honda jazz trunk with a 1.2 litre petrol engine is 379 litres.
Among other improvements, except the additional equipment elements such as leather seats or the possibility to install panoramic windows, improved access to the seats is offered.
The opening angle of the rear doors is 80 degrees, with the first jazz only 67 degrees.
The engines of the second generation of jazz are also new.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model has 2 designs of petrol engines: 1.2 and 1.4 litres.
Both variants have i-VTEC system, which allows low fuel consumption and smaller CO2 emissions, have excellent technical performance while at the same time providing torque power for the entire engine running time.
The first variant with 1.2 litres reaches the power of 90 hp at 6 000 rows with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4 900 min? 1.
This petrol engine - the predecessor model of jazz reaches 78 hp - has 5.3 litres of petrol consumption and a CO2 output of 125 grams.
With regard to the predecessor engine, which reached 83 hp in the previous generation, it is now able to reach 100 hp.
The jazz 100 PS model 1.4 has 5.4 litres of fuel consumption and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
"Auto-Bee," which avoids collisions
In order to advance the development of the technologies for accident prevention, Nissan was inspired this time by nature, more specifically, by the bees.
The Japanese company has developed a robot whose flight dates back to the heat behaviour of bees and avoids accidents.
This robot is a bio-mimetic car robot drive or BR23C and represents the first step in accident prevention technologies.
The engineers from the Nissan Motor Co's technical development centre have developed this small robot in cooperation with the Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology of the renowned University of Tokyo (Japan).
According to Kazuhiro Doi, the head of technology PR and R & D fire management, the BR23C represents an extension of the four-layer Nissan safety sign.
This robot is designed to ensure that the cars of this brand are able to avoid the collisions.
During the flight, each bee builds its own oval-shaped flugram, which is very similar to the Nissan safety sign.
But the most important thing is the faceted eyes of the bee, which can see over an angle of 300 degrees in all directions, allowing them to fly undisturbed in their personal airspace without interruption.
In order to reflect the rundum perspective, the technicians developed the so-called Laser Range Finder (LRF).
He notices obstacles that are within a distance of up to two meters before the BR23C and are in the radius of 180 degrees, calculating the distance to the object and sending a signal to a bordeigen microprocessor, which is translated directly into a signal to avoid collision
'At the moment when an obstacle is noticed, the small robot will imitate the bee flight and immediately change the direction by turning its wheels around 90º or even larger angles to avoid the collision.
The biggest difference with other systems is that this escape manoeuvre takes place absolutely instinctively.
If not, the robot could not be able to react with sufficient speed to avoid obstacles, 'explains Toshiyuki Andoh, Director of the Mobility Laboratory and the leading engineer of this project.
In contrast to a bee, the robot cannot deviate either upwards or downwards, but also not overcorner; it can only move on two dimensions and in the direction that allows him to rotate his wheels and not in the infinite directions and in the infinite way the bees do.
For this reason, Nissan has used the rotation function in addition to acceleration and braking functions so that the small robot avoids the collisions.
'This device only takes a few seconds to process the information and act according to this information.
It does not require either the information or the intuitive logic of the manoeuvres performed, so it can work continuously with just a couple of dozen KB of the storage space.
That sounds surprising, but it's not about the GBs and not even about the MBs of the storage space.
This is the first step in the development of technologies for the immediate prevention of collisions, a technology that will introduce Nissan in the next ten years to the serial cars prophecy time.
The robot operates with lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and longer than variety of lithium ion batteries.
A further possible use of this technology in the future could be the integration of the unit with a GPS navigation system by satellite to lead to the target while driving and avoiding obstacles on the way.
She's shaking before she gets charged with a mortgage.
It must be realized that the US Ministry of Finance, except that it has sufficient liquidity to provide support, is not without skill.
Before the crisis and in order to avoid US citizens being involved in mortgage stories of the allegedly affordable banks, a entertaining and informative game for the Internet surfers has been developed: 'Bad Credit Hotel', says it.
Or maybe the "hotel of bad loans" or the other one.
The third aspect of this accommodation and especially its receptionist is to think one, two and up to three times, whether it is the moment to ask for no credit.
And especially where you can do it, which is probably the goal of the game.
Certainly she has useful information, but no details.
This is more a page for teenagers than a place for all spectators.
What will happen when the game is extended?
Well, when a dream room appears in the hotel.
At least something, because it's not about buying a better house
Morgan Stanley provides its capital for MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) into its company, which would be the first bank in Japan to spend nine billion dollars and thus take over 21% of its capital, a innovation due to a strong fall in its exchange rate.
One week after a provisional agreement had been made public, the two banks declared that MUFG will buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's share shares at the single price of 25.25 dollars, which will result in a total of three billion dollars.
The accepted price is less than 19% of the share price of 31 August.
MUFG will invest additional six billion dollars in the acquisition of convertible shares that will secure it a profit of 10% and can be sold again at a price of 31.25 dollars.
Morgan Stanley explained that the global business will be made on the basis of a single average price of 29 dollars, i.e. 28% above the current price value.
The Morgan Stanley share, however, fell by 6.79% to 23.07 dollars at 17.00 GMT.
"This strategic connection is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to the status of a holding bank," said John Mack, Director-General of the American Group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this status last week, which is supposed to allow him to extend its business to new areas, but under the supervision of the Federal Reserve.
Your connection to MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces the biggest names of Wall Street to take a much more careful attitude than before.
The arrangements presented on Monday also show that the agreement has changed in the course of the last few days: last Monday Morgan had simply explained that it would sell up to 20% of its shares for about 8.5 billion dollars to Japan.
'A week ago ', said Toshihide Mizuno, Managing Director of MUFG in Tokyo,' we thought that the participation would consist entirely of stem shares.
But given the current economic and market situation, we wanted to reduce the risks and safeguard ourselves. '
Based on a balanced average price, MUFG will pay 7% below its price for its Morgan Stanley shares.
And the business will go with a reduction of profits by about 20% per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential shares into share shares in one year if the latter is exchanged to more than 50% above the sales value within a given period, i.e. to about 47 dollars.
Morgan Stanley assures that the funds provided by MUFG will enable him to use investment opportunities, to strengthen its balance sheet and to increase its sales.
However, a group press speaker refused to provide more detailed information on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After MUFG's investment, Morgan Stanley should be able to book a payment rate of about 15%, one of the best in this sector.
Morgan declared that he had reduced his balance sheet 'significantly' since the end of August.
The last few weeks were hard for the group who had to look at how their exchange rate fell by half, while the price for insurance against insolvency accelerated to the level.
This price fell on Monday, but remained at a high level, at about 12%.
Goldman Sachs, the only "survivors" of the large investment banks on Wall Street after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchase of Merrill Lynch, announced last week that he had raised 15 billion dollars, partly at Berkshire Hathaway, the Warren Buffett group.
Rafael Correa this Monday in Quito.
The Republic refounded around the socialism of the 21st century.
This is the joint project of the Venezolan Hugo Chávez, the Bolivian Evo Morales and the Equatorian Rafael Correa.
The third was to elect this Sunday, the example of his equal minds and friends, the plan of a new constitution.
Mission accomplished, because according to the public results of 80% of the voters' votes, 64% voted 'yes' in the referendum.
According to these results, 28% were 'no', 7% of the polls were invalid and 0.7% were delivered empty.
In order to adopt the Constitutional Project, a vote must be achieved more than half of all votes cast.
On Sunday, two surveys carried out at the exits of the electoral offices and a counting of a non-governmental organisation had announced a clear victory for 'yes', and it prophesied 63% to 70%.
In the night from Sunday to Monday, Rafael Correa had requested the victory of his constitutional project.
The 'Constitution has triumphed overwhelmingly', he had insured and congratulated the Equatorians in Guayaquil, the seat of the government 280 kilometers south-west of Quito.
Of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales, but also by his Chilean alienated Michelle Bachelet.
The election held in silence under the Observatory of the Organisation of American States (OAS) referred to a 444-point text to secure 'new socialism' for which the President is committed.
The Constitutional Project transmits state power to the economy by giving it the exclusive right to 'development planning' in a country that lives largely from the oil production of foreign companies and from the foreign currencies that send emigrants to the country.
The project, which will be pursued by the Correa elected in 2006, will also grant more comprehensive power to the Head of State, which will be able to exercise up to two consecutive mandates of four years each, and will have the opportunity to dissolve the National Assembly.
Correa already announced that he would take advantage of this power and seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also guarantees the principle of free medical care and education, which the President has already begun to introduce in this country with 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty limit.
Finally, it also provides for the prohibition of the presence of foreign troops, which will end the agreement between Quito and Washington on the use of an equatorian base as a starting point for American anti-drug operations.
The 19 hostages were released in Chad
An Egyptian command launched the attack on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions who had been captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions, who were held in the desert for eleven days, were returned to the Egyptian capital this Monday afternoon healthy and unharmed.
In the morning they had been released from an Egyptian command in Chad.
Apparently in good condition, the hostages reached the military base of al-Maza directly next to the international airport of Cairo at 3: 30 a.m. on board a special aircraft.
They were taken directly, without being able to speak to the press, on board a helicopter to the hospital of Maadi, a foreign district of Cairo, to be examined there.
They all welcome 'best health' and the kidnappers' were not paid a ransom ', said Egyptian Minister of Tourism Zoheir Garanna on the roller field.
After being captured on September 19 at a campsite safari on the foot of Mount Ouanat in the border area of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, the group of hostages was repeatedly brought to the nearest of 35 unknown kidnappers from one hiding area.
They are eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and eight Egyptians: two leaders, four chauffeurs, a border guard and the director of the Agency Aegyptus, the organizer of the Safari.
An Egyptian security controller said that 30 members of the special units, on board two helicopters, started the attack at night, just before dawn.
'On both sides shots fell and half of the kidnappers were killed, the rest fled, 'said this responsible man who wants to remain anonymous.
He stated that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian Special Units had been sent to Sudan, where they were supported by German and Italian commands.
The head of the Italian diplomats Franco Frattini reported from Belgrade, where he was just sitting, on the role of the secretary and the elements of the Italian special units.
"We must recognise that thanks to the professionalism and performance of our men we have achieved this result from the Secret Service and the Special Units," he explained without further details.
He also denied that a ransom had been paid.
On the eve of the evening, the Sudanese army claimed to have stopped a patrol vehicle in which the kidnappers, six of which were the leader of the Chad, were killed and two arrested.
The army stated that it would be associated with a group of rebels from Darfour, the Libération du Soudan-Unité (SLA-U), but this movement was immediately contested.
Letter - The silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture makes headlines and is a central issue of the current campaign.
The better.
But one area of our cultural life remains forgotten.
Who will rise up and challenge the pathetic sums granted to the small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical places who are despicable?
What politician will dare to remind the federal government that they are neglecting their monuments and their cultural buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, there are no proper laws that effectively protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French Government only provides 3.5 million euros for the restoration of Chinon's castle in Loiretal?
Our American neighbours have written in the Constitution of their country that the protection of cultural heritage belongs to the culture of the Americans and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all Members and all government districts, by mutual agreement.
In Quebec, in the association of the history companies Quebecs, at least 40,000 honorary officers gathered in 211 history societies strive to deal intensively with history, to save the numerous private archives with some large groups, and to preserve the archaeological remains.
They are also often the guardian dogs of our cultural heritage who protest with the power of despair when promoters and decision-makers release their bulldozers on our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When will there be a stage for history and cultural heritage?
Benelux governments state parts of Fortis Bank
With a partial nationalisation, the Benelux States want to take the arms of the Belgian-Dutch Fortis Bank, which has been hit by the US financial crisis in turbulence: the three states are providing a total of EUR 11.2 billion to the banking and insurance institution, which also has offices in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands have consulted at the highest level this weekend, together with the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission Competition Authority's representative.
In the euro area, Fortis is the first victim of the international financial market crisis that has been going on for a year, so decisions that are now being taken in connection with the Bank could have a precedent.
For the purposes of the decision taken on Sunday night, all three States buy the respective shares of the bank at approximately 49 percent.
The Bank is likely to sell part of its holdings, all of which were previously purchased by the Dutch ABN Amro last year.
The shares of the Fortis have started a steep drive last week, and in the second half of the week serious crisis scenarios have already been recorded.
However, analysts agree that the bank with its 85,000 employees is far too large for a plea.
The institution's securities fell by 12% to a 14-year depth on Friday.
Since January, the value of the shares has fallen by more than two thirds.
In view of the current share rates, the group's market value is EUR 14 billion, but according to management, it is unrealistic.
According to the management, the USD 700 billion expensive American rescue package and the resulting uncertainty on the markets is due to the rival of the Fortis shares.
On Monday, however, the courses increased slightly.
On Friday, Philip Dierckx was appointed new Director General of the Bank.
The money institute was also looking for a private buyer, but there was no interest in offering a real offer.
However, the Belgian government was trying to calm down - no investor should shake for his money, it was said.
There has been no panic among the customers so far, the banks' branches have not been stormed.
In Hungary, Fortis has independent branches, but it also calls lease companies its own.
Fox in the chicken stall
Because of the drug consumption of a person, life and health insurance in America often refuse to conclude a contract with a customer.
Data protection experts fear that the data market could become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programmes that in any case link the use of the drug data to the consent of the person concerned.
These should be in independent hands, otherwise we trust the fox the chickens "- quotes the Washington Post Richard Dick, developer of the program for the tracking of prescriptive data.
Insurances shall determine the fees and payment amounts in the event of injury depending on the health of the customer and if the risk is too high, the insurance will not be completed at all.
In the past, the customer was sent to a medical examination and the contract was concluded only in the knowledge of the results of the investigation.
Ten years ago, Dick invented a far more favourable method: using the customer's identification number, he receives the data from the pharmacies for the last one and a half years, speaking of which preparations were purchased, and the program calculates what the customer's disease is suffering from and how his health is.
For example, if he regularly purchases large amounts of cholesterol lowering drugs, it could result in his blood fat level being untreatable high, which would automatically rank him into a higher risk group.
There are several versions of the programme in circulation - some even define a risk ultiplikator, so that insurance only has more to do with paperwork, but there are smaller difficulties.
One of the disadvantages is that many medicines can be taken for different purposes, such as against migraines and heat wells, but also against depression.
In the view of the insurers, the latter is a high risk factor, while the above are not mentioned.
For the search and processing of the data, own societies have formed which, before obtaining the data, ask the patient for its consent.
Meanwhile, they have to do this by law, even though forgiveness has not been condemned so far.
Some companies even process the results of laboratory studies and link them with the data on drug use. Thus they provide an even more precise picture of the patient's health status.
More and more companies have access to the data and the control of their use is becoming more difficult at the same time.
Although there is a private data protection law for health data, its effect applies only to healthcare and insurance providers.
The draft law has already been submitted to the Congress to allow authorities to control data processing companies as well.
Dick Richard recognises that this is too little, so he wants to further develop his programme so that data can only be passed on with the agreement of the person concerned.
Another question is, of course, that the person concerned may hardly be able to prohibit access to his data, as the insurance companies do not otherwise conclude a contract with him.
And so the chickens are only somehow left to the grace of the fox.
Global Marseille dining plan
European Union and India doubling trade
Since the European Union and India are the leading trading partners of each other, this was the main issue alongside other global problems at the ninth summit.
Today, the French-Indian summit will also take place, which will mainly discuss cooperation in the nuclear sector.
While the European Union recognises that India is an emerging, democratic power that should be given more votes and the right to vote on international issues, the Member States have not yet been able to agree whether or not they should support the permanent membership of New Delhis in the UN Security Council.
This issue was not discussed at yesterday's ninth summit in Marseille.
The French President and current EU President Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as President José Manuel Barroso and Chief Diplomat Javier Solana received Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. An agreement was reached that trade should be doubled over the next five years, i.e. up to EUR 100 billion.
Given the fact that trade between 2000 and 2007 had risen from 25 to 55 billion, this objective is not even so ambitious.
In this sense, the 26 existing civil aviation agreements with India have also been legally grouped into an agreement, so that air transport will also be moved in the future.
By 2009, India would like to sign the free trade agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the pact.
The aim is to create a balance in the current imbalance between the EU and India: while the Union is the partner number one of India, New Delhi is only at rank nine among the EU partners.
The summit was dedicated to global concerns.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, or terrorism, was strongly condemned by both sides, and the call for a UN conference was urged.
The Doha Round should also be concluded, with both sides being blamed for failure.
The EU emphasised that it would maintain its energy and climate programme, i.e. that the emissions of pollutants should be reduced by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agreed to this, as was the proposal to conclude a sort of global compromise at the forthcoming Climate Summit and to reduce greenhouse gas production by 50% by 2050.
The increase in food prices should also be tackled, so both support the convening of an international conference on financial crisis.
The Indian Head of Government is visiting the French capital today, where he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
In Paris, however, it is hoped for contracts to French companies worth EUR 20 billion for the construction of nuclear reactors in India.
According to agency notifications, the agreement is to be decided for 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the International Frankfurter Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishers will be present at the 60th Book Fair, the most important international event for the acquisition of rights.
The International Frankfurter Book Fair awaits over 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries for the current event. They will spread over the 171,790 square meters of the fair and introduce over 403,000 titles. Turkey will be the guest of honour of the event.
The secretary of the Ministry of Cultural Goods and Cultural Activities Maria Giro will represent the Italian Government during the opening ceremony in the exhibition hall: Italy will be represented in the 264 sqm exhibition room "Punto Italia."
A press conference near the room structure in the exhibition hall 5.0 of the book fair will follow: at this occasion, numbers, trends and perspectives will be discussed around the publishing system in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of books by foreign writers is decreasing throughout, but especially in the adult and youth groups.
The little plane of the billionaire Steve Fossett recovered a year ago.
The small plane of Steve Fossett, who was discovered on a flight over the desert of Nevada on September 3, 2007, was a billionaire.
The individual parts were found on a 3,000 m high plateau, in the Sierra Nevada Mammoth Lakes area between the states of California and Nevada.
However, within the plane there were no human remains.
The sheriff of Madera County, John Anderson, completely defeated the last doubts during a press conference: "The plane has been located, to which a troop was sent. Now we have the security that it is the plane with which Steve Fossett flew on the day of his disappearance."
Mr. Anderson also confirmed that no human remains were found on the plane or its proximity.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The American Office for Transport Safety (Ntsb) announced that a team was sent out a few hours after the plane was spotted, which identified the machine: it was the Bellanca 8kcab lost on September 3, 2007 after Fossett started a three-hour flight in Nevada in Yerington.
Yesterday, also in California, near the border with Nevada, some of Fossett's personal objects were found by a couple close to their house on the Mammoth Lakes.
These are two cards with the name Fossetts, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of illinois, cash and a jacket.
The search for Fossett had been abandoned a month after its disappearance.
The billionaire had taken a place in history by a long sequence of records.
In 2002 he succeeded in the sixth start, as the first person to circle the world ball in a hot air balloon: a two-week, lonely flight.
Three years later, he flew the world in a single flight without an intermediate landing with a plane.
Among his numerous records is a 15445 m altitude flight over the Andes, but this with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect
A suv, which falls from traditional designs by its original design and the special line direction, the loading surface and its clear angles.
Mercedes-Benz has tried with this offroader to crush new breath into the sector.
Just because of its extraordinary properties, the idea of the Suv Glk will also be unconventional, which will be seen from 17 October in the show room of Mercedes-Benz.
Thus, the advertisement, which will accompany the appearance of the new model, will also appear in a new dress, namely in the form of a 3D campaign - this is a novelty in the car sector in the backward Italy.
A project with a maximum effort to be carried out in various stages that will take the central shopping mile of Mailands, the Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase will consist of the presentation of the car in the form of 3D glasses distributed near the Corso Como to give the whole a special look: the new Suv will thus appear in its almost real dimensions as a tridimensional model.
In fact, the car appears to emerge from the poster on which it is pictured.
With the help of the Elumina8 technology the new Glk will be illuminated at different moments in all its details to reassemble itself as a whole.
It is undoubtedly the concern of Mercedes with this advertising to introduce a new type of author advertising into this rather stereotype field.
But will it succeed in rising the interest of future buyers? We will see it.
Now it's clear who the Italian hooligans are
They come from the Triveneto - now they risk stadio ban
Who are only these 150-200 boys and girls for whom Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia," which has been travelling behind the Italian national team for years and which, frankly, until recently did not cause any serious problems.
There has never been any conflict with opponents.
The group originates in the right environment.
The promoters are from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
Other smaller groups from Campania and Apulia came to these in Sofia.
They carry the tricolori on which the cities of the militants appear: but they were removed on Saturday to avoid identification.
Their models are the English fans.
In Bulgaria, there has now been a collapse with a truly right-wing fancy scene, that of Levski.
The Figc had provided the Italian fans 144 cards for the game: all were issued on names and thus easy to control.
In fact, they were all controlled by the Viminal: none of them ripped to Sofia was subject to an ongoing stadium ban.
Four fans of the Italian team, who had already been pressured in this respect, were also denied the ticket and the trip to Bulgaria.
Now the Viminal awaits the reports of the Bulgarian police to take further steps: in this case, the arrested or identified Tifosi can expect a stadion ban of at least five years.
This is an international ban which prevents access to the stages throughout Europe.
So our hooligans will no longer put a foot in a stadium.
Good luck.
But now there is, of course, fear of imitation towns which could follow them little more than 150.
"This fire must be expelled immediately, and that does not in any case give such a behavior the opportunity to justify" is said from the Viminal.
Therefore, "Eyes on especially also with a view to the game of the national team on Wednesday in Lecce."
Indeed, in Apulia there is a small core of the Italian Ultras.
Tomorrow the Osservatorio (sports supervisor) gathers, on Tuesday the Casms, which can count on part of the Aise, i.e. the secret services that deal with the problem of the stadium violence.
"Duce-Duce call and the raised right arm during Mameli's hymn? In Bulgaria this is not a crime..."
This is the thought of Domenico Mazzilli (clearly expressed in no joy), who has been the director of the Osservatorio on the Viminal for a few weeks (he took over the post of Francensco Tagliente and Felice Ferlizzi on it).
Previously Mazzilli was the police president of Trieste, where now a core of the supporters of Ultras Italia founded in 2002.
Although it is true, Mazzilli says that in Bulgaria it is not against the law to praise the Duce, but undoubtedly the behaviour of these 150-200 people was a shame.
"I am not a sociologist - adding the number 1 of the Osservatorio - crimes are condemned in the country of their actions.
So far, this group had remained in the fence, but now it has to be reviewed what has happened and will be done.
But we also talk about the puppets during the Hymne Mamelis: even if this is not a crime, but allow me, there is no education.... "
