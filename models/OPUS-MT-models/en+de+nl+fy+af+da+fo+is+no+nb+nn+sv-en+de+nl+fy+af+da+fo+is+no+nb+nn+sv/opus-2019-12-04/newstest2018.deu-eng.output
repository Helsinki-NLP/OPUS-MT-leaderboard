Munich 1856: Four maps that change your view of the city
A crazy institution where young people are supposed to meet today.
A pit chapel, where the S-Bahn tunnel is now engraved.
Kleingärtner manages the first reason of farmers.
The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories to day.
It's annoying when maps are not up to date.
Anyone who had to get excited before, because the car Navi instead of an umbrella street showed a green meadow.
The historical maps of the digital Bavaria Atlases, an offer of the Geoportal Bavaria of the government, are all different from the present - but this is precisely why very obvious.
Especially when compared with current online cards.
Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the spatial area of the Munich Merkur since the 19th century.
The digital Bavarian Atlas is a girl's tape that you do not recognize as such.
More detailed maps, so-called Urpositionsblätter, have been included in the large overview map for cities and municipalities.
According to the Bayerische Vermessungsverwaltung, these were created between 1810 and 1864 and originated from the first Bayerns measurement.
Your client: Napoleon.
The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.
Even though the French troops finally withdrew with the peace of Lunéville from February 9, 1801, it was today's neighbours who created the idea of a Bavarian surface-covering map.
Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph continued the project, founded the "Topographic Bureau" - and thus the Bayerische Messungsverwaltung.
The Urpositionsblatt for Munich comes from 1856 and is available on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek.
The comparison early / today is the most impressive example of the country capital.
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.
One example of this is the subshipment that appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.
Sendling was congregated 21 years after the creation of the map, that is, 1877, as a Münchner Stadtteil.
Today the submarine lies in the middle of the city.
The houses Untersendlings concentrate around 1856 along today's Plinganserstraße, which was first named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the rebellion of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705.
Where the West Park is today, you see nothing but fields - at first glance: When zooming in, a more small map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: hand-numbered blocks from the so-called "start-up" from which the basic tax was derived.
Small parcels no longer show farmers there today - but small peasants of the "Land in Sonne."
A large green area is located north of Untersendling.
The Theresienwiese, since 1810 Schauplatz des Oktoberfests, was actually still a meadow - and no concrete desert in the 19th century.
On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the Urpositionsblatt you read not only the street name "am Gasteig" in the territory of today's district Au-Haidhausen, but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt."
Yes, here at the exterior street, people were once locked up with delusions.
In 1858 / 59 the Munich Circle Irrenanstalt "On the Auer Lifts" was created.
From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the institution - the psychiatrist who was brought in connection with the death of King Louis II.
"He was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the chain of so-called madmen.
In addition, he has forbidden the staff to use violence against the prisoners, "says Hermann Wilhelm, Head of the Haidhausen Museum, who has worked for an exhibition with the institution.
For 280 patients there was first room, and later it was extended to 500 places.
At some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Circular Irrenanstalt in Hair in 1905.
Since 2006 there is the Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-East, one of the largest psychiatrist in Germany.
In the area of the former Auer Anstalt young people now meet in the Munich Salesianum.
The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training establishments.
West is the football square of the TSV Munich East, east residential houses from the 1980s.
In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built in an architectural sense of the original building of the Irrenanstalt, which was destroyed in the Second World War in bombing.
The Marienplatz was recorded around 1856 as "Head Place," the Kaufingerstraße was called "Kaufinger Gasse."
A decisive change also brought the Second World War into the heart of Munich.
In December 1944, the bombs of the Allies ripped many holes into the city.
A big one remained until today - at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, small business houses and a medieval mining chapel once stood at the Marienhof, where these days the preparatory work and on April 5, 2017 the spade engraving for the second S-Bahn tribal route.
The old Munich card can be compared with today's air image - and the hole at the Marienhof.
Citizens' Rights Group publishes Travel Warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of Colors has issued a warning for colored people travelling to Missouri due to the discriminatory policy and the state's racist attacks.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which is to enter into force until 28 August 2017, calls on African-American travellers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention and to give extreme caution when travelling through the State, as a number of questionable racial incidents have recently occurred throughout the state and are listed here," says the Group's opinion.
A recently adopted law of Missouri, which makes it harder for people to win discriminatory actions, as well as the law enforcement authorities of the state, which are disproportionate to minorities, prompted the group to issue the travel warning, the NAACP said.
"They have violations of civil rights that happen to people.
They are stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten together or killed, "said the president of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.
"We hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet."
It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States.
The group quoted incidents such as racist crimes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more gasoline during the journey through the state and was taken into custody by the Missouri police without being accused of a crime.
The Council also points out a recent report by the Office of the Prosecutor General of Missouri, which shows that black drivers in the state are 75% more frequent than white ones.
"The recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel.
"People need to be ready to bring bail money or let their relatives know that they travel through the state."
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI hate crime report program, which classified the state in terms of the number of such injuries to the 16th rank of the country.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law which would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, after the states had adopted immigration laws, obliging local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration violations, which the ACLU believes will contribute to further racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but recently stakeholders have used the measure to respond to certain laws and trends within the US.
Weidesaun project is elementary
The Fiserbacher Weidezaun project is a success project and will continue next year.
The CDU Bundestag delegates Peter White and Kordula Kovac have made a picture on site.
At the right-grave court of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fiserbacher CDU local association met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members.
Markus Schwendemann first gave insights into his farm, where he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, provides 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and hosts in five apartments.
The "black-walled milk" is the alternative marketing route for the milk of his cows, according to Schwendemann.
On the table of the holiday guests comes exclusively regional.
Since he is also BLHV chairman of Fischerbach, he described the Weidezaun project as "elementary important."
I can't make a profitable economy on such steep areas.
The green land area provides a lot of work, much has to be handled with the engine sense.
"We have to fight here with the conditions and topography," Schwendemann stressed.
In 2003 he took over the parent holding and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if it did not run a biofarm.
For Mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear: "The municipality has recognised the importance of the pasture project and is pleased with the support of Leader."
Farmers would have to be supported at a cost of between EUR 3000 and EUR 4000 per hectare.
It is hoped that this would allow the reforestation of the land to be withdrawn for a long time.
"The biggest treasure we have are the people who work in agriculture and think about how they carry on doing their business," the mayor stressed.
Farmers are often criticized for support
In 2013, a total of 25 parcels of eleven participants were incorporated into the production of grassland.
The area of disclosure is thus 40 hectares, which may not be harvested until at least 2023.
Of the total cost of EUR 71 500, half was funded through Leader, one quarter of which was carried by the municipality of Fischerbach.
Thus, farmers remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of farmland.
"The great advantage is the longevity of the fences," Schwendemann said.
Kordula Kovac stressed: "You are doing a really good job, without farmers and farmers."
Peter White also said: "Best food is produced here."
The Landscaping Court (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows the state to promote pastures.
The aim is to keep the Black Forest open.
The precondition is that there is a support cushion designated by the LPR.
In addition, the sealing area must not be traceable (over 35 per cent hanging) and must therefore be threatened by reforestation.
For the Fiserbacher Weidezaunprojekt 2018, the application is currently under way by eight participants with 24 parcels who want to build almost 16 kilometers of fence.
The area of disclosure corresponds to 35 hectares and the estimated cost is over EUR 112 000.
Is nothing more sacred?
Now the White House of Trump takes the Statue of Liberty
The safest sign of a regime change is when they start attacking the statues.
The Americans appreciate this as well as any other - therefore the carefree crash of Saddam Husseins in the Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN on the president's proposals for drastic limitation of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty.
To be fair, Miller didn't attack the statue himself.
A bunch of boat owners and Liberty imitators would have flashed him if he had.
But he attacked their meaning, and in particular the meaning that was attributed to her when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus was added in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, its base.
When Miller Acosta criticized, "I don't want to go into a whole thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem you refer to, which was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "
Miller is in fact right, but as he said himself, it's not really about history.
It is about the contemporary response to Lazarus's immortal words, the only one in which a state invites not only some old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your tiredness, your poor, your troubled masses who desire to breathe freely, / the miserable waste of your rich coasts."
There was never a time when the "miserable waste" was better to see on our screens.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Trumps USA are not welcome.
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural dispute: it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America.
Lazarus - and her friends who tried to put their words at the base after her death - knew very well that they were performing a highly political act.
The sculpture should show the connections between French and American Republican by presenting the female embodiment of freedom in an abused classic picturesque.
Lazarus changed this meaning: In her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.
And she gives herself a completely different name: Mother of the Exilants.
The connection of the poem to the picture is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the significance of the statue, people from the right wing wanted to change it back for a long time.
The great screaming Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John of the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the liberty statue is not invited anyone but rather an early neo-conservative that brings the American flame to the surrounded world: "Lady Liberty is moving forward.
She's supposed to wear the facel of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch should not illuminate the way to the United States. "
Pretty unusual Limbaugh hit something here.
The importance of the statue is quite a matter of perception.
The great fantastic deed of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted, miserable but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships.
It is in the real sense to see the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and an opportunity to improve their lives.
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they need to hear.
And of course, that's not the perspective Miller and Trump ever want to recognise.
Their torch shall not illuminate the way, but the hatred that is their only source of power shall burn.
World Championship 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two shots belonged to the UK team
The executive director of the UK's body tathletics, Neil Black, says that the 16-headed Scottish quota in the World Championship Framework "will make a massive contribution to the team."
A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.
Black believes that "something special develops in Scotland" and the UK's body tathletics need to learn something from it.
"We welcome it, and we try to understand it, and we will continue it until we find out," said Black.
"I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they did.
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they did.
British body lethology: It has something to do with what they have done.
And with the guy at the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant. "
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will fight Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track, while Eilidh Doyle was elected by the team as a team captain.
"Eilidh is pretty modest.
Your captain's speech was incredible, "says Black.
"A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of space and felt very proud and were very motivated.
The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh naturally brought in were great. "
The Commonwealth silver medal winner, who will take part in their fifth world championships at the 400-m hurdles, says it's "incredible" that 16 shots are in the British team.
Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.
Muir, the mediterranean runner, has been leading this way and has set up five British and two European records last year.
It will participate in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotch that one should observe after a great season, which included the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembered her first world championships when the only other shooter in the team was Lee McConnell.
The crew captain says that she is "extremely proud" of the fact that many of her countrymen are not only part of the team, but in some cases will also mix with the medals and finals.
"The special thing about being a team captain is that she was elected by the other members of the team, so it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my team colleagues voted for me and chose me makes it something very special for me," she added.
"Obviously, I am very proud of all the shots that belong to the team.
It just shows how far we've come.
And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to go on poddies.
What about my speech as a captain?
Yeah, I think she went well.
I have just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.
So it is really important to rely on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back in the Olympic stadium.
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and there will just be such a great atmosphere out there. "
Blocking critics through Facebook: Do not turn around a public office if you can't tolerate the heating of voters
The father of our country knew something about bad press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long until the newspapers beat him because of everything, from internal politics to his political principles.
He was cheating on the criticism, I'm sure.
But he didn't make his critics silent.
Because in 1783 Washington said, "The freedom of speech can be removed - and, dumb and dumb we will be led to slaughter like the sheep."
This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington.
Hogan's employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for that at the beginning of this week.
The governor's staff dismissed the complaint as freely, and the online comment was full of a counter reaction with "Well, and?."
"It's just Facebook," said many people.
But it's important.
And it's especially important if it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is astonishing popular.
He has the second highest consent of the 50 governors of the nation.
Hogan is not a reactionary heat head.
He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict compliance with the principles.
He was also very good at using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and play his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side.
Therefore, the blockage of people coming to the governor's side - which is a public forum called officially and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the Governor's actions and argued that the blocking of comments was nothing but a moderation.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hatred-filled people that swing the whistle online.
The mail spoke to some of the real people that were blocked by Hogan.
And these are only real people who speak with their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a parish, no troll.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not prophetic.
The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hated, but she asked for hate crimes.
"I commented politically that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the comment area of the news broadcast "The Post."
"I do not appreciate this idea either, if a number of people comment on the same subject, they are ignored by some rather than a so-called collective effort and not recognised as a large group of affected citizens."
What the Governor's employees called "concentrated spam attack," others would probably call "intercession."
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in the past if one had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect newspapers with critical headlines and burn or arrest demonstrators and bring them to silence.
But that's exactly what's happening digital.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for having crushed Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones on this issue fell in Virginia last week.
The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County violated the first amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banished a voter from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
At the moment Washington's time of affordable portos had a similar effect as the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter writers attacked his leadership.
And even then, Washington had anonymous troll.
The people who used Pseudonyms like "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote all letters of newspapers that made Washington's decisions.
Petitions that criticized his position on the Treaty of Amity, trade and shipping with Britain overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project.
But he didn't keep her quiet.
Freedom of speech, disagreement and discourse are the basis of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comfort at the Renaissance Club
The former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for domestic comfort in the next three days, as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian will organize the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Nordire, who led links next to the Archerfield to the final round last year before he lost against Paul Eales, is connected to the new location and acts as a tournament ambassador on behalf of the association founder and CEOs Jerry Sarvadi.
"I have seen how the Renaissance Club was built, and we see how he achieved his glory with this event," said Rafferty.
"The players will see this course from his best side, it is in a great condition.
Jerry did a great job when he set this place.
He is an eager defender of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great window for this course. "
The English Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, although in his 32-year career he won both at the European Tour and at the European Challenge Tour.
"This really feels special," said the player imitated in Southport.
"I have not been able to defend the Extremadura Open since it was taken from the program in the year after I had won it.
Coming back to this part of the world is magical.
It's a wonderful place to play golf.
The memories from last year come back, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate. "
Gary Orr, who came to the European Senior Tour earlier this year after his 50th birthday, returns to home floor for action.
This event will be its first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a little more when you play at home," said Orr, the man from Helensburgh.
"You want to make it right, but you also feel this extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again, and I played a solid golf.
I'm glad how it went so far. "
With the trio on the field are the former masters winner Ian Woosnam and the senior major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six shots on the field, the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
The entrance is free, the parking lot costs £5 per car with one occupant and £10 per car with two or more occupants.
All revenues go to Prostate Cancer UK.
Less pulmonary cancers due to passive smoke
In the past two decades, fewer and fewer people have died of lung cancer due to passive smoking.
This results in a study by scientists from the University Clinic Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE).
"According to our estimates, 167 pulmonary cancers per year are due to passive smoke," said Head of Study Heiko Becher.
As a comparison, he used his own study on this subject from 1994.
At that time, there were still 400 lung cancer cases due to passive smoke per year in Germany.
The new investigation is published in the International Journal of Public Health.
Household connections prove to be very complex
The construction works on the Villinger street are in full progress and "lie somewhat in time," said the head of the Bauhof Fred Heinze.
In the area of household connections, the situation is more complicated than suspected, as in the underground there is a lot of hiding, which is not listed in the plans.
Traffic, which repeatedly hinders construction works, is a major problem for the company Stumpp's construction team.
"The ignorance of the drivers before red lights and guitar guitar is already enormous," Heinze reports.
The road was blocked and only the buses were allowed to transit.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from the company Stumpp have been working on the bridge for weeks.
"The hot days have been quite exhausting.
But lucky we were provided with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt, "says Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and death in Indonesian gold land
If Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she won't use a stove.
She rarely uses a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai Regent in the troubled Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually puts a sweet potato - locally called "note" - directly into the fireplace.
After half an hour, the chilled knoll is removed and swallowed with fierce, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the clay plate - she has no furniture - where she also carries out her daily work, for example to wash clothes with dry water from the nearby swamp.
A bucket in a roofless room serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of the four wives of her husband, no fields were assigned to her.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, late work can be dangerous: most villagers are unemployed, and many drink hard, and there are the soldiers here.
"No one dares to walk around the village after 5: 00," she says.
It is a rare insight into daily life in the Highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony, which was recorded in 1969 after a contested referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 elderly should vote by a public survey in front of the occupation forces.
An existing movement for independence against the Dutch rule quickly turned against the government of Jakarta, which maintains control over the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers from it.
In 2003 the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea covering the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as remote as it is deserted. The trip includes a 90-minute flight from the province capital Jayapura to Nabire and then a 5-hour drive by car in the morning.
There is no public transport.
The city with about 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo tones, and of wool sheet ceilings transformed by rust into various yellow brown tones.
Only very few Indonesians have made their journey here, as journalists and practically no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuan worshipped a god named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes.
"We were not used to wearing these clothes," says Degei and points to her vibrant, handwoven turban, her dark shirt and her bright skirt.
"We used to have only leaves on our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst child mortality and alphabetism rates in Asia.
But it's Indonesia's golden country as well.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, owned by the Freeport McMoran from Phoenix, is just 60 miles from Paniai, a high country province in the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants.
In 2015 alone Freeport has reduced gold and copper worth of 3.1 billion dollars.
In addition, Papua has wooden resources worth an estimated 78 billion US dollars.
However, these riches are a source of misery for the Papua to ensure that Indonesia's powerful military preserves a suffocating presence.
A 2005 New York Times survey reported that Freeport paid local military members and units between 1998 and 2004 almost $20 million, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.
Papuanese demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden goose and are treated without mercy.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and detained by Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass deaths in Papua's tribal high country in the 1970s became a genocide in accordance with the Asia Human Rights Commission.
In the region alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful demonstrators last year.
"We are going to lose everything" is said in a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, which contains reports on the cruelty of the previous year, such as illegal executions and torture - rape and electric beats are particularly popular according to another report - and the brutal defeat of peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to count the number of victims as incidents happen every week," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesian researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have strengthened since Papua's resources bring a flow of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83% Christian, but demographic development changes as Muslim economic migrants come from the populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese Warning Cantines sell brown chicken and Gado Gado, a mixed vegetable served with peanut sauce.
Local people fight to keep up here.
"Migrants have begun to sell chickens and vegetables cheaper on the traditional market than the local Papua," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old paniai resident who moved to the province capital Jayapura to work.
"It has cost the domestic Papua - the Mommy [the women] of Papua - their market."
During his 2014 election campaign, Indonesian President Joko Widodo, known as Jokowi, promised to tackle inequalities and violations of law in Papua.
The former roommate secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua - including Paniai - on the way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta.
But in Papua little has changed, and today the locals feel deceived.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014, with the expectation that he will meet our hopes that justice will be restored," says You.
In fact, Paniai suffered a deep point only two months after Jokowis's inauguration in October.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas songs in front of a camp fire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the dark on a motorcycle.
The frightened kids told them to turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers took off her tone and later returned with four soldiers, so the local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had drunk chased and beat the group with their rifles, said victims and witnesses.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
A child, the 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was hit so hard that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered in a football square in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice.
They wore ceremonial hunting bows and introduced the Waita dance - in circle and a bird song imitating - by Papuas Mee Pago tribe.
Some demonstrators began to slide stones at police and military posts.
When the mood was heated, a warrant was sent to the soldiers via an internal radio: "If the masses make more than three times resistance, they shoot them dead," it says in an official document of TIME that was not released to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto district of Enarotali, saw the threatening danger and called for rest and asked the crowd to return home.
No one was listening in the mood.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in my left wrist," he said TIME on the veranda of his colorful wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired, but says the bullet came out of the rows of the soldiers gathered here.
"It was overfilled, many shots were fired," he added.
The local man Alfius Youw was hit three times, according to his cousin, who witnessed the shooting.
"I ran to him and studied his body to make sure it was him," said Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, only has one name, the TIME in darkest mood.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
The Chief Inspector of the Papua Police, Yotje Mende, said that his officers wanted to "secure" their station only because she was attacked.
"We must defend ourselves if people are threatening to kill us," said the speaker of the Papua police, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, in 2015.
"It's about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young demonstrators were killed and many more injured.
The news of the killings came to Jakarta only on the following day 'filtered'.
Three weeks in Jayapura, Jokowi held a passionate speech in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and swore to deal with the historical misgivings in Papua.
"I want this case to be resolved immediately so that it will not happen in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he was setting up a non-judicial mechanism to resolve historical human rights violations.
But the excuses started almost immediately.
"Most injuries occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 90's and early 2000's.
The point is that we have committed ourselves to dealing with these infringements, but there are processes that need to go through, "he said.
Then Wiranto made a withdrawal when he spoke to TIME on June 5 in Jakarta and said that he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, "everything is regulated by law," he said.
Wiranto, who accused the UN of "crimes against humanity," which called for more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor's bloody independence vote in 1999, said that 11 cases of human rights violations have already been settled in Papua, including the Paniai incident.
The families of the Paniai victims took up such claims with grim infidelity.
"I've been interviewed four times in the last three years, but there was no progress," says Yohanes.
"I'm tired."
He says years later, he still lives in fear.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I'm afraid to be arrested by the military, I'm afraid to be shot."
His brother Yacobus repeated the opinion that people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four of the victims.
"After I buried the bodies, the military was looking for me," he says.
The shooting hasn't stopped.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot villagers in Paniais neighborhood Deiyai.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to bring a unconscious man to the hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man who was 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who had drowned when he was fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Rebellious villagers protested in front of the company's office.
The police said the villagers threw stones to officers who responded by firing warnings.
But locals say that the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) started shooting at the crowd and killed one.
"We were so in panic, we're afraid there will be revenge," says the 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured have been brought here quickly, "says the TIME.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the officers involved to be accountable and the police's mobile brigade to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai was always an unrest for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the dissatisfaction of the tribes Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal who live in the green highland of Papua.
Many joined the "Free Papua Movement" (OPM), the Rebel Army, who claims to defend the rights of the Papua by launching sporadic attacks and abductions of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders are from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
As a response to this, thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested in recent years and arbitrarily detained under the pretext of "safeguarding national sovereignty."
Some never show up again.
Among the people in Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place."
Poverty strengthens dissatisfaction.
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for residents.
Bread is just as far out of reach.
People here are building everything they eat: especially notas and fruit and leaf vegetables.
Agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potatoes each.
They keep most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have grown between the local Papua and the new migrants who have arrived at Nabire Airport since the opening of new routes.
The few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the more trained and prosperous migrants.
Papua rarely has the capital or the necessary capabilities to run its own companies competitive.
"The young people are not interested in staying in the village... because there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, the chairman of the Paniai tribe.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
In addition, restrictions on reporting of international media remain tense.
At the beginning of the year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported for lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua, although they were given the rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, the Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokowis's campaign to lift the restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development were not realized.
"There are new dangers for foreign journalists who try to report from Indonesia's most disturbing eastern provinces of Papua and Westpapua: visa refusal and a black list," he said in a statement.
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian Government is largely limited to the immediate neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific States - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Salomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "various and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
The same countries have historically supported the OPM.
The speaker of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Arrmanatha Nasir rejected the group's accusations and said journalists in Jakarta: "In Indonesia there is still a democratic system, and there is free media, so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights cases."
People on the ground want more foreign governments to take note of this.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, under the leadership of human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on 4 May, indigenous people broke their silence and pressed him "We want freedom," according to a source that also took part in the meeting but wanted to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papua say that they will probably not vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a man who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Paniai shots," says Gobai, the chairman of the tribe council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, apart from living under the constant threat of a robbery military, are in poor education and health services.
Gobai says that the Paniai people, like other Papua, regard their voice for Jokowi as a "guilt" he has to pay back.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and intimidations of the Paniai shooting victims, a final symbolic act of the trot was carried out: the body of a victim was buried in a site just opposite the police and the military station.
They know that perhaps justice will never come to them, but at least they will not let those responsible forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," says Yacobus with lowered head.
"What else can we do?"
Fire capture the 'torch' cloud crater of Dubai for the second time
A fire was found on Friday in one of the world's highest residential towers in Dubai and forced hundreds of residents to escape from the 337 meters high, 79-storey building.
It is the second fire that flies through the high house in just two years, which is by chance called the torch tower (torch tower).
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported, and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame.
"We slept and we got up in the fire alarm and screaming people.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50th floor, "said a residents who gave his name as George, Reuters.
Dubai's civil protection authorities said that at 4: 00 (00: 00 GMT) the fire was eliminated and the building was cooled.
The government said she was working on providing accommodation to the people concerned.
The incident can revitalize questions about the safety of materials used in external areas of high-level homes around the world.
An investigation by the management of the torch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage from the clothing, outer clothing, came to decoration or insulation.
In the UK, the police said that they believe that the system of plates for insulation and clothing at the London Grenfell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire where about 80 people died.
No Davis Cup Reform: Next Best-of-five
The President of the International Tennis Association (ITF) has passed through his great Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly.
At the meeting in Ho-Chi-Minh City, the revolutionary proposal for this sport to play Davis Cup single only at two rates was not supported by the necessary two-thirds majority.
The five-set classics, often very long, but also very appreciated for that reason, remain therefore preserved by the tradition application.
63.54% of the Member States voted in favour of the reform, so the objective of ITF President David Haggerty was only slightly missed.
"We respect this decision, but we are disappointed that our members have not accepted the whole reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
We need a change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historical competitions, "said Haggerty.
It will continue to work to improve the applications.
After many objections, the proposal had already been made to make the final in a neutral place.
New from 2018 are only comparatively smaller details: for example, finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have the right to host in the first round in the following year.
In order to reduce the costs for the organisers, the requirements regarding training places, etc., will be facilitated and players will have to make less official media dates before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 out of 5 US travellers bring forbidden items to the plane, find out a survey
A survey among air passengers showed that more than 20 percent consciously or unconsciously forbidden items are passed by the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration, including at least 6 percent of which entered the plane while they accidentally carried banned knives or other objects with blade.
Less than 1 percent claimed that they had discovered late that they had travelled wrong with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people - carried out by a jet charter service, the Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also found that younger travellers would rather violate the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they wisely tried to fly with something that was forbidden by the TSA, 19.7 percent were millennials, compared to less than 15 percent that were members of generation X.
The most common items that were deliberately passed by TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3 percent admitted wisely carrying objects with blade through security control, while 2.2 percent of the female respondents and 3.7 percent of the male respondents also confirmed that they had deliberately forbidden drugs to the plane.
The company said it had questioned travellers throughout the country to find out how many accidentally brought smuggling goods through airport security and how many would have deliberately done it.
It is no surprise that people who carry the most eager smuggling goods - knowingly or unknowingly - through safety were those who flew the most frequently.
However, the company points out that the TSA directives are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often unsure of what fluids they can take or how much of them.
So it is no surprise that the largest amount of liquids that the TSA has seized are prohibited.
For a while, people thought the TSA could consider books as smuggling goods.
Liquid fluids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk doesn't care: Ten thousand Tesla customers cancel order
Electric-thousands-sassa Elon Musk is happy to present with the huge number of reservations for his new Tesla "Model 3."
He has so far prevented some of the customers from withdrawing their non-binding reservation.
In addition to the ever-triumphant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla-Chef Elon Musk, when announcing the recent quarterly balance, for the first time betrayed another, less brilliant number: the number of cancellations in the new mass market model 3.
In recent months Musk had often recruited the more than 500,000 reservations for the new car whose extradition is beginning.
Now Musk admits: Of the total 518,000 reservations, 63,000 have already been withdrawn.
Critics had repeatedly pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations.
In case of cancellation, Tesla fully repayes the €1000 (in the US $1000 and in Great Britain £1000) "reservation deposit."
At the moment there were 455,000 such non-binding reservations, Musk invited him to a telephone conference with analysts.
However, the Tesla Chief does not believe that the cancellation of around 12 percent of all orders so far could become a problem.
His argument is that the challenge of the ambitious growth targets is not demand but production.
Last year Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
2018 - all models together - are to be 500,000, a million in 2020.
The demand for this is obviously there.
According to Musk there are currently 1800 reservations per day.
If you order a "Model 3" today, you can expect the extradition at the earliest half of 2018 - if Tesla succeeds in driving its nail-new production streets that have never been tested in practice without major interruptions.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
However, if there are greater delays, then the imbinding of the reservations could become the problem for Tesla.
Because then the company cannot prevent unsatisfied customers from running away in scissors.
EPO Chief Pruitt withdraws due to the delay in the Obama era rules to reduce emissions
One day, after being sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Authority, withdrew his previous decision to delay the implementation of the Obama-era rules to reduce emissions of smog pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change when his agency demonstrated the needs of state environmental authorities to respond faster than previous administrations.
He did not mention the action brought against his previous body in a federal appeal court.
It is a deadline that expired on 1 October for states to comply with 2015 standards for soil-taking ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by one year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid "interfering in local decisions or obstructing economic growth."
Pruitt, who was the prosecutor of Oklahoma before he was appointed by President Donald Trump, was a long time a reliable opponent of stricter environmental protection rules.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations that the chemical industry and the fossil fuel industry oppose.
The sudden turn of Wednesday is the latest legal setback for the Pruitts regulatory Rollback Agenda.
Last month, a federal appeal court in Washington decided that the EPO administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration, obliging oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methanlecks.
In an opinion published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that its turn to ozone standards would simply strengthen the EPO's willingness to cooperate with the States through the complex process of timely compliance with the new standards.
"Under previous administrations, the EPO has often failed to comply with the deadlines for implementation and then waited for the accusation of activists and others, and agreed to set the date for implementation," said Pruitt, who sued the EPO more than a dozen times in his previous job.
"We do not believe in legal regulation, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the law and authority that we have seriously. "
Nevertheless, the EPO's opinion that Pruitt will eventually use its "delay and all other legal powers" to ensure that the rules "are based on a sound policy and the best available information."
The Republicans in the Congress urge a more comprehensive recast of the ozone rules.
A draft law adopted last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate.
The New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of the states that had brought the EPO to trial this week, said that the group intends to maintain the legal pressure.
"The reversal of the EPO - according to our complaints - is an important profit for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by smog that flows into their communities," Schneiderman said.
New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia.
soil ozone occurs when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.
The emerging smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people and contribute to thousands of premature deaths every year.
Representatives of public health and environmental protectors cheered over Pruitts surprising change of course.
"It is worrying how much pressure it takes to get this sensible step of the person responsible for the protection of the air we breathe in," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight the Trump government's ideological cruise to offer ourselves to environmental pollutants and their special interests."
Tumbling celebrates 750 years St. Hilarius Church
750 years St. Hilarius Church: On Sunday, 16 July, at 4: 30 a.m., a Serenade is invited to the old cemetery site in Tumlingen.
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village is the historic St. Hilarius facility is a popular place to stay.
Visitors of the sixth Benefiz-Serenade can be enchanted from this powerful place.
The rescuing and preservation of the oldest building in the place has made the friends and promoters of tumbling their concern.
Walter Martini emphasises: "It is a unique dull little od."
In 1267 the St. Hilariukapelle was first mentioned in the Württemberg Paperbook: Count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church on it to Tumlingen and the vogtei" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silber.
According to the text of the document on the Tumlinger Mountain other than the first parish church, there was also a glorious court to which the Church or Patronate Law belonged and not vice versa.
So there were people living there too.
As the description of the Oberamt Freudenstadt of 1858 shows, alongside the Unterdorf and Oberdorf, which are still to be seen today in the picture of Tumlingen, the "mountain" of the third, the ruling settlements of the village.
Old cards from the time around the year 1600 underpin these historical circumstances.
The Patronate Law was created from the early medieval self-church law.
A gentleman who built a church, exhibited it and occupied it with a priest, remained the owner of this church and could inherit it it.
This led to the right to use a priest or to propose a new priest to the bishop.
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.
The largest of the two will break down on Christmas 1673.
The newly purchased bell was first opened in 1692, but had to be released later in the Second World War in 1942.
In the 30-year war (1616 to 1648) the windows were struck and the bell ropes were stolen.
The roof was undense.

They broke out the crane and churches and used them as a firewood.
The remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.
Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.
In 1823 the cemetery was expanded and the Hilarius church was cancelled.
Only the church tower was abandoned.
In the New Year's Night in 1834, a storm broke down the church tower and half collapsed.
In order to prevent an accident, the tower was broken down.
Only the tower still exists today remained a witness to the 750-year-old church history.
Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem of the "Shepherd Pensioners" as the successor of Dieter Dockhorn maintain the Hilarius plant.
As an organizer, the friends and promoters invite Tumlingens on Sunday, 16 July to the sixth Serenade at the old cemetery to the St. Hilarius Chapel.
This is designed by the Combo of the Kepler Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with words from Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
President Hartmut Romann speaks the final word.
The program starts at 4: 30.
The entrance is at 3: 30.
To the end of the Serenade a trunk takes place in front of the cemetery.
"Enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest," the organisers present the fantastic view.
The Serenade takes place only in dry weather.
The organizers hope for many supporters to maintain the historic St. Hilarius plant, which is important for tumors and listeners.
The friends and promoters of Tumlingens feel particularly committed to home care, as Serenade organizer Walter Martini confirms.
Association wants to check approval of wind wheels
"Boisheim resists" does not see any legal prerequisite for construction and has therefore turned to the Landrat.
The association "Boisheim is opposed" has asked Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind power plants in the Boisheimer network.
It was unlawful.
The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 no wind power plants could have been approved in the Boisheimer network, since at that time in Viersen only a wind power concentration zone existed at the city border to Schwalmtal.
Within this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind power plants is in principle possible, but at the same time the concentration zone excludes wind energy use for the rest of the urban area.
Such zones are designed to prevent a "sparing" of the landscape.
Although the city of Viersen had decided a second wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer network a few days earlier by amending the land utilization plan, which had not been approved by the district government of Düsseldorf because of a malfunction.
"Due to the lack of planning legal condition, the approval decision issued remains illegal and therefore also withdraw," said Christoph Erkens, Chairman of "Boisheim resists."
Current state of affairs: The City Council has again decided the wind concentration zone in Boisheimer's network before the summer break; an approval of the district government is still available.
Recognize: "This excludes the granting of an authorisation for the construction of wind power plants under planning law."
The circle confirms receipt of the request.
"The corresponding letters have been received from the district of Viersen since last week," explained a spokesman.
The circle takes the opportunity to re-examine the matter.
However, they are not expected to lead to the termination of the procedure.
With regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, on Thursday the circle did not wish to express itself in substance to the argument of the association "Boisheim is opposed."
The NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, is planning on an area on the Boisheimer net the construction of four per 200 meter high wind wheels.
Already last year the company in which the city of Viersen is indirectly involved had concluded lease contracts with the owner of about 65 hectares of land.
With the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity demand of around 11 400 households is to be covered - which corresponds to about one fifth of the electricity demand of all four households.
The NEW Re wants to invest around 20 million euros.
Last summer, Viersens City Council gave green light for the purchase of three wind power plants in the Linnich Windpark near Aachen as well as a participation in a wind power plant in Übach-Palenberg in the Heinsberg district.
Car and tractor crash together: woman dies in terrible accident
One terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10: 00 on the L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel (Rhine-Lahn-Kreis).
A woman was injured in this case.
Two more people were slightly injured.
The national road remained locked for hours.
According to the police, a 17-year-old young woman from Bornich with her car in the context of the accompanying ride with her 53-year-old mother as a companion authorized the L 333 towards Bogel.
City and dealers plan "Home Shopping" weekend
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region are to discover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September.
The trade association and the city administration want to use the weekend on September 8th and 9th to attract the residents to the city centre for shopping bummel.
As the chairman of the trade union, Christian King, announced, the "home shopping" weekend is intended to raise awareness to customers of what offers the city's own outside of the usual supermarket product.
Thus, a market with regional suppliers is planned, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, local companies should present themselves with their training places.
In addition, the business of the city centre is to invite to "midnight shopping."
The action is not only aimed at the inhabitants of the city and the neighbouring region.
In preparation are advertising spots on the radio, an Internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend, said Christian King.
Municipal administration and trade associations cooperate with the Chamber of Industry and Commerce.
This means that the trade union and the city go into another stage of the project "Attractive Downtown."
These include new offers such as the first "Active Day" to the fountain as well as Sundays on sale, talks with all commercial operators and hosts to encourage them to participate actively.
Attractive offers for Saturday and the waiver of parking fees on that day are also part of the concept.
In addition, customer potential will be opened up or re-opened.
These include guests and tourists.
But also many locals would have lost the city when shopping out of sight.
In the end, everyone would have to help to revive the city center - to rentals, the establishments of the whole city and associations.
It was possible to overcome with a network the lethargy that had partially spread, King had said in the spring.
Birgit Streich, head of the IHK Centre in Mühlhausen, announced that the third "home shopping" day, for the first time, participates in five Thüringer cities.
Besides Bad Langensalza, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.
The day should "promote the appreciation of local trade and highlight its importance for the common well-being of our cities," said Streich.
The action under the leadership of the IHK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence its direct environment itself with its purchasing behaviour.
Two dead and several injured after explosion at US school
During construction work there was a gas explosion in the school building.
New people were injured.
In a gas explosion in the U.S. city of Minneapolis, two people have been killed and nine more injured, some of them severely.
According to the fire department, on Wednesday (local time) another injured in critical condition.
A man died when part of a school building collapsed in the explosion.
A first missing person was also held dead later.
The dead were members of the school.
As an accident cause, the authorities suspected working on a gas pipeline.
During the holiday period, only a few people stayed in the Minnehaha Academy building.
Trump put under pressure for the payment of the border wall after searched transcripts of phone calls Mexico
Transcripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post.
On 27 January, Trump called on the Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The President of the United States chastised him because he had publicly challenged the wall. According to reports he said to him, "You can't say that to the press."
Trump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern border of the United States, and swore to let Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and revealed a tense exchange.
Mr. Trump said Mr. Turnbull that a trade for the United States of America refugees who emigrated to Australia would be "ridiculous," "naughty" and "stupid" and that the existence of the trade provided by the Obama government would make him look like a "dumpster" after he had proposed a ban on the relocation of refugees to the United States.
Mr. Trump ended the call after he said to Mr. Turnbull, "This is the most unpleasant call for the whole day."
Moores Ford massacre: activists restore racist Lynchact as a call for justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury ran through a group of people in rural Monroe, Georgia, and went to the Ford Bridge of Moore.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men came out with guns to block his way.
The leader of the Mobs - a man of medium age in a needle stripe suit - took a long train on his cigars and looked through the windscreen.
Inside, the inmates were in fear.
"We want this n -- -- r Roger!" the man shouted.
"Get him out of the car!"
The cry ripped the silence when a young black man was torn from the passenger seat.
Fortunately, this horrible scene, which was played on July 22nd, is just a remedy.
But when a sling is thrown around the neck of "Roger," almost everyone in the audience would have put out very real sieve.
Since 2005, civil rights have come back to Moore's Ford Bridge to follow the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom as well as George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were flashed by Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one's ever been charged with the murders.
"It is really unbelievable that in all these years no one has been arrested - although we see them in our communities, even though we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps organize the post.
"It's a dirty spot on a story, but it's a burden for our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old congressman of the state of Georgia and a lifetime citizen.
For him, it serves as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want prosecution, we want the end, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we need justice," he said.
"We can't get to healing and reconciliation until we get justice."
A courtroom puts a cloth over the body of one of the victims of the Moore Ford Lynch on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI files received by the NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the Lynch process.
But no one has ever been accused.
Although the suspects have been on free foot for decades, civil rights say that the double motivation for the Lynch actions throughout the city was always known: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a decision by the Supreme Court enabled the black citizens in Georgia to give their voice for the first time in the summer election campaign.
Approximately at the same time as the election, according to the FBI, the black farmer Roger Malcom stabbed a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a fight - allegedly because of a woman.
Brooks said the rumor in the city was that Hester slept with Malcoms wife Dorothy and that the baby she was wearing wasn't from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to free Malcom from prison, said the FBI.
He was accompanied by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey to prison.
But when they left prison and approached the Moore's Ford Bridge, a Lynchmob called the car.
"As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murders," concludes an FBI report.
"It is also obvious that there was a plot between the state and local prosecution, which was not only involved in the murders, eliminated evidence and concealed the identity of witnesses."
Brooks makes it even more pronounced.
"It was an electoral massacre," he said.
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community:" If you have to register and if you vote, this will happen to you. "
For almost a decade, Cassandra Greene has led the annual reproduction of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murders.
Their presentation is obvious, catchy and is based on a kind of deep racism that many want to believe that he no longer exists in America.
It's hard to see, and even harder to look away, but Greene said that's the point.
"We don't want to talk about the Lynch, because then we are confronted with its ugliness in us all," she said.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or don't want to hear what I've been through."
The samples for this year's production began in June, and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - pushed into a room and heard when Greene started a well-played overview of the play.
Wade Marbaugh is Greene's co-director here.
He's been playing the role of the chief clan member for years, but he said that the role never gets easier.
"I feel dirty because I'm not like that," said Marbaugh.
"But I think it's very important to keep this story alive because we don't want to return to these times."
On the other side of the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who played Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, tried their lines.
The piece begins with Malcom, who screams at Hester and pressures him, angry that he slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, n -- he, get away from my property!"
Rascona returns the fire.
There's a break.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) breaks out in laughs.
Greene's laughing.
"What?!" said Rascona.
He's alarmed and confused.
Was I too hard?
"No," said Greene, still cuddly.
"I just don't think white people said a --" he said. "
"Yes," one of the other black actors was joking.
"You just have to hit the hard R."
And right there the energy moves in space, a sense of comedy replaces the discomfort.
Everyone is busy getting this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four people killed.
The scene starts again.
This time, when Rascona says the N word, he says it sharp and strongly.
No one's laughing at all.
This repetition ends violently and quickly.
There are screams, shots and then silence.
A woman, dressed with a grief dress, stands above the bodies of the actors and carries out Billie Holidays sorrowful praise "Strange Fruit."
Your voice breaks with every second word.
About a hundred meters behind it a group of about four dozen spectators sweat and tears wipe out of the eyes.
The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white.
A couple traveled from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many come down the street only.
They have all experienced Georgias pressing humidity for almost eight hours when Brooks leads them on a pilgrimage to the cemeteries of Malcoms and Dorseys.
Until this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, when you stand on the same country where the Lynch murders took place, the air feels insane.
When the last notes of the song disappear, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspire the body name.
Children stick on their heads, register the fake blood and the quiet bodies and whisper to each other.
"You're not really dead," a little boy murmures as if he wanted to remember.
After a few minutes, Greene is thanking the crowd - and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw away the Lynch part and wipe off their tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the clan member.
Nick Rascona embraces two of his players and then breaks into her arms crying, the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through with him.
"It's okay," one of the women whispers.
"We know that this is not in your heart.
You did this for a reason. "
Later, the audience will meet with the actors for dinner.
On a table a white couple from Atlanta is excited about the resting with a black couple that they have just met.
Denise Duplinski fought to find words that left the performance.
"It's hard to hear these horrible words and actions coming from people who look like yourself and who do that because they look like you," she said.
"What this really does to me makes me believe that the Lynch is still going on," she added, "today it's just called police shooting."
In the same room Tyrone Brooks's court holds at his table, he eats and reminds of civil rights.
He said he already started planning the performance next year.
"The posture is in some way inspiring, because it describes the horror of what we have endangered, but it is also a moment of learning," he said.
"It's like, if we don't learn from it, it can happen again.
Whoever does not study his own story, who does not know his own story, is convicted to repeat it. "
"Götterdämmerung" reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth
Also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner's monumental work, director Frank Castorf puts on a bunt-frivolous censorship in front of giant, six-storey scenes.
The rotation stage (designed by Aleksandar Denic) optionally shows a scary street corner, as well as a wall rest and dönerbude in Berlin, a "plaste and Elaste" logo from the DDR times or the New York Stock Exchange.
Before that, an open Mercedes-Oldtimer is parked, where the Rhine's daughters are positioned as rockers, or alternatively an Isetta.
Stapled oil barrels remember Castorf's guiding motive - money, power and greed - which draws through his "ring" censorship.
The three Rhine daughters - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize wonderfully as already in the "Rheingold."
Kess seduces Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), scratches a body in Hollywood Manier in the trunk and gives the Krawallo Clique.
Stephen Milling sings the magnificent ugly shark surrounded by the aura of a heavy weight boxer.
Brutal the scene when he beats Siegfried.
Later, Gunther (Markus Eiche) also has to believe in it.
The audience thanks the ensemble with a strong applause.
Stormly celebrated are Foster, Milling, Vinke and conductor Janowski, who modestly bends hands to the Merkel Red.
There is a great applause for the party orchestra, which shows itself on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat again in empty leisure clothing.
With tension, Frank Castorf and his team were expected to appear.
In 2013, if he had to have another golden pipe concert over himself, there were five years later great jubiles in which the single "Buh" calls were made.
Catchman Katharina Wagner should have been happy about it.
"It is noticed that the audience has grown together with the" ring "in some way," she said shortly before the performance of the dpa.
The audience did not only make a form of peace with Castorf, but it was also an understanding of its vision.
I'm pulling a positive resuscitation.
Max Menge works as a volunteer
They work equally in several places in their volunteer year.
Wherever?
Quantity: Normally in Steinfurt in the furniture exchange, once a week I help out here in Greven in the furniture bridge.
And I've already been working at school in the open whole day.
How are your experiences with this?
Lot: It's a beautiful, wide spectrum I see here.
I have to do with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.
You're 26 years old now, so you're a late-occupied volunteer.
Why is that?
Lots: I made a graduation.
And then a building engineer study, let's say, successfully canceled.
I realized it's wrong for me and I want to do something else to work with people.
And then I wondered what you're doing.
Make a social year, there is an insight, then you can see how it really is on the ground, perhaps at the centre of focus.
And was it that way?
Lot: I've collected great impressions.
I'm going to start my social school in the winter semester.
I will study dual, probably do a social worker training at the Jugendamt Herne and study in Hamm at the University of Engineering.
Isn't it a little unusual to have several different operations during the volunteer service?
Quantity: Yes, it is very variable.
I guess it always depends on where you do your FSJ.
You can do it from age to youth work - in all possible facets of social work.
It was very varied with me.
I was also partly in the OGS, so in the afternoon care.
For me, it was exactly the right thing that irritated me.
I could see my own strengths and see how it really goes.
Unlike in the engineering study?
Mass: Of course, this isn't about calculating statics.
You always have other people in front of you who have a different story behind you.
Whether a refugee, whether a young person who has been taken out of the family - you always have to respond individually.
Very interesting.
And you didn't have any touch fears?
Lot: I'm not the guy for that.
It's a field that gives you a lot.
A lot of love, a lot of kindness.
There are also negative moments, but that's life.
Pearson shorten another 3,000 jobs and shorten the dividend to revive the business
The British Education Group Pearson said on Friday that it would reduce another 3,000 jobs and reduce its intermediate dividend by 72 percent, as another restructuring programme would be launched to overcome the pressure faced by the company.
The job reduction, announced by Director-General John Fallon mainly for the end of 2018 and early 2019, comes in addition to its previous restructuring, which already lost 4,000 jobs.
Pearson announced in May in a third cost reduction programme another £300 million ($394 million) to revive a business that was hit by the rapid step towards digital learning.
The company that sold its participation in Penguin Random House in the partner Bertelsmann last month said that the prospect for the financial year was unchanged after it achieved an increase from 1 percent to 2.05 billion pounds in the first half of the year.
Convoy attack by Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide
A suicide assassin attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital of Kabul, killed a NATO soldier and injured several others, says officials.
Five soldiers and a interpreter had been injured, announced a declaration by NATO.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians died during the incident in the Qarabagh district.
The bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan hit this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat.
On Monday, a suicide assassin killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
In a NATO statement, it says that the explosion had taken place on Thursday night when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by "carried by persons improvised explosion". "
The statement says that all injured are in a stable state and are treated in the US military hospital on the Bagram aerodrome.
Correspondents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a major concern for NATO troops in nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, about 20% of them in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shiite district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they had carried out this attack.
On 31 May, a massive bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the country's most deadly militante attack since the US-led troops forced the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, as US President Donald Trump weighs to increase the number of US troops supporting military and police in the country.
Correspondents say that the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, their policies and in particular in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPO returns decision to delay the smog rule to complaints
The US Environmental Protection Authority has repealed a decision to delay the regulation of Obama's government, which obliges States to reduce smog-causing emissions. This took place a day after 15 states accused the Agency for the step.
The EPO announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the so-called "ozone regulations 2015" and said that it showed the Agency's obligation to cooperate with States.
"We believe in dialogue with and that we respond to our state partners," said EPO Chief Scott Pruitt in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the EPO's intention to delay the ozone provisions - where pollutant emissions are to be measured in part of the country in order to determine where increments must be made to comply with stricter air quality standards - by one year until October 2018.
A group of 15 mostly democratic states, together with the Colombian district, filed a complaint on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal.
The government of President Donald Trump has tried to reverse a wide range of environmental requirements imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda which, according to Mr Trump, is intended to boost economic growth.
However, efforts have triggered the decline of democrats and nature protection groups who are concerned about the impact of greater emissions on public health.
The EPO website says that inhaling air containing ozone can "reduce lung function and enhance breathing symptoms" such as asthma.
Municipality Council wants Community space
The decision was clear at the end: in two votes against, the Municipality Council of Fluorn-Winzeln decides to set up a Community area in the future senior housing.
Before the discussion there is an important information: the purchase contract for the still missing part of the property was signed, Mayor Bernhard Tjaden reports.
Although it will still take until the area belonging to the church community is in municipal ownership, there is no longer any obstacle to planning for the project to be voted by a private investor.
There is a debate on this in relation to a Community area.
One of the two investors who are still on the boat has offered to meet the municipality.
On the ground floor it would provide a living area - about 55 square meters - and a adjacent terrace with at least 70 square meters area for a special price.
The administration and majority of the municipal council are proposing that such a Community area should not be regarded as a meeting point only for the inhabitants of the senior residence, but open into the municipality.
As an example, the word from the Strickcafé made the round.
The decision, which was taken in advance by providing funds for the current budget last autumn, is capped by means of funding.
The building is located in the refurbishment area.
The establishment of a Community area would be eligible, as Tjaden reports, with 60% of 30%.
The proposal for a decision, in order to signal to the investor that he does not want to throw a hug between his legs in this respect, provides that both Sattel - which is dedicated to the environment - and Pultdak - which reduces the grape height and makes the construction economically possible.
Unnecessary, so don't just think Wilfried Sohmer is this addition.
If it helps, he goes through the board unanimously.
It's not that simple in the community room.
Daniela Ruf refers to the many buildings with which you do not go so far, for that you now reject yourself from the window at the community room, she says, "I am hard to do with it."
Yvonne Staiger is very much in favour of the Community area, but absolutely opposed to local participation.
It looks behind it a concealed subsidy to any asset or even foreign investors.
That is not the case, because the acquisition of the area does not give a grant, but gives a real counterpart that can be marketed in doubt, is the contradiction.
Mr Staiger's request to split the proposal for a decision in accordance with this, is in favour of three.
So it remains with two votes against the original programme that Stefan Haller summarises: "If we make this decision, we will make a huge step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure."
Collision with car: Cycling on the road
On Wednesday, a 82-year-old bicycle driver in Garath was caught by a car and severely injured.
As the police told us, the 82-year-old Langenfelder had been on the road to Hilden by 12: 20 with his bike on the road of the road Black Road.
The Senior wanted to cross the road up the street Am Buchholzer Busch.
A driving driver in the same direction gave him priority.
When the Langenfelder drove on the road, he apparently did not look at the opposite traffic.
He came along with a car running a 66-year-old hero.
The man was flashed on the street.
He suffered severe injuries and was brought to a hospital with a recreational car.
FC Bayern Munich must abandon David Alaba and Thiago at the supercup against Borussia Dortmund
The Supercup takes place without him: David Alaba must make the game suck against Dortmund.
With personal care, FC Bayern is the first mandatory game of the new season to Dortmund.
Seven pros are missing the title defender in the supercup against the pocal winner.
The staff care at the German football record champion Bayern Munich will be increasing in front of the Supercup on Saturday (20.30 / ZDF and Eurosport) at Pokalsieger Borussia Dortmund.
Coach Carlo Ancelotti must also refrain from David Alaba in the duel with the BVB.
That was confirmed by the Italian on Friday.
In addition, the miners Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat are missing.
For the five defeats in the last six test games Ancelotti has made the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team responsible.
"We know that we are not in the best physical state," said Ancelotti and added: "The most important point is the balance in the team.
It wasn't good last time. "
The 58-year-old, however, believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory game of the season.
"Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I am very confident that my team is showing these qualities.
The crew is ready.
We want to play intelligent, "said Ancelotti, who expects a" difficult, intense game. "
The duel of the two German football heavy weights attracts the fans into their band.
The party was sold out with 81.360 spectators and the German Football League (DFL) announced on Friday.
Walking in the resin of star to star
In the resin, the first "star path" will be created throughout the country.
This is planned by the Association of Sternwarte St. Andreasberg.
There is a planetary road in Göttingen - since 2003.
A "star path" meets the need for information from many resin visitors, it was said.
He connects nature, science, movement and sports performance.
The members want to set up the scheduled route tables and inform them about stars and stars.
In a first phase until 2018, the association plans "well-accessible installations in five to six places" in the upper resin.
St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiss and Sieber would be asked.
The information on the tables is to be supplemented via the Internet.
Therefore, a good mobile network reception is important in the selection of locations.
Accessibility is also a criterion.
Later, the Starpath train will be extended by train.
"On the Starpath the viewers learn a lot of knowledge, for example about the physics of each star," said the association.
They also learned why stars had different colours or why a star was more bright than another, although it was far further away.
It is also provided in which star is a selected star and when it is best to see it.
Since 2014, the club operates the highest star station in northern Germany in St. Andreasberg.
According to the Federal Office for Nature Protection, the site in the centre of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany.
From there, the Milk Road and even the Andromeda galaxy with a naked eye are often visible.
Since 2003, at the initiative of the Planetarium Göttingen Confederation, there has been something similar to the planned Starwerg - the Planetenweg.
Starting in front of Gebhard's hotel in the Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the planetary road leads with its stalls up to the Hainberg and Stargate - as well as a "alien" location in Diemarden (municipality of the same) with the planet Sedna.
The steels with the individual planets - including the pluto degraded to the dwarf planet at the endpoint - are exactly set in the distance and scale of one to two billion.
The earth thus shrinks to a ball of 6.5 mm in diameter, while the exactly 75 meters away sun is at least 70 centimeters.
The entire distance of the planetary road is well four kilometres.
While the light takes about eight hours from the sun to the pluto, pedestrians need a good hour to the stele with Pluto.
So pedestrians are faster than the light in space.
The march to the next fixed star would take another six months.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who were supposed to be in a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing fight in the near future under 147 pounds, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms in ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia, the unbeat World Boxing Council lightweight champion, went down the hall to welcome Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization Super-Federweight champion.
After Garcia's victory by unanimous decision on the former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday at showtime, both fighters are members of the top five pound-for-pound list.
Garcia stretched out the right hand and said, "How are you, champ?
I wish you luck. "
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday night at 7: 00 ESPN.
When the pair posed for photos, Lomachenko manager Egis Climas noted that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect order of size."
"I'm a former spring weight," said Garcia.
"I climbed for brons [to 140 pounds], but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 140.
I'd like to get down to light weight.
And he has to move on lightweight [135 pounds] and then we fight.
That's what the fans want.
Let's give them that. "
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxing needs this fight."
Climas asked whether it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy that Lomachenko has to fight with a 135-pound debut this year to agree with Garcia next summer a date (37-0, 30 knockouts) that also has interest in fighting the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight title match in the forum on September 23.
"This fight could take place in pay-per-view mode because all fans have asked for him," said Garcia and later expressed himself openly to fight at the network that offers the best financial package.
We're the best.
No other names can generate this kind of attention.
Whenever they are ready... "
Garcia said he appreciated Lomachenko as a "huge fighter," and he might be taking part in his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko held on to the generous praise for Garcia and said that he thinks that the three-fighter champion from Riverside looks "very slow, I'm sorry Mikey... you wanted the co-out."
Garcia said that the focus is to show strength, then boxing.
They both said they could feel the moment that was built for their own struggle.
"This is the fight that must be carried out.
No other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm.
I am more than happy to work on it, "said Garcia.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for the top fighters, and this is Mikey.
It'll be a great fight. "
Four injured by tyre plate
In the event of an accident at the A7, four people were partially severely injured on Thursday afternoon.
After first information the driver of an Opel Zafira probably lost control of his vehicle at 4: 30 a.m. shortly before the connection point market width after a tyre plate.
The car slipped to the right into the wreck where he passed and then lay on the roof in the green strip.
The four inmates - two adults and two children - were partly severely injured during the accident.
During the first supply of the injured by the rescue service, the A7 was blocked north for about an hour and then the traffic on the left road could be passed by at the accident site.
Fortunas Hoffmann: "Triple chain works better"
After 2: 2, Andre Hoffmann hopes that the optimisation of the defense formation will bring points to the season against Braunschweig.
With the first season, Andre Hoffmann was satisfied, and with the result, there would not have been the two opponents at 2: 2 against Braunschweig.
"That was two counterparts too much, and we need to be even more careful in Aue," says Fortuna Düsseldorf's defender.
In the Erzgebirge, the triangle chain will continue to be optimized.
And a gate after a freestoost won't catch up with the fortune either.
"For the future it will be so that no one will stand on the line next to Michael (Rensing)."
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will be better off with the triangular chain, even after the experience in preparing it, than with the four chain.
"I still don't know how we will act in Aue," says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his cause, "because we have in the triangle at the half positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann players that can build well," said Hoffmann.
"The prerequisite is that we harmonize even better and we do not make so many gambling mistakes in building up."
Of course, Hoffmann also goes to Aue to win the game.
"But if you can talk about a misguided start after an undecided start, you don't know.
The performance could be all right, "Hoffmann said.
"But if we can stand there on Sunday with four points and focus on the pocal, we will certainly be able to talk about a proper season start."
His coach didn't want to know about that.
"I only judge the start of the season after six to eight days of play," said Friedhelm Funkel, who does not want to speak of an advantage to Aue, only because the Saxony game in Heidenheim had to be interrupted prematurely due to a storm.
"Now they can quasi start the season with a home game," said Funkel and Hoffmann believe that the players from Aue might even be a little more fresh as they don't have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against a climbing favorite in the bones.
"But they don't know so 100% where they are at the moment," says the internal defender of Fortuna.
While guests from the Rhineland go to the final (almost) finished stadium of Aue as a light favorite on Sunday.
"The fact that we have the right to come under the first six is bullshit," says Funkel, whose balance is positive in the case of only one defeat against Aue from nine games.
"There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga that one has to beat from the front," explains Fortuna's boss coach.
"To make such a statement would be arrogant and superstitious."
And that's not how Funkel wants to experience his players on Sunday.
New results of Swedish Asylum Age Evaluation Tests published
The latest results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which have been subjected to a new method of medical evaluation of their age, show that more than 80 percent of the subjects tested are older than 18 years. But not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Agency for Forensic Medicine (Jättsmedicinalverket) has started carrying out the tests last year.
They should make the assessment of age more precise during the asylum procedure after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migration Agency) has been criticised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were minors.
Up to today, the Migrationsverket has sent 6.880 cases to be tested and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2.481 tests from the period from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were assessed as 18 or older, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was "possibly 18 years or older."
In 432 cases, it was concluded that "the person may be under 18 years of age."
The tests shall only be carried out in cases where the age of the person is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been stable over the past few months.
"We don't see a big difference in the statistics of the past months, the numbers are quite constant," he said the magazine The Local.
The high proportion of cases in which the person has been judged as over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the applicant has lied about his age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there are 442 cases that "suggest that the investigated person is 18 years or older."
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results, she found that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she would be 18 years old this year.
The method of medical age assessment, where X-rays are made of wisdom teeth and MRI recordings of knee wives, then analysed by dentists and radiologists, was also criticized in some areas.
A scepticist is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of humans to see if they went through puberty sooner or later as usual.
"I had reason to think about it, and I don't think the type of measurement should be used.
To assess the biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say it safely, we shouldn't pretend we could, "he said to the newspaper Metro.
However, Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests: "Generally, you can say that the risk of judging a child as an adult is low.
The greatest risk is if the person is less than 18, in this case this is about 10 percent. "
Full plan
The work on the three bridges of Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well.
On Wednesday a seven tons heavy concrete part was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.
"We are very good in time, it's going great," says Reinhold Leicht, Head of the Road and Transport Department at the Regierungspräsidium Freiburg.
In April the work began at the same time on all three rehabilitation bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.
The end of the construction is planned for October and light is sure that the timetable is complied with.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.
It is a wool bow bridge made of concrete, dressed with red buntsandstein and has a total length of 4,80 meters.
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, it has now come into the years.
In order to ensure the stability and safety of traffic, the three buildings are now being thoroughly restored.
The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach.
They're made of red Buntsandstein.
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve or 10,60 metres long.
The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach has now received a 1,30 m wide and seven tons heavy so-called bridge capsule on the north on Wednesday morning.
This is a peripheral attachment that is also used as an operating route.
On Friday, a 2.20 m wide bridge cap is to be used on the southern part of the bridge.
Then the pedestrian path is to go on.
The special thing is that these are finished parts, a patent of the Schramberger company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridges.
Special fingertip feeling has required the deployment of lines through the construction in Lauterbach.
Because there is also a glass fibre cable that many companies are connected to.
The residents were informed of the project in advance of the work by means of a handbook.
In addition, fish and crustaceans had to be fished first.
For the bridges between the Bauhof building and the collector towards Schramberg, traffic is controlled by a light.
For construction work on the bridge at the Lauterbacher local entrance, the road in the area of the bridge is fully blocked at the height of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Seven Linden."
The cost of the three bridges is EUR 700 000.
The whole thing is funded by the country.
AfD in Gerolstein: Bunter protest for German potato salad
It does not happen so often that parties draw on a string, but when it comes to the alternative for Germany (AfD), it comes together, which is otherwise difficult to put under one hat.
The parties represented in the Circuit Day Vulkaneifel (CDU, SPD, Green, FDP, FWG, Left) are part of a broad alliance which shows a peaceful flag on that day because AfD invites in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle Rondell to the sound "big campaign record."
And bring known names to the start - like Alice Weidel, who together with Alexander Gauland is the top duo for the Bundestag election on September 24, and the Deputy Federal President Beatrix von Storch.
But those who have been on site hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the AfD players, but to demonstrate.
The motto "The Eifel remains colorful."
Originally the city picnic was planned under the motto "All at a table" in the well-being place, but is now taking place in the parking lot below the roundabout - and thus right in front of those who come to the AfD event in the city hall.
It's a colorful picture.
And what Christa Karoli, Chairman of the Forums A World and one of the key organisers, is right: "Great how many people have come together here."
There is music and lots of food, including a "ancient German potato salad, which the AfD could also eat without problems," says the woman who brought him.
The police have ordered many officials to Gerolstein, showing presence especially at the railway station, which is just a few metres away from the event sites.
How did the AfD actually get on Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes reported from the AfD Vulcan Eifel that he had tried to make such an event and received the contract.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had first asked in Daun, but there was a refusal because due to the already built Laurentiuskirmes there were not enough parking spaces.
So now the Rondell, Hompes, is happy that we can have such a nice event here.
With a view to the event on the rondellvorplatz, he says, "This is the good right of people, mainly, it remains peaceful."
This is also true: at 8: 00 a.m. on the rondellvorplatz a band provides entertainment, in the city hall several speakers, including the Rheinland-Pfalzische AfD Chairman Uwe Junge.
In the hall there are about 200 listeners waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag election, Alice Weidel, and the Deputy Federal President Beatrix of Storch to make their speeches.
The police presence is unchanged, but so far the officials had a quiet evening.
The AfD event takes a little more than an hour, the guests in the courtyard have a longer breath, but even there is announced to clean up shortly after 9: 00.
The police can pull off - no special incidents.
Posaune hits trumpet
A good-bye to the Wolfacher Posaunist Frederic Belli is in the series Haslacher monastery concert tomorrow, Sunday, at 8: 00 in the monastery church.
Together with the Bulgarian Trompeter Miroslav Petkov he gives a concert under the motto "Black Sea meets on Black Forest," or even "Balkanfolklore" meets a classic German training with roots in the blast music.
Both soldiers are winners and prize winners of numerous international competitions and have solopositions in European top orchestras.
For example, Petkov is a solo drummer at the renowned Concertgebouw Orchester Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is a soloposaunist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Both unite the desire not only to cross borders on their instruments but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres.
Thus, Johann Sebastian Bach declares himself united with Bulgarian folklore, and in the piece "Exchange Suite" of the Jazz prize winner Nils Wogram, classic, jazz and free games are mixed into a fascinating overall art work.
This core part of the programme was first launched this spring with huge success in Freiburg.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram wrote it specifically for the two musicians and more: The Haslacher monastery church with its special acoustics is deliberately included in the concert.
Kristen Stewart talks about her bisexuality
"Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their life.
But I want to try everything, "said Kristen Stewart very openly about her bisexuality.
"Once I bite in grilled cheese, I think," Oh that was cool, what comes next? "
The most well-known relationship of the Hollywoodstar was that of her "Twilight" colleague Robert Pattinson, who eventually broke up bitter.
Despite all this, the brunette actress assures the "Harper's Bazaar" magazine: "I was seriously in love with anyone I dated.
Or do you think I played it? "
After her separation, Kristen admitted that she was bisexual: "I have always lived dualism and seriously believed in it.
So it never confused me or hampered me.
I just never liked not being taken seriously. "
She suffered especially from it according to "Bang Showbiz," but at school, when she preferred to dress up like a bub: "Not all girls are typical girls.
That really hurt me very much.
When I was 11, the kids told me I'd look like a bub.
I really felt attacked, scared and embarrassed.
Now I look back and think, "Girl, be proud of you!"
Particularly to the public, they do not like to explain their love life: "People expect you to act in a certain way and that annoys me.
And perhaps some call me ungrateful, but I do not like to have to justify myself in front of the whole public. "
The Governor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
The democratic governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced on Thursday night at a sound with President Trump that he would change the party.
Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have gone away from me, "said Governor Justice.
"Today I will tell you with a lot of prayers and thoughts... today I will tell you as inhabitants of West Virginia that I can't help you anymore when I am a democratic governor."
The audience broke out in jealousy.
"Tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republicans," added Justice.
"As a coach, I would say it's time to play another game."
Mr. Trump promised a big announcement before the West Virginia Rallye.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia with 42 points, and Justice did not approve the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
According to Forbes, Justice, the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states and has inherited a coal business from his father.
He's worth about $1.59 billion.
In the meantime, the Republican National Committee made a statement on Thursday night saying: "The change of the party of Governor Justice is another blow for a democratic party that would rather prevent us from working to make our country great again."
"With only 15 governors and the control of the least legislative bodies in history, the announcement of Governor Justice is only the last refusal of a party that is without leadership from above to below and is unable to find a positive, unique message," RNC president Ronna McDaniel said in a statement the CBS News.
Coe praises "honest" Russian apology for doping scandal
On Thursday, the world's head of body lesson, Sebastian Coe, praised what he described as a clear excuse from Russia to a doping scandal, but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be taken into sport again.
Russia's leader, Dmitry Shylakhtin, on the eve of the world championships, said that his country's banning from sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he was sorry for "all athletes who were taken away in competitions of gold and silver medals."
In spite of its comments, the IAAF Congress voted for maintaining the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) had found indications of state-funded doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very open answer today, a very honest presentation," said IAAF President Coe to the reporters.
"The whole Council and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has realized in itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is redesigned."
Coe said he was also "pleased" that Russia accepts the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day, and I think that progress has been made, but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to redeploy Russia," said Coe.
"We have to do everything we can to normalize this situation in the coming months.
The guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate clean athletes from the devastated system, "he added
Nineteen Russian athletes will act as neutral players at the World Championships in London on Friday, according to the strict IAAF criteria.
On Monday, the Head of the IAAF Task Force, Rune Andersen, said that Russia still had to meet some of the criteria for redeployment.
Drug tests are still inadequate and forbidden trainers are still free to work, he said reporters in London after a lecture at the IAAF Council.
Sorrow for soldiers crashed in Mali
At a mourning ceremony in the North Hispanic Fritzlar, about 1,000 people thought of the two soldiers who died at a helicopter crash in Mali.
The ceremony took place on Thursday at the Court under high security arrangements.
On the unexplained cause of crash, Minister of Defense Ursula of the Leyen (CDU) said nothing.
She described the two pilots who were killed as "the skilled."
"We are inclined to face this highest sacrifice they have given on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany," she said.
The 33-year-old Major and 47-year-old Stabshauptmann from North Hesse had died on Wednesday a week ago in West African Mali.
Their arches were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a Federal Defense Death Guard to the Fritzlarer Dom Sankt Peter.
At first, only the relatives in the church said goodbye.
After that, the mourning ceremony began in the family's circle, close friends, by representatives of the Federal Defence and politics.
Among them were Hessens Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the General Inspector of Volker Wieker.
The guests of grief laid down roses, and the families stood arm in arm at the chest.
In front of the church, Frettzlarer and numerous soldiers pursued the ceremony on a canvas.
Minister of Defence of the Leyen described the murdered soldiers as "highly decorated" and operating.
The staff chief had built up the flight operation of Tiger's fighter helicopter in Fritzlar and had been one of the first six trained Tiger pilots of his regiment.
Also Volker Bauersachs, commander of the regime of the soldiers, said: "If this crew could not turn off the crash, no one would have been able to do so."
No doubt about the UN mission in Mali showed Minister of the Leyen that the operation was dangerous.
But he was also of great importance "for a country that we are only separated from by two states," she said.
After the mourning ceremony, the plagues were taken out of the cathedral.
When and where they are buried, the Federal Defense did not provide any information.
Prince Henrik doesn't want a grave next to his wife
The man of the Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death.
That's what the Royal House told us on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish royal couple is buried in the Cathedral of Roskilde.
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard already made a sarcophag for the two.
The queen agreed to the decision of her husband, it was further mentioned in the communication.
Where Prince Henrik is buried, be unclear.
However, he does not intend to be admitted to his French home.
Prince Henrik had never made a hero because he was not happy with his title.
After the throne of his wife Margrethe in 1972, he would have liked to be king.
In 2016, he retired and also wrote the title "Prinzgemahlen."
Since Henrik in Denmark did not receive the title and function he wanted, he does not regard himself as equivalent to his wife - even after death, Lene Balleby, the chief spokeswoman of the Danish royal house, explained.
Where the last rest place of the 83-year-old will eventually be, be still unclear.
He does not intend to be settled in his French home, but in Denmark.
He likes the country he's been working for in the last 50 years.
The born Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, son of a French noble sex, had met Margrethe in London in 1965.
He worked at the Themse in the French Embassy.
During his later wife's sympathy to the people, Prince Henrik had a heavy position in his nearly 50-year-old reign with the Danes.
In an autobiography Henrik said about the first years in Denmark: "A few months after my arrival, everything I did was criticized.
My Danish was fluctuating, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk stockings instead of stricksocks, citroën instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gauloises that I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation of being the brand of socially critical intellectuals in this country, I could not hope for negligence.
I was different.
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not to be ashamed.
That was just two mistakes! "
Prime Minister Because wants quick re-election
CDU and FDP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
Lower Saxony's Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) is after the loss of the red-green government majority for a quick re-election of the country day, but he does not want to resign.
Because on Friday the resolution of Parliament was in favour.
Previously, the surprising departure of a Green MEP from her countryside group in Lower Saxony had fallen the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the official date of the Landtag election, the red-green coalition in Hannover thus lost its narrow one-vote majority in Parliament to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
The former Green MEP Elke Twesten founded her step with the non-nomination for the election 2018 in her constituency in Rotenburg (Wümme).
"I see my political future in the CDU," she explained on Friday in Hannover.
CDU Group leader Björn Thümler would like to recommend to his group that they be included.
In this way CDU and FDP together have 69 seats in the Dutch Landtag, SPD and Green 68 seats.
So far, the relationship has been reversed.
The new day will be elected regularly on 14 January next year.
Thümler said that the red-green government must now decide whether it can continue to rule in this situation without a majority.
However, Stephan Weil considers it essential that the country day decides its self-resolution as quickly as possible.
The CDU Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday.
The national constitution also provides for the possibility that the country day withdraws confidence from the Prime Minister and chooses a successor.
"Our Constitution offers several options.
These possibilities need to be examined legally clean, "Thümler said.
"All questions will be discussed in peace when they are legally reasonably examined."
Thümler called the second step "a little curious."
The politician himself stressed: "I am not a traitor.
I feel very good. "
She was the supporter of Black Green.
The Greens called on the seconded Members to return their country's mandate.
"We assume, of course, that she returns her country-day mandate, which she has received from the green country list, with immediate effect," the country president Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner announced.
The Group chairman of the Green Group, Anja Piel, said: "We regret the decision of Every Second extraordinary."
She deliberately decided not to hold a debate in the group.
"Even in the context that there were no substantive differences, we cannot understand this step."
SPD Chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condemns the transgression of the Dutch Green Members Every Second to the CDU as a betrayal.
"The behaviour of former Green Members in Lower Saxony is not only a betrayal of voters, but also a betrayal of red-green," the Federal Head of Social Democrats wrote on Facebook on Friday.
He supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to have the country day reelected quickly.
The second exit costs the majority of Red-Green in Lower Saxony.
The politician placed "in her injured vanity and in her joy her personal interests in the good of the country," criticized SPD Secretary-General Hubertus Heil.
"It is a scandal that the CDU participates in this dirty intrigue game in Lower Saxony and tries to beat political capital from it."
Lower Saxony's CDU leader Björn Thümler would like to recommend to his MEPs that each second be included in the CDU.
The head of the SPD in the Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, proposed Twesten to distort the result of the 2013 Landtag election with personal career remarks.
The CDU was then the strongest force before the SPD, but SPD and Green had a small majority of one voice in the countryside.
Minister for Agriculture in the Interview - How do we protect ourselves from poison eggs, Mr Schmidt?
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs.
How did the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves?
Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt (CSU) is in an interview with the German editorial network (RND).
Mr Schmidt, how can the consumer protect himself from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to look closely at the eggs in your refrigerator and to check the stamp pressure.
On the Consumer Protection Portal www.Lebensmittelwarnung.de, the Federal Countries set up the latest information on the egg batches concerned.
The eggs concerned should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, according to everything we know at present, a health hazard is practically excluded.
Is Aldi now taking over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the explorer is not actually perceived by the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs?
Food monitoring is the responsibility of the Länder.
Nevertheless, my House has immediately turned up and has been in close exchange with the authorities of the countries since the fact that Germany has been affected.
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers.
Trade, as well as manufacturers, must ensure that the products sold are transportable and health-safe.
If, in the case of eggs, the maximum residue level of 0,005 mg / kg is exceeded, they shall not be able to be transported.
However, unloaded eggs can be sold and consumed.
This time, it's not the business's fault.
Are production companies and consumers on the same boat?
In the present state of knowledge, the production companies do not face any direct blame.
Instead, they must expect economic damage due to allegedly illegal practices by service companies.
As always, there are too few controllers in serious cases.
Is there only a lack of human resources or the decisive competence?
It was just official controls that discovered the process.
However, the truth is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded 100%.
It is precisely for this reason that consistent clarification of such events and the handover to the prosecutors in cases where criminal offences may exist are crucial.
I have already made it clear on several occasions that I am expecting a complete clarification from the responsible authorities.
Is the regular alarming of food scandals really necessary?
Consumers have the right to receive only safe and transportable foods.
If an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are rightly disappointed.
The pissed means have led manufacturers, dealers and consumers to a situation that is absolutely not necessary.
In principle, it must be clear: the illegal use of the insecticide fipronil in the holding of food-producing animals is unacceptable and must be terminated immediately.
This must be done consistently and with high pressure at all levels.
I expect all the competent authorities to clarify the matter quickly and without delay.
How the financial rules of football affect Neymar's move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unhindered expenditure of European football clubs will not disturb Neymar's World Record Transfer from Spain Barcelona to French Paris-Saint Germain.
Some consequences for Paris Saint-Germain will come from the UEFA, because the leading organisation that supervises the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial fair play rules set up by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG has to prove that the transfer of Neymar has been financed without major losses.
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to buy the Brazilian out of his contract, and Neymar will receive a salary of several ten million dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
PSG can certainly loosen the money so that Neymar will sign and bring it into a galaxy of other stars, given the funding of the team through the energy-rich rule family of Katar.
Associations can spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players, but they need to compete with legitimate sources of income that allow them to break-even point in their football-related business.
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA president in 2007.
The former French player believed that associations who had taken enormous debts on their aspirations for success effectively betrayed and risked to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011 FFP moved from concentration to clubs' debts to monitoring its losses.
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested vigorously to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a tougher matter.
During the current three-year FFP investment period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million.
And even though Platini fell into disgrace by the Presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to oppose excessive expenditure.
"Certainly FFP is not dead and we will certainly strengthen the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for FFP at the UEFA, compared to The Associated Press last week.
Although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a flat rate, it can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of its contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so that the amount of the proceeds for the next five years can be shown at EUR 44.4 million in the annual accounts.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, together with Abu Dhabi, owned by Manchester City, has taken the most severe sanctions.
The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (at the time 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the 2014 / 15 Champions League remain limited to 21 players instead of the normally 25 players.
UEFA is looking for clubs that might try to overlist their financial supervision by spreading up their revenues by companies linked to the owners of a club.
While a cataric company could sponsor the PSG if the value of the sponsorship should exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not allow this to be considered as legitimate income.
That's exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the value of the sponsorship of the PSA was blown up by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come to Katar on payments by the Organization Committee of the World Cup 2022.
But PSG and Katar in 2022 have contested that Neymar will be the World Cup ambassador and that such a maneuver for the UEFA regulatory authorities could easily be found out.
The existing sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be even more attentive to respecting every attempt to circumvent the rules.
The UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymar's transfer, said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.
They spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press as they were not empowered to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 has achieved a profit of more than EUR 10 million with a turnover of EUR 542.4 million.
The accounts for the last financial year still have to be published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a blessing for sponsoring deals, merchandising and tricot sales.
The association assumes that sales will increase by at least 30 percent after the signature.
The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players go, and she tried to prevent Neymar from leaving by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP.
"It is a clear case of" financial doping "with the club and the state," the President of the La Liga, Javier Tebas, said the Spanish newspaper AS regarding Katar's last ownership of PSG.
Arsenal Manager Arsene Wenger, whose association is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares La Liga's reservations against a state that finances a club.
"It is the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football over the last 15 years," said Wenger on Thursday.
"As soon as a country owns a club, everything is possible.
It will be very difficult to respect financial fair play because you can go different ways or have different interests when a country has such a big player to represent a country. "
Swiss is looking for a new shade supplier
In recent years, Chocolat has produced Frey board chocolate for the Swiss.
Now there is a possible end to the socalled cooperation: the airline rewrites the assignment.
Swiss spokeswoman Meike Fuhlrott confirmed, at the request of the news agency, a corresponding report of the Friday newspaper "Nordwestschweiz."
According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be checked every two to three years and subject to quality control.
"We are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolat Frey," the spokeswoman said.
Approximately 17 million small red-white shade panels of 14 grams per year distribute the flight crew before landing to passengers.
The Swiss did not want to provide any information on the costs.
Brancheninsider estimates the order volume according to "Northwest Switzerland" to 1.5 to 2 million francs - the Migros daughter achieves an annual turnover of around one billion francs.
But more importantly, the advertising effect is: for a shade manufacturer it is a prestigious job.
How many candidates there are in the new tender, the Swiss does not want to betray.
However, only Swiss manufacturers are eligible.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey is trying to renew the contract beyond spring 2018.
For sda, the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion.
The Swiss have been distributing chocolate tables on board their flights since 2006.
Before concluding a contract with the Migros daughter, Barry Callebaut had delivered the chocolate tablets in cooperation with Hug.
The possibility to place the logo introduced Swiss two and a half years ago with the start of cooperation with Chocolat Frey.
The airline cooperates with various Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-distance flights the customers of the First Class are spoiled with leakage by the Confiserie Sprüngli, in the Business Class nasty passengers Schoggi of Lindt and in the Economy Class Schoggi of Chocolat Frey.
Swiss Schoggi also distributes Swiss Schoggi from Chocolat Frey, both in business and economy class.
Leichtathletik - Diskus Olympiasieger Robert Harting reaches the World Cup final
The three-time world champion is fighting for a medal in the final on Saturday.
His brother Christoph, Olympic director of 2016, had failed in the national World Cup excretion and could only look at the Diskus competition from the tribe.
Also with the first attempt, the Polish title defender Piotr Malachowski, who threw 65.13 meters wide, qualified for the final battle.
Nostalgia goes into "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective" into the Nische
This repetition of history is nostalgic at the same time because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80's, for the 90-year-old Grunge era (when the vampire David Wain and Michael Showalter drew the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, went to bigger things.
As a cultural artifact, it is also a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook-capable era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise, it feels like the time is short.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not only because of his absurd humor (it contained an original story for a speaking can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By stepping up on the core of the goat - actors of middle age play horny children who grow up - they still created the possibility of winning back the last part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later," with his adults who are now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more according to the giant principle, including a reef on the stalker movies of the 1990s such as "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("The Hand that shakes the cradle").
At one point a character stumbles through an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates and "a number of other things from 1991."
Many of the central stories are the same.
The loving Coop (Mr. Showalter), now Romanian author, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has still not lost his virginity.
And there is another crazy-evil plot that Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) is involved in, which is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a good impression of Michael Ian Black).
As always, the excursions are the best part of the franchise.
It is particularly fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillon's sublipstick of "Singles," whose former Big Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old knocker.
It is the moments of random madness that could heat this franchise like a kind of repeating "Seven Up!" series until he reaches what I assume as his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose last scene will show the gang how to visit the film premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon now reminds of another kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War of "The Americans," the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its East-against-West Ring Camp Iconography.
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as a director indicates being a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two police as friends, two officers from Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism Leninism.
The main roles - a hard-shot Gregor and an idealistic osef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues are synchronized by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some beautiful gags to look at (the police spend the time watching chess on TV, how Americans might do with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - ensures a decent game 'Find out the voice'.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a killer wearing a Reagan mask - that it often plays like a single one.
In six long episodes it is pulling there, and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough.
"Comrade Detective," edited to a smaller length, could better deliver his agitprop satire as Gregor and Iosef visit the American embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who consume a bunch of hamburgers.
The message for the imaginated communist audience is that Western culture can make everything food for a mood.
The fictitious Romanian creators were not wrong: we even do it with our own younger history and with their.
Beating against drug mafia in the country
The police succeeded in beating the Italian Mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest Baar Circle, Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as the Public Prosecutor informed Konstanz on Friday.
15 accused persons aged between 25 and 77 years were arrested and already issued warrants against them.
In addition, officials secured larger quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms and several hundred thousand euros.
Two people were arrested at the same time in Italy.
There were German warrants against the two suspects of Italy.
The two are therefore likely to be delivered to Germany.
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action.
A total of over 300 police officers were in operation.
The members of the Mafia are accused of organised drug crime, serious violence, assassinated murder, robbery and blackmail.
Since summer 2016, the Public Prosecutor has investigated Konstanz against the organized drug trafficking in the southern German region.
There was a strong exchange between the prosecutors in Constanz and Palermo, and the investigators of the Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
This is why four officials from Palermo were also accompanied by the major operation on Wednesday morning.
In particular, Italian nationals were closely related to the Italian mafia.
Also an incident on May 27 in Hüfingen, where several shots were fired early in the morning to a restaurant, should go to the account of the gang.
Way complains about great gaps in the foreign register
"Citizens' data should not appear there": According to a report, the foreign register in Germany has significant shortcomings.
This leads to some serious misdecisions in asylum procedures.
According to a media report, the Federal Government's refugee management officer, Frank-Jürgen Weise, has highlighted major gaps in the foreign central register.
Deficiencies in the data recorded there could lead to "some serious error decisions" in the case of asylum procedures and deportations, warned in an analysis carried out by the "South German newspaper."
According to the register, 10 million people with foreign nationality are included in the register, including about 5.7 million non-EU nationals.
The data are therefore managed by around 600 foreign authorities in Germany.
As the data had not been adequately maintained, the data quality in parts had not been good so far.
In isolated cases, data from 1921 had been found, "by people who are no longer alive, or by citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register."
"Failure to provide data can significantly slow back processes," says the report further.
Statistics on persons subject to exit also include EU citizens who do not have to leave.
However, such false assignments led to "a distorted debate on dealing with exit agents," it is said in the analysis.
Meanwhile, it appears that the Federal Government has started sending refugees' families with under 16-year-old children back to Italy when they have travelled from there.
This is reflected in an internal paper from the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), the "New Osnabrücker Newspaper."
In the paper it is therefore stated that the BAMF has re-conducted such procedures for families with children, with the exception of infants and small children, to Italy since 1 June 2017.
Since the end of 2014 this was practically not possible, so the newspaper referred to the difficult situation on the ground.
According to the Dublin Agreement, refugees from the EU State are responsible, which they first reach.
If a migrant continues to travel to another EU country, this State can send him back to the country of entry.
For reasons, the Office now writes: "In the meantime, the reception capacity for families with young children in Italy has increased significantly."
Italy has provided guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (EGMR) considers these commitments to be sufficient.
Other EU countries would also send refugees back there under the Dublin Agreement.
The domestic speaker of the Left Party in the Bundestag, Ulla Jelpke, criticized this decision: "Families with children threaten because of the deficiencies in the Italian asylum system human rights violated reception conditions and a threat to child's well-being."
Second best result achieved
A total of 220 litres of blood from people living in Oberreichenbach already provided the blood donation service for other people.
At least by the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday.
Allen in front of Jürgen Greule, who shared with his now 100 donations 50 litres of blood.
Traditionally, at the meeting of the Municipality Council, the community appreciates the multiple willingness to donate blood.
"It is brilliant how our body is designed for it and we pay respect to donors who provide their blood to strangers, yet unselfish," said Mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
"A single blood donation helps several people," explained the head of the German Red Cross (DRK), Holger Maisenbacher, because the preserves are replaced in their components.
Three people could benefit from a blood donation.
At the same time Maisenbacher reported about the actions carried out in Oberreichenbach in the spring.
"This year, with 114 donors, we achieved the second best result," said the DRK council leader.
Obviously, the change to the theatre house a few years ago led to higher numbers of participants.
Before that, Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiple donors and were awarded for 50 blood donations each.
Half as many books Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Cousin delivered ten times per 500 milliliters of their life juice.
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the deterioration of inflation have diminished speculation over an increase.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue to be "yield" when it maintained interest rates on family income in the middle of a growing pressure.
The Bank's Monetary Committee (MPC) policy makers voted by 6 to 2 in favour of keeping interest rates to 0.25%, with fewer members seeking to increase this month as weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and for 2018 to 1.6% and warned that the pressure on household income would continue, with inflation expected to rise to almost 3% in the autumn.
But she signalled that in the next few years interest increases would be needed to streamline the inflation heated by Brexit and she said that credit costs might have to increase more than expected on the financial markets.
The members also voted in favour of withdrawing part of the Mammut recovery package issued a year ago after the Brexit.
It will require time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funding to banks from next February, although it has been said that now it is expected to provide 15 billion pounds more under this system - with 115 billion pounds Sterling.
Minutes after the decision on the interest rate, the Bank said: "In the central forecast of the MPC, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term as pressure on real income of households continues to burden consumption."
With regard to interest rates, it reiterated that "a certain streamlining of monetary policy" would be necessary to cool down inflation and a "slightly greater" scale than the markets expect.
The markets are currently projecting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another one in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that increases would be "progressively" and "limited."
The Bank's downward adjusted growth forecasts for this and next year are compared with the projected growth rates in May of 1.9% and 1.7%.
It has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.
After these news, the pound fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and by 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision does not change after the recent disappointing growth figures have dampened the rising expectations of interest increases and GDP increased from 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3% in the second quarter.
Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will easily recover after the bank at the end of the year.
The recent inflation report has given little enthusiasm to households affected by rising inflation and low wage increases, as tightening becomes worse first before it gets better.
It added that monetary policy cannot "prevent" income collapse in the coming years, but added that wages will be recovered "clearly" at the end of their three-year forecast.
The economy is also strengthened by the increasing demand for British goods, due to the weak pound, which will compensate for some of the lower consumption spending.
The decision comes one year after the fall in interest rates to 0.25% last August after the shocking EU vote that caused the pound to fall.
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will fully reach prices and the economy.
Before the Bank's last judgment on interest rates, the call for a rise in interest rates had increased as inflation increased the pressure on heavily pressured households, with three policy makers demanding an increase of 0.5% in July.
Inflation has decreased from 2.9% in June to 2.6% last month, although the Bank said that this was expected and will attract it again in the coming months.
The Bank said that the excess in relation to its target of 2% was "entirely" attributed to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, Director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent decline of the swap rate, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again, as creditors are loud looking for business and want to end the year in a positive way.
The market looks particularly good for those in whom the existing deals end and enter into new mortgages, and many with free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular. "
NHS (National Health Service) is to prescribe controversial HIV drug 10,000 people
Patients will be given access to "transformative" HIV prevention treatment from September after a fight before the High Court against the funding of the medicine in the NHS.
NHS England announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) taken prior to sexual intercourse, which can reduce the risk of infection in high risk patients by around 86 per cent, is now delivered by the health service through a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people.
He agreed to finance the process after the appeal court confirmed last year a ruling by the Supreme Court that the NHS had the power to pay for the PrEP despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it.
The chess train announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England Chief Simon Stevens as "important new intervention" while the National Aids Trust (NAT) called this "crucial moment."
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first that will allow people to register, and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018.
Preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in patients at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sexual intercourse means that there are just enough medicines in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection.
Such medicines can be taken every day or two hours before sexual intercourse.
Among those eligible for treatment are gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated.
Clinics identify appropriate participants who agree with the study, including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and are registered with a domestic doctor can also register for possible participation in their local participating sexual clinic.
The program will be signed £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the medicines this week after an international competitive procurement.
The study aims to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence as it is used, absorbed and implemented on a large scale.
Stevens said, "This major new intervention should complement and overtake the widespread and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in the continuing progress over three decades in tackling one of the greatest health challenges of humanity. "
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said, "This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if it is targeted at needy and vulnerable people, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September onwards, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and not negotiated with a partner, which leads to the improvement of many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement. "
Ian Green, president of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority must now be to ensure that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk to HIV is left behind.
Now that the PrEP test medicine has been purchased, we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people. "
Sharon Hodgson, Shadow Health Minister, said: "The start of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and hesitant implementation by the government.
The evidence shows how transformatively this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and end the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected with HIV and that it will help us to end the spread of HIV in society a step closer. '
Living great life: intermediate and clever designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a generous home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, declined from a large house in Knightsbridge in 2014 to a Earls Court Apartment.
It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne did not pack and sell her bags.
"Before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much bigger room," says Joanne.
"I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.
I was shown this apartment at Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and made an offer on that day. "
Since the first visit, the 1,000 square feet apartment has been completely overtaken.
Originally a one-room property with a enveloped layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add a storage room and an intermediate floor to make optimal use of the generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
That was my request, "she says.
To this end she instructed the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12,5 feet high ceilings and to create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms across each other, so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor where you could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the requirement.
"The steel plant is quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked across each other without having to bend.
It was not only about building a simple platform, but about putting on the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below. "
This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms in full height across each other - with a lot of additional drama.
For the intermediate floor a classic copper light window of Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous residential area.
Played gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.
At both ends a short corridor is mirrored to allow it to work longer.
In the kitchen, the mirror feels like a window into another room.
At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all Joanne's bricks and glasses.
By perceiving a glamorous room, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.
Collapsible kitchens are nothing new.
The special thing about this is that it's a garage door.
"A little engineering art went in there," Erfan explains from the steel reinforced, furnished MDF door.
"It is opposite important, so that when you push the door up, it slips very easily."
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to win additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day you will sell the ground area - or how your property is appreciated," says Erfan.
"In a rudimentary form a real estate broker will enter and perform a calculation based on the soil size."
Here they have managed to enlarge the floor surface and at the same time to use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.
"The materials are the things you touch and therefore help create an emotional connection in a home," Erfan says.
"You don't fall in love with the electric plugs in the walls.
These are important, but they do not play with your heart. "
It shows that an apartment can transform through good design and increased square metre of something standard moderate into something quite amazing.
In fact, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave them.
Brothers fight for a $500 million real estate empire
Two brothers, four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, are in a struggle for one of Victoria's largest real estate imperies worth over 500 million dollars.
The former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis live in a villa in Toorak, just three doors away from his younger brother Paul. He brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how to share their property and their business capabilities.
Paul wanted to retire from the family business since 2014, but a sharp dispute about separation is taking place in the Supreme Court.
Together with her mother Anna, the brothers possess 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, collected since the family bought a business in Smith Street, Collingwood in 1973.
There the Westco Jeans family founded and became a chain of 160 retailers.
It was sold for $85 million in 1999.
This money has been invested in real estate, and the De Lutis portfolio now includes offices in the city center, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centers in the suburb.
After an agreement with her deceased father, Colin - described by Paul as the "main operator and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - has about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third.
A court file says that this means that Colin owns property worth 316 million dollars and Paul owns 176 million dollars.
The distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem point for Paul.
"The divisions proposed by Colin left him with what I thought was the best objects," he wrote in a first affidavit in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failures, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place.
The brothers now also fight for control of the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul claims, has ruled out him.
Colin argues that this is not true, but claims Paul to manage some possessions incompetent.
In an early affidavit submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.
"My Italian heritage stipulates that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.
In this case, costs increase, with hundreds of pages with affidavits, e-mails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and held by both sides of the law firm.
Ms De Lutis and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicate shops from the late 1950s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used the security to buy the Collingwood property in which Colin opened the family's first jeanshop.
Colin says that he started there when he was "in my last years of high school, when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to give their property to their sons kindly.
"Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group, with Colin claiming that Mark was paid 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars when he left the company.
Both Luke and Mark were bittered about the terms of their financial separation.
Colin was a former AFL board member and after a 2015 biography by Eddie McGuire, the best friend of the TV star.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin answered by SMS to say "I really can't say much," because the case was before the courts.
"It is very, very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and draw our family name through the courts," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to meet his brother's demands.
"Our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current dispute," he said and added that he "still hopes for a solution."
On Friday, this hope seemed to be over.
"Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to restrict the president's media abstinence.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If he does, he'll be the first.
Politico reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump, including the reports of the news media, in the hope of keeping the boss on a more uniform course.
Here's a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with senior employees on his first working day, he represented a major problem in President Donald Trump's White House that he wanted to repair: bad information that came into the hands of the President.
Kelly told the employees that information should flow about him - whether on paper or in letters - because the president would make better decisions if he received good information. "
Kelly's diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump's relationship with television is decades back - and now that he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.
"If candidate Trump was upset because of an unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of posts to convince," the former election counsel Sam Nunberg said to Politico in February.
Policos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trumps Twitter habit under control, according to six former electoral officers is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a constant prize."
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit was ever "under control," is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign officers know something that we don't know to others - that Trumps Tweets would have contained even more ignition without their interventions.
We'll probably never know anything about the tweets Trump didn't send.
If his employees managed to keep trouble away from him a few times, then their efforts were rewarded.
But no one has consistently prevented Trump from causing controversy.
Part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, are constantly trying to move forward their own agenda by presenting Trump material that might promote their views from the world.
Politico - fully involved in this history - reported in May on the preference of consultants to provide the President with questionable information for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press cuts, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he will find out where they come from.
That is exactly what happened at the end of February when someone gave the President a wrongly printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocator Charles C. Johnson, who accused the Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh to be "the source behind a bunch of leaks" in the White House.
Although Johnson was permanently banished from Twitter because of harassment or that he did not offer any concrete evidence or that he had in the past expressed false accusations and revoked them.
Trump read the article and began to question employees about Walsh. "
Goldmacher added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter, have "tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork, which receives the Trump."
How did that work?
Kelly's trying to do the same three months later.
Maybe he will prove himself more effective as a Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors are still striving for influence.
These invariable factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Most wanted criminals get mail from Europol
Since the address is unknown, the people will be prayed and hoped for help.
This summer, the police across Europe send (virtual) postcards to dangerous criminals on the run.
Since the addresses of the wanted serious criminals are naturally not known, indications from the population are hoped and prayed.
Europol reported on Friday on the action following the "EU Most Wanted" Advent Calendar of Winter.
Experience had shown that many refugees hid their holiday destinations, it was said by Europol.
21 postcards were compiled for wanted criminals from 21 EU countries.
Since 2016, the website www.eumostwanted has been viewed more than 2.5 million times.
36 of the online requests have been arrested so far, at least eleven of them due to references after publication on the website.
Travellers negotiate a ditch and return to the millionaire series
Some of the most prosperous house owners of the West Midlands are again standing with some determined travelers on war feet who have negotiated a tomb drawn from the municipality to recover a field in front of their mansion houses.
The travellers have parked their 20 caravans on a field outside a prosperous road of Solihull called the "Millionaire series."
They brought horses, babies and an army of carriers after they were thrown out in May, but they were not frightened by a grave engraved by the Council to prevent their injuries.
The tactful group found a gap in the defence facilities and pressed their vehicles through a section that remained unhindered to find a way.
Evil residents have pressured the council of Solihull who said it was "useless to deal with the problem."
An anonymous residents said, "They moved there on Monday night after they were forwarded by Bentley Heath where they threw stones on the passengers.
The Council must be forced to implement by shame because it was useless in dealing with the problem.
The travellers were there in May, moved further and are now back.
More arrived last night, probably more today. "
She added: "The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by holding long lessons to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I am not happy to continue to pay my municipal tax if the Council cannot even stop it. "
A residents who didn't want to be called said, "It's ridiculous, we just saw the last round of these travellers just to be plundered by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and one has even seen a horse in the parking area. "
A speaker from the Solihull Council said: "We are conscious of an unauthorized camp on the country beyond Streetsbrook Road and work with the Solihulls Police. We take the necessary legal steps so that they move forward as soon as possible.
In order to support our collection of evidence, it is very important that as many residents as possible report an anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court has to examine when we present our case. "
From Birkenhof, forest hotel Luise
From the former Hotel Birkenhof is the forest hotel Luise.
The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadts is currently being renovated and is to be opened again on 1 March next year.
That's good news for the city.
Because with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014, about 30 000 nights per year were lost and also revenue from the Kurtaxe.
In the autumn of 2014, the hotel building was offered to the Landrat as a collection accommodation, given the dramatically rising numbers of refugees coming into the county, which led to controversial discussions.
The city prevented the lodging of asylum seekers by drawing up a construction plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not undisputed in the council at that time.
But most of all Freudenstad's mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel site and spoke of serious interest in the house.
He should be right.
The Luisenhotels group with Managing Director Birgit Scherer, headed in Bad Bergzabern, has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three-star plus category under the name of Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the Freudenstädter object.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
They are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
The former Hotel Birkenhof has been in front of the entrance for a long time, and when you enter the house, it will be clear what extensive renovation work is being done.
The floors were torn out, blankets were partially demolished, old bathtubs were removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single construction site.
There is still a lot to do until March.
"It's actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper.
Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large walking showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed.
Everything should later be "pretty bourgeois," as Thomas Scherer expressed himself.
"We want to make a piece of jewelry."
Swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room are part of the facilities.
One would not want to position itself at the high level of hotels in Lauterbad, but already at an elevated downtown level, Scherer emphasises.
The forest hotel Luise with its about 60 rooms wanted to stand wide, explains Scherer further.
Both individual vacancies, groups or businessmen should feel comfortable at the hotel.
He already had talks with OB Julian Osswald and Tourism Director Michael Krause, so Scherer.
The ideas of the city are similar to those of the hotel group.
"We're on the same line."
According to the amount of investments, Thomas Scherer does not want to define himself in detail.
Nearly one million euros, he's counting.
The outdoors are also brought to the front, which is already clearly visible.
In a courtyard there is a large terrace that will be accessible from the public restaurant.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market."
Russia's affair: US Special Investigator uses Grand Jury
In the Russian affair around US President Donald Trump, special investigator Robert Mueller is supposed to have set up a so-called Grand Jury after a report.
The board has taken up the work in recent weeks, wrote the Wall Street Journal, calling on familiar persons.
The newspaper appreciated the step as a sign that Mueller extended and intensified his investigation.
The CNN broadcast reported that there were already first invitations from the board in connection with a meeting between Trump's oldest son and a Russian lawyer.
US Secret Services have long accused the Kreml of having been specifically involved in the 2016 presidential election campaign.
Mueller investigates whether there were agreements between Trump's campaign team and Moscow.
The investigation should focus on several men who acted as the Republican's advisor in the campaign.
According to reports, Mueller also took more and more trumps private and business environment under the loop.
The Washington Post wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Investigator Trump personally moved into the center and investigated the accusation that the president might have hampered justice in the course of the affair.
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine the evidence available in possible criminal cases and to decide whether to charge.
Grand Jurys are therefore also referred to as prosecution chambers.
They are usually switched on when they are larger and controversial cases.
The procedure is always done behind closed doors.
The body can also be switched on by the Public Prosecutor to invite persons to interview under oath.
According to CNN, presentations have already been issued about the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
Persons who were involved in the meeting had been asked to testify, it was said in the report.
They should also provide documents.
In addition to Trump Jr., Trump's advisor and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his then electoral chief Paul Manafort were involved in the conversation.
On Thursday night, right-wing experts said on US television that the deployment shows that Mueller is not being intimidated by his work and that, if necessary, he wants to act quickly.
However, it should not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on in the end to decide on the imposition of an indictment.
However, the establishment of the panel would be the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Trump.
In the middle of the new revelations, the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday night to represent the Russian affair as a campaign of his political opponents.
"The Russian history is a total invention," said Trump.
The subject gives the Democrats an opportunity to "feel good because they have nothing else they can talk about."
His special advisor Ty Cobb stated in an opinion that he did not know about the establishment of a Grand Jury.
He emphasised that this work was also usually in secret.
The White House supports any action that accelerated the work of the special investigator in a "fair" way.
The former FBI chief James Comey has said three times that it is not being investigated against the president.
There is no reason to assume that something has changed about it, it continued in the Declaration.
Mueller had only been used after Trump Comey had fired.
Because of this outcast, accusations against Trump had become loud that he wanted to obstruct justice.
Comey announced in June in front of a Senate Committee that Trump asked him to terminate the investigation against the then national security advisor Michael Flynn.
The President is under great pressure for the investigation.
After presenting US media, the White House collected material against the Special Investigator and his employees.
It triggered speculation about whether Trump Mueller wanted to release.
In contrast to an independent special investigator of the Congress, such as in the Watergate affair about the later resigned President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired by the Ministry of Justice at the request of the President.
Several senators of both parties, however, want to prevent such a step.
Two groups of Republican and Democratic Senators presented draft laws on Thursday, according to which the special investigator could no longer be released so easily.
Antarctica: Giant Ice Mountain Drives in Antarctica
In the West Antarctic, a gigantic iceberg of almost seven times the size of Berlin has dissolved from the shelves.
This was announced by the Bremerhavener Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Maritime Research on Wednesday.
The coloss of over one billion tons of heavy and 5800 square kilometers now drives north and will probably take two or three years until it has melted.
It is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered in the last three decades with a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres.
A danger to people is not going on with him.
The extent to which climate change has played a role in the breakdown of the iceberg is unclear according to researchers.
However, for about 30 years, there have been a series of unusual collapses of ice shells in the region, the US Research Centre for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) writes in a background.
Many researchers believe that this could be related to global warming.
The now broken coloss has so far been part of the Larsen-C shell fever.
Schelfeis swims on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.
It thus grows further into the sea and breaks down regularly.
Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.
The balance of growth and disruption was disturbed north of this shell feather a few years ago.
A complete shell fever has fallen down there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
It speaks for the Larsen-C shelves being in danger too, because the front edge has never withdrawn as far as the present.
In addition, the ice plate is under voltage and may fall if a piece breaks down at a key point.
The melting of shelves and iceberg does not increase the sea level, as they swim on the water and squeeze ice as much water as it results from melting itself.
However, the loss of the shell feather leads the glaciers to flow directly into the sea and to flow much faster than before.
This could potentially increase the sea level, but only to a small extent, writes the British research project to monitor the Antarctic (Midas).
The Larsen-C shell fever is the fourth largest shell fever in the Antarctic, according to AWI data with almost 50 000 square kilometres.
At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters.
There it breaks off regularly.
"Although it is a natural event and is not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the ice shield is now in a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary from British Swansea University.
"This is the widest withdrawal since the start of the records," he also confirmed.
Among scientists, it was controversial whether the Larsen-C shelves will grow again or fall back in the long term and possibly collapse, his colleague Adrian Luckman said and added: "Our models say it will be less stable."
But this development will take decades.
Although these researchers do not lead to the breakdown of this giant iceberg, very many ice shells of the Antarctic Peninsula have been broken in recent decades.
This long zipfel of the Antarctic extends towards South America.
According to the British Antarctic Survey research programme, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has fallen by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s.
The rise in temperature has contributed to the decline.
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed up by about three degrees over the last 50 years and is one of the areas where the temperature rises the fastest.
CDU wants to get home to the staff
Since it is becoming increasingly difficult to occupy vacancies, the CDU calls on the employers' association to leave in order to become more attractive.
Only shortly before the summer break, the Circuit Day has whistled 41 new posts in the administration.
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.
Now again, 17 trainees have their first working day behind themselves.
The courses at the circle seem to be very desired.
Approximately 620 applications were recorded for the places to be awarded this year.
Nevertheless, the circle still lacks staff to meet the increased requirements and tasks.
At present there are still 50 unoccupied posts in the Mettmann district.
Doctors, engineers and the general administration are requested.
The CDU now wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG in the Circuit and counter the shortage of staff in the administration.
The management is intended to "develop an approach to the collection and development of personnel," as requested by the parties.
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs for professionals, but to address the future-oriented lack of applicants, says it.
The overall concept should be inward and externally oriented, show concrete measures for cross-border entrants and include a training offensive, calls for CDU, FDP and UWG.
That sounds like a good approach.
Because the circle has to do with personal problems that you didn't know before.
Other cities recruit good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
It is a question of a regular "competition of public employers."
In addition, a high number of employees who leave the service on grounds of illness or age.
So the highest time to act so that no more jobs remain unoccupied.
But Klaus-Dieter Völker, head of the CDU group, goes beyond the joint request with his party.
He recently made a foolish surprise in the circular day when he publicly questioned the staff cost coverage and amazed the other parties.
People would like to see all the possibilities that allow them to leave the municipal employers' association.
"If we do not arrive at a satisfactory solution in the short term, the circular administration with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the circular cities - should seek a house starif," said peoples.
This means that the CDU is trying to pay the employees and officials better than it actually provides for the public service tariff.
The salaries are currently strictly prescribed, increases or more money are only available if you move to a higher level based on working years.
But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.
Only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be set up in which employees deal with the provisions of the new prostitute protection law.
Not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Hendele and Circuit Director Martin Richter have a problem: they have too little staff.
Italy strengthens the tone to NGO migrants rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs who use rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they should not continue to do so if they do not comply with new rules for their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.
Minnitis Warning came a day after the Italian authorities seized a boat from the German Youth Rescue Organisation, because their team had worked effectively with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to comment on detailed allegations by the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us the rescue of human life is and remains our top priority. So we are very sorry that we cannot operate at the moment in the search and rescue zone," said the organization in an opinion on social media.
"We can only evaluate all the accusations that are currently being made after we have collected all the information and can assess the situation."
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the boat of 'Youth Saviour', the Iuventa, since October.
It is suspected that his crew takes on board helicopter migrants that are delivered directly by traffickers and that the smugglers can leave so that the ships can be used again.
At least one such meeting was supposed to take place only 1.3 miles from the Libyan coast, according to the DA's file, whose content was published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected to move beyond the authority of the Italian Coast Guard to monitor rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other reasons.
Under the Code of Conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must, in particular, have an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to comply with the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary, but acceptable, as they would not bring "significant changes or disabilities" to their rescue operations.
Among those who refuse to sign are the Nobel Prize Organization doctors without boundaries (MSF).
Minniti has now said that the number of migrants arriving after rescue measures in Italy has declined sharply in recent weeks, indicating that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local mayors have yielded fruits.
"In the last few days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," the Minister said.
He announced plans for further discussions with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
Increases and Trials
Nine Weilermer Biker, the Berlin outpost and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the North Palatinate to enjoy four days of trials and sights.
Three friend guides were available for this.
The accommodation in the Wachenheimer Valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
The first tour led at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelchapel above Deidesheim.
The outlook was followed, partly on towers, from which one could look far above the woods and the precursor levels.
Meanwhile, there were always longer rises for which long trials rewarded.
On the second day it went to Bad Dürkheim to Saline and Volksfest Wurstmarkt.
Once again, the outlook was at the point of view, linked by "floating" trials and moderate increases.
In the last two days, a lot of altitude meters were announced again.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and cabins brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim the bikers breathed in the free air inhalatory healing soles.
New Town was also controlled.
After 173 kilometers and almost 4500 meters of altitude, the group had met the Pfalzer Forest from its best side - sports and cultural.
Console instead of lawn - Bundesliga rests for e-sport
Do the sports stars sit in front of computer consoles in the future, instead of sweating through the wind and weather over the stadium races?
The fact is: E-Sports has long become a serious industry, become a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gains included.
This has also been recognised by the first federal League members who are increasingly engaged in this field.
The VfL Wolfsburg began in 2015, later followed the FC Schalke 04 and last the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an E-Sports Division in mid-July and signed two professions for the computer game FIFA 17.
"We hope to enthusiasm all new young target groups for the VfB," says Jochen Röttgermann, board of directors.
He's sure "there are still some clubs on this train."
In the next weekend, the FIFA World Football Association will organize the first "Interactive Club World Cup," where the gamers of various clubs will face each other.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or the PSV Eindhoven qualify.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sport.
The former coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen has now advised an agency for virtual football players.
"The real football has to deal in particular with the 14 to 30-year-olds that young people will continue to go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.
And: The associations tried to conquer all possible markets, especially the Asian ones.
With prominent e-athletes under contract one could be much more available online on these markets than sending the Federal League to Asia only once a year.
What exactly is this about?
In e-sport, computer games like "League Of Legends," "Dota 2," "Counterstrike" or just the football simulation FIFA are being fought at competition level.
For the long time, as in normal sports, lies have been established in which the pros stand against each other.
And at the Asia Games 2022, e-sport is already part of the official program.
But is it even a real sport?
For many, the idea is certainly necessary for ordinary people.
Ingo Froböse has been dealing with the issue for a long time.
For the professor at the German Sports School in Cologne, e-sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in classical sports - for example increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
It also needs cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding and a fast response capability.
Professional gamers should train not only at the console but also their body and respect the diet.
"The pussy player is a good player."
Froböse also sees problems: "Doping is becoming more and more a subject."
Controls are difficult to implement in online games, and in the scene the structures of classical sport were lacking.
The scientist positively highlights the high integral effect of e-sport.
The players are on their way internationally, which is like a large global family, there are no intercultural barriers.
A study by the company consultancy Deloitte and the Federal Federation Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts racial growth for e-sport.
In 2016, 50 million euros had been implemented in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsoring and major tournaments.
In three years, sales will be 130 million.
In contrast to the nearly 2.4 billion euros of the Federal League of Football, this is little.
However, the e-sport is "no longer far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," the Deloitte consultants write.
There are many countries on the international scene.
Large markets are Asia and the USA, where ex-basketball players Shaquille O'Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez participate in the US team NRG eSports.
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSport competition provider Unikrn.
Much is done in Europe too.
In a Norwegian school, e-sport had been introduced as a teaching field, says Froböse.
In the Netherlands and France, the First League Football Association, according to Dutt, is now obliged to set up an E-Sports Division.
"In European comparison, Germany is tracking behind," explains the VfB board Röttgermann.
Only to fall into nostalgia, and to explain the old times, is not enough today.
It is about preserving the tradition of the association, but at the same time orientation the company to the modern market.
"We live in a digitalised world," Dutt also says.
"You can't hold on to the fact that only football remains the way it used to be."
Gift eggs ade - The egg alternatives for cooking and baking
The scandal of poisonous eggs has now affected almost all the Länder.
Aldi South and Aldi Nord have responded and taken all the eggs from the sale throughout Germany.
In the shelves only eggs are to be taken that do not appear to contain fipronil.
Michelle Carter sentenced to suicide for the texts that conrad Roy pressed for.
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend by texts and calls for suicide.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years were suspended on parole.
Carter was convicted in June for negligent killing by Conrad Roy, who took his life on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father said on Thursday at the hearing, "My family is uncomforted.
My son was my best friend. "
Carter was allowed to remain free until the vocation.
She had been confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr. Roy suffered from a mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and a cream-coloured blouse, Carter stood there with tears in the eyes, with folded hands and pointed down eyes when she was convicted.
"Your actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor said to the court.
"She ended his life to make her own better.
She did not take responsibility, "she said.
"She didn't show any repentance."
But Carter's attorney said it was a "terrible circumstance that she completely regrets."
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said that he did not find out that her "age or maturity or even her mental illness have a significant influence on her actions."
A prosecutor read a statement from Roy's mother Lynn Roy saying that there is "no day I do not regret the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything. I try to be there for his sisters in spite of all my pain that we will carry for eternity. "
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, said that she was "followed" by the realization that she would never attend her brother's wedding or be an aunt for his children.
"To no longer have this only person with whom I have been with every day since my birth is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said.
The case seems to be a legal precedent because there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead from carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case attracted national attention after Carter's text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life.
"Hang up, jump from a building, stab yourself, I don't know, there are many ways," she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family.
In the moments before his suicide, she wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad," and "All you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter was looking for attention through Roy's death and ordered them to benefit from the case by any press.
The case has shared the legal opinion.
One of the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was sentenced to murder in 2007 to her British roommate in Italy before she was released two years ago.
Ms. Knox, 30 years old, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison."
Joshua Kimmich: Learning from the new Mini-Lahm of FC Bavaria
The fact that Joshua Kimme was allowed to run as captain at the Audi Cup is not a coincidence.
The FC Bavaria trusts the Confed Cup winner with a big season - extra motivation does not harm.
There was something different in his place in the cabin, which Joshua Kimme immediately saw, even though the additional garment was very, very small.
But since far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cups, of course, no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel New was to see, he stopped the bond he was assigned to his arm.
"The coach did not announce it," the Confed Cup winner said after his first operation as the Bavarian captain.
Good, the station could have run better than at 0: 2 against the SSC Naples.
But the sign of the coach Kimme was able to say so.
Not the eight years older Arturo Vidal had been chosen as a leader in the C-Elf, who had been chosen from youth players, debut dancers and just from the holiday.
Sugar l is the preferred distribution to those to whom you trust a great deal to keep in humble mood.
So whoever has been extraterrestrial to the inheritance of lamb can only use a small extra motivation.
Kimme confirmed: "This is what you want as a player: take responsibility."
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old flashed over the field as a mini-lamb.
Behind the right, this is his position, the white bond on the arm did the rest of her.
And at all, Kimme worked in this starting formation like the one who can take the rowing in the best hands.
He gave instructions, tried to steer the unplayed troop.
He had the whole look, while many others were busy with themselves.
Vidal was able to survive his lack of fitness (barely worked); Renato Sanches was able to get to the devil to get out of the achievements of the Asia trip (also only worked conditionally); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Søle did not notice negatively in their first appearance in the Bavarian tricot.
That worked very well anyway.
Süle ran up next to Kimme, Rudy before the defense, both acted sovereign.
The namely occupied Naples storm often made itself difficult, and also Søle tried to play successfully a few times.
Although his colleague Rudy admitted that the result was "not as we hoped."
But he also showed a proper performance at the debut.
Game shift, change of tempo: "For this style I was picked up too."
How unusual this Bavarian world is still for the newcomers, one saw after the party.
For example, Rudy did not give one or two interviews in the catacombs, but determined six or seven interviews.
Kimme said goodbye after a few crazy statements in the back of his new players.
He heard an interesting phrase from Süle: "What's going on here, I've already noticed.
At Bavaria you just have to win every game. "
After all, he doesn't have to teach the new one anymore.
Alaba motivated OFB-Ladies
David Alaba believes in the success of our public service ladies
Austria's best-known football player reported about Twitter shortly before the game and wished the public service ladies all the best.
The Bavarian Legionary is virtually a club colleague of ÖFB Captain Schnaderbeck and fires with our ladies.
The Tweet of the Austrian soccer of the year and the Champions League winner should be a special motivation syringe.
The famous Bavarian Dusel may also be well needed by our ladies.
Company satisfied with Rheinland-Pfalz Minister: Economy praises Wissings Tempo
The relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still Minister of Economy of Rhineland-Palatinate, was often unreconcilable.
This is apparent after more than a year when the new Minister for Economic Affairs Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.
Chambers and companies from the region speak on T V request of a change in economic policy - and at the same time the old minister.
Frank Natus, Chairman of the Association of Trierer Enterprises (VTU), says: "Wissing tackles the wishes of the economy that Lemke has all blocked."
The largest turning point is Natus in infrastructure policy: the gap between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country's priority list.
This year the Ministry is hoping for a planning procedure, and until 2021 the construction law will be established.
A role in the country's plans also plays the west circumvention of Trier, which is in the pressing need of the Federal Traffic Plan.
The aim is to launch the route in December 2020, says Minister spokesman Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees it as a guide to support regional but internationally competing companies.
The Chamber of Industry and Commerce (IHK) Trier, as suggested by Wissing, seeks to use a Rhineland-Palatinate label in wine to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports that have declined for ten years.
In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to create their own company, the IHK praises.
In the new Master Bonus, the Trier Chamber of Crafts sees an additional incentive for young trainees, says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach.
A premium of 1000 euros is provided for the completed Master Examination and 2500 euros if graduates make themselves independent within 10 years of Master Training.
But the homework list for the country remains long.
In the planned road construction it is fast to create facts, while the country lacks the necessary staff, says Jan Glockauer, head manager of the IHK Trier.
Of 56 new engineers wishing to recruit mobility in the national operation, only 29 jobs have been employed so far.
The IHK calls for more contracts to be awarded to external offices.
The CDU Group Vice-President Christian Baldauf refers to the Court of Auditors' calculations, the country invests more than EUR 20 million less in the preservation of national roads in 2017 and 2018 than proposed.
Frank Natus also expects a concept of the country as it intends to address the lack of expertise in the region.
It is also worrying that there has been a widespread expansion in the country.
In 2016, regional companies had only rated the network supply in an IHK survey with note 3.4.
They complain about increasing Internet connections and interruptions.
On the other hand, ex-Minister Eveline Lemke is currently out of politics and is still in the Supervisory Board of the Wind Power Company Pro Wind.
The Green Group left Lemke in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where it restored the field after four months for inconsistencies.
Audi is supposed to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers are faced with a counter reaction
One day before Audi's announcement BMW said it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said that the company considered that "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions," referring to European cities, including Munich, where BMW is based, to ban or restrict diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the companies as recalls.
European car manufacturers have strongly promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions rules.
But the nitrogen oxides emitting diesel engines are considered carcinogenic and can cause asthma.
The costs for car manufacturers to install systems to neutralize exhaust gases discharged by diesel vehicles are also increasing, which makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
The German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of obscuring the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
Companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen that could regulate the use of so-called shutdown devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the rules when a car was tested but drive back under normal driving conditions.
In the United States several employees were accused of Volkswagen, others are being examined on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in Audi's engine development in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be brought to justice in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations on Volkswagen, after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circumvent emissions rules in Europe, and a question focused on the United States was extended.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could be difficult to burden Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to the profit of Volkswagen.
This message has the fleet on Saturday on the Isar
The city is trying to protect the Isar.
In order to join the Isar visitors, tomorrow Saturday a fleet runs through Munich, which has a special message.
Whosoever draws to the Isar again on Saturday, he will see a large fleet there between the riches and the riches.
And this is not a regular fleet, with Isar tourists.
But the building department is trying to clarify.
On the river you can see a large infoot ranger.
It shows a trash mountain.
The start of a public campaign to appeal to the Isar visitors.
With the motto "True love is..." the understanding of the Isar as a protective flow of wildlife should be strengthened.
Last summer the fleet drove over the Isar and this year there are other actions and measures to achieve a prudent and environmentally conscious behaviour.
Mordilless Knollennasen and the laugh against suffering
Mordillo was sometimes one of the most published cartoon designers, and the knollennasen of his characters are his trademark.
Also with 85, the Argentinean is still drawing and is working on a film.
His message: Laugh, "because there is too much suffering in the world."
Guillermo Mordillo was born on August 4, 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.
In the first years as an artist, he passed through, among other things, as a painter for lucky cards - which frustrated him.
"The happiest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job," he once said.
After stations in Lima, New York and Paris he succeeded in breakthrough at the end of the 1960s: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then also in "Star" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
Always again, the artist of cities inspired himself.
Large round Mordillo figures are in drawings with the skip tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.
In the early morning he is still sitting on the drawing table today, working almost ten hours a day.
About calendars, puzzles, books for big and small, T-shirts, plushions and watches his dreadful figures continue to find a great deal of spread worldwide.
For six years he has also been working on a drawing film and a TV series with his characters.
The main person in the movie "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - the most popular animal in his drawings - which has a thousand fountains as a counterplayer.
For the first time his characters speak in the 3D film, which is supposed to come to the cinema wall in 2019.
"I don't know exactly what they're going to say, it's weird for me," says Mordillo.
The script is not written by him.
This is why he rather puts on the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is produced worthlessly.
Lavender from the Provence threatened by climate change
He has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change.
The Lavendel is declining due to the conditions of drought and the insects transmitted by diseases, which causes great headaches to scientists and farmers who try to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, expert at the Farm Research Institute CRIEPPAM in the Provence, said: "The Lavendel in the Provence is effectively threatened because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years, which brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn.
This has an impact on the lifetime of Lavendel.
There is also a small cicade, a microbacterium that transmits dwarf cicads, and in very dry weather there are very many of them. "
And there's a lot at stake.
Lavender oil not only attracts for holidays, it is also very demanding for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said, "Instead of having very long vegetable ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have less parts with essential oil. "
The solutions considered include better water distribution and the slowdown of dilution from the soil, but also the spraying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drought.
The town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhine celebrates its 1200-year-old existence today.
The highlight is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval party.
Creams, teeth, dealers, vagans or a landscaping camp are to be experienced in the city center these days.
The assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico
The staff of Riodoce's weekly mission usually meet on Wednesday to review their plans for reporting the latest chaos in the state of Sinaloa through organised crime, corrupt officials and endless drug wars.
But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
They were told that it is important to change their routines.
Two high-level journalists discuss what feels safer: to take their children to the office that was the goal of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a table on the front of the room: opponents, neutral, allies.
They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary, perceptions and abdominal feelings are sufficient.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of being on the wages list of the government or the cartel, a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.
There is no rest of violence, and while the corpses are increasing throughout the country, more and more journalists are involved: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto entered office in December 2012. 589 are subject to attacks and threats under federal protection and so far there were at least seven dead in seven states this year.
Among the latter are their editor and inspiration from Riodoce, the co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on drug-related violence.
His lack is deeply felt, although his presence is everywhere - a big picture of Valdez, showing his middle finger with the word "justice," is attached to the facade of the Riodoce building. Two reporters in the thirty years, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical panamahut.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared subjects, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal attorney was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, only two criminal proceedings were initiated.
As with the majority of thousands of murders involving drug trafficking and organised crime every year, the murderers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.
At Riodoce they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are uncomforting and although the terrain is now even more treacherous.
Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting has little benefit to discuss security, says Ibarra.
"It's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
"As long as we don't know why, we're all suspicious."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the newspaper's office in the capital of Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. He was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot at him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "Twelve River."
The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left a woman and two adult children.
Rumors tend to fly freely to Culiacan.
But about Valdez there is virtually nothing but silence.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and the extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa had become one of the most bloody battlefields of the country since rival groups struggle here to fill the vacuum.
It doesn't matter that every day in Sinaloa, someone or more people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of redundant, two-piece mousoleas for drug kings that are bigger than many houses for the living.
Forget for a minute that there is a state of "tranquility" if only one cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States.
Nevertheless, and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, is broken with the blame that he could not protect his friend.
He believes that two misunderstandings contributed to the murder.
First, in February, there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel fractions in the war with Guzman's sons.
This publication may have upset the sons, suspected gang members purchased each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper skioske.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country at his own security after seizing another newspaper that had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there.
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues for Riodoce and sold 50 US dollar shares.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to run journalism without facing the problem of drugs," said Bojorquez.
With time, the newspaper earned a reputation for brave and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved to be able to publish hard-hit investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat.
Eight years after Riodoce was founded, she received the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Prize for her reporting in Latin America.
In the same year Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in persecution of Mexican drug history wherever it went.
He volunteered to admit he was afraid.
"I want to live," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a lifestyle," he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV.
"You must take on the task that you have as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb.
I don't want to be asked, "What have you done in the face of so many dead... why didn't you tell me what happened?"
The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the fun bird who could curse like a port worker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted his routine.
He'd always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit there at the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love for routine his destruction?
His death has also forced them to question their own assumptions about how they can do their work best and stay alive.
"They don't like it when you're dealing with their women, their children, their clean shops, their secret runways to move drugs."
"These things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.
The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-esteem.
Trust his own instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away from it.
The trouble is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that "smell a sense that can be cheated... and then the thing happened to Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce's staff met for security training, suddenly no phones were allowed. Days before it was known that Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two policemen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.
They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a middle-class quarter of Culiacan.
Half the joke, some of the reporters asked themselves whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the police who the governor himself called untrustworthy.
It's been months since the reporters went to the mountain landscape where the drug bands are actually under control.
For the issue of this week, Riodoce has looked at three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of former known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exposé on government expenditure, which focused on the governor's hometown.
And there was a group who conducted a kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the DA's office.
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was advised when it was time to write what everyone in town knows: that the restaurant is a favorite place of drug dealers and authorities.
A reporter found out from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which ruled almost all political levels throughout the century.
Recently, several PRI Governors were accused of corruption due to high-careers.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this place, including one in which a son of El Chapo Guzman missed a military robbery.
Only a few months earlier, the readers would have considered the column of Valdez as the best informed source of kidnapping.
"In the past we would have known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El Flaco" because of his slim body stature.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources have been broken."
Valdez's office was renamed as a storage room for characters and stickers protesting against the murders of journalists, because the employees have become something they would never have expected: activists in the name of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed some signs and went to a demonstration the next morning for another journalist to the prosecutor's office.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.
A burned body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is his.
Journalists have become more loud throughout the country by writing in organized protests "SOS Press" on trails and buildings.
On that day the director Bojorquez is gone to Washington and tries to gather international support for justice in Valdez case.
In a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa the day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and killing them because they were telling the truth.
She has been asking for it to be redivided by the government since then because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were "surrounded" by organised crime, government officials involved in it and an indifferent society.
In his last book "Narco-Journalism," he wrote that reporters are killed not only by drug bands, but also by orders of politicians and security forces who were under a ceiling with the organized crime.
The Media Guardian Group "Articulo 19" has assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists to the police and officials last year.
"In Mexico you die because they want you to shut up," said Ramirez.
Obviously, the murders have a dissuasive effect.
No one forgets the death of Blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found together with a note that was allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "Here I am because of my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones were located next to their separated head.
Some branches have chosen to close, such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of her director in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with a lead article on the title page entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled from their homeland or even from the country.
It's a painful decision.
It's hard to find work in exile, and they're still watching the streets and looking for danger.
And sometimes they are chased, as apparently the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz.
For those who stay behind and continue work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that drug trafficking scares him.
"Mexico goes to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
At midnight last Friday, when the last edition was already finished, the editors of Riodoce sat in front of the office on the street and drank beer when all their phones suddenly began to sum up.
A series of shootings with rivals and security forces near the city of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed deaths.
The war continued to escalate as promised by a number of cartel messages in the region.
From the table stone edge, they have published the news on the Riodoce website via mobile phone.
The title page had to be changed the next day.
Siren cried up nearby - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez took a look at the cops who kept the guard to see if they were ready.
If they were scared at all, they wouldn't show it.
Under the tremendous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose midfinger was visible to the whole of Sinaloa, Riodoce's employees followed his traces.
"How can you even think of closing," said Bojorquez, "when on the same day Javier was murdered, the trainee asked me to send her to the street for reporting."
Dinosaurs used cover to avoid his enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, though a frightening one.
Now researchers have found out that the first findings of the incredible nashorn of a Canadian miner were so well preserved that experts described it as "Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs."
It was so well preserved that they could even find that his lazy skin was red brown - and they said she had something of a "troubled past."
The report in the magazine "Current Biology" described him as "the best preserved armored dinosaurs ever found, and one of the best dinosaurs in the world."
The fossil is a newly discovered type of nodosaurier who lived in the middle of the time of the heritage between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredibly well-preserved condition has amazed researchers who describe it as "truly remarkable"
According to reports in National Geographic, the armored plant eater is the best preserved fossil of its kind
It was found by Shawn Funk on March 21, 2011 at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.
He encountered something that seemed wrong from the surrounding rock on the spot, and decided to look more closely.
The Fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
They spent the next six years detecting the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) of heavy ground clumps.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be disclosed.
"If you just blink a little with your eyes, you could almost believe it slept," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature can be seen.
"It will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."
Researchers have found that this plant eater, although it is covered with a armor and similar to a walking tank, was probably threatened by meat eating dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaurer used a red and white cover to hide from predators, and used a protective technique known as a countercoat that is also used by many modern animals.
This would have made it possible to mix better in his surroundings and avoid his enemies, experts say what suggests that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million years old creature from the family of Nodosauriers made headlines for the first time in May and is now to be seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and it Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours trying to detect it carefully.
The amazing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armor over his body.
They discovered the counter-estimation, a widespread defense method in the animal realm, which means that the tip of the creature was darker than its underside.
Although the calculation is common, the results are surprising as the size of Borealopelta exceeds the size of the animals living today.
It suggests that the dinosaurer was chased by enough pressure from meat-eating dinosaurs that evolution favoured the hiding of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most contemporary animals that use contra-valuation - think of rubs, zebras or belt animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than bust, which signals that this nodosaur was exposed to a real struggle for survival.
"Strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armored dinosaurer shows how dangerous the dinosaurs must have been of the time of herring," said Brown.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaurer was red brown.
Scientists continue to investigate the animal for evidence of his life, including his preserved intestine content, to find out what it ate as his last meal.
They believe that the dinosaurer, when he died, fell into a river and was driven out into the sea where he sank on his back to the seabed.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as southern florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much further than they are today.
"This nodosaurier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved skin but is also preserved in three dimensions and preserves the original form of the animal," Brown said.
"The result is that today the animal looks almost the same as in the early time of herring.
You don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it. If you just shake a little with your eyes, you might almost believe he's sleeping. "
The time of herring was a time, as giant theropods, meat-eating dinosaur that stood on two legs that went through the earth.
Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaurs were chased by some of his terrifying ancestors.
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11,5 m) long, six tons heavy monster.
The scientists whose latest findings appear in Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta fell down in the sea after death and was mumified in mumification.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk on March 21, 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the world's best armored dinosaurs, including skin and armor, and is completely from the mouth to the hip.
The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch-long tops ripping off his shoulders.
The researchers believe that the armored plant eater was floated through Western Canada until a flooded river fled it into the open sea.
But the underwater supply of the dinosaurer kept his armour in exquisitem detail.
The hidden remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin residue still covers hollow tanks along the dinosaurs
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as' rare as a win in the lottery.
The more I look at it, the more confusing it gets.
Stone remains of the skin still cover the hollow tank plates that carry the head of the animal.
His right front foot is on his side, his five fingers are spread upwards.
I can count the showers on his sole.
In the Thunderstorm: Massenkarambolage on A8: Many injured
Heavy accident on Thursday night on the A8: barely 30 vehicles are involved in a mass caramel company.
There are numerous injured, kilometers long stops and buffalo.
On the Stuttgart-Munich motorway (A8), about 20 people were injured by a mass caramel company on Thursday afternoon.
According to the police, at 5: 00 a.m. between the Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen connections (Aichach-Friedberg district), nearly 30 vehicles, including trucks, were interrupted during a thunderstorm.
The exact number of injured persons was not reported at first.
It was mild to moderate injuries, said a police officer.
A large supply of rescue vehicles was at the accident site.
The A8 was completely locked to Munich.
In the direction of Munich, a 10-mile-long rear was formed.
As an AZ reporter reports, massive disabilities also occurred on the counter track - through numerous buffers.
The fire department took note of the identification marks of the vehicle locomotives, which are now subject to sensitive penalties.
Shortly after 18: 45 a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
There was a collision between a car carrier and a car.
A rescue helicopter was on his way to the accident site.
Deutsche Bahn: Group tested "Comfort Check-In"
It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced before: nothing pretend to sit in the train and sleep.
Or you're deeper into your work and you have a brilliant thought right now.
And then, bufff.
The shepherd comes and wakes an ungentle or rips the passenger out of the workflow.
Ticket control.
But the times of interruptions will be over soon.
The German Railway is currently testing the creative-free ticket control.
You simply confirm by phone that you take your place and thus devalue the ticket.
A test operation is currently running on two lines.
"If the offer comes, we'll expand it.
It will then be available on many other distance routes in Germany at the beginning of next year, "said a railway speaker.
"Comfort Check-in" is called the train's ticket devaluation without shepherds.
However, in order to use it, some conditions need to be fulfilled: you need a smartphone or a tablet.
And you must have booked an online ticket - which most passengers already do.
You must also have bought it via the train app, the DB Navigator, which is anyway the most convenient type of ticket booking.
And last time you need a seat reservation.
Because the "comfort check-in" works like this: you get in the train, call your ticket under "My tickets."
The test customers then appear a button for electronic devaluation.
The train beginners get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and has taken the booked seat Y.
If the train companion comes to place Y on the ticket check, he knows that there is a passenger with already discounted online ticket.
So you can continue to sleep, to work, to remain silent.
The "check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which should in turn take advantage of passengers.
"If you want to travel through our train crew without a ticket check-in, you can check in with the DB Navigator yourself.
This allows passengers to make their travel time more personal in the train, "says Michael Peterson, Marketing Board of DB Remote Traffic.
Second plus: "And our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs."
Those who often drive trains know that along with delays and missed trains, ticket checks are one of the biggest troubles.
Because you often have yourself, but in any case one of the travellers does not have all the documents you need to devaluate online tickets.
Either the credit card or the identity card or any other document you need to present.
The result is endless discussions between train companions and passengers, which leads to bad mood in the section or large space and delays in checking the own ticket and takes the creator at the end of the time to deal with other concerns.
Only a small number of test customers can still use the new service.
And this also only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.
Other train numbers on the same track are not yet unlocked.
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"
On August 9, 2014 Brittany Ferrell was shaken up to her core.
Only one day after she arrived in New York City, the one born in St. Louis sat on the bed of an airbnb apartment she rented and scrolling through Facebook on her phone.
She jumped over a post from someone from high school.
"The police just killed an 18-year-old kid, and it's still on the street," he said there.
Confused since nobody else posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle @ TheePharoah was constantly rescued on their timeline.
The rapper from St. Louis's territory was about to kill the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, who was killed live by a white cop in Ferguson, Mo.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body, stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.
"That's wild," said Ferrell.
But death was nothing new for them and their community.
She dropped her phone to return to Tweets later in the evening about people on the Canfield Drive.
There were pictures of the police band and people who screamed, and of a man who claimed to be Brown's father wearing a shield with the label: "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live feed where a police officer stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a bellowing dog.
In another video, she said, another cop secured his gun and shouted, "I'll kill you... animals all."
"This is not usual," said Ferrell.
"This is not the kind of murder we've used to and we can typically call it."
At this moment, I felt chills.
I was angry and crying. "
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 23: 00, she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the next morning they would go to Ferguson.
What happened with Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years is the subject of a new documentary film, "Whose Street?," in the cinemas from the 11th century.
It is a history of survival and protest, of love and loss, of strength and of resistance from the perspective of people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell went to Ferguson with her daughter, who wore a flower dress and a suitable crown, they discussed a conversation that they had countless times before this morning "about the black experience and the black condition."
"You remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe in?" She remembered what she said.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right.
I couldn't take her with me, "said Ferrell later.
"What happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past.
She needs to know and see it and be raised in it.
It must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also the different layers of black experience and black constitution, and what we need to do to become free to free ourselves.
Even though I'm lucky to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience an eclatant racism, she is no different than the next black woman child.
I feel like I would prove her a bad service to keep her away from it. "
The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was on South Florissant Road, a place in front of the police department that became a campsite when the activists waited for the possible non-accusation of Officer Darren Wilson.
There Ferrell and her daughter joined a local businessman who made lunch.
They prepared bags and helped pass them on to demonstrators.
Slowly, a new type of activist for Ferrell form began to adopt.
"My activism has changed completely after 9 August," she said and noted that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on Essens justice and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
Everything has come. "
Weeks later, Ferrell met during an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film.
Folayan said that she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado Farrar just wanted to "document" what happened.
One question came to Ferrell's mind: "Do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use?"
This scepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often by white people - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance.
As Folayan recently said in an interview: "We had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson did not centrate their voices and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already worked with the former co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area that is known for his activism around death strait inmates.
His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Brown's shooting.
"This documentary film is not someone who speaks for us or with us. We talk," said Davis.
"That was the main thing for me as these people are represented, because that is how I will be represented."
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement "is not a Messiah leader, but a community that comes together," said Folayan - she proved to be the most open participant in the film.
As a result, documents from "Whose Streets?" reveal surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life as she falls in love and marries her wife.
"I felt naked," said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time.
"But I understand that there must be a certain vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people."
In addition, Ferrell's history repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement, who, after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, have shaped the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media, identify themselves as gay.
"Black, gay women in leadership positions have worn the movement as a whole," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are constantly fighting at different fronts.
Black, gay women must bear the main burden of everything. "
Folayan agreed to notice that "the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women."
However, it insists that "this is not a confirmatory type of action," where Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film because of its identity.
"She was the person who moderated this energy," she said.
"It is not a coincidence, although she was at the front, because in a life at these crossings as a black, gay woman is at stake so much.
You can feel their energy through the screen. "
Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have long disappeared, but the racial links between the municipality and the police continue to exist.
Ferrell is on parole for 2 ½ years due to the blockage of a motorway in a demonstration.
It describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "A chaos."
Nevertheless, she clinged to a song and she felt committed to this memory since she went to Ferguson three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "
From "dream" to "magnitude": TV readers discuss bit gallery
The bit gallery moves people, although it is not built for a long time.
But the idea of a shopping centre in the south of the pedestrian zone has split the population in favour and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.
Cold doesn't leave the subject to you.
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."
While one of them says to the bite gallery: "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be really great" (Nicole Schausten), from the other side comes: "Need no human" (Siggi Betzen) or quite simply: "Size!" (Lars Scholz).
While the supporters are building on the fact that a gallery attracts more customers to the city, which also benefits the rest of the business, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will then bleed out.
In addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the property on which the farmer market hall is located, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products.
With the construction work started, it will be over.
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Beda Square with the possibility to sit outside.
Simone Rooms: "We have been buying in the Farm Market Hall for many years almost weekly.
Especially our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the rural women are always very happy.
We also discovered the slaughterhouse for ourselves.
We would wish that there would be an opportunity to maintain this offer even during and especially after the construction of the gallery.
In other cities there is that too.
Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting. "
Gerd Densing: "Whether direct marketers live in a market hall in the gallery, depends on the height of the rent.
It should not be very low in the new project. "
Eva Kilic: "What for shopping spals in Bitburg?
Whether clothing, shoes, drug or supermarkets: I find this unnecessary.
There's enough of that in our city.
You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.
However, since there is not even a proper weekly market here, it is all the more important that at least the market hall will be preserved.
After all, the product offered there is fresh, is mostly offered directly by the producer and is above all priced.
As you can see, shops in a shopping centre are only rented by larger companies, because the rentals there are often not portable for a retailer.
Too bad, there are almost no more special shops and what's left of them will probably disappear. "
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping centre with a market hall doesn't fit for me.
And the gallery doesn't fit for Bitburg.
Above all, where is the farm market hall to go during construction?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long term, if the bit gallery actually comes at some point.
Or does the ghost bite gallery manage to sell all the deals from Bitburg before? "
George Marquet: "It's just not gonna work.
And no one needs a shopping center that's empty.
I think it would have been better to promote a real farmer market than this gallery.
But for a farmer's market hall, thanks to the insane many - as I think - construction projects in Bitburg are no longer meaningless.
When the farmmarket hall is destroyed, another piece of culture will disappear. "
An appropriate similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA
In the middle of the Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces - white, black and brown, which are almost unnoticeably similar - hanging on cables from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfer and hair cuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the cuts from the prison Fort Leavenworth, where the former intelligence analyst committed a 35-year prison sentence after publishing classified diplomatic messages on the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition, which was opened on August 2, is called A Becoming Resemblance (A suitable resemblance).
It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united its expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwife and pioneering disciple, whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office.
Dewey-Hagborg has, through the algorithmic analysis of the DNA extracted by Manning and created from the 30 portraits that someone could look like with these genomic data, a sharp, though even some intellectual comment not only on the formability of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also on the identity.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has spoken openly about identification as a woman since her puberty, was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of the Spionage Act, computer fraud and theft.
Through the prison her picture was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grain-white selfie in which Manning is apparently unwell sitting on a driver's seat and wearing a platinum blonde wig - with which she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of her 2012 project "Stranger Visions."
In this, the artist produced portraits of aliens from forensic artifacts such as cigarettes and chewing gum by extracting DNA from the waste to make a picture of how these people could look.
This was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.
"They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted some kind of portrait to accompany this article," said Dewey-Hagborg in a press review of the new exhibition.
And she couldn't visit at that time and she couldn't be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse were too uneven letters that exchanged several letters over two years.
They even created a comic "Suppressed Images," illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, "which predicted a future in which President Chelsea's judgment would change and it would be able to see the exhibition personally.
The fact that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published, demanding Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome kind of happy meeting.
There is also now something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government camp and against Transgender troops to find new, dual ways to further fire the rigid divisions that he should actually remedy.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things, she said that "Things happen for a particular reason."
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning called for an end to "automatic fragmentation, the basis of which was gender, race, sexuality and culture," with its overwhelming signature.
On the opposite wall, their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand feet of Cs and Gs and As, is written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show, by incorporating the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the highly developed scientific lexicon of the artist), how amazing similar, at least in biological terms, we are all.
"What people hopefully will take from it is that our genome does not care who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work, Spurious Memories, is also visible.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so that's 30 of these stories."
The last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in its own room, is a page from the above mentioned comic novelle.
It shows Manning how she shows up with a release phone in the hand from the US disciplines like King-Kong.
"If they call your speech, they won," it says.
"So don't shut up."
"It came directly from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist who greets from Philadelphia.
"I still get goose skin when I talk about it."
Manning has not seen the exhibition personally yet - as it was foreseen in the comic book - but if she should do it, then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks, by their own genomic simulators, which are together like hordes of protesters.
This was also targeted, as was everything in the exhibition, to the size (5 "2, Mannings stature), in which their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil.
"In the past, I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd of people," said Dewey-Hagborg of the portraits.
"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was also behind its liberation."
Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of the University of Oxford sought for killing
A country-wide hunting is going for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford University who is wanted as a suspect after a man had been stabbed with fatal injuries in a luxurious apartment in Chicago.
On Monday, Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) were issued warrants for murder for their alleged participation in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as the files of the Cook County Court show.
The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stitches.
A Community warning system published by the Chicago police department says that the body was discovered on July 27.
Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries on his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead at the place of the event, and detectives investigate the sticks as a murder while the police are actively looking for the two suspects, said officials.
Lathem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the vice president of university relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem had now been vacant and had been excluded from entering the Northwestern University campus.
"This is now a criminal matter that is being investigated by the competent authorities and Northwestern University cooperates in this investigation," said Cubbage.
Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.
A spokesperson from the University and Somerville College said in an e-mail statement that "we are in contact with the police in the United Kingdom and ready to help the US investigation authorities in any possible way."
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to stand up.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guglielmi, said he urged the suspects to stand up to the authorities.
"The police have an idea of their location, and our efforts to locate them strengthen themselves," said Guglielmi.
Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious tip that said something happened in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident had also taken place on July 27.
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," said Guglielmi.
The management team of Grand Plaza published a statement to the residents: "The police are currently working on the time axis and the background of the victim and exploring a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."
"We will complete the WADA roadmap in the near future" - the Russian Vice-Prime Minister Mutko
The Russian Vice-Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it won't take long until the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for restoring the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) are implemented.
"RUSADA has received the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping) at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap.
The WADA roadmap was updated in this respect, "Mutko said on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA roadmap to comply with the code which describes the criteria for restoring RUSADA and was recently published on the organisation's website.
According to Mutko, he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia.
"Everything has been announced, everything is being implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the WADA in the near future, "he added.
However, one of the criteria set out in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by WADA by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on alleged state-funded dopings in Russian sport.
As far as the matter is concerned, Mutko said: "We are conducting the investigation as our anti-doping system has confessed to a mistake.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no state programmes, and we will not admit something that does not exist. "
Mutko's words agreed with Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian anti-doping commission.
In conversation with the Russian sales office RSport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov raised problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organisations, but added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and rules.
No one intends to accept this report unconditionally, "added Smirnov.
In November 2015, RUSADA was excluded from the implementation of doping controls in Russia in the course of the doping scandal.
However, it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
After a visit to Moscow's headquarters in July, WADA Director-General Olivier Niggli explained that RUSADA is moving "in the right direction" to be redeployed.
Aldi no longer sells eggs
This was shared by the business groups.
It was a purely precautionary measure that it could not continue to be considered to be harmful to health, it was said in the Communication.
From now on, only eggs should be delivered to Aldi, which have been proven to have been tested negative for fipronil-containing anti-luminous agents.
Aldi wanted to create clarity and transparency with his customers.
The start-ups that will help your company not become the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure happiness at your e-commerce start-up, but the surveys did not work.
Responses were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - fraudulent.
And even if you promised anonymity, some workers didn't trust the process.
"There was simply never consistency and objectivity," Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Company Madison Reed.
She called people from outside for help.
A new race of Human Resources start-ups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it enables companies to carry out surveys, address special groups and demographic groups, offer employees anonymity and complaints hotlines, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to circumvent the C-Suite managers and directly contact the board.
"You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for the persecution of their health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said they won a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.
In addition to the Snap surveys and surveys of certain teams, it offers a heat card of the company, which shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which managers have low approval results - so you can retrieve why.
Companies come to see that you must remain at the top of the workplace culture so that you do not become the next Uber that has been involved in scandals since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of harassment where those who have spoken have been punished.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
Global governance, regulation and compliance industry could have more than $118.7 billion in 2020, according to the financial website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, which helps companies to prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of the Uber case in discredit.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently signed up as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send tailored "pulse" surveys, collect confidential answers in real time and see the heat maps of your problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.
And when the principal manager is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.
"The public opinion court has captured the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and managing director of Convercent.
When a company is found that is treated badly or is unethical, it can experience expensive consequences through consumer boycott, employee fluctuation and complaints, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have a simple opportunity to reach their business centre.
Earlier when a employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company central, submit a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously.
It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday General Counsel, who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees.
Now that the company employs Convercent, problems that were previously identified and addressed by managers who were in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair traineeships - can be more quickly identified and addressed.
"I can get closer to this holistic 360-degree view into the experience of employment," said Vitrano, who runs the Risk Management Group of Ruby Tuesday.
"And we protect our shareholders from employment disputes."
Companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after the accounting company Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations due to the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it lasted until the "social media came to their right" that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry from going online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service and charge companies with recurring fees for the use of their products.
It is a business model and a chance to find the consent of Venture Capital investors who have supported both start-ups.
Convercent received $10 million in the February financing of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, which increased the entire capital to $47 million.
Glitzern secured $10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners and brought his entire funding to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising, given the networking nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more of their jobs than before.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only operations.
The employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.
"If people are happy to be in a company, feel that their voices belong, and that the work you do is worth it, then they feel more committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors reach returns when their portfolio companies run well. Companies run well when employees are engaged and engaged.
If the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and the use of employees, it is no wonder that you find support.
Data on employee involvement according to the experts in the workplace culture is important.
But the data are useless if the managers of a company do not take action.
Indeed, if a company asks employees for your feedback, it may have a expectation that change is on the way.
And if the change does not come fast enough, or not at all, this can grow disappointment and demotify employees.
"If you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you need to be ready to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kotter International, who has seen companies who have relied too much on collecting data.
"Because if you don't follow staff will ask yourself," did you really hear me?
Are you taking care of this?
And who you don't care about, why should I? "
Madison Reed, who is now conducting monthly employee surveys, was able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported about Glint, says Errett.
And after gathering feedback from frustrated employees, she was able to reorganise several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems through the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company will always have new insights into the employees and hopes that in the long term, this will lead to a better binding of workers in an industry known for high sales.
"If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," said Vitrano.
"And if you lose people, you also lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you will lose companies.
The NCAA eliminates two-day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins
It goes up to 23: 00 when a lot of UCLA football players entertain on one side of the new training fields of the team on the campus.
Some have pulled out their tricotts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.
For a good part of the team, these inactive minutes represent a lunch break.
Players who are registered to the summer courses will return to their statutory audits after the three-hour exercise before returning to the Waterman Football Center the next morning at 6: 30 am.
"This is a real tree mill for the boys for the next three days," said Bruins Coach Jim Mora just before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to facilitate the burden of the players, and has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday.
Therefore, the first three training of the UCLA should start at 7: 15 in order to meet the already packed timetables of the players.
The compromise away from the two days is more than one day when the Bruins postponed the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras six games in Westwood practiced exercises.
They are supposed to hold 18 exercises during August. 20 before the start of the formal game preparations for their start against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said that he supports the change in the rules of the NCAA even if it adds another point to the highly employed routes of the players.
"We put this enormous burden on them three or four days, and it is very challenging," said Mora.
"And they just pushed it through, they keep sticking, they're great people.
I think as soon as we arrive by Saturday and we have more time, it will be really great. "
UCLA will end its practice as soon as the camp is finished, which, in view of the clear visibility of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center, a hotel of the elevated class, which has already been thrown with soccer balls that ruined a protective network behind a torpedo, will not be a easy task.
Bruins players are supposed to occupy the hotel from this weekend, but Mora announced that there might be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season.
"We will use our security," said Mora.
"This is a real problem, and it is not far away to think that people rent a room there and then chose to record a exercise there.
If you have the video tape from an exercise, it's a pretty good business.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces in parking lot 8.
We'll do the best we can with what we have.
I'm not too worried about that.
We have a plan. "
Facebook wants to intensify factual review in the fight against counterfeit news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false messages to third-party data auditors and then show their results under the original contribution, said the world's largest online social network on Thursday. It is one of its efforts to combat so-called fake news.
The company said in an opinion on its website that it will start using updated machine learning methods to detect possible false messages and send them to factual auditors who may display results of the factual examination from the original article.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, many of which believe that they have also influenced the US presidential elections in 2016.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, with French voters being flooded with false stories before the presidential elections in May, and Germany supports a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to quickly eliminate hatred postings as before the elections there in September.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate German statement that a test of the new facts review will be launched in the USA, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to the realization of which stories are being challenged by facts auditors from third parties, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share," said Sara Su, product manager for Facebook news in a blog.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the "related article" and work on other changes to his news feed to reduce false messages.
Creating a comic novel: A castle in the history of England
In his recent past, Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a clump for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history of his cosy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophair Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.
"I love to look at the handwriting of someone who's been dead for 300 years," he says weary.
"What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand."
'A Castle in England 'covers the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney. Every story was illustrated by another emerging British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It is not the first book by Rhodes based on an archive: He wrote 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories' in 2014, a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpected emotional.
"I only responded to the thumb print on the page of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700's who worked for the Jakobines," he says.
"That's his thumb print!
And letters always smell like smoke, because then a fire was lit because of the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if it were himself.
Oh, I love archives! "
For someone who has been struck so with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ("To be honest, I have overrated my welcome greeting"), all of this seems too beautiful to be true.
Rhodos spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, looking through the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosity of the castle, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and bottles that had spent centuries in the grave.
He walked through the grounds and ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscapes, gardeners and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night, he drank "whiskey and started writing."
The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, since the National Trust only received full access in 2006 when the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees just started to take care of the archive he described as "hundreds of years in which Aristocrats said" Oh, throw it on the attic. "
Daybooks, letters from the time of the English Empire, cards that represent who possessed something: "One could think that land conflicts would be boring," Rhodes says, "but there was a birch fighting around the two families.
Guys, let it all go! "
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive into English history on a broader basis, including 'The Labourer', following a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant upset of 1381.
"There is a record of a rebellion that appeared in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'," says Rhodes.
"The peasant uprising started in this area and I thought a uprising was a good start.
Maybe they're connected? "
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - such as "The Priest," which tells the story of the Jesuit Father, which the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or 'The Smuggler', in which the smuggling Arthur Darrell from the 18th century is presented, who stayed his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery that was made only years later when his coffin was buried).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favourite family of Scotney: "The gentlemen seemed to be a lot of gauntling, making debts and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good-looking boys, with a talent to recruit inside. "
After the end of his operation in the castle, Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences
He has made a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämanmäki, the site of a sanatorium from the early 20th century, which has been recovered from nature since then.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to go again," he says.
It was like, "Oh, now I have to deal with the fucking life again."
Campaign launched: Over 300 years old Marienkapelle concealed in Rhöndorf
With the cover of the 301-year-old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf, the city of Bad Honnef launched its campaign on Friday to introduce a new roof brand (Thursday's tour).
Until Thursday, Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and the slogan secret.
At the end of August there is supposed to be a feast on the island of Grafenwerth as the highlight of the campaign.
"Too good for us.
Right?, "ask the makers of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rhöndorf chapel.
"We don't really think that (of course!)," they write on their unlocked website yesterday.
"But we use this measure to gain your attention.
And to make it clear that some things are better than they seem.
Basically, we are firmly convinced that as a bath of Honnefer citizens we know very well about the beauty and attractiveness of our city. "
The action is about more than "just" a logo and a slogan, says it.
"It is important to formulate an exclusive promise, one which gives the city an indispensable exclusive character."
Finally, it is in competition with other municipalities.
The city of Bad Honnef can cost an average five-digit amount to its new roof brand and the campaign.
Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's fear of the army
Every year in early August, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) advises in Ankara about pensions and transport in the officers' corps.
Like this week.
At first glance, a normal procedure.
But nothing is routine with the Turkish armed forces one year after the pussy attempt.
The meeting took place no longer in the building of the General Staff, as before, but in the office of the Prime Minister.
The five Vice-Presidents, under the chairmanship of the Heads of Government, as well as the Ministers for Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs, took part in the discussions.
The number of civilians in the YAS was over.
The government is attracting the troops in the military.
Head of General Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the commanders of the army, the Air Force and the Navy have been dismissed.
Since the coup failed, Heads of State have fired 169 of the 326 generals and admigrants.
More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the armies - mostly due to alleged connections to the movement of the Exil Preacher Fethullah Gülen, who sees Erdogan as a wire drawer of the Putsch attempt.
486 people who are supposed to have been directly involved in the Putschtest have been negotiated in Ankara since this week.
Already on the day after the coup, Erdogan had called the attempt to conquer as a "God's gift," since he gave him the opportunity to "fully cleanse the forces."
But does Erdogan really control the army?
At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article entitled "Unpleasures in the military headquarters."
In the general team, there were concerns about an increasing "Islamisation" of the army, which, among other things, manifested itself in the abolition of the headlinen ban on soldiers, the newspaper wrote.
In any case, the great makeup of the army and the security forces continues.
In the middle of July, Erdogan had another 7395 state servants fired by the decree, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers.
At the same time, it seemed that Erdogan has numbered the military.
The generals were used earlier than the actual masters of the country.
Three times they popped on their role as guardian of the world state order.
After his 2002 election victory, Erdogan pushed back the military's power step by step, not least on the basis of the European Union's reform guidelines.
Former officers say that Erdogan is focusing on the islamisation of the armed forces.
In the magazine "Vocal Europe," an unnamed officer who sought asylum after the pussy attempt for fear of persecution abroad warned that the Turkish army would be "full of extremists and salafists" in a few years.
If this is true, such a development could not leave NATO cold.
There is also doubt in the Alliance after the cleansing of the Turkish army's willingness to intervene.
The management structures and operational capabilities are "weakened," NATO diplomats say.
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card, said President Donald Trump, quoted by the media.
It provides for a reduction of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for obtaining visas for temporary work permits and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.
The draft law is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, increase wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers and will do so by changing the way the US will spend on citizens from other countries Green Cards."
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
This new application procedure will benefit candidates who speak English who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy, "said Trump, quoted by the American media.
Ministry wants to restore track for racing shuttle
Always again in the past few months there has been a dispute about the future of the race hut - now it should go very quickly.
Even before the end of the year, it is planned to build on the marode route on which the tourist trail runs.
According to the Ministry of Transport, in order to ensure the future of the Rennsteigshuttle in the long term, construction work on the route is to begin this year.
"With the decision to continue ordering and refurbishing Ilmenau-Rennsteig, the country confesses to this particularly important connection for tourism," said Minister of State for Transport Klaus Sühl in Erfurt on Friday.
The cost of restoring the route was estimated at around €2.5 million.
Of this sum, the country takes over 75 percent.
The Treaty on the basis of which the shuttle is to be ordered by the country in the future is currently being definitively voted, said Sühl.
The Ministry and the South Thuringia Railway as an operator have already agreed on the technical details.
"The roadmap, the vehicles used and the quality standards are thus negotiated," said Sühl.
The planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be concluded for an eleven years.
In order to order the race shuttle regularly on December 2017.
The Rennsteig-Shuttle is a railway connection between Ilmenau and the Rennsteig stations, especially for tourists.
In recent months, a pilot operation had tested whether the route was used by enough people to order it regularly in the future.
The route is also very large in parts.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should worry
Just as you thought it couldn't get any more crazy in 2017, a new report comes on the technological developments in the field of sex robots.
Yes, indeed.
Sex robots are a big thing right now.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, emeritized professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we must begin to take their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of nipple and the type of fingernail.
"People are joking about them, but companies deliver a lot of them, and we will see them much more often," said Mr Sharkey when he published his new report.
Modern sexpupps have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also "customize" his robot according to his beliefs and select everything from the robot's eye color to the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails.
But it is even more worrying because many robots possess the "personalities" that would make a Stepford woman look progressively.
Modern Sexpupps have developed into robots with a silicone skin.
For example, the RealBotix robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the characteristics they find appealing, such as shame.
And then there are the Roxxxy Gold sex robots developed by True Companion with preprogrammed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah," which gives the impression of shame and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.
"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is as well adapted as possible to your personality," swarms the True Companion website.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
She also has her moods during the day - just like real people!
She can be tired, she can be fixed on conversation or she can be "in mood"! "
There are many worrying aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the underdowed female properties, the accusations on rape, when one goes to a step on Frigid (here: contradictory) Farrah, worrying one most.
On his website True Companion Roxxxy compared with a vibrator but for men.
"If women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men not have Roxxxy?" is said on the website.
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just a different sex toy.
Their emergence and its increasing refinement point to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a withdrawal from the ideal of equality of the sexes to a desire for sex with understatement as an optional addition.
Most men will, of course, not hold sex robots, and while the FRR notes their increasing popularity, they still remain provisionally on the edge of consumer culture.
But what goes through the peripheral zones can be very teaching in relation to the spirit of the time in which we live.
And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission to do so.
There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots show up in a time when the rights of women are threatened worldwide, where there is a President in the White House who has praised to have attacked women sexually.
The most dissuasive aspect of the television series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The report of the Magd ') is not the graphic images, the muddy bodies and the outcast eyes, but how realistic this vision works.
The Republic of Gilead is a jump, but at the moment this does not feel like a big jump.
The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (although with pornostar proportions).
Their builders want them to feel human, to imitate the movement of a real body.
But, when it comes to their "personalities," the robots are not real women.
You can't separate yourself from your companion or just leave.
They have no mediation or background history, nothing that suggests independence or anything that could interfere with the imagination of total subservience.
In other words, they are faithful slaves.
Or to express it in the 2017 speech: maid
Trump's big performance?
He makes Mitt Romney an integral part of a healthy human mind
It has become a bind wisdom of the Trump era that the political divisions that the US electorate has polarized have also split families in the Kleinformat.
Around Christmas and harvest feast, there were newspapers in the USA with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump's chosen relatives.
We're all supposed to make our filter bubbles crash.
Less noticed is the power of Trumps to bring together families.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-facing poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Republicans in our family, visited me in New York this week.
She reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican relatives that she had fought with for decades of politics, suddenly and very strange on the same side.
This is certainly a good thing about the dining table, but I find it in a further context that this also entails significant risks.
The left was strengthened by Trump, but the disappointing effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
When we talk about "normalisation" and Trump, we refer to the horrible possibility that one day his mattresses won't blow us off.
However, there is an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump Republicans of the right wing "normalize" which suddenly appear to be an integral part of sensuality compared to its standards.
Today, I find myself affected by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's unusual version of the madman - the dog on the car roof, who had 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax statement looked) - which both in fact occurred as a very mild crime compared to Trump.
If Trump leaves, the next candidate of the Republicans has to be mentally healthy only to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.
When my cousin was in town, we brought our children to the Carussell in Central Park, the largest of the Carussells of the New York Parking Division, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine.
The horses are huge, the fiber glass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are crawling and the animals are twisting to look full of fear over their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climbing music provides this in a strange way.
Disappoint so many clichés of a city: the views of high buildings are old, the Skylines are trusted to offer a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city is not responding to the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I'm still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage - the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a great circle in the north of London.
However, the Central Park Carousel is still a strange magic experience, since here two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women in the 40's can go on it and all have a great time.
If I could have evaluated the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but lucky no one asked for it.
On the other hand, this week I was forced to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before I could pass my credit card.
In the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to compare the evaluation with a 15% drinking money - this to buy something over the store.
This does not only slow down what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also exert pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no need is.
The poor woman at the store was apologizing while I had tired of giving her my credit card with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius with chest pain moved from prison to hospital
Pistorius left prison for a hospital visit for the second time.
Last year, he was brought to the hospital because of the treatment of cuttings on his wrist, according to which he suffered from the prison authorities after a case in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after an appeal by the prosecutors against a first death sentence.
He killed stone camp in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013 by shooting them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a night intruder hiding in the cabin.
The prosecutors have announced their intention to impose this time against the six-year imprisonment of Pistorius appeal of which they say it is too cautious.
The National Criminal Court said that it would object to the Supreme Court of South Africa and that the opposition could be heard this year.
Pistorius runs the risk that his punishment will be increased to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
When Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg
As the last of the Blumberger schools, the four-classers from feet and epfenhofen were released to the holidays and to the secondary schools.
Three of the dismissed students will go to high school in the future, four to the real school.
On Tuesday evening, head of school Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Biesental Burgerhaus in Epfenhofen.
The 29 students of the four classes, led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder, chose a young eagle who grew up in the chicken yard but then was released into freedom.
To this end, the modest char introduced a musical entitled "Der Adler im Hühnerhof."
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg, and let it go out of his chickens.
Instead of a chicken chicken, a little eagle came out.
But the hope of making a chicken out of him broke down; the eagle spread out his wings on a high mountain and disappeared.
After that, the three and four classes showed a chicken dance in Yvonne Frank's studies.
The chickens danced with the young hockles wearing cylinders to bet.
The eagle stands for integration, said school leader Angelika Sitte.
Although the young animal is different from the other young animals (chicks), it is one of them.
But he'll never be like a chicken.
His purpose is to be free.
She wanted every fourth-class classman to feel accepted in his new school.
The words of thanks were followed by colleagues, the former head of school, Michael Müller, who is always coming into teaching passports, and the parents' representatives.
The kitchen time is now over, explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher.
After two years of teaching, she would hate to dismiss her students, because it was a really great time.
Finally, she could have relied on the fourth classes.
All students made a song of summer time and holidays.
There was great joy among the children.
For the new school year, eight first-class students have already been registered.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal campings in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, quoted by television, announced.
On the morning of August 1, the police arrested a group of illegal tracking people in Sithonia, including the two Bulgarians.
They were released on the same day while an investigation is under way.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported bTV that the Bulgarians were released later.
The Greek authorities have strengthened control over free camping and impose substantial penalties on anyone found in a place not intended for this purpose.
The controls will continue throughout the season.
The ministry said the court can impose a fine.
Software update for diesel vehicles: What the people concerned need to know now
How exactly is the software update taking place?
Do diesel drivers have to participate in the action?
The most important questions and answers in the overview.
At the diesel summit BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of about 5.3 million cars.
They aim to improve the exhaust behaviour of Euro 5 cars and partly Euro 6 cars.
Euro 4 diesel or worse are excluded.
Anja Smetanin from the ACE Auto Club Europe gives estimates:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the negotiated software updates are voluntary.
"The mandatory updates previously only apply to vehicles that have foam software," says Anja Smetanin.
Their refurbishment has ordered the KBA.
How and when will customers be informed about updates?
Manufacturers have announced a rapid implementation in the coming months but have not yet mentioned a precise date.
Daimler has notified all interested parties.
If an inspection is due anyway, this is done within their framework.
How long should the refurbishment take?
"Hard to say," says Smetanin.
This depends on the commitment of the manufacturers and on the political pressure.
"Because we have seen that the car manufacturers do not voluntarily act on the issue of the environment so far."
How long will this update take?
The refurbishment itself could only take three to four hours in the workshop.
It could be more time-consuming to get an appointment.
What do drivers who don't drive a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW group do?
The ACE advises to wait.
It is likely that foreign producers would follow, so Smetanin.
Is there a threat to a massive fall in prices for Euro 4 cars?
The ACE fears that.
But just in the regions where driving bans are threatened.

LL Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first prize ceremony under President Trump promises to become political.
One of the winners doesn't want to come out of protest.
LL Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive one of the awards of the renowned Kennedy Center.
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday, this year also singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68) and choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and TV producer Norman Lear (95) are among the honors.
The awards will be handed over at the beginning of December.
Traditionally, US President Donald Trump will organise a reception and participate in the ceremony together with his wife Melania.
The award winner Lear announced with progressive TV series that he would not participate in the gala.
The New York Times said: "This presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even to withdraw the funds - and that is what is burdening me."
The 59-year-old Estefan stressed that she would use the conversation with Trump to clarify her view.
The Kennedy centre, named after the former president John F. Kennedy, is the largest cultural centre in the U.S. capital.
Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We make the city livelihood
Roland Wacker, the city builder of Haslach, will retire next year.
The office is already written out - suitable candidates are rare.
For 31 years, Wacker has been a city builder.
And the work still makes him great fun, as he gives in the press conversation.
He reports of varied but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor.
At the same time he wonders that no application has yet fulfilled the demand profile.
The city is looking for an architect or construction engineer as soon as possible.
Thus, taking into account the regular termination deadlines, there should be enough time to prepare.
Since Haslach operates as a lower building law authority for the administrative community, the applicant must present the corresponding accounts.
Because this function definitely wants to keep the city.
If they could no longer fill them in, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice.
But the proximity of the city and itself is important, says Wacker, who reports about a good operating climate as well as good mood between authority and citizens.
In more than 30 years in office, some important projects have gathered, looking back at the wackers with pride.
"We make the city a livelihood," he is confident about the building office and his employees.
But also in the future there are varied projects on the agenda: the redesign of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofenparkplatz has started.
The Kinzigbridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed, and the stadium renovation is still the subject.
Only the latter will make a book with about 1.5 million euros, "if we do it right," estimates Wacker.
"All in all, great tasks are waiting for my successor.
The work here is fun. "
There is great room for a city builder.
With Haslach's own farm and gardening, many things could be responded quite flexibly.
"You can move a lot," says Wacker, and the design of green facilities is often mentioned by citizens and visitors commendably.
Since the Old Town is under monument protection, it is important to "have an eye for what fits in" when new buildings are approved, the divorcing city builder emphasises.
Ohnehin has a high responsibility for the city builder.
He's a builder. "In the end, everything goes over my table."
With care and coordination he can count on long-standing employees: Markus Neumaier (building) has been there for ten years, Manfred Schöner (deep construction) has been there for 15 years.
Also that his successor remains long, Wacker wishes: "We are looking for someone who really wants to be identified and stayed with the place."
Because continuity is important not only for a good operating climate but also for the further design of the city.
Anyone who wants to inherit Roland Wacker should be able, according to information from the city of Haslach, to present a completed study as a diplomat engineer or Bachelor with specialised architecture and have good expertise in the fields of construction and planning law.
The City Building Office is responsible for the construction, construction planning, basic advertising, management of the urban properties, city farm and urban management, as well as the lower building law authority including monument protection.
Bicycle thrown on lines: south line locked
According to the police, the previously unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bicycle from the track transfer in the area of the Leobener Straße (B116) on the lines.
These were damaged so badly that the resulting freight train had to be stopped.
The investigators go from two male perpetrators and have been looking for them since night hours.
Close to the crime scene, witnesses had observed a rosé roller and a bicycle driver.
"This goes far beyond a runway line," said ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch to the APA.
The perpetrator or perpetrator would have put himself in great danger and would also endanger train traffic.
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant as well as the delay minutes and the costs of rail replacement traffic, there could also be penals of railway customers on the perpetrators.
Overall, the speaker said that a "significant" sum should be assumed.
The damage was recovered on Friday afternoon, and the train traffic on the south rail route could be carried out without disabilities.
There were barely ten passenger trains on Friday morning, two of which concerned distance traffic.
Goods trains did not fall out, but they were delayed.
According to the ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch, about 200 meters of overheads had to be exchanged.
Isolators and masts were also damaged.
Red meat, milk products and chocolate could help to alleviate IBD (inflammatory intestinal disease)
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and milk products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory intestinal diseases.
The unhealing condition, which affects around 1.3 million in the United States and 300,000 in the UK, causes gastric cramps and bleeds, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
While the subjects are usually advised to avoid meat and milk products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.
The senior researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells patrol in the intestine to ensure that harmful microbes hidden in food do not penetrate the body.
Cells capable of triggering inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation, it may result in inflammatory intestinal disease.
Experiments have shown that there is a type of tolerance of stimulating immune cells in mice carrying a particular bacterium in their intestines.
And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the proteins' building stones - to trigger the appearance of the cells.
Professor Colonna said, "We have made a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestine microbiom, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had of these immune cells. "
He proposed that the combination of L. reuteri and a more tolerant, less flammable diet should promote the same system in humans.
The post-doctorate Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan investigated a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same strain, but which was separately housed, did not have this.
She suspected that the difference had to do with the intestinal microbioms of mice - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The intestines of the mice were sequenced with DNA and six types of bacteria were found in the mice with the immune cells, but without them were missing in the mice.
Mice were raised in a sterile environment so they lacked a intestinal microbioma and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received L. reuteri and the immune cells.
To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, researchers L. reuteri grew in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - to inmature immune cells isolated by the mice.
The immune cells developed into the tolerance-enhancing cells.
When the active component was cleaned from the liquid, it was shown to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as indol 3 lactic acid.
If the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mouse feed, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but if the tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerance-enhancing cells as mice, and that most of us L. reuteri protect in our gastrointestinal tracts.
It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but deficiencies in genes related to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory intestinal disease.
She said, "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine.
Potentially high tryptophan levels in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population. "
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has committed to a "genius" with Nemanja Matic
Manchester United has signed a "genius" with Nemanja Matic, Jose Mourinho believes, after the middle field player had his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
The 40 million pounds of Chelsea's signature began with a 2: 1 win in Dublin, the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup starts against Real Madrid on Tuesday, and impressed in the holder role when people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marched for popular marches.
However, Matic had been excluded from the Blues preparatory Asian tour and only got 45 minutes of what Mourinho admitted he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," said Mourinho.
"We will help him be ready sooner than later."
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started in the Aviva stadium when Mourinho formed his start-XI for the beginning of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three more new commitments, but he insisted that the club had already done a "fantastic work" to fulfil three of its four priority new commitments.
"To get three out of four, I thank the club for that," he added.
"I'll be happier if they get four out of four for me, but they've made a lot of effort."
Boeing "malt" Dreamliner in the sky
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner in the sky.
The pilots flew away from Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington, but the drawing started in Marquette in the U.S. state of Michigan and moved in the form of a Dreamliner over the United States, which is several thousand kilometres.
The action lasted 18 hours and one minute.
On the radar screens the shape of a Dreamliner was to be.
This whole thing was a durable test for new engines.
Boeing had made such advertisements before.
Thus the number "787" and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky.
New defeat for Martin Schulz - Hannover, we have a problem
As the wind turns: When Sigmar Gabriel was still SPD chief, socialDemocratic Prime Minister always looked before elections with some concern to Berlin.
Just no fire from the party centre, just no counterwind from the covenant - so was the most important wish of the electoral fighters.
Since Martin Schulz was the leader of the party, this has changed fundamentally.
Since then, the staff from the Willy Brandt House have seen the events in the SPD-controlled country capital cities with growing disappointment.
What Schulz received from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in the approach with the opposite wind.
They were deep beats.
One at a time.
After the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the Federal CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of SPD and Green.
"This shows again: Red-Green can simply not rule reliably," said CDU Secretary-General Peter Tauber to the German editorial network (RND).
The surprising outbreak of a Green MEP has led the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to a serious crisis.
Five months before the Landtag election, his red-green coalition thus lost her one-vote majority to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
The Green Federal Managing Director Michael Kellner has asked every second to return his mandate to the seconded Dutch Greens member.
The transfer to the CDU means a clear falsification of the electoral will.
Each second must return its mandate immediately, "said the Federal Managing Director and Electoral Camp Manager of the Greens to the German editorial network (RND).
"All this must not be true," says a SPD electoral fighter, when the new Hiobs message reaches the party center on Friday morning.
Stephan Weil, SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, stands there after the crossing of the Green Members Every Second to the CDU without its own government majority.
It is the provisional peak of a whole series of major and small crises in SPD federations.
And no one knows what's next.
The Misere began with the unexpected significant defeat at the Saarland election in March.
A blue eye, that's all, the comrades calmed down that time.
After the Landtag elections in Schleswig-Holstein and Nordrhein-Westfalen, everything will be different.
It was then - and it became much worse.
The defeat in Kiel led the SPD to dive, the Düsseldorf-Pleite killed the party smoothly.
The comrades slowly recovered in the weeks afterwards.
Then, when they had just created new courage, the G-20 summit of Hamburg came.
And with him came the next defeat.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD leader, lost his Nimbus that weekend because he sat in the Elbphilharmony while his city burned.
And because in crisis communication after that, he did pretty much everything wrong that can be done wrong.
Since then, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.
So now Stephan Weil too.
Because of the VW-exhaust affair and its role in the Supervisory Board, the Dutch Prime Minister has long been in criticism.
Bad surveys were added.
Nevertheless, or perhaps just because of that, because in the past few weeks, it has been more and more attempted to put accent into the covenant.
The aim of the former mayor of Hannover to strengthen his power in Berlin was not to hide comrades around Martin Schulz.
They made him grant because they promised to stabilize the party.
Now the exact opposite could occur.
It is because the Dutch Greens are not guilty of the interparty interference.
And Schulz doesn't.
Sometimes the comrades are trying to keep their own rows closed.
Their wrath is directed at the Greens, and here, in particular, to the descendant parliamentarian Second.
"It is intolerable and damaging to democracy, as Mrs Twesten puts her own career interests on the interests of all others," says Matthias Miersch, head of the party ink in the SPD Bundestag group, the German editorial network (RND).
Mrs Twesten has not been elected to Parliament because of her person as a direct candidate, but through the country list of the Dutch Greens, according to the Dutch Member.
The logical consequence would be that she returned her mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, Head of the SPD Bundestag Group, complains of a "undemocratic maneuver."
"The electoral will four years ago was clear: People made Stephan Because Prime Minister," says Oppermann, who leads the Dutch SPD as top candidate to the Bundestag election, the RND.
"Now the personal career reminder of a future CDU member distorts the election result," Oppermann continued.
He called for the background to be clarified.
I want to know whether there has been more or there have been further commitments by the CDU Niedersachsen.
Promotion funds for locals III
Anyone who wants to clean up his house in the years can soon get support from the country.
On Wednesday, Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG city development informed in Empfingen.
At the beginning of the information event Schindler once again gave a look back on what has happened so far.
Since 1991 there have been rehabilitation areas in Empfingen.
At that time, in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004, the Land Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount.
In the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016, the grant was still 60 per cent.
For Schindler, the previous remedies are a "success project" - it is important to promote internal development and not only to explore new construction areas.
On April 4, Karlsruhe was informed by the Regierungspräsidium that there will be a rehabilitation area III.
The amount of funding is €833 333, of which €500 000 would be from the country, the rest from the municipality Empfingen.
How is a rehabilitation area now created?
You will continue to investigate where the "really old" houses are.
However, it also plays a role whether there is any interest in rehabilitation in the planned area.
If necessary, the territorial boundaries could also be shifted again.
The STEG represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday night.
Keller presented the content of the federal country programme "Social City," in which the remedies would then be carried out.
The core of the programme is the revitalisation of urban areas, the improvement of living and working conditions and the maintenance and development of infrastructure.
The measures would be carried out objectively, i.e. per property.
The rehabilitation area would then be established as a statute.
Since 1 January 2017, the period for the granting of the aid shall continue to expire until 30 April 2026.
However, until September this year, the inventory would only be carried out once in which the participants in the rehabilitation area would receive a questionnaire to fill out.
In November or December, the decision will be taken as far as possible so that the remedies can be started next year.
Pietzschmann then stated that each municipality had to carry out the abovementioned preliminary investigations.
It is about assessing the urban defects and deciding when to restore them and to what extent.
A restoration note will then also be entered in the basic book for the respective property.
Pietzschmann himself will come to Reception again and take a picture of the situation, she promised.
Gotzel emphasised that a key success factor for the project was the participation of stakeholders.
That is why there will be questionnaires that will be sent postally to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be completed by the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the "building and land arc," which concerns, among other things, the construction condition and the rehabilitation intentions.
The grey questionnaire, the "household and housing book," provides information on the size, distribution and residents of a residential area.
The blue "operating sheet" shall be completed only if business rooms are operated in the building.
However, Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding.
In addition, new construction measures are not eligible.
Schindler also stressed that the distribution of the funds would work according to the "Winddog Principle" - who comes first, must first.
No funding could be reserved for later.
At the end of the project, photos of the "Ortskern II" were shown to make the attendants a "tasty" restoration.
British inventor sets himself a microchip to come with a hand movement in house and car
A British inventor is the first in the country that is equipped with a microchip so that he can open his door, enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the tiny chip between thumb and drawing finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology by his company BioTeq.
He joined Dr. Geoff Watson, an advisory anaesthesist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards.
The technology is similar to a cat and dog implanted microchip and only takes 30 seconds.
The company of Mr. Northam also wants to change the castles to houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip, all for an additional charge of £300 per slot.
The married father of one has now installed both at home and at his BMW Z4 technology that begins when his hand is on the wheel.
The advertising costs of the White House cost the taxpayer thousands
The White House's decision to fly a marine helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlights American production last month costs taxpayers, according to the military's data, which were left to the TIME magazine, up to 24,000 US dollars.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the heart of the event on July 17 in the White House with American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and executive officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states.
The helicopter made in Connecticut was issued next to a boat from Maine, a fireworks from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi.
The military office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO, almost 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event of his superior, the deputy marine commander for aviation.
The message showed that the helicopter arrived at the South Lawn on July 17 at 7 a.m. for the event at 3 p.m. and stayed until the lawn was cleaned between 6: 00 and 9: 00 p.m. this evening.
The note adds that, if the departure from the White House should be delayed, a second team would be required for the return flight due to the limitation of service hours.
The original flight crew was located at the helicopter during the event, while the unit's security staff remained on the ground during the time with the plane.
It was not clear from the records provided for the TIME that a second flight crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
Data sets indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could violate the determination.
"A question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case," the commander wrote.
"Sounds like you're locked," the deputy commander replied.
The event "Made in America" was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But official events also have political superiors.
At the event, the President launched the reform of the health reform under way in the Senate and promoted efforts to reduce government legislation.
The use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are obliged to use them for the journey.
But asking for their use only for a photo surgery is unusual.
Trump conducted an investigation in February when the presidential plane performed taxi services against the background of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is full of reports complaining about the use of the presidential aircraft by his predecessor.
"The White House is enthusiastic about the show" Made In America "- the products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials," said the Deputy Press Secretary of the White House, Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews often carry out training flights around Washington and South Lawn in order to cancel the US President in the White House with precise centimeters.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 carried out 58 exercise landings in the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" event counted on the training needs of the flight crew for the month, said an official.
Helicopter units also flew 11 hours that day for "non-presidential support missions."
The White House said that taxpayers took the burden for none of the other invoices presented at the event.
A spokesman from Sikorsky said that the company had not been involved in exhibiting the helicopter at the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not keep budget records for presidential flights and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
However, according to Hourly Taxes of the US Ministry of Defence for the financial year 2017, the DoD refund rate for the VH-3D is USD 24.380 per flight hour.
Records of the unit record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below this rate.
"Determining the costs of taxpayers on the basis of the estimates for the refund rates is highly misleading," said Walters.
"These estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds."
According to a 2015 RAND study, the refund rates for DoD do not include personnel costs but take into account fuel, maintenance and contract closure costs.
At this time, the former press spokesman of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to present things that are made in America this week," said Spicer.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not even thousands of people, are dependent on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we're all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked for.
It is, of course, appropriate to highlight this. "
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter when he entered his tour over the South Lawn for the event, but he sat in the driver's seat of a fire rautos.
In the White House Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of company products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the President said, "I have three of them."
TC BW Neuss before difficult task
Suchsdorfer SV will join the Second Tennis-Bundesliga at the table finish.
The TC Blue-Weiss Neuss will arrive tomorrow at 11: 00 in Kiel at the table trip Suchsdorfer SV.
Despite five parties, the top rider of the Second Tennis League has been given the sense of reality.
In any case, Chief Marius Zay has respect for the opponent.
"This is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation.
Just on the back positions I find the team very good. "
For class and stability at the Suchsdorfer SV mainly provides imports from the high north.
"Their Danes and Finns can even refer to operations in the Davis Cup.
And they are also strong in double, "says Zay overlooking Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus (all Denmark).
"It's gonna be hard for us as always.
You need a good portion of luck too. "
The Neusser team for the trip to the high north is practical.
His debut for blue-white could give Maxime Janvier.
If the French who is still active at the Challenger tournament in the Italian Biella does not make it to the Bundesliga Party, the Zdenek Kolar (Czech Republic) who plays at the tournament in the Czech Liberec will be the first to play this season.
The Chilene Hans Podlipnik-Castillo, previously undefeated, was in the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel with the White Russians Andrei Vasilevski yesterday.
He should be there in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both the Netherlands) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina.
After his two victories last Sunday against the club at the Alster, Máté Valkusz could also return to the team.
If it is not enough for the 18-year-old Hungary, who was still the number one of the Juniors world rankings in January 2016, someone from the train staff around Marius Zay fills the cader.
How America can harm the OMV
Donald Trump really didn't seem happy when he signed his signature on Wednesday night under the law to tighten sanctions against Russia.
"In his desire to adopt the law," the Congress packaged some "unconstitutional rules," he puked.
Moscow's response was as sharp as expected, and even Brussels was ashamed of the US offense.
After all, the draft provides for the punishment of European companies that help the Russians build gas pipelines into the EU.
As a result, investors of the local OMV have been concerned since then, which co-finance the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea line Nord Stream 2 together with other European companies.
The threat scene is huge.
However, it was too early for an assessment of the consequences, according to the official statement of the oil group.
In fact, Donald Trump himself would have to revive the sanctions by means of Executive Order.
Twelve weapons are his choice.
"The press" has looked at which group could defend and which could really hurt him.
Narco's Staffel 3 Trailer: Without Pablo Escobar the Cali Cartel will be placed at the centre of Netflix heat series

Role backwards: The city stops 46 kitchenettes
The city organizes the Kita lunch again.
With strong contacts for the children and an assignment to the team.
The clock will be turned back in the city's kindergarten.
On 1 September, the city of Krefeld takes over food provision in the city's childhood facilities (Kitas) again in self-government.
For Sonja Pommeranz, Deputy Head of the Youth Assistance Department, this is a good news: "We are all very pleased."
Cooked is still out of the house: a caterer takes over this task and delivers fresh cooked cooled.
The city operates 46 children's day places in the Krefelder area, in 44 children get a warm meal at noon.
During the last Kitayear, 2800 children were sitting on the tables, and the need is growing steadily.
"Meanwhile, not only children who are cared for 45 hours per week eat in the Kita for lunch," explains Pommeranz.
"The offer is also valid in 35-hour care if children stay until 2: 00."
46 Part-time workers have a kitchen service from 1 September: they warm up the food delivered, supplement them with salad, raw food and fruit, portion the meal individually, spend the food, clean up, rinse and clean the kitchen.
"The employees are firmly assigned to a kita," says Pommeranz.
The size - there are two groups as well as seven groups - decides on the volume of hours.
"The kitchen helpers are now firmly part of the Kita team," says Pommeranz satisfied.
"So they are much more involved and it is easier to implement educational concepts for the Kitalleitung."
It is also about healthy nutrition and cooking lessons.
"The children should help prepare the food."
The direct connection of the cuisine to the team would be useful.
Also for the children.
"They have a known power in the kita, a person who is familiar with them, and not constantly changing people."
This continuity is important for children.
The purification of the Kita spaces - so far also the task of the cuisine forces - will be carried out by special cleaning staff in the future.
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has, in addition to improving the quality of the kitchen performance, the charm which it has shown itself to be the most economical of the city in the cost comparison between the government of its own and the supply of foreign products, is said by the Press Office.
And that, although 46 part-time forces are being re-recruited.
"But these hours do not fall so much in weight for about 750 people in education," says Sonja Pommeranz.
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women, says the UN
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, Head of Mission of the United Nations, said that hundreds of women will be candidates for the Council elections in the provinces. Three women are candidates for the role of Vice President and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overestimated," he said on Wednesday in a statement.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate fully and are involved in all parts of the electoral process.
Afghan elections for the Provincial Council and the Presidential elections will take place on 5 April.
The Taliban have published threats to a election process that coincides with the transition from international action to an advisory role.
This year, for the first time, the elections will give the power peacefully from a democratically elected government to the next.
Haysom said that a strong role for women will strengthen the democratic success of Afghanistan.
The Afghan independent electoral commission reports that 1.2 million women are registered by a total of 3.6 million voters.

Men try to rob 13-year-old girl
Two young men aged 19 and 23 should have tried to rob a 13-year-old girl on Thursday.
According to the police, the men spoke to the 13-year-olds who stayed with friends on Kolpingstraße at 2: 55 p.m.
The 13-year-old refused the request, and went on with their friends.
After that, one of the perpetrators tried to grab the girl's cell phone and necklace, which was misled.
Without a bust, the duo escaped.
The two young men could later be arrested by the police.
The investigation is under way.
GMB concern about investments in the McVitie factory in Glasgow
A trade union would like to verify the long-term commitment to production in its factory in Glasgow with managers of the biskuit manufacturer McVitie.
GMB Scotland said that the company had defeated about the future of investments at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 employees work in the workshop, which together with other products produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea Cookies.
McVitie's owner Pladis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years.
He added that employees and trade union representatives would "learn first" if their activities would change.
In a letter to the company's branch leader, GMB requested Scotland McVitie's to "express concerns that the financing for the modernisation of production lines will not be promoted."
GMB Senior Organizer Drew Duffy said: "The fact that we cannot gain clarity from the General Site Manager on the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross concerns our members deeply.
Generations of families have worked here and workers are concentrating heavily on the local community and the large area of Glasgow, an important pillar of decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage.
Therefore, in the perspective of jobs, wages and prosperity, and in the context of the Brexit, rising living costs and chronic decline in production, the eastern end of Glasgow urgently requires a flourishing production performance at McVitie. "
A spokesperson from Pladis said: "Tollcross's branch leader received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday, and the company will respond directly to it because we appreciate the continuous commitment of employees and trade union representatives.
We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross two months ago, where some questions were discussed openly.
We discussed with the employees that, like all companies operating in a highly competitive and unsafe economic climate, we constantly review our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive.
She added: "In recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our tollcross site, especially in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognise the heritage of Tollcross as a production site. Should our operations change at the site, the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to learn this. "
Did the PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar three years ago?
The side of La Liga may regret her interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not leave behind in her persecution of Neymar after she made an offer of £189 million to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago before the world record robbery?
The sensational approach has heated the transfer window in summer, because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record more than twice the previous brand, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United for 89 million pounds last season.
After the end, Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the most paid professional athlete in the world. PSG offers wages of more than GBP 500,000 per week.
Barcelona is angry about the way Neymar has forced his way out, although a source near the Catalan board insists that the club has always done its best to take care of him since he arrived from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned three years ago by the PSG President about this view?
When Manchester City announced interest in the signing of Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strong warning for every club who wanted to sign one of the best players of PSG.
"I am not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will stand in opposition to them, we will contact their players," said Al-Khelaifi.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to let one of our players sign with them, this will have consequences. "
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line, with the Spanish association expressing interest in the PSG middle field player Marco Verratti at the beginning of this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their prizes for Neymar.
Roller thrown and damaged
In the night from Friday to Saturday, an unknown perpetrator deliberately thrown a roller in the Royal Field Street before the estate number 30 and thus caused material damage of over 200 euros to the clothing of the vehicle.
Police Schramberg, phone 07422 / 27 01-0, asks for clues.
For an accident on the B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese, the police are looking for witnesses.
Because a car came up with him on his track, the driver of a VW Touran had to escape and touched the board.
On Thursday evening, the 34-year-old Rehburg-Loccum with his VW was on the way to Leese at 7.55 p.m. on the B 215 from Stolzenau.
In the area of the surrounding area of Stolzenau he met a car on his track, so he had to move to the right.
The tour driver touched the board.
There was damage to the car.
The driver of the upcoming car, a Mercedes Benz, had overtaken a truck and continued his drive without taking care of the traffic accident.
According to the accident injured, it can be good that the Mercedes driver had not noticed the accident at all.
The police now ask witnesses of the incident as well as the driver of the polluter payer vehicle to contact the Commissioner in Stolzenau under tel. 05761 / 92060.
Interview: "Domspatzen Report Relieves Pope-Brother Georg Ratzinger"
The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the abuse cases relieves Pope-Brother Georg Ratzinger.
That's what author and historian Michael Hesemann means.
The final report on the misuse scandal of the Regensburger Domspatzen continues to provide discussion.
Christian Weisnder, spokesman of the Reformation Movement "We are Church," explained after publication to the German Press Agency, he expects an apology from the former Regensburger Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emeritified Pope Benedikt XVI.
It would serve the Catholic Church's reputation very much if Muller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret for their own abandonment or their then false appreciation of the operations.
On the other hand, the Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano" criticized that the report on violence in the domestices was measured with "two dimensions."
With regard to the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubts that it is "shameful and shameful actions" that should be punished and prevented in the future; but it is noticeable that the "degree of medial manipulation," according to the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian bioethics committee.
"The habit of calling the Catholic Church a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to think that it is normal," Scaraffia writes.
Prince Gloria von Thurn and Taxis also said in an interview with the Bayerische Rundfunk: "You like to go to the church and this is a found food."
In addition, she pointed out that in her youth "beats had been a very normal educational means" to get ready with freaky children as I was one. "
They found it unfair to apply today's standards to previous decades, because the world has changed.
In connection with the reports on the abuse cases, Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.
The author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote with Ratzinger the memorial band "My brother the Pope" (translated into 12 languages), is quite wrong.
"I have to protect Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report.
What exactly does it say in the 440-page report presented by Advocate Ulrich Weber, the Bistum of Regensburg with the information?
A total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s "with high plausibility" victims of assault, 67 Domspatts.
In the final report, Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994, says: "In summary, Domkapellmeister R. has in many cases applied forms of physical and mental violence.
In particular, with high emotionality, the punishment for the students could also be more severe.
Nevertheless, unlike many other accused, many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases despite violence, even combine positive memories with him. "
In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger is in his opinion unloaded.
Mr Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "incidents of violent exercise to the guardians of the Regensburger Domspatzen" gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.
On the one hand, many students highlight his "humanity."
On the other hand, he also appears as a cholerist and perfectionist, who became handful of the more frequent when a domestical plot did not bring any top performance.
How do you value this final report as his biograph?
Michael Hesemann: If you make the effort and read the 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is in it at all.
He is devoted to eight pages, and he is clearly released from any suspicion of meditation or sympathy in the horrible cases of sexual abuse.
The violence at the preschool also occurred outside its sphere of action.
It can be accused of having learned too late or of not taking the first suggestions seriously enough.
The court school he worked on was felt by virtue of all respondents as "salvation," "heaven," and "better world" - so literally.
Thus, the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger also exhibits a very excellent testimony, describes him as "warm-hearted," "popular," "sincere," "competent," and "understandable," as a very good teacher who regularly cared for the boys with cakes, biscuits and bonbons and "always was relieved of grapes by children."
Only a minority complains about its perfectionism and its high emotionality, which even once led to rage outbreaks.
That he did not only bust with chairs and threw the key bond on the ground, but also distributed ear figs and pulled too bad boys on the hair or ears, he himself admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it.
In order to save his honor, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the time in question, the 1960s and the 1970s, among parents and teachers.
Do you know any such breeding methods?
Of course, I think each of us who was born before 1968.
I also experienced this in a secular school, a state gymnasium.
Compared to what is actually the subject of this report, namely the horrible sexual abuse and the acts of violence at pre-school, these are certainly bagatelles.
It is a question whether it has to do with his acquaintance and his role as brother of Benedict XVI. that many media have just crashed on him.
Many who have never understood the Bavarian Pope are still eager to do so.
But the truth is, the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!
In the media, much has been reported on the issue of abuse in the Regensburger Domspatzen in connection with the report.
Will Georg Ratzinger in the final report also be charged with any interference or codecision with regard to sexual abuse?
Michael Hesemann: Clearly no.
None of the 67 victims of sexual assault claim to have entrusted themselves to the Domkapellmeister.
Not even the parents were inaugurated.
"I never trusted to talk to my father or my mother about it," one of the people concerned said to the others, "I was very embarrassed."
The real problem with the discovery of sexual abuse was and is that most victims are silent from shame.
If they did not even entrust parents and sisters, then certainly not a choir leader who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators in some way in the profession.
How do the Domspatzen students evaluate Ratzinger's role in terms of abuse cases?
Michael Hesemann: A student questioned said it like this: "With regard to sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) would have had timely insights and could have stopped the perpetrator.
I think it is... also really absurd to assume that, apart from him, bubs have been more intrusive or clear or even more open than their parents, internals, trusts, etc.
That you talk to him about sex... unthinkable. "
Thus, the report comes to the very clear result: "The fact that pupils concerned themselves in advance and / or their environment could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation."
So, as far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is free to speak of any knowledge.
He cannot be accused of not preventing him or bringing him to the press either.
There is therefore no reason to link his good name with these disgusting crimes, as unfortunately happened in some cases.
In the media, much of "violence" was read at the Regensburger Domspatzen.
The previous Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused of looking away in the report.
Does he have to live with this accusation?
Michael Hesemann: This is the big problem that in reporting everything was mixed and mixed into a giant melange of sexual abuse and violence sessions and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.
But that is, in turn, an abuse of the report.
There is a clear separation: between the pre-school and the gymnasium of the domspats, between sexual abuse and violence and, let us say, other accusations.
In addition, the report deals with incidents from the time since 1945, including from four decades, where Georg Ratzinger was not the choreographer of the domspats.
The whole horrible battle pedagogy, the cases in which boys of sadistic teachers were intimidated and maltrained and suffered horribly from them, all occurred on the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where truly scandalous conditions must have prevailed.
But they had nothing to do with Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, because he only got the boys to face when they were already at the Domspatzgymnasium.
On this, as most witnesses emphasise, was the subject of "pre-school" tabu.
One was just happy to have escaped her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradise" states.
What was different at the Domspatzgymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: There was discipline, but no sadistic violence.
And this applies to Georg Ratzinger, where the report concludes that "many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases despite violence, even combine positive memories with him."
That's the only way to keep the accusation of looking away.
In spite of all efforts, however, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported about the conditions at pre-school.
The first time 1970 / 71, when he began to establish himself and from the events at a school where he was not working and responsible, (if the witness) did not want to hear anything, and then only again around 1993.
Georg Ratzinger consistently closed his ears from the conditions?
Michael Hesemann: No, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzgymnasium, which the report even reproduces.
In this he points out to them that "the first school continues to practise the fight penalty."
In view of the risk of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervention.
This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, when fighting penalties were already forbidden in Bavaria.
Before that, they occurred in a legal grey zone, as each one of us may remember.
It was also difficult for him to estimate where the affected might have been exaggerated or dramatized and where the permissible limit had really been exceeded.
But you can't say he always looked away.
That's just not true.
Only in 1980 was the fight against schools officially abolished in Bavaria.
Prince Gloria von Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards to that time.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We historians are talking about the "trap of anachronism," that is, the danger of assessing the past according to today's moral standards.
That's where the prince is right.
But, of course, this does not apply to sexual abuse, which was horrible at all times and not to what was criticized in the preschool of oppression and violence against innocent children's souls, which goes far beyond what was used at that time.
This is all awful and I'm glad it's finally being worked out.
But at the same time, I have to protect Georg Ratzinger, because all that had nothing to do with him.
Its means of discipline and punishment, i.e. to draw ear figs and hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.
When physical punishment was then forbidden, he was also strictly adhered to it.
What picture of his Regensburger time has Georg Ratzinger given in the conversations with you for the book "My brother of the Pope"?
Did the issue of the fight penalty also come to the attention?
Michael Hesemann: Well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, that is, Pope Benedict XVI., tells from his perspective, then the domestices played only a side role.
Nevertheless, I do not conceal that he had a strict regiment there.
But this must also be said: without this perfectionism, without demanding unconditional discipline, it would have been hardly possible for him to form an institution of world trang from the rather national Regensburger domestications, true European cultural ambassadors and its musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With cookies and bonbons alone, you don't make a big singer from disgusting boys and stand before every success in any field, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.
What kind of person did you experience Georg Ratzinger talking about her book?
Michael Hesemann: Through the work on the book and beyond, I really met Georg Ratzinger very well and repeatedly experienced as a wonderful, humorous, basic, deeply believing and heartworthy people, of whom one cannot imagine that he could do anything to hurt even a fly.
I regularly get to know how many former posters today, 23 years after his emerition, keep regular contact with him, visit him, read him - he's almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family.
Those who have not forgiven him so far that he once was strict to them are clearly in the minority.
Most of the domes are grateful to him today for enriching their lives and bringing them closer to the world of music.
And that he was always a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, certainly that may be - but also a loving respectful person to whom they are still looking up to today and which they are just to worship.
And please, once again quite clearly: all that he is accused of are educational methods that were on the agenda at that time.
We can be glad that we have overcome this time long ago.
But it is highly unfair to make a man, only because he is prominent and has a more prominent brother to make a medial sin buck.
There is the evil intention behind it only too obvious.
Because the report that has just been published is unleashing it.
Now the decency would aspire to abandon a 93-year-old man who has acquired great merit and without anyone outside of Bavaria and perhaps still Germany, no one would finally know the Regensburger domspats.
