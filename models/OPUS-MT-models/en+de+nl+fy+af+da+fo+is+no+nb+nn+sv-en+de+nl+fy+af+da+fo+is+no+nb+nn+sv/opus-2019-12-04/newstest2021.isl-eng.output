Run to the world
The market tour looks Like You Need Iceland seems to have gone well off and screaming and shouting out into nature have gone to people white and spread around the world.
"You have the checkout, I need Iceland," says some woman out in the big world in attentions to the announcement from the Marketing Authorisation Looking Like You Need Iceland at YouTube.
Another good-bye shall be in the heart of Iceland for all eternal life, and a young woman shall say that the first thing to the end of Iceland shall come to be her servant there.
To all sorts of misfortune, she is indeed in the United States, and therefore presumes to wait for a month.
One more observer asks whether the way to Israel is allowed, for no one is the plane.
The story doesn't follow if he comes from another time.
Egill Thórðarson in Peel, which has been made together with M & C Saatchi, says that visitors have been further hoped.
"I came to many Inspired By Iceland armies that have gone very well but this new armies are already going to hit.
On the basis of this, it is about creating a PR value, it is getting an erlent multimedia to replenish the army, and it has gone incredibly well.
At a reasonable amount of time, we have been converted into about seven hundred counties around the whole of the world that will reach a wealth of two million people.
The value of their surroundings is estimated at 1.8 billion kroner.
It's not amusing. "
The main market is the United States, and the army has gone very well, even though the Americans are not on their way to the country in the near future.
In the story of Egils, the marketplace such as Denmark, the United Kingdom and Germany has also taken good care, as Russia, which has come to a great surprise.
Then there have been reactions from other areas, such as India, which were not specifically set up.
"These notices have gone far but we have turned to," says Egill but that over four million people may have looked at the subject on YouTube.
"We could not have wished after a better start."
The pictures here at the opening took Arni Sæberg, the photographer of the morning newspaper, taking the "Let It Out" magazine in the middle of the last month.
The towels went forth wide and wide, as in the schools of Reykjavík, in Reynisfjöra, in the forest foss, in the sun's corner, and in the hall of the midst of the midst.
The champions were Samúel Bjarki Péturson and Gunnar Páll Olafsson in Scotland's production, and the counselor of the Ottoman son of God.
In the portions of the notes were the Icelandic Anna Jia and Murphy Cardenas, which are from Kuba and Hungary.
Twenty Islanders came to make the announcements, but at the same time as the recordings went to the south of the country, another group in the West and the West.
The story of Egils is "Let It Out" only the first member of the Looks Like You Need Iceland World but the goal is to join the Winter Army in co-operation with M & C Saatchi.
"This is only the first phase of this work for the Icelandic Foundation," says Egill and adds that the co-operation with M & C Saatchi has done quite well.
"It's great working with them.
In such tasks, much of the work has to be done with the knowledge of the people we are talking about. "

Blood of the Peacekeeping - Terrible voices of the Gleestern
This lesson has reached the Internet to curse rest over the site of the Happy Birthday, but the actress Naya Rivera drowned in California in the days and became there with three of the main players to make life go far ahead of age.
The activities of the glacier (e. g. Glee) are a friendly part of the song, dance and joy.
The numbers of young people in human school, their loved ones and their destiny.
It was not always taken out with the seal to be in the glacier but through the song and dance the people seemed to be able to overcome any of the circumstances that emerged in their lives.
But outside the scene many people have been riding over the actors and the staff, so very much that lessons have awakened that the curse of the rests on the sections.
Naya Marie Rivera went with a portion of Santana Lopez in the divisions, a clerk who didn't call all his grandmother.
After the cathedral had run its lawn Rivera went to own Ryan Dorsey's play and had his first and only child, Josey.
In 2017, Rivera was arrested for homicide against his husband and left them in the jail.
Although Dorsey refused to submit a plea and was the private secretary's case dropped down.
On July 8th, last time, it was reported that Riveru was missing after her four-year-old son was found alone on the boat on Lake Piru in California.
The boy was found asleep in the rescue vest on board the boat and he could tell the police authorities that he and his mother would have injected himself to the sink and then Rivera would have brought him back up to the boat but never left himself there.
Started looking for Rivera.
The day after the search began, the police officer found out in the area from the point of view that we had gone from Rivera's drowning.
Five days later, Rivera was found and was officially excreted.
It is said that she has been in a lot of power in the water and its new last power to save the sun.
The cause of death was filed by the drowning of accidents.
Cory Allan Michael Monteith went with the role of Finn Hudson in the sections of the American Football Officer with the angels that played a key role in moving the "Happy Birthday" to the road and respect.
But without the perks, Moneith flushed with the personal devils.
From the age of 13, he had flashed with fools and tried hard to get away from her.
In 2013, his co-workers were found in the sections enough, grabbed in and watched him search for help.
Moneith went to treatment and seemed to look to be better.
Only two months after he started the treatment, Moneith was found in the hotel room after having fun with friends.
Banamein has been attempted to mix the flavourings with alcohol.
It was not said that there would be any willingness to discuss it.
Moneith had gone into treatment and his tolerance for vials had reduced so much that the dose he had previously tolerated was proven to be fatal.
He was only 31 when he died.
His spirit was heavy on his associates, but his opponent, Lea Michele, was decided to continue his work, and to sanctify them with the remembrance of Moneith, and of his person Finnish.
Mark Wayne Salling left with the role of Noah "Puck" Puckerman in the sections, Puck was an American footballer, like Finn, and had little respect for his agreements in the Gleðisheim, or all that he had changed the core to acknowledge that he enjoyed singing and dancing.
Two years ago, Salling was arrested in his home in Los Angeles, suspected of child protection.
At his house, he found a giant amount of childhood cloth and the matter was promptly asked out openly.
It was said that Salling was done.
He was accused and accused of his breach.
He had over his head four to seven years in prison, even as he came to have to be on the file of sexual fractures and seek treatment for child care.
Before the judge had determined the riot, Salling was found, which was then free from security, left his house near.
The cause of death was self-destructive.
It wasn't just the players who fell from a long time ago.
Jim Fuller was the assistant director.
He was soon asleep in 2013, only 41 years old.
We also worked with a woman named Nancy Motes.
She was the younger sister of Juliu Roberts, and she didn't carry her sister's favourite story, but she was accusing Roberts of great control and disrespectful appearance.
Motes took his life in 2014, but she slipped into severe depression.
She left a letter to her fiancée, where she killed her mother and sister among others.
"My mother and my sister, my sister, have nothing after me except the reminder that it was the ones who caused my worst depression."
Lea Michel was the star.
It has recently been decided to engage its partners on a single basis and on a postal basis, and to have a standard star.
Jesse Luken went on to play a part in the activities of 2012.
He was arrested and prosecuted for a racing car in 2019, which had a lot of gossip.
The actress Heather Morris had a big part in his work.
It was the year 2010 that unpronounced telephones came into their necklaces and appeared on the Internet.
The players Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner played both in the events and had a relationship of love outside them.
Benoist later told me that Jenner bit her in the connection.
It can put flowers on almost everything
It increases the evolving children when they get to play out in the garden with the parents to grow flowers and watch them grow and dope.
It is also endlessly possible to do with the flowers as the Swedish photographer Anna Kubel aspires.
Just having a moment with the kids in the garden is something that's never forgotten.
They will be reminded of the flowers, of the wicked, and, of course, of the precious time they were given with their parents.
Buying a boat after the 10th Event
"I don't think we are many seamen who work in the school of the country," says Axel the son of God, who is hosting the sea in the summer, but takes psychology with the school of Israel over the winter period. "
Beach sports are very pleasant summer work when you're close.
If good fishing is possible to have good tags and I feel great to be able to let go of it.
And the teeth are good for me in the winter, saith Axel the son of God, the son of God, 25 years of psychology, which is at the time of the sea in the summer, as is the end of some.
Axel was the youngest to turn on the Talk Party when the journalist spoke of him late in the evening at the beginning of the week. "
"The knowledge that I was in the early days, I took command of boats that are under 12 meters long and I bought my boat the summer after I finished the basic school.
I've been visiting my boat some times since.
I bought the boat by my knowledge, the man of the son of John, and made the boat name of his name.
Hartmann was grown up when I bought the boat and ceased to be at sea and he was very sweet when he saw that the boat had his name.
Hartmann died a few years after I took the boat, "says Axel and adds that he bought the boat in three million.
"I made a deal with Hartmann to pay half, one and a half million, in the beginning of summer, but the other half at the end of summer when I was done hunting.
So I had the boat without guilt at the end of my first summer on him. "
But how could the boy have had one and a half million to pay out in a boat when he had a new school?
"I had already laid down and gained money, I had been working with my father at sea when I was a boy, I was all some to go hunting with him and got my part.
I also put my ferry money in my boat. "
Axel is born in the land of Israel, from where all his mother's people are, but he has lived in the coach from the day that he was a boy.
"I can go here in the west because I have a lawyer at my grandmother's at Isair.
I learned in this area right here in the west of roots with my dad.
I will go between them, according to the way I feel, because this place is near all the West.
Though I feel best to be in front of the West, I have also laid in the surroundings of the Swimming and Widding.
I have also given to the sun, but I prefer to let go, "says Axel, who always touches one fire in the morning, and sometimes speaks to the moon, and sings for the sky, in a single hour together in the sea.
"The network outside of the ocean is good, so I can call, listen to the charts and music.
I don't think it's a problem to be alone on a boat.
Of course, I try to avoid landing in the skirt, but certainly something has been unique times to weather, but never much danger, "says Axel, who is lucky with it that he is never watery.
He says the length of the working day goes according to how the races go every time.
"In the beach course I am never more than 14 hours on the paths at once, but I have also been searching in other systems, for example in the rental rooms, but then I have been interfered in one and half a day in a bit out of the lake to search."
He says that he will be able to fish 770 miles a day, which he will find hamland.
"Other brakes are that I may not bathe on holidays, on Saturdays and on Sundays, and I can only bathe for twelve days a month, these four months that the beach paths stand over, in May, June, July, and Jul.
For my food, seamen should choose their days after weather and none else.
This unnecessary pressure is to calm down instead of having 48 days throughout the summer and can be chosen according to its head.
So the area exchange should also go because of me and a well-placed fishing area should be enjoyed, "says Axel, who draws most of the water from the sea on its seaside, but also only ufsa and very few other species swiftly.
Axel works over the winter season with the high school school at Núpi School in Copavogi.
"I don't think we're many seamen who work in the country's playschools," says Axel proud and adds that he has only intended to work the time at the playground.
"I'm stuck there because I feel this great job.
I hope that the psychology program will be new to me at the school in the future, "says Axel, who has also been very far in the field of business science.
Error in the file prevented the home interface
Error in the file sheet that people fill out when it comes to the country was made to ensure that individuals, established here on the country, were not called back in the show.
It is not required to file a certificate if the relevant expiration is completed in English, as is when it is done in Icelandic.
"This will be examined during the week," says the specialist at the countrydoctor's office.
Three inlands were detected on the viral science site of the Landspítalan yesterday.
One of the people who was successful came to the country on the 15th of July, two days after the rules of the homecoming system took place.
And those who were established in Iceland were commanded to come to the land, and again commanded in sightseeing four to five days later.
Before this came in the lunch news of RÚV that the adjacent had gone after the old system.
The oxygen of the land was negative and it was not called back to the virus.
Kamilla Rut Sigfus's daughter, a specialist in the National Health Service, says in conversation with the newsletter that this may lead to an error in the radiological journal.
Full people in English are not required to insert a number like that and are in the Icelandic version.
It was even the first to be thought of by travellers.
Therefore, the latter did not receive an autoactive invitation to come to the show.
However, Kamilla says that many people have been following the rules of homecoming although they have completed the file format in English and, in some cases, employers have also been awake for sending people back to the show after it came to the country.
"This will be examined during the week how to facilitate the availability of people to raise attention to this on the journey."
The man is in isolation and six have been set in the night.
They're all going to show, but two were going to show symptoms.
Smithing is now going on with the three smiths that were detected yesterday but it is most closed because of two pieces that were reported on Friday.
In both cases, the Italian genetic analysis has led to the absence of the coronary virus that has not been found here before.
In the second instance, the Federal Republic of Israel has committed itself to knowing that the person who transported the virus to the country had also travelled to another European citizen.
Kamilla says that tomorrow should be where the other virus should come from.
There are now 15 in isolation according to COVID.
135 are in the morning.
Four out of five infected
Five inlands have been landed here in the past few days.
Four of them are completely unconnected and it is not possible to find the origin of the infection that came up at the Rey Cup portal yesterday.
Smiths are still persistent.
Originally, three tugs were sent individually at night, but they were reduced for sixteen.
In total, there's 34 in the night because of these new things that were detected yesterday.
This is another time in a short time that smit is detected on an athletic response and has raised questions about whether it does not hold such an admission.
Johann K. Jóhannson, co-director of the General Security Department, says it well slowly, as long as people follow the rules and regulations.
"We are constantly bridging for all those who live here that it needs to keep up the individual infections.
We also need to bridge for people who have to observe that there are certain rules in progress that need to be followed.
Then there is a chance to keep the place, "says Johan.
He says that it is possible to prevent smet by holding on to the air of individual infectious agents.
The rules and recommendations are included in a more permanent review.
"What needs to be done, and what the public service and the countrydoctor are constantly bridging for people, is to think of these individual infections.
Both at home and then the same way in service companies.
People wash their hands and use a syringe.
It is to be prevented that the mud may go on, "says Johan.
"We need to bride for the people to continue on the good path we were on, to keep up the most successful that we have come here."
40% of victims of COVID-19 had diabetes 2
Devon Brumfield heard on the phone how hard her father had to breathe.
Her father had diabetes, and she had him to seek medical assistance.
The next day he was dead.
The breath was raced to a rapid difficulty in breathing due to coronary viral infections.
Diabetes was reported on the death rate as a underlying problem and Brumfield, which is also diabetic, is terrified of being the same after its occurrence.
Reuter's news says the fear of Brumfield doesn't mean no reason.
The number of new studies conducted by the United States has shown that 40% of those who have been treated with diabetes 2 have been subjected to an underlying disease.
When the proportion of those who had not reached 65 years of age is examined, the proportion is increased by half.
Study of the CDC took up more than 10,000 people in 15 states who died from the coronary virus in the period from fever to maize.
Jonathan Wortham, a specialist in CDC infectious diseases, says the results are striking, not what is the last for those who have detected diabetes 2 and their love.
Reuters had a low weight and had the answers from the 12 kingdoms who responded to the same issues.
10 kingdom, but among them California, Arizona and Colombia have not yet been reported from the underlying diseases.
"Diabetes was already in a slow shift.
Now COVID - 19 has been broken through like a powerful age, "Reuters has after Elbert Huang, Managing Center for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at Chicago School.
Diabetes is more common among the black and the people of the South American upset, which has also increased from the coronary virus.
One of the best precautions for those with diabetes 2 is to maintain the disease in bodywork with body-like, hollow food and health care.
However, the chronic viral age has made it difficult for many weeks to maintain Russia.
Insulin has therefore been required to continue to work and to stop being exposed to the virus.
Reuters suggests that the United States of America may be aware of the risk that those with diabetes 2 may be depicted by the virus.
When the SARS coronary virus went over the year 2003, 20% of them were infected with the disease, and at the age of SARS in 2009, this group in three times was more likely to have to enter the hospital.
When MERS was done in 2012, one study showed that 60% of those who died or were injected into surgery had diabetes.
Charles S. Dela Cruz, scientist at Yale High School, says that because of the effects of COVID-19 the virus may have prolonged, then the age of the patient has diminished the loss of the number of unknown complications.
"I fear that we will see a flatulent problem when this is over," says Andrew Bolton's former supervisor, taking up diabetes.
Physicians have been advised that the cholesterol virus age, with an unbone, may lead to an increase in concomitant diabetic complications, including renal disease and renal dialysis.
As with new studies, the coronary virus could lead to the number of diabetes cases.
Reuters says that scientists are trying to distinguish the links between the coronary virus and diabetes 2.
The vein is affected by heart, lung and kidney, a body that is already ill in many people with diabetes.
Therefore, the high proportion of glucose and lipids in diabetes may be called a true "cellular storm," as it is called when the immune system raises too hard and raises the body.
Skin cells can also lead to inflammatory events that may cause a replication of the blood.
"This is all one big puzzle game," says Dela Cruz.
"This is all related."
The news has been guided.
"We were invited champagne, so they went out of the room"
The wife of Ásrún Magnussdotter and Atli Bollason were with their unusual prayer from the photographer Ragnari Kjartansson to have sex in front of the camera for work that the librarian was putting up in Paris.
"We loved each other so this wasn't a problem."
So Atli Bollason never forgets when he met his wife and mother, the daughter of Ásruna Magnusa, first.
"I was very healed by her.
It was natural only the release, but then she also kept me very unbelievable.
And still regrets, "he says.
Ásrún remembered this, too, the end of the husband's first meeting regularly.
"I always hear this story.
The last of the weekend, "says she who was loaded also to the husband at the first concert.
"I felt and felt so much gossip around Atla, as I play.
There's a lot going on and a lot to happen, and I was greeted by it. "
Atli says that the wives have put an end to it in their own relationship to go their own way.
"We don't bind our backs with the same knots and partners.
We're avoiding ruits that we're looking at around us. "
That's probably why they took the archaeology from the Ragnari Kartansson photographer just thriving, although it would be slightly said unusual.
"Christ Anna's common friend has contact with us and asks if we can come to dinner with him, Ragga and Ingibjörg's wife Ragnars, at Snaps."
They had the commandment, met the triangle of Snaps, and received the desservin and the aftermath.
They listened to Ragnar, who led them through his shape to the image view he thought would set up in the Palais de Tokyo in Paris around the house.
"He had many videos called Scenes from Western culture.
He explained it in a simple way. "
Ásrún says that he has described the work as a banal and decadent sending from the everyday life of Western Buya.
"He had a shield of all the beds he was planning to shoot and last he told us about what he wanted to know if we were interested in taking part in."
Later on, Ragnar asked the couple to take part in showing young millimetres to be loved in a minimal room.
"These are comparisons with the beginning and the end," says Atli.
The couple didn't know Ragnar much, though they knew about him and him of them, "but they knew us and found us fit in this.
They had words that they didn't want to clarify after people.
Perhaps they said that they would not get the right people but people who received sexual fertility from performing for others. "
They quit Ragnar and agreed to think about it, but it didn't take long.
"When we came out of Snaps, we said," Aren't we just in this?
It was just like that.
I trust Ragnari as a listener and all his team, "says Ásrún and Atli.
"This is about love and proximity."
It was later taken into a nice apartment on the Myrerstraße.
There was a very small portrait; a lecturer, Ragnar, and a speaker, and a couple.
After moving, all rooms had been taken to wait outside in the car except Atli and Ásrún.
"We haven't decided anything about how we should be.
We got some instructions but we tried to forget time and place.
To be unaware of what we were doing and for whom.
There was no game, we just loved each other so it wasn't a problem, "says Ásrún.
But was that romantic?
"Yes, this was a little romantic," says Atli and Ásrún agree.
"We were invited to champagne before they went out of the room.
It was a little like being on vacation at a fine hotel in Paris. "
The team was pleased with the performance of the couple in the work that moved them.
"When Tommi was looking at this, he cried, he was so beautiful," said Atli.
"This is as much about love as well as the close and the self-understanding," says Ásrún.
The parents of the couple have seen the work and tell Atli that his mother has heard the voice in the son of the Listasafni Reykjavíkur and then assumed that he was part of the work.
"Then she turns around and goes into this," says Atli.
"Mom and Dad saw this in Paris.
We hadn't told anyone that, but then Dad just sent me a message and said, "It's good to kick the little family in the Palais de Tokyo," Ásrún breaks up.
And will the involvement in the work have deepened the relationship between Ásrunar and Atla?
"We're still together, so maybe this was deeper.
This deepened my relationship with the family, "says Ásrún and laughs.
I saw Ásrún's work in Kaupmann's house with his colleague.
"I felt a little difficult not to be with you but someone else," she says and turns to the husband.
"But it was fun to see this because this is only a late in much bigger pain and when you saw this with the other effects this is very nice.
I was able to pull something out of this and I was just proud.
And there was the little bait in my stomach, "says Ásrun, who was unclean of the other child of the wives when the late was taken up.
"This was just beautiful."
Anna Marsibil Clausen spoke to them, Ásrúna and Atla, in love stories at Rás 1.
Swansea with victory in the previous sub-section
Swansea won 1-0 victory at Brentford in a dramatic game.
This was the previous play of the teams in the outline of the paper to get into the English editorial division.
The game went on home to Swansea in Wales.
Half of the population was 0-0.
The home of Swansea got a deck in 64 minutes, and Andre Ayew broke down the booklet of the white spot and made it go away.
Only two minutes later, Rico Henry, the actor Brentford, got the red spear.
Brentford then played the rest of the game of a man less and in the 82nd minute, Swansea's new team.
Andre Ayew then replenished the scratch by scratching great ground and securing Swansea 1-0 victory.
Swansea then leads 1-0 to the deck, but the later game will be next Saturday at the home of Brentford.
Transmission for five years from 2009
Jeffrey Gunter Ross, the United States Senator of Iceland, who was thrown out of the media after CBS found out this morning that he wanted a weapon of life where he was afraid of his life.
However, the President of the United States has not been able to command the masters here on land.
Since Carol Van Voorst was empowered by the United States Senders in April 2009, all of them have been sent out in the country for 62 months, more than five years.
Van Voorst was appointed by special circumstances, but Kastljós found from 2009 that she should have received the Fálkadade.
On the eve of the meeting with the President of Iceland, she got a call from the presidential office, saying she wouldn't be a fair word.
After she left Iceland, she was a member of the Army War College.
Sixteen months of life until the post of Van Voorst came to work, in September 2010.
There may be some way that Robert S. Connan had been commanded as a mayor, but then quit.
We worked at the end of Loius Ariega had then worked in the foreign ministry for years.
So he left the job in 2013 and took part in the office of the senior senior in Guatemala.
Then we took another broadcast without time.
Robert Barber agreed to the United States of America in January 2015 and came to work at a later dose, but then no mayor had been in place for 13 months.
Barber was politically commanded but not a diplomat, but he had worked as a lawyer and supported Baracks Obama.
He made a job as soon as Donald Trump took the President's contribution, 20 January 2017, as the usual is with a politically commanded senior.
Chief Trump was unusual to command both senior and high-level officials in the Washington control system.
So two years until the United States of America, Jeffrey invited Ross Gunter to his meeting to ask him out the speeches and confirm the end of the mission as a senior in Iceland.
In his testimony of the king, he said, "Never has he come to Israel, but often to Western Europe, but his wife, who is consumed, had been broken by the holy mountain."
Gunter is a political commander, a predecessor in California, and has been involved in a group of Jewish Jews in the Republican Jewish Coalition.
The game owner Sheldon Adelson set them up, but Adelson is a successful supporter of Donald's Trump.
Gunter came to work in Iceland in May 2019, but then none of the masters had been in the country from that early year 2017, for two years and four months, which is the longest judgment in this country.
The reason is both how long the Trumps control was to name people in the key supplement who and the past years have worked the United States of America is moving very long, which means confirming the masters in office.
As of 2009, therefore, it has been sent to Iceland for five years.
However, it has not been prevented from performing on the roads of the broadcasting agency which has recently opened headquarters at the Royal Court of Justice.
The results are estimated to have cost about 6.5 billion, but the safety walls of the building are surrounded and the shotgun glass is in all windows.
It doesn't seem to have been enough to fill up the current sendemark because he's been said to be afraid of his life and wished for a weapon of life.
Previous player IBV was born in Iceland - "There was a mistake coming to Iceland"
Tonny Mawejje, the former actor of IBV, said that he had become racial when he was in Iceland, and that he was looking for coming to the country.
This appears in a conversation with Tonny, which appears on the Uganda media of Daily Monitor.
Tonny recently joined the Uganda Police FC team playing at the Uganda Supreme Division.
In the conversation with Daily Monitor, Tonny talks about a lot, among other times here in the country but he played with IBV, Val and Trótt on Iceland.
"When I came to Iceland, I didn't play in the middle as I was used to play.
For the team was in their position, but he was also with the trust number that I wanted so I got no of what I wanted, "Tonny says, but he played on the right side of the game with IBV.
By the time Tonny talks, it is a rage that he was in Iceland.
He says this is a problem that many black players will be facing when they play in Europe.
"This came once to me, but as I didn't understand the language, I just ignored what was said to me.
Later I heard about the matter and then I asked my friend what the matter was about.
He told me then that my opponent had made a racial hug fall on me after I struck him. "
In 2014, Tonny moved from Iceland to Norway where he joined Haugesund.
That's where he says he made the mistakes he sees most.
Tonny had not been able to get into the first team at Haugesund but he wanted to play more to get into the country.
Then he asked to go back to Israel on loan, but he went to the county of Val.
"There was a mistake coming back to Iceland on loan.
I think if I had been in Norway longer then I would have had the chance that I wanted to have, "Tonny says, but he hopes that if he would play well in Norway he would probably come any further.
He wants to say that the loan to Iceland has made out of his dreams to get to the storm in Europe.
Found worms in her neck
Doctors at St. Luke's International Hospital in Tókýo found 3.8 cm long black snake in a woman in the neck that was looking for it.
Doctors managed to pull the worm out with a tooth.
Studies revealed that there was talk of snacks.
CNN's telling you about this.
The wife had eaten a few days before the sashime, which is diluted meat.
The wife recovered quickly after the worm was removed, but chicken animals on board are often in rough meat or fish.
After the sushi went to bed in Western countries, cases, where snowy animals have been bored in people, have multiplied to the story of CNN.
Fear that other curves are to be started in Europe
Spain is now on fire in connection with the concerns of the other coronary virus in Europe, but in this area, the authorities have taken action to restore the spread of the coronary virus age.
In Catalonia, all the fun life has been put on ice for two weeks, but there are more cities than Barcelonas where infections go into a multitude.
Other European countries have also taken action on the grounds of the large number of people in Spain, but in the United Kingdom everyone needs to go for a night at the home of Spain, just like in Norway, and the French have been attended by travelling to Spain.
Smites are also counting again in France and Germany, where the government is trying to find the equilibrium of the spread of the virus and restoration of the substance life.
The location of Europe is, however, good in the face of the world, but the newcomers are approaching 300 thousand a day, but there are the most important ones in America and South Asia.
Confirmed is the word 16 million on the homepage, according to Johns Hopkins High School, and are deaths that are confirmed to be associated with the virus 644 thousand.
Mozaïc Works Gerda finally gets to enjoy himself fully
In front of the Tollhaus in Reykjavík is a big and deep hole.
There are men in it with orange-yellow helmet.
There's a big grave, too.
And more of my work machines.
The gate is closed for traffic.
But the gateway is ready, and there are now many stalking and respecting the listing of millions of mosaic flash - just as they have never seen it before.
Maybe they've never seen it before.
At least it wouldn't be worth it.
The work has been here to have been somewhat hidden, directly in front of it were car loading places that were always transported.
People put it there, locked the car in a hurry, and then get out of the middle of the city.
"Living and multidimensional general space" and "adhering towns" are a guide to the restoration of the Safeguards that are now over.
The target is to remove the area and allow the mosaic pain of Gerðar Helgadótt in the Tollhaus to enjoy the appearance better.
In front of the work, there will be a torque and where the area is well located with the sun, it is considered to be a good place of residence for travellers.
The listing work will be clarified and will now get the substance to enjoy it better than before on this 142-metre surface.
In the area there will also be small "thrusters," some types of water turtles, which invite to play and provide the area with a determined tolerance.
At this point, the reboots are described by Reykjavíkurstad, which is being implemented together with Veita.
Launched water, heat and rapids are restored.
Many of them have come to their years, but the shelter and the cold water logs are from the year 1925 and have therefore served dwellings and businesses in the middle of the century.
When the street is opened again, the power of the locks can run cars around it again.
But she's going to be a single street and soon creates a calm and accessible space before walking.
In the curiosity of the Tollhaus on the tissues of the customs officer, it says that the house has been taken in the year 1971 but its architecture was Gísli Halldórson.
Because of the harness of the sea through the house, there were 250 metre window-free walls out to the street.
The construction name and the architect agreed that such flats would have a bad impact on the overall image, if no specific advice was made to determine the appearance of the house.
Therefore, you agreed to calculate by putting up available listing work there.
In this time a great word was made of the Holy Son of God, the son of a listener, saith in the congregation.
If she had worked a lot on mosaic stains in Germany and across Germany.
This was the first time to contact her before it was decided whether the substance would be for a competition on the work.
Often it had been discussed that the work had to reflect the life of the head, the end of the head had been alive Reykjavík since it was done.
When speaking to the listener, she had to trace the idea of such pain.
Had it agreed that she received drawings and other assistance before she moved back from land breaks, as she would work with the admissions of Erlendis.
She was given the time she decided herself to need, and when she returned home she made some suggestions for discussion.
It was agreed without delay to ask her to work.
At the same time, it was desirable to make a total agreement with it and the scientific listing company in Germany, the Oidtman brothers, but Gerður had been working with them for a long time to establish a more skilled listing for Europe.
Interviews took place with Gerd under the establishment of their brothers, who then saw the establishment of the Tollhaus.
All the work was extremely well solved by the hand, both of the half of the Holy Dogs and the Oidtman brothers, says in the congregation.
It's been a long time since there was an unblinded Icelandic racing.
It took Gerði about two years to work, which was worked and set up in the years 1972 and 1973.
Listacone died two years after the Tollhaus work was completed, only 47 years old.
Provides the transport of more agencies to land
Mr Einar Daðson's company counsel invites that more public bodies will be transported to land the next day.
This was what the counsellor said in the field exploding at the Bylgjen on the lunch.
It has recently been reported that the brunamalasant skin and human activity toxins are being transported north of South Korea in the head.
Six specialists in the field of brunamála work at the Agency but none of them are advised to follow the Agency north and have a link between the countryside and nurses benefit from the transports.
"I think we should take further steps in this world.
I'm preparing for further steps in this world.
More transport, "said Ásmundur.
If he is convinced that a large part of the nation wants to see more the distribution of the public bodies across the country.
"I think it was necessary to take further political decisions on the transfer of public employment to land, as well as I was doing with Household and Human Resources," said Ásmundur, but he also took judgment of other institutions that have been transported to land and switched a great deal for society outside of the country, such as the transport of food supplies to Selfoss, the countrymen of Israel to Akraness and the unemployable population of Skagastrande.
All the most important from the late day Master
94. The Championship of Iceland in Freedom on Torsvelli on Akureyri today.
Some of the opponents were set on the late day of the competition.
In 2014, Vigdís Jónsdotts from the FH placed the Islam in the slope of 2014, which stood all the way until Elísabet Rut Rúnarsdotts from the IR added corn to last year.
Vigdís went back to Israel earlier in the summer, and was in fantasies on the side of the box, but she has tripled Israel with what is of some.
Elisabet Rut has been flushing with pain and has not reached a line today.
She only had one valid cast of five, threw 25.69 meters, which is far from her best.
Vigdís was thrown for the longest time today, or 60.08 meters in her last experiment and set as soon as the resistance.
Her ice cream she used to put in July is 62.69 meters and she was still a little from it.
Guðrún Karítas Hallgríms daughter of the IRIS had almost the best throw in the day but she improved her best performance with a throw up to 50.18 meters.
In a man's class, the FH king Hilmar Örn Jónson, the methafi of Iceland, had a certain victory, but he threw 73,84 metres in his last throw, and set his face.
His ice cream in the article is 75.26 meters.
The God of God, the son of God, and the Olyphite, and the methafia of Israel, in the midst of the midst of the midst of the city of Torah yesterday, and this day, he was in the midst of his midst.
The Jehovah of Israel is 65.53 metres, but he threw 59.13 metres today, and assured himself the victory.
Valdimar Hjalti Erlendsson threw almost for long today, but he had one valid cast that dug in the second seat, 49.43 meters.
Hafdís Sigurðóttir, Icelandic methafi in a long-haul, won the long-haul ships with surfaces but Hafdís stayed for a maximum of 6.25 meters today, which is 40 cm from her Icelandic metre.
In the 200-metre run of the women, it was the IR-King of God John Bjarnadóttir who was the most prosperous but she came to the mark of 24.04 seconds, but her Islam in the article is 23.45 seconds.
Godsbjörg Jóna was victorious on Akureyri, but she won two gold salaries yesterday, in 100 meters running and in 4 x 100 meters of quadrant and then also in 4 x 400 meters of quadrant today.
In a male group, Kolbeinn Hood Gunnarson of the FH was the first to mark for 200 metres of the race in 21.57 seconds, 0.3 seconds before Oliver Mána Samuel's son from Årman.
Like the Gothbjörg of Jonah, Kolbeinn won gold in 100 meters yesterday as well as in 400 meters running.
Do not get sect for 27 million crowns of Bitcoin
Overtax has rejected the requirement of tax investigator who has been forced to defend a man in order to discount his financial assets that were made due to the sale of the Bitcoin computer.
The name comes to the conclusion that the tax investigator had not moved a clear line for why it was necessary to hunt the man.
In the absence of the reference, the tax investigator found that the person's tax investigator had a distinction in the substantive tax forecasts for the 2016 and 2017 financial years.
He would have deprived his financial assets that would have been made because of the sale of the Bitcoin battery up to 27 million, either wanting or of magnificent ruthlessness.
Hunt the man for his affection.
The man rejected it in a letter to the name.
However, he managed to sell electricity for 27 million in 2016.
He would have been buried in 2009 and 2010 when such a thing had both been easy and inexpensive with a more common home service.
Then he pointed out that when he sold the battery coin, the tax performance of such a sale would have been very unclear and unforeseeable.
It would have been possible for the general public to identify such advice on tax progress.
He would not have been planning to pay the tax of the increase and would have made a statement for his property on the performance of the debt account.
He would have asked both the scientists and the government tax administrator how this would be done but without any incentive.
Then he thought he needed to take the view that he was not born or the oldest in Iceland and had only lived here for a few years when he started digging after Bitcoin.
He would therefore have been in a worse position than others to present themselves flouting rules that taxpayers would not have made a clear assessment.
The man was right to say that his treasures for these two decades were restated and well-determined, but that other ones did not make a refusal.
Then he imagined that he was winning in Iceland and would have paid taxes here in a country from 2012.
He never intended to get away from his duties with an unacceptable end.
The crap of a sect would be out of all the groups and would put him in debt.
BrewjuIves show: "This man understands what foot ball is"
Oxygen Andersen Willumsson has been talked about between the teeth of the people but has also been influenced by its progression of the time of play with the Pepsi Max division.
Blocks will be in the fire line tonight when they take against IA in direct transmission at Station 2 Sport.
Brewster takes them out of the game because of four memories of the game time and therefore does not play with new cut as in the summer's game here.
He had let write "blah, blah, blah" on the colon in front of the game at the HK last Thursday, which HK won 1-0.
"I don't know exactly who he was answering with the reward, but talking about character then was this but better to try in the game.
He didn't hide.
He wants to get the ball at every one time and if it was someone going to equate this game then I thought he would do it or create it, "said the Goddess Benedict son of Pepsi Max girl, when said he was fighting to Brynjulie.
"I'm supposed to be here for the people."
"Sometimes it's hard to figure out what position he is.
He searches something out of the left side when it comes to the play, but he has a very free roll in the team, "said Harvar Hafliðson.
Torkell Month Péturson says Brynjulf's real fun and celebrates having such a colorful man in the division: "No one shares it that this is a character.
This is fun, and I love it with my hair, and always be ready to meet and answer in conversations.
It is incredibly much of the people busy of him, which tells me that this man understands what footballs are.
"I'm a fun man.
I'm supposed to be here for the people and enjoy it. "
The people are reading the interviews with Brynjulf, people are paying in and watching what's next on his hair.
This man is just a genius, "said Moon.
Playman KR says want to leave the company - "I've been in touch with some team in the B-Division"
Tobias Thomsen, KR of the Pepsi Max Division, seems to be leaving the team.
According to the Danish media Bold, Tobias is ready to go back to Denmark.
Fotbolti.net also found out about the case.
Tobias wants to get the start of the time in the home country, but to do so, he must first quit his deal with the KR where the Danish division starts before they look like Icelandic.
The people know that I miss Danmarks and have shown me great understanding, "said Tobias in conversation with Bold.
"I've been in contact with some team in the B division and I'll probably switch over before the Icelandic era ends.
There are not many teams in Denmark that can allow themselves to pay up my deal with KR. "
Then he says he needs to take all the chances of taking on a salary increase in Denmark.
"The dangers in Denmark have probably found more for the substance effects of the virus than in Iceland."
The Bjartmar motorcycle has restored the wheel for millions - Responses now for themselves after the DV conversion
For a few years, Bjartmar Leóson has had an interest in the same way as most others.
He has gone up and saved the losers and the stolen racing wheels, the battery wheels, and the weave.
Bjartmar's name has been called "the wheelchair" a week ago.
Yesterday, there was so high a four-point when you showed a story of your relationship with Bjartmar.
DV informed them on Facebook Group Western Bearings where it appeared that Bjartmar had taken the man on the speech at East Velli and said that the weasel might be proud.
It was not possible to read from the original writings of the battery sniper but that Bjartmar has served him.
The text has now been changed on Facebook and the original DV news has been updated in accordance with it.
Bjartmar says original news of the matter at all did not describe what actually happened yesterday in East Africa.
Bjartmar was told that he had been informed by the victim of the battery bullet that this was indeed his battery.
They received information from others, but Bjartmar said that the information was wrong.
"I saw to the guy and I looked at the shuttle, end with information that there were battery shuttle that had been missing very long and had been searched for.
Of course, I hated first, but when I saw him reside to drive off at the shooting, I decided to chat with the man.
The owner was sure of his fault, and I decided to have a conversation with the man.
In general I go very good in such matters, but before I could finish what I had to say, the man had taken away from me. "
Bjartmar says that the man on the battery shot underneath his command to show him the receipt for the wheel and called himself for the police.
"Yes, great," said Bjartmar, "let's just get this cleaned up."
And then the owner of the battery shot proven the possession of his battery and went off.
Later, the rightful owner of the battery shield from his history on Facebook, as well as the story of the previous news.
In this bed year that Bjartmar has spent a while on this remark, it says he can count the ship that he landed at the edge of the people on the fingers of another hand.
"I have had a peaceful relationship with the most difficult men of Reykjavik," said Bjartmar and pointed to the longest brethren and sisters of the community, fools, angry people and other people who are on the street for any reason.
"The fox is a harsh household, and some need to finance the next dose, because unfortunately it is served in such a simple way to achieve the goal," says Bjartmar.
"My relationship with this people is actually so good that I have come with many of the good people with me in the team.
The judgement is that people have gone into treatment and taken on and then searched for me and helped me with what I am doing, "he says.
In general, Bjartmars is interchangeable with racials at short-term nights.
Some know of him, and what he is doing, and are commanded peacefully to show him the receipts, the number of wheels and so forth.
Railway service is a major problem that has been rarely covered.
Again, Bjartmar says the police are more to tell people to talk to him out of stolen racing wheels.
Bjartmar is injured at the previous DV news transfer and is not claimed to be a personal self-employed police officer looking for justice.
Asked whether he is now still not on the high ice with his attention, and whether this is not the first and most part of the law, says Bjartmar certainly be.
"Of course the law is to do this, but the facts of the matter are that the law is purely not to do this.
I've been looking up at cops driving away from a big bug of stolen wheels.
She is purely out said, "Incredible in these matters."
"When the law is not doing anything in this, and this is only in front of your nose, and the experience has shown that I can get more effective in this category, then why not?" asks Bjartmar.
He says that he has reached so much more prosperity in having upstairs on the stolen wheels, that sometimes he strikes on his "shields" on the street, that they have only right the Bjartmari wheels that they had come into before.
The change Bjartmar has called after the police help has occurred to be purely unsuccessful.
"This is just not working with the law, and it is not my fault and it is not the own racing wheels to teach," said Bjartmar and regrets that the victims of the racing wheels need to suffer from empty law in this field.
Bjartmars's success is not shared.
We can find stories of people thanks Bjartmari for getting their own back to them.
Self, Bjartmar has long been ready to lose the number of racing wheels that he has understood, but the rises are running over a million, if not millions.
Ways where power spots, battery wheels and power generators are heavy, but battery wheels can cost under half a million.
Bjartmar works on a day to play school and every other weekend he works on a conspiracy.
His wreckage is therefore unpaid work that he earns in his leisure.
Lifestyle and long shadows
The year 2019 was a major anniversary in the history of life disease in Iceland.
Ambassadors had received an extra salary from Danach King from all the streets of the 19th century, but in 1919, they were created by the survivors who ended up with the survivors of all public workers.
The fundamental importance of the current life-cycle of general wages was then established with the generals' core collections on the labour market in 1969, where the employment rate of life-expectancy with due diligence and full duration of sediment from the beginning of 1970 was set.
In 1974, the law was thus based on these agreements and the life-cycle system continued to be subject to it.
The life-risk system was not the only red-cell change that caused the 20th-century disease to occur with its carcinogenic effect.
In 1955, job-solvents had been severely disrupted in the history of a history of work, and a small number of cases were also combined on the subject of disease and illness, a serious right to work, support for the workforce, housing and more of this kind as a matter of fact.
All of this right cost a lot and a lot of trouble, but it was, after all, a lot more and more sustained carabote than the number of aurans in the wage camp, which went away in the same way in the world that characterised the time after war and until 1990 as many others.
The advisor for the establishment of general life disease in 1969 was both long and complex.
Although men come together to the end that the seas would be in the best interests of seafarers, they had to fall to the control of their officers and seafarers.
In the next few years after the establishment of the seaweed, the crop of major parts of the work in the management of the seaweed was often discussed in a total of salaries, but it did not succeed, and therefore we are still sitting up with the unusual precondition that representatives of the seaweed are not in most parts of the control of the seaweed.
The 36. Law No 129 / 1997 on the protection of the right to life and the function of life life is based on the financial criteria of the sea.
It says in the first section that "life leavers must have a leading light."
It also says in the fifth section, "Lifeyris should set itself in a proportionate way in financial terms."
The Lifeyriscoids are among the following:
The LIFE is a member of the United Nations (UN PRI) for the responsibility of financial institutions, together with many of the largest LIFE and professional Western and European countries.
The rules focus on how environmental and societal policies, including good governance, can help to improve the financial impact of the global economy.
Thus, the differences between the financial interests and the objectives of the nation's society go together in greater contexts.
LV considers it important that companies, especially those registered on the partially restricted market, have an open approach to: to maintain good governance, joint responsibility and environmental policy.
The Life Age of Value, which is with the greatest seas of the land, has set itself the "path of responsibility for the finances," and there are the measures of the same trains.
This is all ripped up here as the entrance to the newest time word of the Islam, "shadow management."
As it is new in the case, it is not expected that it has been defined as a hero, but I see the following definition now being "most taken": Shadow Management is the case when the chairman of the supervisor in the supervisor says in the county that he intends to send the company's supervisor into the management of the life-risk strategy or the plan for how they should take action in case of a case.
If they don't follow the orders, they'll be dismantled by the first chance.
If the chief does not bring this into the multitude and does not speak of excitement, then it is, however, not "shadow management" is still such an interaction between men, of course, eternity in the financial world as elsewhere.
I'll let the reader think about how the way he feels "shady."
There are only two men who have tried to react to this definition when this is written, to the morning of Saturday 25 July 2020.
They are the Heads of Egisson, the journalist of the tabernacle, and Asgeir the son of Jonah, the chief of the law.
The timeliness of both the company was until Bogi Nils Bogason's head of Icelandair had told them that their plan was to enter into the airline and flight service (say them up), and Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, the president of Verslunarmannafélag Reykjavíkur sent them out of their orders to the fullness of the company in the control of the Lífeyrishóðs company, who were well advised not to support the imaginary purchases of the ship in the company.
Some later Bogi killed Nil's decision back, and in the river Ragnar went the same way as his decision that was in the direction of the decision of Boga.
Nothing later they saw Head and Ásgeir's reason to celebrate the matter in the Friday's Newsletter with great words about shadow management, law breach and rich need for changes in law.
There, a small pump should certainly be weighed by weight, although the blessed thousand had been in contact and it was wiped out soon.
Since this matter is important, we should consider the substance itself at the end.
I was in front of them in the law of life leap that is going on with this matter.
They hide that the mayors must guard the minds of the seafarers, and have a moral response in the finances, and these things are more closely dealt with in the consent of both the Gildis and the Lifeyrseeds, as I have mentioned.
However, life fever isotopes should NOT be seen only at the time of dose control in their finances.
Such a situation would be particularly dangerous and does not need to be considered for a long time in the past, where large lending of banks and seafarers have led to the sidelessness of adventures and environmentalists, with severe consequences.
The Icelandic supervisor was clearly on ice when he was thinking of wiping out the whole group of employees, thus reducing the willingness of the company to take advantage of Icelandic markets and weakening its financial position.
As better as he goes, he saw it and pulled it back.
The time leads to whether it is sufficient to ensure that the financial contribution of life-leavers in the company can be attributed to the responsibility of seafarers when they are up.
The author is a former professor in physics and science.
One of the little ones didn't have a homecoming.
One of the three who was found with Covid-19 in the land yesterday came to the land from the Kingdom of Eystrazalt on the 15th Jul, for one and a half weeks later.
He is an Icelandic who is not yet established here as a place of age and therefore did not have any clear instructions to maintain such a called home passport after the arrival of the country and go to another show a few days after the arrival.
He had a negative impact on the land.
"But he is in Icelandic society, and in fact he should go into this discourse," says Kamilla Josephs daughter, a specialist in the medical service of the countryman, and a local nurse while he is in the summer holiday, in conversation with the journal today.
"He used the English file format and there is no obligation to file the lecture and if the lecture is not filed then you are not invited to automatically in the later display."
She says that the man could have used English file formats because he is actually established Erlendis but because of his connection in the country that Iceland would have preferred to use it Icelandic.
He didn't think about it.
"When the trainee is not filed, you need to search for it yourself to come into the late screen.
Neither he nor his employer seem to have made a statement that it is the right way, "says Kamilla.
"So it is clear that we need to provide information about this while we find a way to make an automatic tender system, although Iceland does not file its teaching.
Or to do it any way more clearly who are involved in the Icelandic association in the file system, "she explains.
As better goes around the appropriate, however, the coming to the land will be received, even though he is defined as a participant in Icelandic society, who is an Icelandic.
Only six have been sent in the evening after he was found yesterday and these six were all in agreement with him.
They have to go to the show, but two of them are going to show the symptoms of Covid-19 smits.
The man got negative from his vision at the landmark of July 15th.
Kamilla probably says that he has recently been infected by the virus that she has not yet been able to detect in him when the show was taken with the land.
She does not want to exclude the fact that the man has been infected here in Iceland, but does not carry the virus to the country.
"It is not quite possible to pretend that this is certainly impressed smit because it is a long time since he came to the country that he could have been exposed here like these two who have created a little control in relation to the irite."
That's what she says is very unlikely because of the few man around here.
"It is in fact very unlikely," says Kamilla but suggests that it is not possible to exclude it until the Italian genetic agreement has been completed to the radicalize of the virus in the man.
"If we get a virus that hasn't been seen here before, then it is almost certain that he has carried it to the land."
Piper spray and explosives bite against countermeasures
In addition, the police and the retaliants in Seattle came together last night.
The police had a violent piparspray and an unprecedented hand, but a violent breach of rows and moves.
45 opponents were arrested and 21 police officers were killed.
Police force and sexual immunity were supportive in the United States last night, but the Seattle supporters were supportive in Portland in Oregon.
In Austin, Texas, one of the opponents was shot to the ground.
The attackers have been arrested after the BBC.
In Seattle, thousands of people gathered in peace.
A group of people then moved into the building area and broke rows in the city's courthouse.
In the trail, the police said that the opponents were irresponsible, and in the meantime, they were between the groups of opponents and the law.
Requests justice in Aurora, Colorado, was Elijah McClain, 23-year-old black man murdered by law law in the last year, not least by opponents.
The car went through a group of opponents in the city, but no one was killed.
In Louisville, Kentucky, hundreds of troops came black together and demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, 26 years old black woman who was murdered by law enforcement at his home in March last time.
The group carried shotgun and observed closed streets where the police were responsible for the shotgun group who opposed the warnings and carried shotgun as well.
Then there were 75 arrests in Omaha, Nebrah, where opponents remembered James Scurlock, 22-year-old black man murdered by a white bartender in May.
Sunscreen: Not the game that defines our time
Ole Gunnar Solskärer, Kittenqueror Manchester United, doesn't want to do too much of the important game with Leicester today in the final trial of the English dealer.
If United loses the game, and Chelsea doesn't lose against Wolves, put sunscreen and his men in the fifth seat and lose there with the Master Attorney's seat.
However, they should still be hoping to get to the Championship by working the European Federation for the next month.
"We haven't reached the final station.
If we reach a path against Leicester, I think people may say that we have not had a bad time now, "said Solskær.
"But whatever happens then this is not turned on our journey because we still have talk in the land by getting the teams two before us," said Sunshine.
It is evident that the nerves of men are going to be there at 3: 00 today, but Sunscreen tried to pretend to be like any other game was to be discussed.
"If you want to belong to Manchester United then you have to get used to being under the press in the last game of time.
This is nothing new, and it builds the company.
We have made ourselves a great opportunity to end the time well and now it is ours to enjoy it, "said Solskær.

Fear other patterns of age
The government of Spain is now trying to restrain the increase in COVID - 19 in the country.
Spanish health authorities reported more than 920 new cases of COVID - 19, both on Thursday and Friday.
There has not been any more reports of one day from the beginning of May and will be the same time as the Spanish begins to eliminate one of the strongest outlets in Europe.
The backlog led to the fact that the British authorities now have to leave from Spain to go to the house for the night of night.
A week ago, Spain was on the list of Breta over the safe realm.
The situation is what's worse in Catalonia in the north-east part of Spain, where the government has seized more extensive limits to try to vote for the steps at the west.
In the capital of Barselone, the fun stations will be closed next two weeks and the old houses will be closed at midnight.
Then the outlet is now in value for 200,000 inhabitants of Segria infection in the western part of Catalonia.
It is said that the decision of Breta may have a negative effect on the Spanish substance that is very anxious to arrive at the travellers and is a bad game after the age.
Tui, the largest travel office in the United Kingdom, revealed all the flights that were planned today to Spain and the Canary Islands.
The government of all over the world has been prepared under the later stage of the journey age, but it seems to be a little concern to go back to the surrounding exit band that has laid the substance in the rudder.
Boris Johnson, President-in-Office of Breta, has taken a very bad picture of this kind, just like the nuclear weapon he doesn't want to use.
Then Jean Castex, President-in-Office of France, has said that "the people would not be able to live, materially or socially," if they were to be arrested again for the exit band in the country.
A number of advisors are hoping to be able to retain the virus in the next round if it comes to it.
Five new smit in Iceland - Three Inland
Three inland areas were found yesterday and two additional ones to the country.
So five individuals with positive Covid-19 were detected yesterday in Iceland.
In the general report, one throat is associated with the infection reported last night at the ReyCUP foot-bolthotine.
It has been sent to one and sixteen who were close to him in the evening.
The infected person was involved in the community activity in Reykjavík, according to the report, "only part of the sport population" in the night of night.
Others who were sent in the evening are connected to the man in a different way.
The origin of this infection is undetected and infectious in the full course of the state inspector.
The ReyCUP counterpart has been followed by the instructions and regulations of the professional and public health care professional still in value and appropriate advice has been given.
However, images of the motto of yesterday's attention, which may have been very close to celebrating its team's good course in the field.
Right before 11: 00 today, the following message will be displayed on Facebook page.
It says "ATH: Parents please respect their rules to competitors to pick up their own stuff in school.
Foreldrum is NOT home to do it.
Thank you for seeing a distinction. "
Another smit was detected yesterday but related to the infection that was reported last morning.
Says in the report: "Icelandic genetic agreement has rectified the throat and has come to light a new type of virus that has not been identified here before."
It is also known that infection is also occurring and that the infection is detected in isolation and 12 during the evening due to the infection.
The third set of words is from a man who came to Israel 11 days ago, 15 July.
He was looking at the south-west corner of the country.
The one now is in isolation and six who were in close agreement with him at night.
Two of them are already showing symptoms of viral virus.
In addition, two countries were identified and are requested after the results of further studies, such as the work of infectious infectious infectious diseases.
At the end of the report, the public health service of the State Police Department and the county physician asked people to be careful and to consider individual infectious agents.
Playing at least if the symptoms of the Covid-19 virus are present is the same as asking the other one to go to the next psychiatric site.
Patreksfjörder says the countryside has been invited for a weekend - Beinir gästen andre
The county of Patreks is completed during the weekend, as announced by the Western Construction.
A guest is going to look at other hostages.
The name of the west building is Bildudal, and the mountain of Talanah, and Melanes in the land of the Red Sea, and the house of Flókalund, and the house of Breiðavík, as a second election in the city.
There is enough to be in the Pater's house this weekend, for as the first year of Skaldborg, the feast of the Islam will be kept in the city.
It has been maintained since 2007, and so it has become stronger in the city.
From the request of the countryside to judge may be expected to meet well this year, if the bet does not set strikes in the calculation, but DV said earlier today of a searching spell.
However, the worst weather in the sunset may be expected, and hope for the Patreks.
The vein bb.is first told me, and said that all other guests in the city were completed.
The whole county house grows down in the best place in the city
Romanian workers live freely on Dunhaga 18-20.
In the meantime, the owner of the building permit is sought for repayment, but they have been switched into the system for three years.
In one of the oldest, greenerest and most expensive areas of Reykjavíkurborgar, there is a large multitude house on three levels.
On the ground floor of the house is about 600 metres away.
Behind the house are doors of two steps that where they store four some good apartments.
They're at 93-130 meters, but most of them are over 100.
The house has tales of history to store.
It was raised in 1959 and has been known as Videoleigu, the Schoolhouse, the dairy store, the Joa armory, fish salmon and now the last Háskólaprent.
The house has, as lightweight to be taken, remembered its foolish foolish.
The house is now subject to a lot of fun, as can be seen in accompanying images.
The house owns D18 ehf.
Owner D18 ehf are according to the company file among other Magnus Magnusson and Guðrún Helga Lárusdóttir.
Magnus went to the property of the Borgunar and was the defendant of the Borgunar family.
In the group of owners of the Borgunar is Stálschip ehf.
Stealship ehf is the company of the Lord of the Holy Father and her children.
Godsrún is equally suitable three-fold in D18 ehf.
And God and her husband, the son of God, the son of Sigurðh, took up the Stalskip.
D18 ehf. bought the house in summer 2009 and has therefore suffered nothing since then.
Tell neighbours that the state of the house has progressively worsened since, most recently.
At Facebooksíu's residence in the area, one resident says that the house has "not been particularly viable last year."
In this way, it may be possible to play in having ownership for a few years to change the house and the site.
Other neighbors say the house hasn't been okay for a long time.
"It's a long time to do something general with this pale and sad that this has gone like this."
If he also says that he is fucked out into the house of his own for not being involved in finishing this, found a common flood with the nearby green house and cease this "lawsuit."
"Do this only in consultation with the community around so that it can go through this and finish it."
The "legal applet" that the resident refers to is the command procedure of the route that has been running since 2017.
They then owned Dunhaga 18 and 20 by law to build the height above the current multitude house and in the back of the house, new pharmaceuticals and one-level reconstruction, plus a cellar.
The construction authorisation provided for the performance was awarded to the URCs for environmental and regulatory purposes and the designation was reduced from the value where the performance had not been supported in the divisions and the presentation was not sufficient.
The city of Reykjavik went on with a divisional portion and loaded it with an announcement in the Styrnartond in July last year.
That order was also charming and it fell from its value in March 2020.
At this time point, there were almost three years from the initial application for construction and the owner of the house at the beginning.
In this time, the house had been hit by a narrow rate and neighbours were tiredness.
When DV asked the neighborhood's house out in the state and the reactions of the neighbors were responses in different ways.
Some had an understanding of the plans of the house, others not at all.
Others had the wrath to the city, and others were not.
Others were only angry, but nothing at all into anyone.
Others also said the car load site, but neighbours have recovered unused the car load site Dunhaga 18-20 under its autopsy.
One prosecutor in the case said long-tied on the control line:
"To have to go through the three-way journey is incredible.
It's like Reykjavíkurborg couldn't read. "
Today the house is empty, abandoned and disoriented.
Recognition of the public administration and planning of owners and many years of their work now at the beginning.
When the journalist was in the garden of Dunhaga 18, he blew up the gallows door and rubbish.
Playstation data and recent television are located within another trash on the earth - sacrifice ice cream scratches superior bleach.
It was entered into the old office of Háskólaprents, and there was a number of cats of the lens to judge.
It is evident that someone has handled himself in one corner but no one is visible.
Staples of beds and rooms and a few branches of the earth's journal, which you should probably have to book, blew up.
The house of the Stigagang was as open as the lives of both of them.
A journalist was so lucky to be kicked in their other dwellers.
It was where Rúmento sew a cardboard dish for dinner and invite a journalist in.
The Romans work for Ztrongforce ehf.
They've been there for some rush and military homes of DV that the company has nothing to do with the domestic space except heat and power.
Because of the state of the house, it doesn't seem to be acceptable to hire.
From the postal position in the door of the house to judge, it is clear that there has been a number of erroneous workload on the last malserum.
Employees have not been warned by the Covid-19 state of affairs, the final consultation in the field of travel has led to interviews in the construction industry, and these two industries have been able to benefit from the most service staff.
Nothing since the Dunhaga 18 residents seemed to have enough to do, and the job clubs and wrestlers in the congregation to three after a long working day in the rain.
In spite of the disgusting condition of the house, the apartment that the boys shared seemed to be well maintained.
When a journalist swooped the boys of Romanian, the calf suddenly became clear to him: In the best place in Reykjavík is 1,500 metre old.
Owners want to change the house to better and neighbours want to improve the state but share the definition of "improved."
In this way, the city's order is at the start of the process, the victim's end-of-life pathway and the ability of the ordering process and the susceptibility of the URCs on environmental and environmental issues.
In the house are Romanians, and perhaps even those who go to improve the state, when the Islanders cease to fight.
The report was originally published in the DV 17th Jul weekly.

Women better to fall to lead to changes
She said that the new management file was the largest step that the nation could take to more power distribution, usefulness and to work against debris and to keep the mind of the whole.
"We need to change grain now and who is better placed to lead such changes than the group of societies that is more likely to be in these values.
There are women, "said Helga.
"Women in Iceland are talents for their women's position.
To stand together and be together in conducting changes.
So now we have just come to lead these changes. "
Said she was a little overwhelming over the influence of Iceland as "best in the world" in both sex rights and human rights.
"Then we are not even ready to look at what needs to be done.
Like the nations are very aware of their history and look at everything that needs to be done.
It's a trick.
We need to know where we're from and know the story and listen.
Listen to the radicals of a group.
We don't live with the same rules here, "said Helga.
Asked she said that many women are in good affairs in Iceland, but added to as well as other places of construction Isles with a giant male value.
She said that the rule was touched to reflect on her own minds, counsel and power that were the habits that were held in violation in all societies.
"Women are now ready to set up this group and come together and are only a bit annoyed by the fact that Alūingi is going to move to look forward to this national approach from 2012," she said.
"It's this female value we're thinking of.
Out of human rights and nature protection, cooperation and that we all sit real at the same table, "she said and added that the previous value was the basis of the new management file.
"We are very rich land of nature-free and it is ridiculous that here are people living with poor people.
It's ridiculous, we can change, "said Helga.
"It is ridiculous that there is something natural that women's jobs are always lower in the city.
It is ridiculous that aeroplanes and nurses must stand in the chariot only to obtain human salaries. "
It is possible to sign the signature list of new controller files here through Railway Iceland.

Twenty in the night and some of them are going to show the symptoms of the disease caused by the coronary virus
Five of them have reported the coronary virus in the last three days and most of them are unconnected.
There are days for this, and some of them are going to show the symptoms of the disease caused by the virus.
Three of them were detected with the coronary virus last night and two at the landscape.
Specialist in the official countrydoctor says that growing numbers of domestic pigs do not necessarily mean that the virus is widespread into the community.
"There has been a recitals from the previous domestic infection and there are viruses that have not been seen here before so that we have no special reason to believe that she has gone into the community for some time.
This is probably something new to the land, but of course we need to be very good in the care now, "said Kamilla Sigríd Jozef's daughter, a specialist in the protection of the countryside of the countryside.

This new situation may have an impact on the application.

Decisions between the police and the retaliants in Seattle
Mayor of Seattle, Washington, has outlined the state of resurrection in the protesters of the Middle East.
Policeman took last night to blast prints and piparudes to tempt the cleaning of a large area that opponents signed up and took over a lot of houses in the neighborhood of your house in the city.
The police reported on Twitter that at least eleven opponents had been arrested and that a study was carried out on the activities of the police station in the city yesterday, possibly with some kind of explosion.
Citizens' and police officers say that the defendants have greeted the law with weeds, bottles, whellbits and other loose ones and were one of the police officers transported to the hospital where his pain was done.
Seattle's opponent was still peaceful for a long time.
The blast was for them to show opponents in Portland in Oregon, but there in the city has been a harsh attack between opponents and depressed police officers.
There, like in more cities of the United States, people are gathered under the marks of Black Lives Matter, reminds Georges Floyds, who was killed by a police officer in Minneapolis 25 May, opposed to a system-based race in American society and demanding an exodus.
Not revoked until after revocation
It is not yet possible whether the cancellations of Icelandic airlines, which are to take value over the next month, will be revoked.
In addition, the Icelandic airline agreement on the carriage of air freight passengers to Icelandic air carriers was concluded on the eve of tomorrow's lunch.
The predecessor of the company, Líney Johan's daughter, says that Icelandair will not take a decision on the disclosure until the decision is taken.
"This is clingy," says the divine Líney.
"There have been no cancellations, this has to lie before so that the machines can be manned.
Thus, people are obviously untiring to know whether work will take place after the month. "
The box is about a contract signed a week ago, the date of 19 July.
It is expected that it will be up to the end of September 2025 and is based on an agreement that aeroplanes had previously entered into the aeroplane programme.
On July 17th, the management and the belief of the Air Frey Society of Iceland agreed to invite the Icelandic general service to work with Icelandic companies.
To her never came, but this was decided in the bases of Icelandic decision to cease consultations with the Air Freedom Company, to dismiss all its air freedoms and to search for agreements with the other airline.
Then you have the airmen of the company to take up a safety team on board the time limit.
Ask her how she thinks the attestation will go says God's Líney hard to say about it.
"People are in pain after this by Icelandair, when all the flight-friendly company was dismissed and announced that it would be in agreement with another group.
Now it comes to light whether it has an effect, "she says.
In the end of April, there were 940 airfreakers in Iceland, and 900 of them, 95%, were cancelled.
Their reproach is miserable: he is three months in the first place, and shall end for the month of Jul.
There are about 90% of Icelandic airlines in that group.
What do we take from the agreement?
"Then we wish for continued consultations with our observers.
With this agreement, we are meeting Icelandic demands.
"If he is denied, it is clear that we have gone too far."
Attachment of the Core Companies and Icelandic Discussions of Occupational Years in the morning
The approval of the new core collection will be completed at 12: 00 a.m. tomorrow afternoon.
Icelandic disclosure for the second quarter of the year will also be published in the morning, but the immediate results suggest that the company has decreased by 85% from the same period of time last year.
The Rafafræne report on the carriage of air freight companies in Iceland and Samtaka for Iceland started on Wednesday, 22 July, and tomorrow, Monday 27 July, at 12 a.m.
Those who may choose the agreement are the employees of Iceland who pay a company grant to the Air Freedom Company.
Icelandair and the FIN signed a new nuclear collection on Sunday 19 July than on Friday before Icelandian had dismissed consultations with the company after the aeroplane release of the previous coincidences of the initial July agreement.
Then Iceland had told all the aeroplanes and the airlines of the company up on Friday, but they were withdrawn after the new chariot collection was signed.
According to the new nuclear collection, aeroplanes need to fly five more hours a month for the same basic salary.
The carriage is valid until 2025, but there has been a match between the airlines and the airlines for how long they can fly on one guard.
The agreement was met with the members of the FFI at the Hilton Nordica hotel last Monday, and explained a number of airlines who discussed them about the dissatisfaction of the agreement.
However, most people seem to agree that the agreement should be accepted to keep the FIFG alive.
If Icelandic for other years, the EBIT company will be presented tomorrow, as the EBIT company, which will be recruited for financial and tax purposes, which, according to the acute results, is negative between 100 and 110 million United States of America or about 15 million Irish krona.
Icelandair sent the Kauphöl's emergency allowances last Saturday, but it said that the company took about 60 million dollars per quarter or about 8.3 million kroner.
A handful of money and its equivalent have been about 154 million United States of America at the end of the fourth century, around 21 million kroner.
Icelandic is also planning to invite the company's role in the future.
Icelandic plans are to conclude agreements with fifteen borrowing queen, mayor and Boeing aeroplane manufacturer at the end of the month before going to a part-time contract.
New depletion rather than new type of virus
"New viruses only mean that this has been an individual who came from Erlendis.
This is not something that has been mapped here within the country, "says Már Kristjánson, surgeon at the Disease Department of Landspítalan, for they are tempted to have" new type of virus "written here on land.
Three inlands were detected yesterday and two at the landscape.
One who was found to have taken part in a joint activity on the Rey Cup kidney issue, but the infection was undetected and infected.
Also, fungi was detected in individuals who came to the country on 15 July and are two who were in agreement with him began to show symptoms of COVID - 19.
Then it was found yesterday that was associated with an infection reported from the morning and after an Italian genetic analysis, "a new type of virus that has not been reported here before."
Smiths are closed in connection with the smiths.
It is considered that it is not a new virus, but it is the same virus and has spread throughout the home, i.e. the new coronary virus SARS-CoV-2.
It is more right to talk about a new degradation of their virus rather than about a new type of virus.
Asking what it means and whether it could say something to make other road age is started says Már that as if it is a random case of discussion and it could go so that nothing more will get out of it.
"But if it comes up to cases of domestic which are not connected with Erlendis from and are with the same inheritance and this intentional defeat then would be able to withdraw the commitment [of later agitation] but it is untimely to so supported," explains Már.
The Lord of the Hot Carton
Is the secret that the Icelandic people are hiding in hot pots?
The BBC's journals lead to a similar image in a fun video that warns light on the dizziness and the name pharmacy of the country.
The Icelandic bathtub is special in the world and it is complete that there are no similar bathtubs in the world.
The natural terrain is under it, but also it has been for the disintegration of the kingdom here.
In 1940, the children were under law, but older citizens are not able to use the name of the water as a whole subbot.
Sundries are described as a fixed part of the country's general welfare.
In the pots, everyone is equal, independent and stable.
When people talk to the mobile phone in personal nights about the home, and keep or enjoy the like of the water: the thoughts and loads of the souls and bodies.
Shortly to pick up 100 days in choices
Hundreds of days are there until the Americans go to the election and choose the president for four years.
Donald Trump is looking for a redrive, but he's got the fire to pick up.
Joe Biden, the pretentious demo-crat plant, has a lot of advances on Trump on the country's territory, has been taken from the viewing officers.
According to the recent AP news, the number of Americans in the United States can be estimated to be in the wrong way.
Trump's response to the world's new coronary virus is also very unfriendly and, in addition, more Americans count than before the president has been in a bad state of substance.
Now, just two out of every ten American people say the United States is on the right track.
32 percent say that Trump supports the response due to the age of father and 48 percent say that he has kept good on the subject.
In March it was 56% and in January it was 67%.
According to the mean FiveThirtyEight, Biden is 49.9 per cent on the country but Trump 41.9 per cent.
Trump himself has tried to move the attention from his progress towards Biden, to push under a sophisticated division and to offer a strategy to turn to law and rule.
Framboð Biden, although much capture to keep an eye on Trump and count a lot of likelihood of winning out of shots if the choice is really about how Trump has been working in the last four years.
Unfriendly Trump also seems to be going down to the Princesses of the Republic Block and fears Frammámenar that Democrat might even reach a major part of the United States General Division, which has been here for a very high level.
Politico said that in the days, keeping the group and the provider consistent, and that is now the Republican bloc would sound the most hesitant for years.
Output has been particularly poor in the 2016 benchmarks and it is now likely that this trend will continue.
Trump has been trying in the past days to frighten the inhabitants to follow, among other things by saying that Biden's president is going to be the president, he will ruin the United States's exerts and squeeze under the sexual divisions.
In other words, Trump has fallen down from the time of Barack Obama in the White House, which was intended to increase the number of excrets.
Then he used to "house members" the United States to read the story of the former assistant director of New York, where she thought that Biden would destroy the U.S. exhibitions and took Trump under it.
"The Biden will ruin your lives and the American dreams.
I will keep it, and even do it even better! "said the president.
The inhabitants of the United States of America are a seemingly growing group of cucumbers.
According to the NPR, they're about half of all ferrets in the United States.
Since George W. Bush was re-run in 2004, the predecessor who has received most of the endorsement of this group has become president.
Except in 2012, when Min Romney got more features from this group than lost for Barack Obama.
The review reports have shown that, despite Trump securing its nauman major parts in the outdoors of 2016, his follow-up has been greatly tightened up.
Although it is different between the patients, Biden has been estimated to be about fifteen percent advance of Trump in the excretion to the excretion.

Will the Olyphin cellar be lit at the end of the walk?
After the final decision had been taken to relieve the Olymophilism, which had only been achieved by the world's leaders, the president of the Olymophilism said that the Olymophilism would be "the light at the end of the course," and promptly posted it in the world's ancient coronary virus that the world is now fitting through in a unification.
Aphromics have years in place to prepare themselves and to increase the cost of delays in Japan.
Everyone still has a lot of time in the house.
When it was reported that Tochyo in Japan was a lack of olymophilia this year, the Japanese representatives were celebrated.
They cried and listened to the ship, the end of Tokýó had been looking for to keep the games in 2016 but according to it changed in the lower hold for Rio in Brazil.
In this exchange, Tochyos and Japan would be bathing in the attention of the world.
The players should go ahead on July 24th to July 9th, but have been expired for years and start it instead of July 23rd 2021 and end on July 8th.
If it is not possible to keep the games then, if the coronary virus still gets too much fear, the games will be stopped.
No one wants to think about it at all.
Olymophilism is not a normal anti-inflammatory competition.
There is nothing to save, the view of always being great and searching to top the last game.
Select the city for Inlymphobics based on the food selected on the presentation of the bands.
The greater the presentation - the more likely to sound the knee.
Tochyo was 150 million dollars to try to keep the Olympic Games in 2016 or to withstand 20 million crowns.
In the later round, when the 20th Games were held, 75 million dollars, around 10 million krones, were placed in the presentation.
In 2013, when it was decided that Tókýó was given the games this year, the Japanese authorities had the same power as 30 million kroner for the project.
But the increase is only a drop in the ocean in terms of what it costs to build the Olymophilia village, playful and general to strengthen the country's influence to advise on such contradictions, prepare it and keep the games themselves.
Japan's officers have said that the Olympics in Tochyo, which should have been in the course of these days but have been postponed for one year because of the coronary virus, would have cost 12.6 billion dollars.
In the report by the Japanese government reviewer, which came out at the end of the last year, it was found that the cost was almost twice as high as the cost.
It is likely that the cost of postponing games cannot be adequately measured, but it is planned to cost between two and six billion dollars in addition to the initial cost.
The total cost of the Japanese Olymophilia and Japanese taxpayers could therefore run between 15 and 30 million dollars.
It is so high that all the taxpayer of the Icelandic government died only for a reasonable half of the Olympics, with the lowest possible cost.
There are inlymphobics of their size that they have become the subject of transformation, which is trying to figure out the numbers and see the benefits and benefits of the games.
In which case, quite a number of people seem to have found that the impact of the Olympithelians is later than that positive to the substance of their cities that hold them.
The dose-time effect is some, for example, a large number of jobs at a very high dose time, but for a longer period, the cities are sitting up with the debt and unusual recovery costs of low human activity.
Rio in Brazil is sitting upstairs with serious debts due to the games in 2016 and has been in difficulty with costing all the large athletes built for the games.
It has been shown in figures after the games in London in 2012, but there has been evidence that only 10 percent of those who received work related to the Olympics in the city were unsuccessful before.
It means that it wasn't about discussing new jobs except a little bit.
Generally, borrowers have not been particularly well off the financial imbalances due to the corresponding cost of the human activity that is built for the games.
However, the benefit is considered to be hidden in the increase in the route of the travellers who want to visit the Olymophical cities in the rivers of the game, which is, however, very uncertain about the games in 2021.
It is also uncertain whether all the spectators who are usually looking for the games must be taken.
The great thing, though, is the honour that the cities must be ruled, but he is difficult to judge.
Because despite the great cost they can also say that the joy to which the players move is not that it is usually possible to put on it valuation.
But even though the view is important and there is no saving, this is obviously not just about money.
It's the sports heroes that are in the forefront.
For some people, it's unsurprising just to postpone the games.
The Austrian five-year-old woman and the golden winner in his report on the last Olympics, Chloe Esposito, is, for example, casolate and would have been far from good old in summer but islands expect to be in competition for the 2021 games.
She is among the athletes who are only more pleased with the liberty, for distinctive reasons.
For those athletes who intended to cease after the games this year, they would have been held in the right time, means the temptation of the game in some cases that they cease the competition before the games have taken place.
Its body simply does not trust to go through years in addition to the strands of exercises.
Few athletes were equally experienced in the hearts of the Olympics in Rio 2016 and Simone Biles's fighter.
She came home with four gold around her neck and one bronze.
Biles has made some interviews at home in the United States to discuss the Olympics.
She's going to play in 2021, but she's not sure she can still be at the top of the games next year, she'll end up being 24 years old.
Although it is not generally considered hair age, it is higher for the feminine in the first row.
"This is appropriate target," says Biles but breaks out in another interview that was displayed on the Instagram side of the Olyphite substance asking whether she is going to get even to the game 2021 and she did in Rio 2016.
"I honestly don't know if I'm still at the top after a whole year in addition to the exercises," says Biles.
She's been talking about her body being unable to tolerate the trauma that accomplishes a lot of training for a long time.
Nothing later she's practicing for the Olymophilia 2021.
Biles acknowledges that there has been an unpleasant feeling of having to sudden stop exercising when the world age was high and the fibrications were closed.
There were no exceptions more to Biles than others during the seven weeks of closure of all anti-inflammatory agents.
All her Unlymphoid couldn't buy any access around the others, she needed to find several ways to keep in shape like others.
Definitely better than in most people.
"We have a steply plan now.
It was hard to start rehearsing first after opening the fiddle room.
We started slowly, but we've got a full move to new and I'm going to add to the exercises as much as I'm going to be after what's going on in the year.
Of course, we don't know exactly how these games are being held or whether they are held but we still practice because they are, we can't do anything else.
"I have put too much on me to abandon the sport now," says Biles.
With her like and more blonde subjects or perhaps more conscious that this situation can come up with the games will not be held in 2021 either.
Well, I'm sure it's hopeless.
No one can know how the location of the world-old coronary virus is going to be in July 2021 and nothing else to do but prepare for the Olympic as they are held for a year.
Maybe the Olymophilizer will be lit at the end of the Covid gans.
postponed wedding due to age
Mother Family actress Sarah Hyland has decided to postpone her wedding because of the coronary virus.
She was supposed to marry the former Bachelorette competition Wells Adams this summer.
"I think there are other important things to think about acidity now," said the actress in conversation with People.
"We really want to get married sometime and have the dream buyout and have all our friends.
But we decided to hit it and confine ourselves to what is important now and it is helping to share information about the importance of being with grams and keeping themselves at home.
I'm looking more at home than the wedding stuff these days.
There's a lot going on, and we have to pay attention to what is happening in the world. "
