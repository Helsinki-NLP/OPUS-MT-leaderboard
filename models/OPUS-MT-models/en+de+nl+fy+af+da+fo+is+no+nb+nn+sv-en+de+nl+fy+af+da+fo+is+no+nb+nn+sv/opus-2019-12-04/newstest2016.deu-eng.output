Obama receives Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not exactly friendly.
They wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and about Tehran's destabilising measures in the Middle East.
But the meeting is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two-state solution discussed.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been tense for years.
Washington criticizes Israel's continuing settlement and prevents Netanyahu's lack of willingness in the peace process.
Obama's agreement on the Iranian nuclear programme has further deteriorated the relationship between the two.
In March, at the invitation of the Republicans, Netanyahu held a controversial speech before the US Congress, which was partly considered to be an insult against Obama.
The speech had not been agreed with Obama; a meeting had rejected this with reference to the elections in Israel that were due at that time.
In an emergency call Professor confesses to have shot his girlfriend
In an emergency call, Professor Shannon Lamb told the police with a slightly silent voice that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house.
Lamb was important to emphasise that his "sweet dog" was still alive and probably excited, and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone.
Within the house, officials found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note that was crushed on a white block: "I'm so sorry, I wanted to reverse it, I loved Amy and she was the only woman who ever loved me." According to the authorities in the letter, this was written by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who taught two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 300 miles to the school site where he, according to the police, shot and killed a popular history professor, Ethan Schmidt, at the door to his office.
Delta State University Chief Lynn Buford said that university staff heard the shooting at 10: 18.
He said Lamb made the hanging emergency call sometime later.
Until the end of the day there was another death: Lamb took life when the police embodied him.
One day after the shooting at the university, students and lecturers forced themselves to hide behind closed doors, the authorities are still trying to get a picture of what Lamb motivated.
The details published by the investigators at both ends of the state, as well as what students and employees who knew him said, helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher.
Students said they were looking forward to his class.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or a criminal history.
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him, in which he mentioned the "wonderful people" with which he shared his academic life.
Both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, whose teachers comprise 17 members, and many students attended courses of both.
At the same time, there were some tendencies to problematic behaviour.
A student, Brandon Beavers, who praised Lamb, said that he also seemed a little excited and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamm told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014-15.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for a leave for health reasons and said that he had some health problem.
This year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in university employment policy meant that the promotion, for which Lamb had worked so hard, would not guarantee for him an automatic way to recruit as an assistant professor.
University President William LaForge said he didn't know about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr. Lamb's imagination."
These are questions that Lamb can no longer answer.
After escaping from the campus, the police later found Lamb's trail when he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a .38 caliber gun in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parents' house on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, said Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson.
His car was still running in the entrance.
It wasn't immediately clear why Lamm went to this house, but Johnson said she believed he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb began his work at the university in 2009, which has 3,500 students in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedagogy.
He graduated in pedagogy in the spring.
One of the long-standing friends Lambs called him intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamm was 20 when they met through common friends.
She and her friends were at high school, and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her the guitar game for a few years.
He was the woman's swarm at the time.
All girls melted there when he was there, "said Hairston, now 40 and living in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously together for some time.
In the emergency call Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there was no certificate of marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in the backstone house that is adjacent to a bayou in Gautier.
The police said the dog was fine.
The ex-husband of Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, said they were divorced 15 years ago, but friends had stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old.
"She was completely destroyed on the ground," said O'Steen about his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said he never met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both appeared on a summer-year market three years ago.
Later, they played the one or other gigs together.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked online for various companies.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a weak lit bar near Gautier, said that he saw Lamb and Prentiss Night at night 5 September for the last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and mouth harmonics game in front of a sparkling audience.
There was no sign that something was wrong.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were cleaning up and joking with each other.
I mean, they both had a good sense of joke.
Schmidt, the dead professor, led the first semester seminar program and specialized in American native people and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was President of his Brotherhood and Student Committee.
On Tuesday evening, at the Delta State Campus in Cleveland, about 900 people, including teachers, employees, students and members of the community participated in a candle light memorial.
Schmidt's wife Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the Male Guard while singing "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
The class will be resumed on Wednesday.
"We are trying to get our students back," said LaForge.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press Authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story was corrected to reflect that the police now say that Lamb made the emergency call after he had shot Schmidt, and that Lamm in his emergency call called Prentiss as his wife, but there is no indication that the two have ever married.
Toys R Us plans to recruit fewer workers for Christmas time
Toys R Us says that there will not be as many Christmas season employees as last year, but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give the current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company said it was planning to recruit 40,000 people in shops and sales centers throughout the country. In the Christmas season 2014, there were still 45,000 employees employed.
Most jobs will be part-time jobs.
The company said that this month it will start applying talks and the number of employees will rise from October to December.
While the holidays themselves are still months away, the Christmas business is getting closer, and companies are preparing to recruit temporary workers to provide shops with employees who sell, dispatch and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his "date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a great moment for Michael J. Fox.
She was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theater waiting for the Royals, and I notice that the seat is empty next to me, and it is becoming clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me," he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary film "Back in Time."
The film begins, and it makes sense that I'm a simulated goose and a arm length away from being with the Princess of Wales on a date.
Back in Time, a documentary about Back to the Future, presents interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back for the Future" had premiere 30 years ago.
"It's really for me," Spielberg said, "undeniably the biggest time trip film ever played."
"Back in Time" will be seen on VOD, DVD and in selected cinemas in October.
UN Chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon says that his response to Russia's enhanced military support for Syria is: "There is no military solution" of the almost five years of conflict, and more weapons will only exacerbate violence and misery for millions of people.
The UN Head reiterates its call on all parties, including the shared UN Security Council, to unite and to support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Mr Ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent members of the Council - the United States, Russia, China, Great Britain and France - at the edge of the General Assembly ministerial meeting this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and regional forces "make this situation unsolvable."
Ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity as they have shown in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran in tackling the crisis in Syria.
8 survey values that show Donald Trump to be taken seriously.
Some have tried to brand him as a flop.
Others took him away from a joke.
And some are waiting for a collapse.
But no matter how some Republicans try to pull Donald Trump from the top ranks in surveys, it hasn't worked (yet).
Ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Trump leading in the two-digit area, and some are starting to seriously wonder what it means for the chances of nominating the real estate moguls.
Of course, it is still too early in the parliamentary term.
No one claims that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts emphasise that at that time Rick Perry's leadership was given to the rising Herman Cain, none of which won only one state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he had to fight in a general choice.
But outsider groups such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the Conservative Economic Group Club for Growth now recognize Trump's perseverance and start to let their dollars flow to crash him.
Here are some current survey values that suggest that the real estate mogul is not just a temporary phase:
Trump's population values have turned around 180 degrees.
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidate in mid-June, a survey from Monmouth University showed that only two out of ten Republicans saw the real estate mogul positive.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Now six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they have a negative opinion.
And these numbers are in early states.
A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans have a good opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as candidates.
In a survey by CNN / ORC last week 67 percent of Republicans said they were either "enthusiastic" or "satisfied" if Trump were nominated.
Only two out of ten say they'd be "angry" if he were the candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates about the same enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would be "enthusiastic" versus 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
The next one on enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of the Republican voters say that they would be "unhappy" or "angry" if Jeb Bush, the favourite of the establishment, would be the candidate.
A majority of Republicans don't see Trump's temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticized for his bombastic and insulting statements, 52 percent of Irish voters who tend to the Republicans believe that the real estate mogul has the right temperament for a president, according to ABC News / Washington Post on Monday.
The same number applies in the first presidential state of the nation, the state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of the Republicans think he has the personality for a chief commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Nevertheless, 44 percent think that he doesn't have the personality to effectively perform his post, and almost six out of 10 independent people say that his temperament does not fit into the White House, so ABC / Post.
Republican voters get used to the idea.
When they put their scholars on, Republican voters think Trump is real.
If they are asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, after a survey by CNN / ORC from last week, four out of ten say that Trump is the best bet.
This is a change since 4 out of 10 at the end of July put their money on Jeb Bush.
Complete disclosure: GOP voters did not have the clearest crystal ball in the past.
At that time in the last cycle, four out of ten Republicans thought Rick Perry would win the nomination against only 28% for the final candidate Mitt Romney.
Nevertheless, it appears that a variety of GOP voters consider Trump's campaign to be plausible.
Even if the Republicans gathered for another candidate, Trump is still beating everyone.
Some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Trump's leadership, while anti-trump support is disseminated to more than a dozen other candidates.
But a survey from Monmouth University at the beginning of September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump harvests majority support.
He has 13 points ahead of Carly Fiorina, 14 points before Marco Rubio, 15 points before Walker, 19 points before Jeb Bush and finally before Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie 33 points.
It's a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to hit him?
Ben Carson would overtake the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head race.
A small majority of Donald Trump fans say they have formed their opinion.
A new survey by CBS / NYT on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the voters who support Trump say that they have forgiven their voices firmly.
Of course, much can happen to change that, and no one can really say never change the opinion.
46 percent said they left the door open to change to other candidates.
Nevertheless, Trump's strongest competition at the moment is the other outsider, the neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say that they have formed their opinion are twice as common for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico in his election campaign two months ago "rapist," immigration was a turning and playing point in public discourse in 2016.
Some are concerned that the bombastic expressions of Trump's decisive Hispano Americans will keep away from the Republican Party and will damage the reorientation efforts.
But after the new ABC / Post survey of Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as immigration remains in the ramp light, Donald Trump seems to do so.
The frustration of the government climbs to new levels.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now have about half of the support of Republican voters, especially through their external status.
Six out of 10 Republicans say in the new Monday survey by ABC / Post, they prefer a political outsider than someone with government experience.
And they're angry with Washington, too.
A survey by Des Moines Register / Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated by the Republicans in the Congress, with 54 percent "unhappy" and 21 percent "totally angry."
Munich, Sylt and Co.: The five most exclusive residential areas of Germany
Here in the Hobookenweg is the most expensive residential area - overlooking the North Sea Watt.
In the street, a square meter of a horse roof house costs an average of 73,300 euros.
"On Sylt, the offer of objects is naturally limited," says the study - therefore the high price.
A new study shows in which special layers a square meter costs the most.
Of course, 18,70 euros per square meter for a student shop in Munich are not really little.
In contrast to Germany's top residences, one of the prizes is like peanuts.
The real estate service provider angel & Völkers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square metre prices in dizzy heights.
There are several tens of thousands of euros nix - per square meter, well noticed.
But well, who can afford it...
By the way, Munich is not, exceptionally, at the top here.
Champions League: Bavarian dream start thanks to Müller and Götze
Double-shot piraeus: Bayern-Star Thomas Müller has just a run.
A happy hit by Thomas Müller banished FC Bayern the way to a deserved 3: 0 at Olympiakos Piräus - then it ran.
A supreme start of the Champions League season.
The world champions Thomas Müller and Mario Götze have given Bavaria a dream start to the "Mission Milan."
The team of Coach Pep Guardiola won their play at the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympiakos in hot atmosphere thanks to Müller's double pack (52nd / 90th + 2) and Götzes's hit (89th) earns with 3: 0 (0: 0).
The twelfth success in the series is supposed to be the first step towards finals on 28 May 2016 in Italy, where Guardiola is finally trying to get the Henkelpott to Munich in the third run.
With his 28th hit in the Champions League, Müller received good help from Olympiakos-Torwart Roberto, who made a flank shot of the world champion.
"We will not underestimate them," Bavarian captain Philipp Lahm had promised before the game in the Karaiskakis stadium before 31.688 hot-blooded fans - and the Munich people kept their word.
They showed a concentrated and committed idea, without shining.
Piräus had won his recent six home games in the king's class, including against nameless clubs such as Manchester United, Atlético Madrid or Juventus Turin.
In 2011, Borussia Dortmund (1: 3) also stumbled here.
But the Bavarians, undefeated in seven Europacup duals with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
They responded courageously, but often too infinite in their offensive efforts to work.
The attacks were commenced too often by relocation to the left side of Douglas Costa, which rarely passed against the former Braunschweiger Omar Elabdellaoui.
Müller was more lucky from the right than his flank from the right half-field in the left upper toreck.
In the 67th minute the world champion gave up the possible 2: 0.
The best opportunities in half one had Robert Lewandowski.
First, when Olympiakos-Sturmer Ideye Brown beat Poland's headball off the line (26).
Then by direct deduction, the Torwart Roberto parted with the knee (35.).
Although the Bavaria used to raise their dominant game, Piräus could set needle stitches.
But Manuel Neuer was abandoned on Torhüter Manuel Neuer.
Like when he led a shot of ideas over the latte (56.).
Before New, Guardiola had a four-chain with David Alaba in the center next to Jerome Boateng, who made it good.
Mario Götze, after muscular problems back in the box, sat first outside.
The WM hero had only given green light after the finishing training, said the sports board Matthias Sammer at "Sky": "Whoever wants to do something else from it is already evil."
In the first change, Guardiola also decided against him when he brought Kingsley Coman for the hit Lewandowski (59.).
Götze came late for Arturo Vidal (76.) and made everything clear 13 minutes later, by eleven meters Muller put one on it.
Before the game it had come to crawls in the stadium.
After a smaller group of partially ruined Bavaria fans in their audience block had apparently provoked the followers of host Piraeus with words and gestures, the security forces attacked and went against the Munich followers with punches.
At least one Bavarian fan was transported injured from the stadium.
Whoever smokes has a higher risk of losing teeth
Those who smoke do not only harm the lung, but also the teeth - this suggests a potsdamer long-term study.
The good news: if you fail, the risk drops fast.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This is reflected in the long-term study of an international research team, including several employees of the German Institute for Food Research (DIfE) in Potsdam.
Compared to non-smokers, there was a risk of losing their teeth prematurely at 2.5 to 3.6 times higher in smokers.
The scientists had observed more than 23.300 participants.
The main causes of dental failure are caries and inflammation of dental meat, the DIfE emphasises.
For this parodontitis smoking is a risk factor, the authors emphasise.
The relationship between smoking and dental loss is therefore due to more frequent teeth-meat inflammation in smokers.
It is not clear to what extent smoking also increases the risk for karies.
People who stopped smoking could, however, reduce their risk within a short time, write the researchers in the Journal of Dental Research.
However, it could take more than ten years to reduce the risk to the level of non-smokers, first author Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham said.
One had to convince people to become non-smokers, Student Director Heiner Boeing from DIfE said: "Smoking shuts life."
Not smoking is good for lung and vessels and leads, according to our findings, to good dental health to high age.
In Germany, more than 20 per cent of the population aged 65 to 74 is affected by toothlessness, the DIfE informed.
Previous studies had already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early dental failure.
The new long-term study supports the findings.
Archaeologists hit Cologne Rheinofer on remains from the late antique
For the repeated time, archaeological findings were made on the right Rhine oever in Cologne.
Near the construction site for the new Rheinboulevard archaeologists of the Roman Germanic Museum have excavated skeleton and remains of historical buildings, said Museummanager Marcus Trier on Tuesday.
Since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine, historians have been looking for so-called ground monuments.
In all construction projects in the district of Cologne, the museum is always attracted as a specialist office for archaeological soil mining.
In the third section of the Rheinboulevard, the archaeologists now became fiery.
From text documents it had already been known that a fortress was in place in the 4th century and a church in the 8th century, trier explained.
In addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower, a cemetery with about 350 tombs had also been discovered, which probably belonged to the church.
Young woman covered by freight train
After a young woman is injured at the station in Geilenkirchen-Lindern, the federal police are asking the population for help.
On the early Wednesday morning at 1.40 a.m., the woman crossed the track from the railway station building at the end of the train and was captured by a freight train that came from the direction of Mönchengladbach.
According to the federal police, by recording the train, she has suffered the most serious injuries.
She was treated on site as an emergency doctor and brought to a hospital by rescue personnel.
The reason for the nightly crossing of the young woman is not known to the investigating officials.
The incident may have been observed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic perceptions.
Requests are made by residents or passengers of Linderner Railway, brick beachway, Thomashofstraße and Leiffarther Straße (L364).
Information on the cause of the accident can be provided on the Federal Police 's telephone 0800 / 6888000 or any other police department under 24 hours and free of charge.
EU Commission proposes new court in dispute on TTIP
In order to resolve the dispute about the planned Transatlantic Free Trade Agreement TTIP, the EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbitration system.
The controversial private settlement facilities for disputes between companies and states are therefore to be resolved by a more transparent system which corresponds to much more traditional courts in its functioning.
"We want to set up a system that citizens trust," said Commissioner Cecilia Malmström in the presentation.
The Swedish Government intends to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the United States.
The German government announced support.
TTIP aims to create the world's largest free trade zone with 800 million people.
The plans for reforming the current arbitration procedures provide for the EU States and the US to choose independent judges for a new Investment Court.
They are to come from the same parts of the EU, the USA and third countries.
For the first time a second instance is planned.
It would allow an objection to judgments.
The parties to the proceedings have so far agreed on arbitrators and there was no possibility of objecting to their judgments.
In the debate over the past few months, it was clear that citizens did not trust the old ISDS system in terms of fairness and justice, Malmström commented.
In the long term, according to its own information, it wants to work towards an international investment court.
For example, there could also be settled disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries.
Investor State Arbitration Procedures (ISDS) are considered to be one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe to TTIP.
The traditional arbitration courts are criticized by opponents as a kind of parallel justice through which companies can cover damages to taxpayers, eradicate national laws or enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards.
In the first opinions, anti-TTIP organisations such as Campact identified the Commission's proposals as insufficient.
In particular, it was criticised that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada (Ceta).
The German Secretary of State for Economic Affairs Matthias Machnig (SPD), on the other hand, described the plans as a major step forward.
The Commission took into account key points in the reform that Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Sigmar Gabriel had drawn up in spring with other EU trade ministers.
The old system of private arbitration was off the table.
The French Government also welcomed the plans of Malmström.
The European Business Association BusinessEurope warned that too many new rules would limit the ability of the economy to complain.
In particular, small and medium-sized enterprises could be disadvantaged.
When the talks on the TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) could be concluded, it remained unclear on Wednesday.
Negotiations have been under way since mid-2013.
However, the issue of investor protection has not been discussed with the US so far.
Originally, a framework for the agreement should be set at the end of this year.
This date is deemed to be no longer sustainable.
Delicious People of Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
11 years ago Sufjan Stevens sat on stage at the Cologne Prime Club (today: Luxor).
In addition to him there is a flipchart on which the shy folk singers recorded the picturesque state of Michigan with a felt pen.
The entire audience, about 40 people, is almost taken by Stevens's lecture.
He tells from different places that he keeps recording on the map, about which his miniature and delicately arranged songs report.
Where they were created and what it looks like there, in his home.
Since then, Stevens has proven to be a wonderful creative madman.
With the 2003 album "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State," the third album "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State" appears wise composed songs that are harmoniously close to the American people of the late sixties, but can at any time drive into great opulent.
The rumor arises that "Michigan" would be the first part of a rejected series: each of the 50 states should be occupied in succession.
But already in 2004 and in Rheinnähe, "Seven Swans" has already appeared and breaks positive expectations.
Reduced Stevens appears here.
Live is enough for him guitar and banjo.
A year later, the musician living in New York returns to the series.
With "Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come on Feel The Illinoise"), a celebrated championship is published in 2005.
Overbodied ideas and stylistic finesse.
The album increases into the American billboard charts and is not missing in any annual best list of influential music media.
After highly productive experiments Stevens then uses "The Age of Adz" (2010) very extensive electronic parts.
This sixth proper studio album is still broadly orchestrated, but worn by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and Hall.
Along the smaller clubs, the stage shows become a colorful spectacle of neon forebands and large fluorescent stage decoy.
Sufjan Stevens is currently travelling through Germany as part of a five-headed band.
In the dark hamburger more!
He mainly presents the "Carrie & Lowell" available since March.
Although almost 2,000 guests are sitting in their chairs here now, the clearly mature Stevens returns to intimacy and to the people.
Without referring a word to the audience, the group of excellent musicians plays through the broadly enriched album.
From the audience you hear: the lecture is "more opulent" and so you could throw away the "record basically."
First to add thanks to Stevens modest, plays acoustically few older songs and finally bends under tune applause.
Jeremy Corbyn's debut at the Question Time of the Prime Minister
Since his election, Mr Corbyn's debut is expected at the Prime Minister's Question Time with tension
The new Labour President, Jeremy Corbyn, should give his debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time for the first time and deal with David Cameron.
Mr Corbyn will rise to ask the first of his six questions shortly after noon, with his performance probably being examined by the media and the Labour Members from nearby.
He demanded "less theatre and more facts" at this weekly event.
He also said that he could skip some sessions to leave them to colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Corbyn's leadership, because it comes to the Shadow Cabinet after his appointment and after his speech at the TUC anniversary meeting on Tuesday.
In the meantime, the Labour President's decision to hold a memorial ceremony on the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence has provoked criticism of a number of Tory MPs and is at the heart of several title stories in the newspapers.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to sing the national hymn has attracted attention
A spokesman from Mr. Corbyn said he had "stood in respectful silence" and he recognised the "Hero of the Royal Air Force in the Air Battle of England."
But a member of Mr. Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC Two Newsnight program that he advised the Labour Chairman to sing the national hymn "independent" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Corbyn's top team, and they call on differences in economic, defence and foreign policy, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as a leader.
The political correspondent of the BBC Robin Brant says that political differences are also "stapling" within Labour, according to Mr Corbyn's statements on the position on the European Union and the limitation of profits.
Mr Corbyn said to the TUC conference that Labour is proposing amendments to remove the whole idea of a total limitation.
hours later, Mr Smith, the Shadow Labour and Pension Minister said that the party was "very clear" that it was only against the government plans to reduce the limit from £26.000 to £23.000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour President who has been facing David Cameron, since he was the Tory leader, over the dispatch box in Parliament for the last decade.
The Labour President, who promised another policy approach, says that he has "crowd-sourced" ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and has given him more than 30,000 suggestions.
The Islington North MP has said that the Prime Minister's Question Time is too confrontational and that it will not be "punctuality" and the dispute with repercussions, and instead has committed itself to focusing on serious problems such as poverty, inequality and the challenges for young people.
Mr Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the Shadow Minister of Economic Affairs, will represent him if he does not participate - for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad.
He also discussed the idea that other colleagues sometimes take the floor, and that he spoke to John Bercow, the spokesman of the subhouse, to discuss the problem.
When he became a leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said that he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a "Kasperle Theater," which is often linked to the Prime Minister's Question Time, but a few years later he declared that he had failed.
Since it was broadcast first in 1990 on television, Question Time with the Prime Minister was considered as the most important barometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the subhouse and his position among his fellow Members, although critics argued that it had become a caricature and needed far-reaching reforms.
'Shooting in Joburg': Homeless young people trained to photographers
The city center of Johannesburg is a tough place when you're homeless.
But a group of former street children has found a way to learn a skill and thus earn living.
"I what shot in Joburg" (I was shot in Joburg (er-)) is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless young people how to take pictures of their surroundings and gain a profit from it.
BBC News has met one of the first graduates of the project.

Pounds are rising by accelerating wage growth in the United Kingdom
The pound increased springingly according to data indicating an increase in wage growth in the United Kingdom. In parallel, the FTSE 100 was increased by the bid target SABMiller.
Between May and July, the result without bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.9% compared to the same period of the previous year.
This percentage has been the fastest since 2009 and has made estimates of the time of an increase in interest rates.
The pound increased by more than 1% compared to the dollar to $1.5505 and climbed up to 0.84% compared to the euro to €1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed with an increase of 1.49% to 6.229.21.
SABMiller was the outstanding stock on the market and made a jump of 20% after the acquisition offer of the Rival AB InBev.
A transaction would combine the world's two largest breweries and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were 0.9% higher after encouraging news from the Competition Group for luxury goods Richemont.
Richemont's latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Burberry - again indicate growth.
Shares of Glencore increased by 5% after the mining giant said he had taken $2.5 billion through a stock sale as part of his debt reduction strategy.
The shares of the packaging and paper group Mondi were the largest losers on the index, with a decrease of 4.3% after Goldman Sachs had set his assessment for the company "Rating."
JD Sports increased by 3.1% after the sports clothing company reported a pre-tax result of 46.6 million for the half year.
The head of JD Sports says that higher wages jeopardize expansion.
The managing director of JD Sports Peter Cowgill says that a higher minimum wage for UK employees could mean "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers."
But it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labour costs of his company, he says.
The costs could meet the expansion plans of JD Sports, he added, and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs.
Justin Bieber in the capital: On Bieber Expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, Megastar.
Lippy 21 years young, a hanfling with superior frost.
The guy with the platinum blonde hair is 100 million euros heavy.
More than that.
At present, Monsieur Bieber is in Berlin.
And the generation U17 is out of control.
Like Wiktoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old has never heard the name "Ritz Carlton."
It's all right.
Hundreds of fans were with Justin yesterday.
Including Ewa and Viktoria from Poland.
However, since 7: 00 in the morning, the polin has been sitting on the cold stone plates in front of Berlin's luxury hotel at Potsdamer Platz.
The Bieber building: Here you live Idol, whose poster is hanging up in Stettin since Monday night.
The suite in which the Canadian singer lives costs exactly as much as her mother Ewa deserves in half a year.
If at all.
She says, "Actually, my Viktoria should be in the 10th grade in the gymnasium."
"I'm fulfilling her dream."
Obligation to school?
Who's itching?
Not the fans.
Neither does Bieber itself.
He took care of it anyway.
For the advertising time of the Superbowl, he cashed three million, a two-year deal with an anti-pickel company washed a lot, a lot of dollars on the Bieber account.
And with every doll that looks like him and over the ladentist, Bieber also cashes.
If Justin Bieber drinks a coffee, you'll be surprised at the window disc.
He's supposed to have exploited more than 100 million.
Some say the hype went too far.
Others emphasise that Bieber was in the United States and Britain with his new single "What do you mean?" in place 1.
Bieber himself, whose fourth album is to follow in November, is not interested in the many zeros for the first time.
At least he does.
Pegida poster brings Lebanese to potato bean idea
Potatoes or dunes?
It goes both - and it is in the potato beans that the Oldenburger Imbiss owner Hani Alhay has developed.
Inspired by the spell "potatoes instead of dunes" on a poster of the Pegida movement Alhay potatoes and meat put together on a spear.
The idea brought him a poster at a Pegida demonstration with the label "potatoes instead of döners," which he had accidentally seen on television.
Since then, in his shop a barbecue spit is made of meat and potatoes.
"This is multiculti for the stomach," says Alhay.
The idea has been registered by Lebanese to the Patent Office in Munich.
According to the Authority, it has recently been protected as a pattern of use.
So how much meat and how much potatoes the spit contains, Alhay does not want to betray.
Just so much: "It tastes even better together," he finds.
The culinary international understanding is also good for his customers.
Metcash launches soil stability campaign to combat Aldi infarction
Metcash is trying to protect the IGA branches from an Aldi march in South Australia and Western Australia.
Food wholesalers Metcash has launched a ground-standing campaign to defend the market share of the IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a $700 million Aldi invasion.
While Aldi is preparing for the opening of two sales centres and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen their relations with local food suppliers and build the brand IGA through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media, as well as events like Adelaide show.
IGA dealers and suppliers jump on board, with brands like Ice Manufacturer Simmo from Dunsborough, distributing samples in IGA shops and shop owners, selling cheap tickets for South Australian football league to loyal customers.
It is expected that Metcash will publish further details of its defence strategy on September 29 when the wholesaler for food, alcohol and equipment carries out its annual investor strategy day.
There is a lot at stake since South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Metcash's IGA shops and generate higher profit margins than Metcash's IGA network in the eastern states.
Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in the eastern states.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will capture about five percent of the food market in these two countries 12 months after the opening of its first markets and will remove all existing players but mainly independent retailers' sales.
According to a report published this week, the analyst Tom Kierath of Morgan Stanley estimated that IGA retailers could lose $360 million per year and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA next year and earn a turnover of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss in food and food business and in the quantities on Metcash's high fixed cost basis could cost Metcash about $13 million of profits before interest and taxes, said Mr Kierath.
At the same time, Metcash lost market shares in the eastern states, mainly in Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found out that IGA buyers are the most trusted.
Morgan Stanley assumes that Metcash's sales in food and food business will fall by 3.8 per cent in 2016, by 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018 and will decrease the market share from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent by 2020.
Last week, the leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, the founder of the Magellan Financial Group, told a business session in Melbourne that Metcash is likely to disappear within a decade. Metcash will disappear.
Metcash refused to respond publicly to Mr. Douglas's comments.
But it's assumed that a board member of Metcash made contact with Mr. Douglas last week.
IGA's market share has decreased from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and revenues from Metcash's food and food trade, which supplies around 1,200 IGA retailers, have fallen by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting the operational debt reduction at the same time pressure on sales and margins.
However, the wholesaler resists and invests more than $150 million to compare sales prices with Coles and Woolworths in hundreds of products every week and to improve IGA retailers in improving their shops by faster growing fresh food and to provide a better selection of private label food.
Metcash's head manager Ian Morrice says that the price adjustments and loading rehabilitation programmes will be added to Elan and hopes that the wholesaler will return to profit growth for the first time in four years in 2017.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more praise than criticism of his behaviour.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damage" in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios and in the opinion of the President of the Australian tennis association Steve Healy deserves more praise than criticism of his own behaviour.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duos, which is repeatedly referred to as "Special Ks," fell into the spotlight by the notorious struggle of Kyrgios with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a fiery qualification game in Cincinnati soon afterwards, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the arbitrator, and Harrison said, "Wawrinka should have hit Kyrgios, and I should beat the child."
While he was last seen beating a tennis striker after a seizure failed a potential US open victory by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, in competition with Sam Groth for the second place in the single behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semifinals against Britain.
"One thing that I am quite aggravated about is the fact that I think Thanasi has been a little involved in the fight," Healy said.
He broke a butcher when he lost a cramp in the US Open, but he's not the first player to break a butcher of fruit with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know he's not proud of it.
But, really, he acted extremely well in the US Open, even under the pretty provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of credit.
He's got a great team around him, he's got a great family around him, and I think he's been treated a little too hard.
He's a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he fits into the team and so on, he's never had a problem with the other players, he's being respected in the changing area, he's working hard, he's good in shape, he's a very stable and mature young guy, and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own merits.
Healy also supported the decision not to take into account Kyrgios in the important preliminary decision that begins on Friday, and he describes the "joint decision" as the right one for all, but he assures the man from Canberra to return to the team as a long-term solid element. "
"First we wish that the team would be fully focused on competition and not on all the controversy around [Kirgios]," Healy said.
And I believe that Nick has made the rise very quickly, which people like Federer and Murray have pointed out. He rises into the eyes of the public, and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we try to support him, we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions. Some time outside of the ramp light, in which he can only think about it, I think it is appropriate, and it's best for the crew and it's the best for him.
Europe's refugee crisis: Hungary explains emergency, closes the border, keeps refugees back
Hungary declared the emergency and closed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who tried to get illegally into the country. All with the aim of stopping the influx of migrants.
Chaos followed at the border when hundreds of migrants gathered in a native country and Serbian officials replied with remorse.
The people who fled from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a land strip on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there.
But frustrations increased.
When a police helicopter floated over them, migrants scanned "Open the border!" and cried insults against the Hungarian alert police.
Some resigned from protest food and water.
Serbia's Foreign Minister stated that it was "unacceptable" that migrants would be sent back from Hungary while more and more arrive from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution and not a collateral damage.
There must be talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days, "said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The turbulence at the Hungarian-Serbian border could not agree on a common immigration policy one day after the 28-nation block at a dispute meeting in Brussels.
However, the Ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in the overcrowded Italy and Greece, and they expressed their hope that, at the end of next month or by the end of the year, an agreement would be reached that the EU countries would receive another 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary.
Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a European Union special summit on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent.
However, Hungary did not put its hopes on an early action by Brussels or its neighbours.
The emergency in two southern regions called on Tuesday gave authorities more authority to deal with the crisis so that they could block roads and speed up asylum procedures.
The Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that his country was also planning to build a wire line along its border with Romania to stop the influx of migrants through the country - after it has finished a fence at the Serbian border.
CBS News Correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners were used in the race to create the Stachelwire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a major shortage and a starting point for many Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban, however, insisted that most of the arriving economic refugees are looking for a better life and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - an opinion that is strongly contrary to other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws that entered into force at midnight in Hungary make crossing the border or damaging the 4-foot (13 feet) high tones, which the government built along the southern border with Serbia, a crime. These laws also impose higher penalties for convicted traffickers.
"Due to the situation created by mass migration, the Hungarian Government explains the emergency status," said Prime Minister Zoltan Kovacs reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We say it very clearly: illegal border crossing is a crime.
Parliament still has to agree on the use of the military, which is expected next week, but reporters of Associated Press have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on the border for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, country security consultant for Orban, said that authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border, 15 others had already penetrated the country deeper.
They come over by damaging the fence, they are now in police custody and are accused of committing offences according to the new laws.
Authorities are about to fix the fence quickly.
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning, after a train wagon had arrived with wire to close the borders.
Chaos surrounded the most important border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process human data and press a crowd to penetrate into it.
About 20 managed to get in, but thousands stayed outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the most important motorway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they could enter Hungary.
Choice-2016: Hillary Clinton's advance in front of Bernie Sanders in national survey halved
The former US Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton continues to hold a two-digit leap in the democratic race to nominate at national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins to the ground against her.
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of the democratic voters in the preelection (58 percent before), while Sanders is in second place, with 27 percent (17 percent increase).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he has applied for the presidential office, receives support from 15 percent of the democratic voters of the presidential elections.
More than five months before the start of the preelection, most democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion is determined which candidates they will support.
But Clinton's supporters are more stable in their choices than those of the other candidates.
Since the CBS news survey, Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups, while Sanders has achieved some profits.
Clinton holds a big leap in women and skilled men, but these leap has decreased.
Your support for men has dropped significantly, and Sanders is only 5 points behind here.
Clinton's advantage in democratic voters under the age of 50 has been cursed, and they and Sanders are now at the same level.
However, Clinton still has a major leap forward among the older voters.
Last month, Clinton was in front of Sanders with a double leap in front of the Liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point leap in this group.
About half of the democratic voters of the presidential elections say that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm if she were nominated by the party.
A quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would support them only because she is the candidate.
Six percent would not support them.
Perhaps not surprising that Clinton's current supporters are particularly enthusiastic about her.
The views are more mixed with those who do not currently support Clinton - only about a quarter would support them enthusiastically.
While 48 percent of the democratic voters say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm, less Republican voters say this about their top candidates Donald Trump (35 percent).
If Clinton's supporters are asked in an open question why they want her to be the candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the opinion that it is time for a woman to become president (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton's supporters also mention their connection to Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Consent to dealing with the problems and electability is also quoted.
Since the Vice-President throws a potential for the presidential office into the wayscale, 57 percent of the democratic voters of the presidential elections want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not.
If democratic voters of the preelection are asked who would be their second choice for the party, Biden is at the forefront.
From Clinton's followers more than half say that Biden would be her second choice far from Sanders.
If Biden decides not to nominate the Democrats, Hillary Clinton's leadership in front of Sanders increases from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race.
Fifty-five percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election, but this number has decreased by 78 percent last month.
Biden is a second in this measurement at a distance, but the percentage that sees it as the "most selectable" has increased.
Nevertheless, in the question of what is more important for a candidate, democratic voters call questions about electability.
Like last month, no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these preelection voters is unacceptable.
The democratic candidates or potential candidates produce good results on some important features in voters of their party's preelection.
Majorities consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong leadership quality.
Biden is best cut off with honesty among the three candidates, while Clinton's strength is the lead.
Thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say that about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent have no opinion of him.
Democratic voters of the preelection generally also see Clinton, Sanders and Biden ideologically in line with their views.
In all these measurements, about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
Since questions about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal e-mail address and a server continue to be asked during the term of office as Minister of Foreign Affairs, most democratic electorates are satisfied with their statement of the matter and say that it has not influenced their views overall.
But it's another story in the American public as a whole.
Half the Americans are now unhappy with their statement, while only about one third is satisfied.
The public opinion was divided in March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans said that the e-mail controversy had no effect on Clinton's general opinions, although 36 percent said that their opinion of her has worsened.
They are mainly Republicans, more than six out of ten who say that their views of Clinton have become worse.
Although Clinton is considered honest and trustworthy by the voters of its party, this is still a problem for them among registered voters as a whole: only 32 percent see them as honest and trustworthy, eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May.
62 percent of the voters do not think they are an honest and trustworthy person.
At the same time, 55 percent of the voters across the country also consider Trump to be unhonest and untrustworthy.
Clinton and Trump, however, receive good notes on leadership.
Biden, Carson and Bush are best cut off from the six candidates tested by honesty.
A majority sees Sanders rather than honest, but as with Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The error rate for the sample of 351 democratic voters in the preelection is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson comes close to Donald Trump in the country survey
Ben Carson is located at the latest survey of CBS News / New York Times close behind Donald Trump
The two candidates now have half of the voters' support in the new survey, and others are losing dramatically
Republican voters continue to support Trump in a large number of countries. Support increases from 23% in the last CBS survey conducted before Fox News debate last month by 27% in the Tuesday survey.
But Carson shot from 6% to 23% during the same period.
The survey also showed that Carson is good in demographic groups and exceeds Trump among Republican voters with higher education.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, has been defeated with Wisconsin's Governor Scott Walker, who fell deepest, from 10% support last month to now 2%.
The former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are at the third place with 6%.
The error margin for the sample of 376 people from Republican voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6% and was carried out in September.
The latest CNN / ORC survey published last week shows that Carson increases in the surveys - he lands at 19% support with the Republicans, behind the Trump with 32% support.
The latest survey by ABC News / Washington Post also showed Trump clearly before Carson.
With a view to a Carson rising up last week, Trump found some side hives for the former neurosurgeon even after Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," said Trump last Saturday during a campaign show in Iowa.
Pleasant bathing temperatures: The eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm.
Even if peak values are measured only in the distance, for bathing vacancies a trip to the Mediterranean is enough to find still warm water.
A bath in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees.
Some people are no longer going into the sea: maximum 18 degrees have the water in the North and Baltic Sea this week, the German Weather Service (DWD) communicates.
On the other hand, bathing temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean Sea: in the east it reaches up to 29 degrees.
In the Adriatic it is at the top 25 degrees, in France 23 degrees.
The Red Sea in Egypt arrives at 28 degrees.
Five members of the Brotherhood with the death of a Baruch College-Neuulings
Almost two years after a student died during a horrible ritual of a student association in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, the murder charges against five people are filed.
The New York Baruch College Pi-Delta-Psi Brotherhood attacked Chun "Michael" Deng brutally during a introduction ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital, which contributed to his death, informed the police.
Officials said that he was charged with a 30-pound backpack full of sand and was repeatedly attacked while he tried to go through a frozen field to a target.
Mr. Deng finally complained about headaches, then he fell unconscious.
The members of the Pi-Delta-Psi-Brotherhood did not call 911 after Deng had failed and they allegedly waited an hour before bringing him to a hospital, so the police said.
However, you had time to change Deng's clothes, to google his symptoms and to contact Andy Meng, the national president of the Brotherhood to seek advice, said Chief Chris Wagner at a press conference.
"At this point the members began to hide utensils and put the well of the brotherhood in principle about Michael Deng," said Chief of Police Wagner.
He couldn't be revived, and he died the next morning of his injuries.
According to an autopsy report, Deng was repeated with stumpy force injuries to head, butt and thighs.
"Too many families have been destroyed by the harassment of the Brotherhood. At least one student has died every year since 1970," said Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, in a statement.
Brotherships and their members must be accounted for, and this step of authorities is very important.
A county Grand Jury of Monroe recommended a charge for murder third grade for the first five members.
Thirty-two members of the Brotherhood, including Mr Meng, are also accused of harassment and the formation of a criminal association.
"We do not just want to make the people involved responsible, but if there is an organization that - officially or unofficially - has punished this, we will also take them to account," said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College has forbidden the brotherhood and the national brotherhood has withdrawn its membership of the local group.
This will happen when the Fed increases interest
A rise in interest will come, and the house will get in the wander, returns for bonds will rise, and the economy will slide into a recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long this will take and how long it will last.
In particular, history provides little guidance to the economy about the process.
A recession occurred within only 11 months of the first interest rate increase and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often, if not always, a factor in how the economy and financial assets react.
Therefore, representatives of the US Central Bank have stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on when it begins to increase interest rates, but rather on the period needed for normalisation.
In fact, several variables play a role.
In the end, however, market participants could conclude that the entire excitement could have been exaggerated due to a rise in interest.
"The first increase of the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of" cheap money "," said Julian Jessop, Chefökonom at Capital Economics, in a communication to customers.
On the other hand, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal heights, but still at too low a level to lead to seismic shock, which many seem to fear.
However, this does not mean that there will be no impact.
Here is a view based on historical trends on how some sectors of the economy could respond:
As the market saw last month, anticipation of interest increases can make things volatile for a while.
As soon as the increase occurs, the influence is not so dramatic.
"There seems to be a tendency that income from assets is thrown down 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which may reflect the delay in monetary policy," said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happens after the Fed's interest increases.
More specifically, in the past 35 years, the market is mostly in upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to interest increase, fairly flat in the 250 days afterwards (average profit of 2.6 percent), then back to normal state after 500 days, with an average yield in the last six previous cycles of 14.4 percent according to a recent analysis published by Bob Doll, head investment strategy at Nuveen Asset Management, at Barron's.
The Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to occur later in the increase cycle and the yield begins to decrease.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but interest increases often promote them.
In the present case, the Fed is confronted with certain conditions that were not present before and which could accelerate a recession.
It is particularly remarkable that the gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point when the Fed increases interest rates.
According to Deutsche Bank, the 118 interest increases since 1950 were only twice the nominal GDP below 4.5 per cent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent, only few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to Atlanta Fed.
Interest increases in such a fragile economic setting could be risky and raise the question of "whether it is different this time," the Deutsche Bank said.
Market participants have been looking for an increase in the interest rate of the Fed throughout the year, and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase at this meeting, Futures trade only indicates a 25 percent probability.
"In our study, all the elevation cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing growth in GDP and put prerecession levels in the shadow very quickly after the beginning of recovery," the report states.
In contrast, this is a clearly slow recovery of what was the worst recession in the observed phase.
The current cycle is far the longest that the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and this has so far been 74 months.
The fixed income was also volatile as the market prefers a rise in interest rates, and the pattern is fairly similar to that in the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than on shares when they change their strategic rate.
In the case of bonds, the yields seem to change direction as soon as the first increase / reduction takes place in the cycle.
At the end of the increase cycle, the borrowing returns immediately fall, the Deutsche Bank said.
The strategies of Charles Schwab believe that the increase in interest rates will lead to returns between longer and shorter bonds closer to collapse and lead to a collapse of the curve.
High-interest bonds often bring better earnings in such a climate, although "we are still careful to expect higher earnings," said Kathy Jones, Fixed-Income Analyst at Schwab, in an analysis.
Interesting is, Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to Fed strategy expectations.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy" she wrote.
Short-term interest rates have increased, the yield curve is flat, credit margins have expanded and volatility has increased - all characteristics of the market when the Fed strengthens its strategy.
In general, companies that deal with most of their business activities in the US will benefit from the increase in interest rates and the attractiveness of local products.
Multinational companies with high debt will be worse because a rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market and also the financing of their debt.
"History shows that" quality "shares tend to respond very positively three months after an initial interest rate increase," said Goldman Sachs analysts in a report for customers.
Firms with a strong balance sheet have exceeded, on average, 5 percentage points after each of the interest increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high capital yields and low volatility in their shares also exceeded their low-quality pendants by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points).
Debt is going to be a big problem.
Companies with a high share of flexible interest will lose the most, said Goldman.
Outside the pure stock games, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Savers could see profits from higher revenues, even if experts differ in their opinion how fast this will take place.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM, says MEP Andrew Bingham
The Conservative Member of Parliament criticized the transmitter for his "dummy"
He argues that he is increasingly not to be distinguished from commercial rivals.
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards and said that they only imitated The British
Parliament's colleague Damien Collins attacked the show The Voice and said that this was not very original.
BBC Radio 3 "turns" to classic FM, claims a leading member of Parliament and increases new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something that the private broadcasters do not.
Conservative Member Andrew Bingham also told BBC bosses that the public radio station should be "stupid" and increasingly no longer be distinguished from its commercial competitors.
"Radio 3 seems - I use the word" stupid "not like - but it seems to turn into classic FM," he said.
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards, which started last December.
The BBC Music Awards that started last year seem to be under a different name.
So, if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneously mentioned examples in which you actually only imitate what is already on the market, "Mr Bingham said.
BBC Director-General rejected the accusations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far from its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and public awareness.
What I learn from Radio 3, I'm not going to learn about classical music anywhere else.
And there is a commitment to live music and music that is really unprecedented.
"And the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and commission new works, I also think it is really important," he said.
At the beginning of this year, BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Davey argued that more work had to be done to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British are less informed about classical music.
Radio 3, however, was not the only element of BBC production that was under fire during the hearing in the Committee for the Selection of Culture, Media and Sports to enter the commercial rivals.
The Tory Member Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the BBC's musical talent show, which was purchased by the Dutch producer Talpa Media for estimated costs of £22 million.
Do you see why this programme is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly marked?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced "in a special BBC way."
He added that he wished that the company would "find a hit from our own house stable" when it started a entertainment series next time.
However, he refused to exclude the order of the further series of The Voice in the future or to spend the fee payers' money on other entertainment formats.
Internet sales increased the slower in August and the Black Friday can be responsible for this
In the first three months of 2015, there were seven percent increases in online sales.
In the last month, the lowest result has been since the start of the records in 2000.
Online sales increased three years ago by using phones for shopping
Experts believe that the Black Friday braked the spending in November
For over a decade, virtual shopping has been booming, and many of the UK's main shopping streets have turned into ghost cities.
But experts say that there are now signs that online sales are stagnating after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015.
Total expenditure for August showed the lowest increase in growth since the start of the records in 2000, with only five per cent increase compared to the previous year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales stagnate after new figures showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the growth rates for the previous years and fall by 2000, this has always evolved over time," said Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index to the Guardian.
He explained that online sales increased three years ago, when buyers started to do their cell phone purchases.
It meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments, for example at home on the sofa.
But now this is going to settle, and we may experience that growth is decreasing.
The Black Friday phenomenon that was imported from America is quoted as a reason for the declining sales.
Experts believe that purchasers will withhold their purchases before this event, which takes place on the last Friday of November.
Last year five times the average number of buyers around their computers to make their nipples, and some dealers websites crashed.
Experts believe that Black Friday, where the buyers fought for snaps, could stop buyers from making purchases.
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that of 5 £expenditure was spent slightly more than 1 £online.
For some products such as television and washing machines, more than one third of the purchases are now carried out via web shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothing and shoes online instead of in the fashion chains in the city centre.
Muslims buried in Mecca at the crash accident - Bin Laden's family is punished
The bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims at the first funerals in Mecca through the streets
Saudi Arabia places the collapse partly on the huge Saudi Bin Laden group
The Ministry of Health said that 394 people were also injured after the crane crashed
Hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane collapsed at Mecca's Great Mosque.
The mourners filled the route, largely dressed in white, to pay their respects when the first of the dead entered their last journey to the Al-Moaissem cemetery.
The mourning process passed on at the Sacred Place, where only days before a construction crane crashed through the ceiling of the mosque and then on the beds.
The bodies were released for the funeral when the Saudi king imposed a penalty on the construction company of the Bin Laden family for the disaster that also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 berries, who were killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central Mosque of Mecca, were carried through the streets.
Among the dead were Qasim Akram from Bolton, Greater Manchester, father of four children who were on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed.
Mr Akram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual Haddsch in the Great Mosque.
Saudi officers have already committed that the Haddsch will continue to Mecca with thousands that will continue to come to the city.
Today King Salman said that the Bin-Laden group should not have left the crane's arm standing when it was not used.
An Arabic version of the decree published by the Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin-Laden group was involved in the collapse.
The English-language service of the news agency did not report this detail, but said that the management of the company abroad travel is prohibited.
At the beginning of this week Salman praised to reveal what caused the collapse of the crane that crashed into a courtyard of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered before the Haddsch, which will take place later this month.
The Bin-Laden Group has not issued any statements on the collapse of the Krans and its representatives were not available for an opinion.
The Royal Decree also dealt with the group because of non-current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteorologists.
Dozens of cranes surrounding Mekka's great mosque as part of the massive construction project, led by the Bin-Laden group.
The Bin Laden family has been connected to the Saudi Arabia ruler family for decades and is taking over major construction projects.
The deceased leader of Al Qaida, Osama bin Laden, was a descendant son who was departed from the family in the 1990s.
The crash of the crane came in the midst of strong wind and rain, just a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for pilgrimage, which is required at least once in the life of each healthy Muslim.
Officials said that 158 people are staying in the hospital.
Government representatives ordered that 1 million Rial (£174,000) should be paid to the people of the killed and the same amount of permanent injured.
Other injured persons receive half of this amount.
B & Q Boss says that the time of cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over
British people employ increasingly craftsmen, says Veronique Laury
The number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe has increased behind it
This leads to the opening of 200 more screwfix shops aimed at craftsmen
At the same time Kingfisher 60 B & Q sales outlets will close nationwide
By Rupert Steiner, City Chief Correspondent of the Daily Mail
It is claimed that the British are putting down their hammers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified Eastern European craftsmen who carry out the work in their home
If you can handle walls with a hammer or brush, you seem to be a minority these days.
Because British workers are increasingly employed to carry out homeworkers' jobs in their homes, according to the head of the company behind B & Q.
Véronique Laury, new Managing Director of Kingfisher, who owns the construction market chain, said that a large increase in the number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe that offer services at low prices is now obsolete.
Therefore, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more screwfix shops that are aimed at craftsmen and to close 60 B & Q sales points.
Mrs. Laury said she wanted to employ more women in B & Q shops, because eight out of ten shopping decisions in the store are taken by women.
At the moment, the men are overweighing with the employees.
She said it was necessary to face up to the growing demographic trends that have more female single households that are doing more renovations than in the past.
Mrs. Laury said, "There is still a majority of men working in our branches.
We need to move this more towards a balance.
In principle, half of our customers are women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Mrs Laury, one of only five women at the top of a British leading company listed in the FTSE100 index, has also restructured her top team to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women, including its management and financial board.
Mrs Laury said, "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
It wasn't hard to find good women for our supervisory board.
Kingfisher reported a decrease in half-yearly profits and sales after the group owed the costs of closing the shops.
Due to the trend, Kingfisher, who owns screwfix and B & Q, will open 200 new branches.
Officials of Aich / Dob for disbelief in court
On Wednesday, at the Landesgericht Klagenfurt, two officials of the Austrian Volleyball Vice-Master Aich / Dob had to be responsible for unfaithful and tax evasion.
The defendants didn't blame themselves.
One of them had also been accused of abuse.
He was legally released from this accusation in May.
The current process has been postponed.
According to Supreme Attorney Robert Riffel, in the preliminary investigation, it was clear that the defendants used funds from association accounts that they were allowed to provide in their functions for private purposes in the years 2006 to 2011.
The damage is estimated at around 400,000 euros.
Sports officials are also charged with financial crimes.
This fact was chosen by the President of the Schöffensenat, Judge Michaela Sanin.
It will be negotiated at a later date.
The defendant's rejection of the disbelief was that the association had not at any time created a share of assets.
The sportsmen would have only settled expenses and the sports club for which they worked from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money out of debt - the liabilities amounted to about 600,000 shillings in 2001 (approximately 44,000 euros).
"At that time we faced the situation: are we going to continue the club or are we blocking it?," one of the defendants told in the bread profession major auditors of the Financial Office.
With his colleague and the defendant, he then decided to assume this task.
With all the risks.
"We have forwarded money, put our life insurance to the bank as security," he said at the reception.
It had been agreed with the association: you can manage the money freely, only no debt can be made.
Furthermore, in the case of financial success, the reimbursement of expenses was decided retroactively until 1991.
Therefore, part of the compensation was paid only years later, namely from 2003, when a plus had been on the account.
Therefore, flat-rate and non-detailed depreciations also appeared, the former Obmann explained the transactions.
The accounts and savings books managed the two accused together, said the second defendant.
The Judge asked why the payments had not been disclosed in detail to the association.
The association had not been interested in the details of the financial bargaining, it was only the freedom of debt that had been the answer.
In 2011, when an official investigation started for abuse, an amount of 120,000 euros was transferred to the association account.
These were reserves, the defendants explained.
This securities account ran on the name of the second defendant and was, according to its statement, not known to the association.
"Why?" the judge wanted to know.
For a long time the respondent did not know an answer to that.
Then he finally said that he believed that this was the best for the association.
If anything had happened to him, no one would have known anything about this money, the prosecutor put in the room.
The defendant had been informed, the official justified himself.
This transfer was formulated as "compensation for damages."
Why damage compensation? Judge and prosecutor wanted to know.
The first defendant stated that he had disagreed with this wording because the association had never suffered any damage.
But what am I supposed to do when the lawyer says, "With this, you're all out of the tailor."
"Am I a legal representative?" he asked.
Furthermore, the official said he never obtained a cent of salary, he only charged kilometers of money and diets.
At diets he charged the association 1,000 euros per month, but the actual cost had been much higher, he added.
The accused could not provide accurate documents for the early years.
They stated that these had not been kept after an audit where everything had been considered correct.
The second defendant also received mileage.
He explained in his statement that he had to go to the Bank from his place of residence to the international market.
The main negotiation will continue on September 23 with the questioning of witnesses.
Hewlett-Packard removes further 30.000 jobs
In addition to the staff reduction that has been taking place for three years, the computerization will reduce further jobs when the company is split up.
There is no end to the job stresses of the U.S. computer editor Hewlett-Packard (HP).
As part of its restructuring, the US Technology Group plans to reduce between 25,000 and 30,000 posts in its customers' parties.
This will save costs of USD 2.7 billion (EUR 2.4 billion), the company informed us on Tuesday.
The step will lead to a special burden of around 2.7 billion dollars, which will be attacked from the fourth quarter.
The reduction of 55,000 jobs which has been running for three years has not yet been completed.
HP still employed around 302,000 employees at the end of the financial year 2013 / 14.

The group of printers from the California Palo Alto is currently splitting up: the computer and printer business is still to be bundled in a new society today - separated from the more advanced areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services.
Both parts of the business are to be listed on the stock exchange.
A once more disappointing PC sales as well as a weaker demand from corporate customers for its services added the world's second largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo last.
In the third quarter at the end of July, the sales of PC and printers fell by 11.5 percent.
Turnover fell by 8 percent to nearly 25.4 billion dollars.
This reduced the proceeds in 15 out of 16 quarters.
HP responds to the change in the industry with a split-up and massive posts.
The 76-year-old company under the leadership of Meg Whitman has only reacted late to the fact that customers buy smartphones and tablets more and more than conventional computers and do more and more online business.
Whitman's restructuring plans provide for a total reduction of around 55,000 jobs.
Conflicts: majority supports the anti-IS training mission
However, direct participation of German soldiers in fighting in Iraq would be largely opposed: 54 percent opposed, 35 percent agreed.
That other states are flying air attacks against the IS in Iraq and Syria, 61 percent are positive.
24 percent are opposed to intervening in the conflict.
A cooperation with the Syrian magistrate Baschar al-Assad rejects 51 percent of the respondents, 20 percent would be for it.
29 percent were unable to decide.
Car: Second Press Day on the 66th IAA
At the heart of the fair will be connected, self-driving cars and electric mobility until 27 September.
After two press days, Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 66th International Automobile Exhibition under the motto "Mobility Connects" on Thursday.
The wide audience can visit the IAA from Saturday.
As two years ago, the VDA car association organizers expect about 900 000 visitors.
Röszke: violent outbreak at Serbian-Hungarian border
The Hungarian police have set up at the Serbian border with Röszke tear gas and watercanners against several hundred displaced refugees.
Euronews correspondent Dániel Bozsik has experienced the outbreak of violence at the border control point.
He reported on the phone:
A group of refugees broke through the border.
There had a police line formed and behind the police a watercannon was ready.
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones, sticks and plastic bottles after the officials.
The officials first used uninterrupted pepper spray.
Then the police used tear gas.
A lot of tear gas was sprayed towards the refugees.
This dissolved the group.
The refugees have now withdrawn a little while.
A pregnant and apparently injured woman was carried away from the zone.
Children who had breathed the tear gas screamed.
Other refugees collapsed together and suffered under respiratory distress.
The Serbian police press speakers also suffered injuries by using tear gas and pepper spray.
Time of decision on interest rates for the US Notenbank
The world observes when the US Notenbank meets in two days, on Wednesday and Thursday, to make the important decision whether or not interest rates have been raised for the first time for almost a decade.
A survey of 80 economists questioned by Reuters found that a little more than half of the one who thought last week that the Fed would do this, now thinks that the Fed will persevere a little longer and keep interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.25 percent.
It's a historical event because it's been seven years since the Fed interest was set on NULL.
"For the first time we approach a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normalisation of interest rates," said Angel Ubide, senior staff at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy is at relatively good performance, billions of dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only low inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy view of global conditions.
It has warned the markets to adjust to an increase, but the evidence suggests that the chances against such a step are good.
The decision is to be announced at 8: 00 MEZ on Thursday
Death Guardian at Delta State University left apologies
After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleagues later on the day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note to say that he was "sorry" in the first murder and wanted "he could do it undone," authorities announced on Tuesday.
The police in Gautier, Mississippi, said that Lamb, teacher for geography and social science education at Delta State University, called the emergency number at 10: 00 on Monday morning
And he said he shot someone and killed someone.
Lamb told the staff of the emergency office that the police had to send cops to his home.
He said, "I shot my wife last night," and he also mentioned that a "sweet dog" is in the house, but "no one will disturb," but probably will be excited.
The police asked the caller for his name, but he didn't give him.
Lamb didn't explain his shots.
When the police entered the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note of Lamb, 45, who said, "I'm so sorry, I wanted to make it back.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me. "
After writing the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before he finally took his own life on Monday evening, when cops surrounded him.
University President William LaForge said he didn't know about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr. Lamb's imagination."
Despite reports on Monday, the Lamb allegedly believed that Prentiss also had a relationship with Schmidt, authorities on Tuesday said there was "no information, no evidence" for a "triangle relationship."
Prentiss was described by Shawn O'Steen, who said that they were married for about seven years as a "good person."
They were divorced 15 years ago, but they stayed friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter who is 19 and she was "destroyed on the ground."
He said Prentiss was her daughter "absolutely best friends."
Prentiss worked online from home, according to Linsday Knowles, which was identified by Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who owned a dog named Lightning, met with lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help other people," said Knowles
The police said that Lamb called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them he's not going to jail.
When police picked him up on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb drove his car aside, flew on foot, ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot.
Lamb received a PhD from Delta State University in the spring of 2015, as his lifestyle indicates on the university's website.
Stars who have lost their lucky bringer
The actor (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), had some stressful years.
In 2001 he fought against leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his long-standing partner, Farrah Fawcett, for cancer.
The actor also claimed to fight drugs, and in 2008 he was convicted of possession of drugs.
I'm sure all of this requires his tribute.
Eurowings: Lufthansa is rebuilding the group
Lufthansa is planning a large group conversion.
Half a billion euros a year will save the Lufthansa Group alone with a better organisation.
150 of around 1000 managers worldwide will cost the company's conversion to work.
However, there are new negotiations with the pilot group.
Lufthansa is rebuilding its company structure and evaluating Eurowings's cheap daughter.
The aim of the reorientation was to contribute around EUR 500 million per year from cost and income synergies, the airline announced Wednesday.
Among other things, Lufthansa will no longer have a board for passenger business.
The Eurowings airline should be developed as independently as possible.
In future, Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings.
With the recast, Spohr underlines the importance of Eurowings, with which the group intends to fight Ryanair and Easyjet in the future.
To date, the organization of the 120 000 employees has been complex.
The airlines established under the roof of the Passage Airline Group, which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros.
New negotiations with the pilots
In collective conflict with the Cockpit Pilot Association (VC), negotiations are to be resumed after the trial strike on this Thursday.
That's what the union told us.
The subject of the talks is to be the retirement scheme for pilots.
Cockpit wants to achieve viable results as soon as possible "in one year with a projected record result."
The conflict between the trade union and the airline has led to several strikes in recent months.
In addition to the transitional provision of the pilots, the "Wings" concept of savings is the background.
It provides that Lufthansa will take routes to the Eurowings Group's own cheaper line in the fight against competitors.
Under the title "Morgenzug in the South" paintings of Leena Krüger are seen in the artist's house.
Finin, which has long been established in Göttingen, has compiled a selection of titellless works for the White Hall of the House, which animate its viewers to travel thankfully.
Luke Shaw from Manchester United can't play for months because of double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg at the Manchester Champions League defeat at the PSV Eindhoven.
While this led the left defense to cry and will exclude him from playing for at least six months, Louis van Gaal does not give up the hope that Shaw can play again this season.
The injury was caused by a reckless attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20-year-old Shaw had broken into the PSV area.
He was treated in the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before he was brought to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double leg fracture and is in the hospital."
He'll be moved tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated in Manchester.
It's horrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18, has it very hard and then plays fantastic, and then that happens.
In the changing cabin he had an oxygen mask.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it'll take six months and he won't play in the group phase.
I hope he can play this season again.
Moreno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the hanging of an eleven meter.
Nicola Rizzoli, the arbitrator, did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suspected that the Italian arbitrator had been wrong.
You can judge for yourself when I say that a eleven meter and a red card were due.
It was a very bad attack with both legs.
A tweet on Shaw's account said, "I thank you all for your news. Words cannot describe how broken I am, my way to recovery begins now, I come back stronger."
On this subject: Manchester United suffered the loss of Luke Shaw in the defeat of PSV
With the European Championship in France, the English defender has an additional incentive to recover by next June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said, "It's a very bad injury."
When a player leaves the place with this kind of injury, everyone is very sad about it.
It is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent.
Moreno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Gaals Holland team at the 2014 World Cup.
"He is very hard because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent, and when you hear that it is a very bad injury, that is not good," said Cocu.
It wasn't possible for me to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball that was going in another direction so it looked like he had touched him [Moreno], but I couldn't see the attack on Luke.
In conversation with SBS6 Moreno said, "I know how it feels, I know how hard such a thing can be.
I feel really bad about it.
The PSV player Andrés Guardado was also brought to the hospital - after a game by Chris Smalling.
I'm sure David Cameron The Lorax knows better?
It's one thing that all parents will soon learn: If your child loves a book, it won't take long until you know it almost externally.
Unless you may be David Cameron.
When he was asked by a provider of childcare systems to call his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister for The Lorax, the environmental fabel published in 1971 by Dr. Seuss, decided.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron writes in a message on the website of SuperCamps, and continues: "Funny, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it is a book that I like to read to my children, because there always seems to be a picture or message that we have missed so far."
Everything nice and good, except that the following paragraph, in which Cameron allegedly describes the action of the book, instead reflects a content indication of the 2012 movie version, which added new characters and details to expand the rather short original text.
"In the midst of the enchanted town of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams by fulfilling his desire to see a real tree," you read. A love interest was Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss hostage and who died in 1991, but completely unknown.
As if it wasn't suspicious enough: The text presented by Cameron is partly read like the summary of the Lorax movie, which is presented on the website of the Internet Movie Database and so begins: "In the enumbered town of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a product, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams."
Although he admits to be a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the action of the book. Here a unnamed boy, as the local environment is being spoiled by the money-greedy, trees-falling, thneed-striking once-ler despite the protests of the naming Lorax, a hockling, snurrberry being, "which speaks in the name of the trees."
Most likely, such a relatively low PR task was delegated to a helper who did not read The Lorax 20 times in succession to a child.
A Downing Street speaker said that the text probably came from Cameron's electoral office.
Supercamps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron's employees, but did not give any more direct comments.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England's team, but it's still hard
Showing Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but if you see the cader that England has chosen for the tour, a repeat of the 3-0 test series defeat is not on my map.
I wouldn't rule out an outward victory.
Alastair Cooks page may be less experienced than those three years ago, but there are good spin players in the batting set, and the common spirit is strong; they won't wear scars of 2012, just a juvenile-positive attitude.
With the ball Moeen Ali develops as Spin Bowler and Adil Rashid, even if it is an unknown size at test level, is an option for the attack.
Related message: Adam Lyth leaves the England Test Box and is replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to leave Adam Lyth is, of course, difficult for me to analyze as his chief coach in Yorkshire.
In his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple but hard reality is that cricket players are focused on results.
There were no questionnaires at Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination, since - and I said this earlier - players are their own best selectors.
A long time ago, Lyth had been prolonged, but he had control of his own fate.
If he hopes to take out more runs for Yorkshire, there will be another chance.
The England trainer Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even if he did not deliver such good achievements, and that doesn't surprise me; he is, above all, a team man.
The question of how much time a test slayer gets to set his sign is difficult.
Lyth got seven chances - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play home and outside.
The only accusation you can make was that England first used Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - when Lyth was in the highest shape - but this lost chance is now in the past.
Alex Hales comes in, and he's a slayer I highly appreciate.
He's an X-factor cricket player, which we saw early at Yorkshire this season when he reached 236 against us on a Trent Bridge place, which hit us very much.
He must have at least the same opportunities as before, but this depends, of course, on the crew position in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of letting Moeen beat next to Cook, which would make an extra spin bowler and get four quicks, appeared, and I don't mind.
I don't see why a slayer can't beat there, and this left hand has already shown that he is a devil bastard of cricket players.
Moeen may not have done his job for his county Worcestershire, but he's a number three for her, and there's no big difference.
My former team colleague Justin Langer played his first 38 tests on the first drop before he appeared as an opener in 2001.
He made three hundred runs right away and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the box as a backup spinner, and in my limited handling with him he has impressed me very much as a young man.
People may look at their statistics - on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it's a point, but there are no large numbers of backup spiders that raise their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth.
He'll learn a lot on this tour.
Apart from the team, England has made some smart supplements at the coach staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the Batsman from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup.
He is one of the nicest guys of the game who will bring a lot of experience because he has played under all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful use into the setup.
I always felt that he was created for the international Cricket competition, as a player or as a coach, and as Mahela he has insights that we can benefit from.
Sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in the changing cabin, even if the news is in line with the previous word.
Colly's team colleague at Durham, Ben Stokes, is not used at the One-Dayers, Root got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it for my part.
Some will not agree, but coaches and team makers do not determine the timetable.
And you have to remember that as with the players, their jobs depend on the results.
Such choices are not made easy hearts.
The Brexit Camp (Brexit = United Kingdom's departure from the EU) could be gained when the economy falls into a flute by 2017
David Cameron's unprecedented re-negotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is being put in deeper trouble with every day, even without the choice of the genius Jeremy "Is it yes or no?" Corbyn to the leader of Labour or TUC, who was heavily defeated because of Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat friend said the other day that some Member States, as deeply strangled in various crises as the EU is now and not always on its own account, are tired of the UK's own agenda with divorced concessions and disturbing Treaty changes that they usually do not want.
In Brighton, TUC decided at its annual meeting that it does not like them either if they jeopardize social protection.
We could also call it Dave and Georges Selfie Agenda.
Prime Minister and Minister of Finance climbing at summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, taking a picture of themselves before a famous local monument, with or without local sizes, then come home and say they win allies for reform.
It's always about me.
My European friend, who wishes an outward UK inside the EU tent - "Let us not alone with France," says Berlin - and makes clear that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials have come up to the point where they don't care if we stay or go.
German gentle Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her, as has happened to those who have been exaggerated for a long time such as Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France's François Hollande looks at his re-election or replacement in 2017.
He is also a blossoming force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain has a left.
It is hard to imagine that they will rip out a leg to help the Selfie British whose energy should be used better to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK - something they do not want either because most of them have similar separatist tendencies.
Therefore, some such ministers may even intentionally plan unhelpful comments, quite in the SNP style, while the UK referendum campaign 2017 to accelerate the Brexit process, my friend suspects.
"The re-negotiation was a plea" and "Britain won nothing of value from the re-negotiation."
Europeans know how robbery Fleet Street can be at their expense and what EU sceptics are the oligarchy of the press barons, as it was during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn, which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2: 1.
You can easily remember Boris Johnson, the peasant Euro-opportunist who has made a name as a "EU-straight bananas" Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
With all his insanity, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
This included the Medley of tax-fearing villages, telephone-hacking foreigners and the Pseudo non-nationals who own most of our major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought similar about her, but found that if you sit in a cage with a hot gorilla, you better distribute bananas to distract him instead of becoming his lunch and dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more blairians than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron's referendum hijacking, because Blair had set the principle of the EU's non-adopted constitution, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which thus opened a back door to him.
The press never forgave him that either.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly blow on my back on Monday in Westminster - I told him he doesn't need time to waste for me anymore - seems in danger of repeating Neil Kinnock's boycott Murdoch strategy of the 80's, a mistake then and today.
It may take, but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is - I would express it kindly - in development.
He says that we should remain in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside of Ukip's traditional blueprint tendency and the wilder fields of Tory's little English-style might say yes to that.
It is what Hilary said "A Benn but no Bennite" Benn on the radio and on television this week when the scout in him fought not to admit that Corbyn's appointment of provoking John McDonnell as a shadow Chancellor was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70's when his old father tried on television to be unloyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job.
Hilary's fight was even more attractive.
But fighting to remain "in all circumstances" - Benn's expression - was not what McDonnell said, but what JC told his fellow disputes and MEPs after all the reports on her class meeting on Monday night.
Whatever the touchy bottom-up image of Corbyn wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all things in the strudel of social media, a brutal place of paranoia and treason.
It is right not to give Cameron a free map for Europe that allows him to consider labours' support in the referendum campaign to be a self-understanding, as McDonnell said.
I'm sure Simon Jenkins thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's fundamental ambiguity about EU membership - in line with their Bennite siege economy, their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents, for which narcissism of the small difference is a central principle of dogmatic disputes.
As with its ambiguities about NATO - Tom Watson is firmly convinced that JC is not starting a campaign for exit - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to find a sense for their superiors at home in all.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have mistrust voters - to make concessions to the British if this can all be meaningless?
The United States is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a reduction in the cost of the Tory government in power, which I was reminded at the start of Monday of something called the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticise Public Health England's report on e-cigarettes
A state-funded agency claims that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking was created from a meeting of 12 people, partly linked to the tobacco industry, said researchers.
Experts in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet by criticising the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the "Basic Report" last month and describes it as a "comprehensive review of evidence."
However, some researchers have questioned the reliability of data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
A headline article in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the "extraordinarily nasty basis," on which PHE founded its main conclusion.
Two more researchers write in BMJ and have asked whether the claims "build on stone or sand."
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They said that the public expects that the claim of PHE that "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking" is based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people who have been convened to develop a model for a multi-criterion decision-making analysis (MCDA) to bring their opinions on the damage caused by various nicotine-containing products to a synthesis; the results of the meeting were summarised in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health whose manager should have previously received from British American Tobacco funds (BAT) for an independent study.
He also signed the references of BAT to public health in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting stated that they would receive funds from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but not the funding he would have received from the tobacco company Philip Morris International in advance.
The reasons for selecting the members of the board are not delivered, but there are several known e-cigarettes champions, some of which also indicate a sector financing in the paper.
Some other participants in this meeting are not known for their know-how in tobacco control.
The meeting also took part in PHE's tobacco management.
McKee and Capewell wrote that the group's research work "acknowledges" that there is a lack of "hard evidence for the damage to most products at most criteria."
However, none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that the claims of PHE that "there is no evidence to date that e-cigarettes serve as a way to smoke for children or non-smokers were premature."
Prof Kevin Fenton, Director of Health and Welfare at PHE, said that BMJ's claims have been responded before.
He said, "E-cigarettes are far less harmful than smoking."
Every second life-long smoker dies of his addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are low compared to that, but that we have to continue to study the long-term impact.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what proves the evidence and what does not, especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Almost 80,000 people die of a disease related to smoking every year, and smoking costs two billion £a year for the national health system.
Through the clear presentation of current evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk, but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking, we fulfil our national competence.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says former head of Channel 4
The former chairman of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said that the BBC should stop sending programs like EastEnders and The Voice. He said commercial rivals would "give their right arm" for hit shows like the Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the type of programmes that are not transmitted by other UK broadcasters.
He criticized the BBC for putting public-law programs, which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience, in hard controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their rivals and broadcasters such as BBC4.
After the BBC Director, Tony Hall, said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations, Johnson said that he had tried to get in touch with the BBC for six years in his time at Channel 4 without success.
"I have problems with the idea that BBC is commissioning or sending programs that are also clearly shown by unsubsidised rivals," said Johnson to the Oberhaus Communication Committee in its study on the future of the BBC.
If you want to keep the broadcasting fee, which I do not think is a good idea in the medium or long term, you should at least make your production on programmes that others do not make or order.
They send The Voice in a first-class time window because they want to reach the widest possible support for their future.
The idea that nobody else would show this is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's of course nonsense.
Johnson said, "I do not see why a regressive tax programme could be financed even without subsidies.
The Voice is such a program, EastEnders is another, admittedly both own production.
Honestly, other channels would give their right arm for that.
I am trying to see how this is supposed to be public television.
I do not believe that this would reduce the BBC at all.
Johnson, an entrepreneur for series, who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC was guilty of hunting for reviews "because of the ambitions of the people who work there, and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long-term support."
His comments on the most popular broadcasts of the BBC reflect what the former head of Sky, Tony Ball, suggested in his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows should sell like EastEnders.
Johnson said that the rather public-legal niche programs "should go to BBC4 where you can pretty much not measure the audience, but they fulfil their tasks, and they can argue if they go to their apparently holy missions to justify £4 billion broadcasting fees," Well, of course, we have created all these obscure programs that no one has seen. "
They put them in a time window where no one ever wanted to see them.
On the broadcasting fee, Johnson said to the Committee: "I urge you to find a more regressive system in relation to the conditions that can get the best value out of this.
Of course you all think, we all think that you get a great value here for £150 a year, but for people who are a lot of money for the £150, ask me if that's true, because they don't consume much from the BBC.
The former Sky- and Channel 5 Chief David Elstein, who also stated in front of the committee on Tuesday, called for BBC to review its Reithian mission to "inform, form and entertain."
He said that little of BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said it was 1% of its TV production and 0.1% on the radio - and it should take an example to "inform, educate and entertain" the public broadcasters in Australia and Canada.
On the issue of partnerships Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas such as those of the proms, of which he said that only one handful is shown on television, and with the commercial channels enter alliances to make everything online.
'Sonogenetics' can control brain cells through sound waves
The video shows how the nematods change the direction at the moment when they are irradiated with sound impulses.
Scientists have grown worms with genetically modified nerve systems that can be controlled by outbreaks of sound waves.
The tiny nematods change the direction at the moment when they are irradiated with sound impulses that have too high frequencies for human hearing to be heard.
The impulses work by switching on motoneuros cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves.
Further on this topic: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
The researchers said the worms showed the power of a new process called sonogenetics, where ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that one day the procedure could replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive process that gives electrical impulse to the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
Threadworms usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they did when they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles.
The bubbles, he found out, strengthen the ultrasound waves that then penetrate the worms.
The reinforced ultrasound waves affect structures called TRP-4 ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the worm cells.
The sound waves create the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to, such a report Nature Communications.
In order to create ultrasound-controlled nematods, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motoneurons carry TRP-4 ion channels.
When applying ultrasound to the changed creatures, the sound waves are reinforced by the microblades and transferred to the worms where they turn on the modified motoneurons.
The process has some similarities with optogenetics, a pioneering tool that allows scientists to switch on and off neurons with the impulse of light.
But Chalasani said that sonogenetics could have some advantages compared to this technique.
Unlike light that needs to be sent down to the desired place in the brain at an optical fibre, low-frequency ultrasound waves can happen unhindered and can be sent into the brain from above on the skull.
"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the targeted human neurons vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," said Chalasani.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.

The ads shame Britain's arms trade
Watch Amnesty International Anti-Weapons Fair Video.
Horrible killer drones!
Footline breaking legs!
The scratch bombs!
And electric shock rods that cause painful pain, but don't leave any trace behind!
The happy voice and the cartoon images leave no doubt that this ad for the world's largest arms fair is a struggling parody produced by Amnesty International in order to bring the British government to the spotlight the willingness to embrace weapons to repressive regimes over the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London Docklands.

But a separate campaign also leads to many posters that can be seen at bus stops and in the subway trains and which require a second look.
"Important announcement: Do you drive with the DLR from 15 to 18 September?" (Docklands Light Railway) is read in the fonts of the London Underground and the brand marks of the DLR line, which turns into the image of a tank.
In September a swarm of arms dealers will drive with the DLR... customers will be asked to help stop the weapons fair.
The 300 posters are issued by artists who have exhibited their work at the Museum for Cruel Designs in Banksys Dismaland.
A collective named Special Patrol Group helped distribute in London and used "Ad Space Hack Packs," a 6 £package of inbox keys, which is claimed to gain "access to about a third of the bus station advertising areas on the planet."
Transport for London doesn't find this poster "vandalism" funny.
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Crueol Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists become more critical and try to bring political works to the audience outside galleries.
Many artists are working with activists within protest movements and realize that they have to go outside into the real world so that their art has an influence on society.
Another of the anti-arms trade posters greets the commanders on the subway.
The Amnesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency VCCP, who works nonprofit with the graphic and voiceover artist, who also works free of charge.
VCCP Creative Director Matt Lever was astonished by the silence that was prevailing around the advertising of the arms fair - through an empty post of the ExCeL calendar - and thought: "Let's give them the campaign they try to avoid."
They played with the invention of a more realistic dubious corporate advertising, but "by blowing in with bright colors and animation it remains more liable."
"They have done a fantastic job by helping us to raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair," says Tom Davies of Amnesty.
What we need now is an intervention by the British Government and the guarantee that torture devices are not being handled illegally outside our door.
Perhaps the most creative art around the arms fair comes from the area within ExCeL, where exhibitors aggravate fantastically euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab reveals an assignment from the US Army about "AT4CS RS," the AT4CS RS shot off from the shoulder.
This includes a "unique fighter head that delivers outstanding retroactive effects inside the target."

Eight golden rules for living in student homes
Eleven years ago, as a forgotten 19-year-old, I moved into a student home, still in the faith in berets and moral relativism, but only now I remember the tense smile of those I have annoyed - and the numerous, long-breathing complaints about others.
Most of what I've learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
The admission to student homes ranges from slightly nervous to absolutely frightening.
It is tempting to shake: people tell me where you come from, whether and where you took Sabbath year, where you stand in relation to Corbyn and why you "honestly do not love or hate Marmite, because seriously, boys, it's just a yeast extract HAHAHAHA, I'm in my room."
Breathe through.
And help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest.
It guides the conversation and helps you find out the people you like unlike those you wouldn't talk to, even if your whistles were burning and these fire extinguishers were.
Let people go.
The rooms of people often turn into drinks receptions, movie night events and local meeting points, but they are also the places where people dress and attract their underwear.
Concerning this: Don't think about starting the school with a relationship
Introverts receive a rough treatment at the university.
Your room should be a refugee, but many student homes form a space-to-space bummel culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendship.
This could be hell for someone who's trying to recover.
Nothing in culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want our friendship to continue, but you have to go away so that I can get back the energy I've consumed for the interaction with you."
Try to feel when a commilitone is exhausted - and send him a text instead of knocking.
Speaking of which, do it.
A guy in my student homes had the idea that an unlocked door was an invitation.
He saw some things.
Friendship closing through baking.
Since you start the school at the highlight of the back mania, knocking on the doors of people to imagine with a plate full of brownies, less strange than the greeting of the 1950's "Welcome to the neighborhood, I have baked something to you. So, and now please smile if I ask you a few personal questions."
Offering homemade leakages is a good way to close friendships.
Your roommates feel committed to entertaining and may eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise.
Of course this depends on whether you are a decent baker.
Bad mixed clumps of flour, sugar and fat lead people to get asleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student homes.
Of course the clay of chicken is a theft, but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too?
Check this with the milk owner.
The chances are good that they say to use themselves even when they cook inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying, and you have my sympathy - but try to handle it more evenly than my roommate who added a dishwasher to her milk to punish thieves.
She's in jail now.
You shouldn't make a noise that keeps people from sleeping or working.
It is not just about being a decent person, but about being one of the people sitting in the glass house in the real sense of the saying.
A girl on my hallway asked her neighbours if they could put Drum & Bass a little quieter than it was three o'clock in the morning, and she had a test in the morning.
They reacted to it with more loud music.
When they finally stopped at 5: 00, she kindly allowed her neighbours to sleep two hours before she had her own music snatched, closed her door and went to her three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse would happen to move into the same student home?
On the other hand, it would not be embarrassing if you held a roommate for your future spouse, ran to her, divorced and then had to see each day and perhaps experience how she takes over all the common friends?
Of course, the heart goes its own ways - but if a hot roommate is definitely not your future spouse, at least try to talk a little sense to your underlife.
At the exciting moment you notice that someone left his keys in his unlocked room, the border between an ulk and mobbing is finer than it seems.
A good joke is funny, but it only takes moments until he becomes a boomerang.
By hiding, give a valuable and amusing lesson about safety - but never screw up anyone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Close your door, and put your keys in a glass of water that you then put in the freezer - but don't fix their possessions on the ceiling more than twice.
Reihenhäuser for refugees, single-parent, low-earned
The real estate contractor Markus Gildner builds in the Middle French Eckental Reihenhäuser for people who don't have much money.
So for refugees - but also as a signal: "Not only refugees need living space, but also the only educating mother and the low-earners."
"I show how to build cheap and good today," says the 44-year-old in the interview
Thousands of refugees will push to the housing market.
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes to know how quickly a more favourable living space can be created: he builds in a project series houses for refugees.
Mr Gildner, many refugees will push to the housing market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: The massive accommodation in containers or gymnastics has no sustainability.
Because people stay here for a great deal.
Given the refugee flow, we also need sufficient living space in the next decades.
A completely banal three-shield roadhouse is the solution.
Gildner: A series house needs the least space.
It facilitates integration.
That's different when you put people in residential blocks.
Each of the six houses that are currently being built in the pilot project consists of three residential units for each four asylum seekers.
Each living unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a living room.
It may be that many refugees will say it's peace again, I'm going back.
Then the houses can be easily converted according to their needs.
How much are the costs?
Gildner: The price for 160 square meters of living area per house is EUR 184 000, without property.
That's obvious.
The construction took six months.
That's appropriate.
Have the construction regulations complicated their plans?
Gildner: Building law I did my project correctly.
Especially complicated it always makes the threatening Damoklessworth special construction and the place regulation.
Terrible.
It is still assumed that those who create three apartments in a series house need at least three pitches.
Only in the cities is there no place for this.
And refugees and asylum seekers don't have cars.
How did the residents respond to their Reihenhaus project?
Gildner: There were some who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers.
Which is definitely not true.
But don't you step up the competition for affordable apartments?
Gildner: True is: We have had a tree in Germany over the last five years, but luxury apartments have been built that can hardly afford one more.
My project has the message, even normal people need a living room.
Not only refugees, but also the only parent or the low-earner.
I'll show you how to build cheap and good today.
That's what this is about.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystem technology in Regensburg and was first involved in environmental analyses.
iOS 9: How to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is published
The new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings app, typing "General" and then selecting "Software Update."
When ready, the phone will give you the option to download and then install.
Some have encountered problems after the installation as they receive an error message that indicates that "software update failed."
To avoid the problem, users are recommended either to wait until the storm returns or to try to update via iTunes.
The phone itself leads you through the rest of the process.
This may mean deleting apps to create space - but Apple has made it more unlikely by swallowing the update. Likewise, it will be easier to do this when you use a special tool to delete apps and then reinstall apps as soon as the process is completed.
It is worth ensuring that your mobile phone is uploaded during the updating or is located near a charger device so that the battery is loaded.
If the charge is too low, Apple will not allow the update to continue, as the phone may turn off halfway and this could result in a cancellation of the update.

You should also make sure that before your download you have looked through our checklist of all things to prevent things going wrong and protecting yourself if it does. iOS 9 brings new functions, including a much smarter personal assistant and huge new productivity features for the iPad, as well as changes that accelerate and repair the operating system.
Rosberg's only Devise: Full Attack
In the struggle for the World Cup title in Formula 1, Nico Rosberg only knows one more version of the "Full Attack" against his clearly leading Mercedes team colleague Lewis Hamilton.
The World Championship Second emphasized before the launch into the decisive seven overseas races that "I have nothing to lose."
53 points separate the vice world champion before separating in Singapore on this Sunday from title defender and two-fold champion Hamilton.
The British has already won seven of the twelve seasonal races and is also attacking the Flutlight Grand Prix in the city state as a favourite.
In 2009 and last year, the 30-year-old British won the race.
Whether the current smog in the city state will have an impact on the Great Price of Singapore is still unclear.
For days a dark bell has been hanging over the city, caused by fires on the neighbouring island of Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger chess club has a prominent member
The chess club founded three months ago "Schachfreunde Bad Kissingen" has included another member in his series, thus increasing the number of members to 19 players.
The new member is the entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess and tennis player who stayed in Bad Kissingen for more than 40 times.
Gauselmann is the carrier of the first class of earning and honorary citizens of the cities of Espelkamp and Lübbecke.
The chess club in Bad Kissingen has supported Gauselmann with a donation received by President Alfred Klein.
This makes it possible to include chess players who cannot make the membership contribution.
Youth work and talent search should also be promoted.
Gauselmann wishes that membership of the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club "Red-White" be seen as an expression of his association with the Kurstadt.
Quartiersbüro searches for direct contact
Saludis and the Altenzentrum Antonistift have gathered under the coat of social foundation and opened a new contact point at Graf-Stauffenberg Square.
In addition to discussions you can also take part in courses there.
The social foundation draws it down from the mountain to the city center.
More specifically, at the Count Stauffenberg Square.
A new quarterly office was recently opened there.
Here, right next to the shopping market, older people and counseling will receive information on issues such as nursing insurance or health care services.
For years we have seen with our ambulance nursing service that often caring relatives are left alone.
There are infinitely many questions.
"Even rarely many services are not used by the cashier because the complexity of insurance is hardly understood," explained the new housekeeper Jutta Weigand, who is also responsible for the Antonistift and the Citizens' Hospital as well as for the Ambulant Service "Amadeus."
In addition to the discussions, the new quarterly office also offers prevention, health courses and wellness.
For this purpose, Saludis was taken to the boat.
Therefore, additional offers such as crash prevention, memory training or physiotherapeutic treatment can be used.
The offers from the senior centre and the Saludis are perfect.
Saludis stands for prevention, precautions and rehab.
"The senior centre for care and care," said Heike Riedel, Managing Director of Saludis.
The reason for the opening of the new quarterly office in the city centre is that both directors are particularly concerned with demographic change.
Because this makes a good decentralised infrastructure essential in the different parts of Bamberg in the future.
In addition, as Mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) underlined at the ceremony, the quarterly office also devoted itself to the gathering at age: "There are numerous events and offers on the program and invite them to a regular common congregation."
The social foundation thus contributed greatly to the ability of seniors to live as independently and well as possible in their familiar environment.
The quarterly office is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m., Tuesday and Thursday from 16 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturday from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m.
Intra Bamberg against Würzburger Kickers on October 6
Now it is official: After the date for the FC Eintracht Bamberg against the third ligist Würzburger Kickers had not yet been set for restoration work at the Fuchsparkstadion, 6 October was now set as the date.
The meeting of FC Eintracht Bamberg in the eighth final of the Bayerische Fußball Totopokal against the third ligist FC Würzburger Kickers has now been definitively terminated.
Played on Tuesday, October 6th, at 7am at the Bamberger Fuchsparkstadion.
"We are glad that we now know when the game goes beyond stage, now we have planning security," said FCE team manager Karlheinz Hümmer, who also points to the now launched card presale.
It's special for our team to play against a third-party ligist.
We therefore hope for numerous spectators, and not without reason, because floating light games have a special attraction.
In 2010, FC Eintracht Bamberg took part in the round of the last 16 teams by winning 1. FC Oberhaid (3: 1) and at home against 1. FC Schweinfurt 05 (3: 2).
The winner of the competition receives 5000 euros and qualifies for the first round of the DFB Vereinspokal 2016 / 2017.

Wiener architect Karl Mang died 92-year-old
Karl Mang, one of the Doyens of Vienna architecture, is dead.
He died already on September 5 at the age of 92, as the artist's house announced on Tuesday.
With Mang the artist house loses an honorary member and at the same time "one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna," as it was called in the show.
Born in Vienna in 1922, Mang studied architecture at the Technical University of Vienna at Friedrich Lehmann during and after World War II.
Since 1952 he has worked as a freelance architect, but also as a teacher, writer and director of the Institute.
From 1972 to 1983 he was president of the Austrian Institute of Design.
In the 1980s he was commissioned to set up the treasure chamber in the Vienna Hofburg and to convert the Palais Lobkowitz into the Austrian Theater Museum.
Parking penalty: Tim Wiese throws a policeman with money
Ex-soccer Tim Wiese disappeared in Bremen.
Football was once, now Tim Wiese, ex-National Torhüter in Germany and at Bremen and Hoffenheim, wrestler.
30 kilograms of muscle mass he wants to have added in the past two years according to his own statement.
Intellectually, he didn't add to it.
Wiese was able to cut the hair in the Bremer downtown just when he saw a parquet guard outside exhibiting a ticket for his white Chevrolet Camaro.
Meese then stormed out of the business, insulted the official and threw her the due penalty in front of her feet, as the "picture" newspaper reports.
The city of Bremen confirms the accusations, but is not yet aware of the consequences for the unusual incident.
"The matter is still under review," says the city of Bremen.
Only after that will it be decided whether or not to display meadow.

Witnesses seek the police for an incident in Bad Soden-Salmünster: On Friday night, at 23.45, three young men were walking from Bad Soden towards Salmünster.
One from the group, a 17-year-old Afghan, according to police, followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him.
At that time the group was at the height of the bft gas station.
Three people also stayed on the site of the gas station.
One of these men now cried at the young and struck it with the fist in the face.
The victim suffered a breach of the nose and was bleeding out of the nose.
When his two friends came up and complained about the battle, he first left his victim.
His friends brought the injured young man home.
The perpetrator followed the group with a car up to their apartment and travelled there demonstratively several times.
When you didn't see the vehicle, the injured went before the building to smoke a cigarette.
There he was attacked again by the butcher and another male person.
The victim's face and thigh were beaten with the help of a stroke.
The injured had to be brought to a hospital for medical care.
There is only one vague description of the perpetrator so far.
One of the men was about 1.80 meters tall.
The second bat should have been about 1,65 meters tall and was dressed with a jeans and a brown-white shirt.
The police are asking witnesses and guides to report under phone number 06181 / 100-123.
Dr. Frank Müller takes over practice field houses and invests 310000 euros
Silvia Müller-Gongoll and Frank Müller (from the left) take the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felstehausen.
In addition, Samtgemeindebürgermeister Bernd Bormann, economic promoter Uta Seim-Schwartz and the mayor of Asendorf Heinfried Kabbert are pleased.
In many places in the country missing doctors - Asendorf is lucky: Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of field houses on 1 October.
While Ursel Felstehausen retires, her husband Karl-Heinrich is still standing by his successor in the coming months with half a post.
After a reconstruction phase, Müller reopened the practice on 12 October, until then he invests 310000 euros in the premises on St Marcellusstraße 6.
It was sympathy at first sight when Frank Müller and his wife, Dr. Silvia Müller-Gongoll, met the field houses years ago, who is currently completing their specialist training at the Verdener Hospital and wants to get into practice in the coming year as well.
"We always had in the back that the trash would fit well in this practice," says Dr. Ursel rocks and laughs.
"When it was time, I just called her."
The couple Müller enjoyed the idea of operating their own practice in Asendorf in the future.
"The proximity and constant contact with patients are very attractive to us," says the 39-year-old trash.
"We want to meet and accompany the families over the years."
As an advantage, he also sees becoming his own boss soon.
And so they agreed, the trash's bought the house with the practice.
However, they will continue to live in Bruchhausen Vilsen.
There the two-fold family father Frank Müller grew up, his medical degree in Hannover followed stations in several medical practice as well as in the hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
He is currently a superior doctor in Sulingen, and was appointed as senior emergency doctor in the district of Diepholz in 2009 and volunteers in the DRK-ready Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
From 19 September the practice will be prepared for the new boss.
During the surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felstehausen worked as a domestic doctor, his wife Ursel (internistin) specialized in gastroenterology.
The Müllers, both internists, want to settle down as homephysicians.
"The endoscopy comes out," says the 38-year-old Silvia Müller-Gongoll.
After the reconstruction, the rooms will look more modern.
We will offer more ultrasound tests as well as long-term and load ECGs and need a more spoken room.
In addition, the computer is completely renewed.
A total grant of EUR 50000 will be granted to the trailers under a programme of support from the district (EUR 25000) and from the Samtgemeinde (EUR 12500) and the municipality (EUR 12500).
"This shows how proud and happy we are that practice will continue," said Samtgemeindebürgermeister Bernd Bormann.
According to Silvia Müller-Gongoll, about 2,000 patients come into practice every quarter of the year, and there are about 500 in the Nordic average practice.
In Asendorf there is another medical practice.
A positive side effect of Frank Müller's takeover: According to Ursel Felstehausen, the pharmacy remains in Asendorf.
If she hadn't found a successor, she'd have gone too.
Anyone who visits Müller's speaking time continues to look especially in familiar faces: takes over the seven medical professionals and the cleansing power of the field houses.
With their farewell in Asendorf an era ends, after all, the doctors have practised there for 30 years.
"At the beginning we had only two rooms," Ursel remembered the rocks of the field.
A little weary already feels after a long time.
"But we live in Hohenmoor and will certainly see many patients more often," says the Internistin.
Your husband adds laughing: "We have a 6000 square meters property."
"So far, I've always pushed myself before gardening, now this could be different."
In addition, the couple has two grandchildren and likes to travel.
Croatia: "We let the refugees through"
"Now border controls will also be driven up at our southern border," said Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner.
The controls at the Hungarian border remain in parallel.
It is still clear that anyone who wants to apply for asylum can also make this "natural."
The supply and safety of human beings are at the forefront.
But it is also clear that "there is a need for clear signals," the Minister said.
People need to know that we do not accept border-free migration flows, even across the Austrian-Slovenian border.
It needs a controlled approach.
Croatia considers "corridor" - Slovenia refused
The Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia also wanted to allow arriving refugees to continue travelling towards Austria and Germany and possibly also to set up corridors for refugees.
However, this was not the way this Minister of Interior saw Vesna Györkös Znidar in Laibach.
The idea of corridors is "absolutely unacceptable," Slovenia will intensify border monitoring, especially with regard to Hungary.
The border with Croatia, on the other hand, was already heavily controlled as an external border of the Schengen area.
As the Minister pointed out, Slovenia does not want to seal its borders on refugees.
"Each EU member must fulfil its obligations, otherwise the system cannot work," emphasised Györkös Znidar.
As the Croatian government announced, the first refugees had already tried to pass through the border crossing Tovarnik / Sid in the night to Tuesday in order to avoid registration.
The Croatian police could pick her up in the nearby corn fields.
According to local media, the Croatian Tovarnik has been constantly entering police vehicles with new refugees.
It is mainly about Syrians and Afghans, including numerous women and children.
Rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use.
In the coming days, his country is counting on about 4000 refugees, said Minister of the Interior Ranko Ostojic.
In addition, buses from Presevo at the Macedonian-Serbian border, which had so far brought migrants to the Hungarian border, would be relegated to Croatia, reporting Croatian and Serbian media in agreement on Wednesday.
However, the government in Belgrade contested that it was it that it was to instruct people to take certain routes: "We cannot, nor want to do so," it was said.
According to the media reports, a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border city of Sid in the early morning, further buses would be expected in the course of the day.
About Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The inmates had been on the way through Serbia all night from the Mazedonian border, about 500 kilometers away.
"We heard that Hungary closed, so the police told us that we should go here," said one of the refugees.
They wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria.
In fact, this could lead to the shift of the former Balkan Route Turkey-Greece-Macedonia-Serbia-Hungary, which has already been predicted by observers, to a somewhat wider western route.
Croatia: "Comprehensive border control options"
Croatia's Minister for the Interior Ostojic had previously emphasised that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong influx of refugees.
He did not mention details, but he pointed out that Croatia, as a non-Schengen member, had "comprehensive border control options."
Strong controls are being carried out to qualify for membership of the Schengen area.
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 and the EU partners have been providing a good witness to the country since then as regards the standard of border controls.
On the Serbian side, about 300 refugees remain behind the Hungarian border fence.
According to Belgrade media reports, they had spent the last night at the border crossing Horgos leading to Röszke.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two border crossings of Horgos and Backi Breg remain completely locked.
Whether the remaining refugees want to continue to the Croatian border is still unclear.
The Serbian Minister of the Interior Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to calm down at a local look in Horgos on Wednesday morning: he considered the debate on alternate women of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed premature.
It would not be a very high number of refugees at present.
It is not yet possible to say whether they would continue their journey over Hungary, Croatia or another country.
Helpers advise migrants to - dangerous - alternative women
However, private Hungarian refugee helpers have already begun to distribute maps to refugees on which alternative routes are registered by Croatia.
However, the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not harmless: in parts of the border area, there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian war, which are still unsmoothed minefields.
On Wednesday afternoon, the Croatian police announced that a team of miners in the border region was sent.
Exchange hacker: Ukrainians pay 30 million dollars
Supranonok should have heard a ring of cyber criminals who are accused of having been constantly insisting on unpublished financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire, Marketwired and PR Newswire since 2010.
With the information used, insider transactions on the financial markets are expected to have been made.
According to the investigators, over 100 million dollars were gained in this way.
"Today's comparison shows that even those outside our national borders are ultimately caught," says the SEC Communication.
The processes against 32 other accused in this case continued.
Most of the accused come from Ukraine and Georgia.
The perpetrators should have acted in both the United States and Eastern Europe.
Ecumenical Hospizhilfe Mannheim has existed for 20 years
Around the Mannheimer Paradeplatz there is a good operation.
People take care of their worries, partly quick steps, partly cozy bumping.
They control the two stations of the Mannheimer car salon at the parade.
Hold city tracks.
Pulsing, pissing life with magnificent autumn sunshine and in the middle of four large tables each with the title "Before I will die..."
The Ecumenical Hospice Assistance made this action aware of its 20-year existence and is faced with mixed reactions.
"It's about life, so we went into the middle of the city and among the people," says Josefine Lammer.
The head of the Ecumenical Hospice Assistance is available to the passengers for questions and talks as well as volunteers.
While some people spontaneously grab a passport to the cry and the phrase "celebrate my life," "read," "ride the camper through the United States," "stop the war" or "not long suffer," others remain short, read, say sentences like "as far as I am not yet" and then go on.
There are always little discussions on the action itself, on life, on dealing with dying.
Peter Hübinger is on site, too.
"Only if I realize that for me at some point the end of this world comes, I can live responsibly," says the director of the Diaconic works Mannheim, which is jointly with the Caritas Association the carrier of ecumeric Hospice aid.
This publicly effective action is therefore good for the 20-year-old.
That not everyone wished to communicate to the public on the tables, but it was understandable, finally, that it was a very personal matter.
The issue of death and death remains with Tabus, according to the experience of Josefine Lammer, although the Hospice movement in recent years has contributed a great deal to the opening of people.
An assessment that Angelika Godefroid shares.
The death and mourning companion is one of the volunteers of the first hour.
Through personal experience confronted with the theme, she read a lot of literature and decided to engage in the help of death.
When the Ecumenical Hospice Assistance was requested by a call for honorary officials, she immediately notified herself and was present at the foundation in 1995.
Godefroid belongs to a team of 45 honorary officers - 43 women and two men - who accompany the affected and relatives in households, hospitals, nursing homes and Hospiz Sankt Vincent.
They're all well trained.
Angelika Godefroid can deal well with its task and experience.
"I see life from another waiting, think it is precious and appreciate the moment," she says.
The offer of the ambulant Ecumenical Hospice Service is free of charge and confession independent.
The financial support for the hospitals and donations of families and associations enables training and training and supervision of the mortality and sorrow companions.
Training is offered for new employees every two years.
The tables described on Saturday are now issued in the House of the Evangelical Church (M1, 1a) and in the House of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).
Further personal wishes can also be quoted on postcards.
FedEx result mixed, financial prospects for 2016 reduced
FedEx reports disappointing results for the last quarter, and the supplier giant reduced its profit prospect to a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its land transport service.
The company also said that she plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday.
At that time last year, FedEx announced that the company wants to cancel 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday time.
The share fell over 2.5 percent in the premarket trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said to earn a profit between $10.40 and $10.90 in the financial year that ends next May, 20 cents less than in the previous forecast.
Analysts expected $10.84 according to a survey of FactSet.
The lower prospect comes despite the price increases, which are on average 4.9 per cent and will become effective on 4 January and despite higher increases for land transport of heavy and large packages collected from November.
The company said that it nevertheless expects that the result will increase compared to the previous year due to cost reductions, higher revenues and growth in online trade.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "generates solid revenues when considering the weaker than expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade."
The plans for vacation employment were announced a day later than those of the Rival UPS, which plans to cancel 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, about the same number as last year.
In the quarter that ended on August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 percent more than in the previous year.
The result per share was $2.42 per share, just behind the $2.44 per share that predicted twelve analysts questioned by Zacks Investment Research.
Turnover increased by 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six of Zacks interviewed analysts expected $12.23 billion.
In recent years, FedEx has seen a decrease in international priority shipment, which has made sales in its unit of express shipment staggering.
But the boom in online shopping has increased the results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, turnover in land transport increased by 29 percent, but the operating result was essentially flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance.
The Express Unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices, while the result due to higher labour costs in freight business decreased.
In the premarket trade, about an hour before opening, the FedEx shares decreased by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
On Tuesday they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record level on June 11.
At its most expected session in the year, Federal Reserve Strategies spend two days this week sitting around a 27-foot Honduras-Mahagoni table to decide whether it is time to raise the lead rate for the first time for almost a decade.
There is a wall picture of the United States over them at the end of the two-sided sitting room.
The map is a reminder that the Fed President Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues are supposed to put the nation's economic interests before all other things.
The Central Bank has a double mission from the Congress: to keep the US employment and prices stable here.
But since the big recession, the Fed leaders have acknowledged that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict it. It is announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to start off from the unprecedented incentive of the near-zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008.
Although most of the economic data show that it grows steadily, recent turbulence in global financial markets could make the already cautious Fed representatives afraid to increase this volatility by increasing the interest rate on federal bonds - and it was only a quarter of a percentage point.
"Obviously, the labour market and inflation will be the most important thing they observe," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at the brokerage company Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think if they were looking for an excuse not to increase the interest rate, the increased uncertainty around the global market is sufficient justification to continue to wait," she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which makes the financial market uncertain itself.
About half of the economists who were recently questioned by Bloomberg have predicted a rise in interest this week.
However, the financial markets expect the Fed to wait, with a key indicator indicating only a 30% chance of an increase.
This suggests a decrease in the stock market if the Fed increases the rate unless the strategies reduce the impact by promising that a further increase is far away.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial average dropped by 228.89 points or by 1.4% to 16.599.85.
The action was triggered by expectations that the Fed policy will maintain the sentence this week, said John Lonski, Chefökonom at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed would lift the sentences at that time, "he said.
If she does, "she should go very far in her statement to calm down the financial markets so that they do not panic."
Other experts argued that a rise in interest would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the Fed will act.
A month ago, the Fed seemed to be in a good way to increase the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the United States.
Yellen had said in spring and early summer that in spite of Liberals' complaints that more economic progress would be necessary, she expected an increase in the rate this year.
Although job creation slowed down in August, the improvement in the labour market was solid this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest for more than seven years and near the level considered by the Fed as full employment.
Wage increases have shown signs of recovery.
And although inflation was constantly below the annual target of 2% of the central bank, the Fed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension in the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, Chefökonom at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But the financial markets all over the world gathered together at the end of last month after China had devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial average fell by more than 16% below its peak in May when investors feared that a slowing down of the Chinese economy would reduce global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, with the Dow now being almost 10% below the height of May.
For the Fed representatives the market turbulence influences the complex calculation when to increase interest rates.
"If the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks, they would attract the trains at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former member of the US Notenbank.
Now he predicts that she will wait at least a month to better control the effects.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be, and there are almost no reliable data that describe developments in China," said Oliner.
The health of the world economy is not one of the main concerns of the Fed, so it should not be technically involved in its decision-making.
But ultimately, the Fed Monetary Authority of the world has become.
The influence of the Central Bank has been enormous in recent years.
The only indication by the then leader Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could "narrow" its monetary expansion triggered confusion around the globe.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly interlinked, the Fed representatives can be expected to monitor developments elsewhere, but also consult with other central banks and experts in order to gain better understanding of the global economy.
Their decision-making is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of the global strategy for the asset management of Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA., noted this month that "the Fed has a history of overreactions on financial market movements that are apparently not linked to the economic fundamentals."
Lacker, voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, who is committed to raising interest rates, quoted decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to reduce its benchmark rate by 0.75 percentage points at three meetings "despite limited noticeable effects on growth in the US," said Lacker.
A year later, the Fed representatives reversed these reductions.
The Fed should only put aspects of financial stability at the forefront during a serious crisis such as the 2008 market collapse, said Adam S. Posen, former member of the Bank of England Interest Determination Committee.
The recent turbulence does not come near this level, he said.
"She certainly does not want to get into the situation where she is afraid of a rise in interest because the markets are exciting," said Posen, President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that is changed, I do not think it should be forwarded to time.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown.
The market / warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
LAX-C is often known as Thai Costco and is a Thai wholesale market that also sells to the general community.
Yeah, he's in Chinatown and not Thai Town.
The market / warehouse is a central contact point and offers a confusing number of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and dishes, furniture, religious jewelry and Christmas decorations.
There's even a car department if you need engine oil.
The store is huge, and it takes over an hour to slide through the corridors.
If the entire shopping shop makes you hungry, there is a meal for you in the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The garage kitchen (good and affordable) in this store is close to the cashier and has various options for participation.
What is here: Do you need something - something - Thai?
LAX-C probably has it.
Products are affordable and a number of them are sold in large quantities.
Fresh products include Asian specialities and regional Thai herbs, fruit and much more.
The meat cake is extensive, as is the fish cake - the staff behind the counter will clean and fileze the fish and even brush for you on request.
A good part of the store belongs to the massive freezer department. Here you will find frozen curry leaves, bitter melons and galgant, whole ducks, fish, bovine blood and gall, pork natural intestine, fish balls, regional sausage, commercially prepared food and more.
Who buys here: restaurant owners and cooks, also individual families and individuals.
The wide corridors are suitable for shopping wagons and forklifts.
You can find here: fresh Monthong Durian next to the box.
Where he is located: The store is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the edge of Chinatown and downtown - a few blocks away from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking space, along with other shops and restaurants.
Even if the store is well visited, it is not difficult to find a parking lot.
Hoyerswerda: Small aid for refugees
More and more refugees arrive in Germany these days.
To prepare a warm welcome to you does not go without the commitment of countless volunteers.
Also in Hoyerswerda there are a whole series of people who support unselfish asylum seekers in the city.
Among them are Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is a teacher with body and soul.
Even with its 74 lenses she still likes to teach.
Every Thursday she does it at the asylum seeker's home on Dillinger Street.
There she helps refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language.
Of course, this is quite different classes than at a real school.
Brazil's Poverty Society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breastfeeding
The Brazilian paediatric organisation SPRS tries to shocking women about how important good nutrition is during breast-feeding. It does this with the presentation of pictures of babies sucking on breasts that are painted with presentations of unhealthy food.
Nursing milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to the additional energy requirements, pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calories by about 500 calories per day.
However, new research results suggest that higher calorie input is not the only dietetic adjustment that mothers should make.
A recent study under the leadership of Robert Waterland, Professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet of the child can adversely affect the immune system.
Exceptions for the new Bernrieder Sporthalle
The municipal council of Bernried approved the construction application for the 2.3 million euros expensive sports hall.
And he made an exception.
The roof may be flat for solar systems.
The plans for the long-awaited tournament building at the Bernrieder Sports Territory are progressing step by step: at the recent municipal meeting the constructed construction request was unanimously blessed without major discussions.
In the past, the body had decided, inter alia, to apply for a "derogation" or "exemption" from the existing construction plan.
The "exception" was the authorisation for a special form regarding roof construction.
Thus, a "saddle roof with non-mid first and roof upper" is to be built.
Background to the planning is the planned use of the roof area for solar systems: "This brings us together a wonderful big southern roof," said Mayor Josef Steigenberger at the meeting.
The "liberation" was again the tendency of the roof, which should be less than ten degrees for energetic reasons than required by the construction plan.
This significantly reduces the volume of the hall.
A "exemption" was therefore necessary because the construction plan regarding roof tendency does not allow "exceptions" - the Bernrieder Municipality Council usually makes a rather restrictive application for exemption.
However, it is not a recurring project: "We do not create a precedent," said Steigenberger.
The Turnhallenbau am Sportzentrum is a joint project of the municipality and SV Bernried.
Cost is estimated at around 2.3 million euros.
Grants are expected from the promotion of schools and broadsports.
In the next step of the procedure, the construction application for the 18 x 36 meters hall will now be submitted for examination to the county council.
Clinic Peißenberg moves to Schongau
The Peißenberg Hospital is to be closed earlier than planned - that is, 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) becomes a new medical director at the hospital Schongau.
The station and the majority of employees move from Peißenberg to Schongau.
This is the surprising plans of the Hospital GmbH of the countryside, confirmed by Countess Andrea Jochner-White.
However, a decision on this is taken by the Supervisory Board, which will meet next Wednesday, 23 September.
If the plans were implemented, all of the nearly 50 employees at the hospital in Peißenberg would continue to work.
The vast majority should move with fishermen and the remaining inner station to Schongau.
The rooms are available.
The employees who cannot go to Schongau are to be offered a job in Weilheim, says Jochner-White.
The staff were informed of the plans.
The change has triggered the termination of Dr. Andreas Eder, who has only been a medical director of the Schongauer Clinic since the beginning of the year and is now switching to a private practice near the hospital.
According to Jochner-White, the name "Fischer," who agreed to take the lead from 1 October and to switch with his team to Schongau, came into play with the question of who to follow.
For the house in Schongau, this was in any case a "upgrade" and a broadening of the offer in the area of "Internal Medicine," says Jochner-White.
Fischer is a specialist in cardiovascular and defibrillators.
Schongau (180 beds) is specialized in gastroenterological diseases at the inner station.
For the next two years, when the Board of Supervisors agrees, fishermen and fishermen are to lead both houses until next year the former hospital of the scarcity, which still has 35 beds, will be finally closed in Peißenberg after almost 140 years.
Until now, the district had planned this for 2018 when the current rehabilitation at Weilheim Hospital is completed.
Landrätin Jochner-Weiß, who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board, opposed rumors that the house owned by the Bundesknappschaft should be used in future as accommodation for asylum seekers.
"I exclude this." As it goes on with the property, Jochner-White could not say that there are several considerations.
There is currently a short-term care of the Caritas and a day-to-day hospital.
"What better could not happen to us, such an opportunity does not come back," said Fischer through the quasi move to the leak, which had been "positive and very understandable" by the employees.
A real perspective for the house where fishermen have been working as a chief doctor for more than 30 years has not been there.
He had been asked by Mr Schongauer's colleagues to take over the post of the medical director.
The Peißenberg Hospital (once 100 beds) has been threatened by closure over the past decades, departments have been closed, for example surgery and birth assistance.
The handballs of the Rhine-Neckar Lions are required tonight (8.15 p.m.) at the HC Mountain.
Although the table leader of the Bundesliga is the clear favourite in Wuppertal, there is no reason for superiority.
In the past season, the baths took a painful defeat at the BHC and have to make some good there.
Hunt accident with two injured at Pratau
Two tractor drivers were severely injured during their maize harvest on Tuesday afternoon by gunshots.
During the Aberntning on a Maisfeld at Pratau (district of Wittenberg), several hunters were in use, as the police informed.
After a shooting, a 63-year-old man suffered serious injuries and was brought to hospitals.
How exactly it could come to the accident was first unclear.
Criminal police are investigating.
Missed 16-year-olds from Rhineland-Palatinate victims of violent crimes
A suspect has led the police to the body of the 16-year-old missing from Rhineland-Palatinate since Saturday.
In interrogation, the 20-year-old admitted to have killed the young people and thrown their body into a channel in Rockenhausen.
A 16-year-old missing from Rhineland-Palatinate since Saturday has fallen victim to a crime of violence.
The body of the young woman was found on Tuesday night in Rockenhausen at Kaiserslautern, as prosecutor and police announced on Wednesday.
A 20-year-old who was also arrested on Tuesday night is considered to be a suspect of the act, who had given the statement and led the investigators to the location of the body.
The 16-year-old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after she had not come home as agreed on the eve of a fall party in Rockenhausen.
In the search for the young woman the investigators first encountered personal objects of the victim.
In interviews in the group of friends and acquaintances of the missing, there was a suspicion of fact against the 20-year-olds.
The suspected perpetrator then led the police to a channel in Rockenhausen where the body was found.
According to the arrest, the authorities admitted to the police interrogation, killed the 16-year-old and put the body in the channel.
The 20-year-old should be presented to the warden on Wednesday, the investigators are putting him to death.
The purpose of the further investigation is to provide information on the circumstances of the action.
Refugees need accommodation: Study warns against housing gap
The situation on the German housing market is tense.
More and more refugees are looking for a affordable stay.
The pressure on the housing market is growing.
Social housing is facing a challenge.
The distribution battles on the German housing market have already begun.
With the coming refugees and job seekers from the EU, more and more people are pushing for a market that is already overburdened in many large cities.
They compete with low income citizens for the last affordable apartments.
To meet the demand for affordable apartments, 400,000 new units would have to be built every year by 2020.
This is the result of a study on behalf of the Association Department of Social Housing.
Comparison: This year 260,000 units will be finished in Germany.
140,000 apartments are missing.
After the first three months of their stay, refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in an initial reception.
Many then hit the housing market and enter the long snakes in front of the rental apartments.
According to the Federal Statistical Office, however, less than half of all asylum seekers lived for rent last year.
However, the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the increasing number of refugees.
The study also shows significant failures in the housing policy of recent years.
Germany is pushing up a housing deficit, which is growing from year to year.
Currently, around 770,000 residential units were already missing in the urban areas, complains Matthias Günther, author of the study.
Many professionals therefore lived in large towns and cities in an emergency area in WG rooms.
Young adults stayed in the "Hotel Mama" for an unwillingly longer period due to the flute on the housing market.
The number of square meters per capita in the major cities has declined for the first time in recent years.
In order to solve the problem, the Alliance "Social Housing" proposes a restart.
The aim is to restore new incentives to social housing.
In this way, the basic commercial tax could be waived and the basic tax on subsidised dwellings could be suspended on a temporary basis.
In addition, according to the Alliance, attractive tax depreciation options are needed.
The KfW State Bank's support programme for refugee accommodation is already good for cities and municipalities.
A good week after the start had already been retrieved on Monday night with 184 million euros more than half of the around 300 million euros available.
Now the project could even be increased.
Refugees have free joke: Croatia and Slovenia set up corridor
To Hungary, there is practically no more passage, as more and more refugees choose the way through Croatia.
Zagreb announces to grant transit through Slovenia to the north without obstacles.
However, the route is dangerous.
Croatia wants to agree with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees.
"I have spoken to the Slovenian Minister of the Interior, and if necessary, we will organise a corridor," said the Croatian Minister of Interior Ranko Ostojic.
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area.
The EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country.
After the shutdown of the Serbian-Hungarian border, hundreds of refugees have broken up to Croatia to get from there to Western Europe.
500 people have come across the border at Tovarnik, the Croatian television station RTL reports.
Hungary had locked off its border for refugees on the previous day.
New laws which entered into force on the same day also make regular asylum procedures in Hungary practically redundant.
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass.
The Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said: "You can travel through, and we are preparing for this possibility."
These people are here, they are women, children and men who want to live and achieve something.
However, it was people who did not want to live in Croatia.
The Croatian police attacked the first refugees at the Serbian border to the EU neighbouring country of Croatia in the morning.
According to most media reports, they came from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan.
They came to the Serbian border city of Sid by bus as well as by taxi.
Immediately after their arrival, they would have tried to walk across the green border to Croatia.
However, on the Croatian-Serbian border, refugees do not face border ceilings.
There are other dangers in the border line: there are still sharp mines from the Yugoslav Civil War in the 1990s.
Mining spaces should now quickly create a safe passage.
After closing the border, however, there are hardly any more refugees to Hungary.
On Tuesday, the police counted 366 people arrested.
Shortly before the tower closes on Monday, there had been 9380.
The new Hungarian laws identified the overcoming and damaging of the border zone as a crime.
35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the southern Hungarian border town of Szeged.
The sentenced are threatening to imprisonment for up to five years and the deportation from the country.
According to the Immigration Authority, 94 applications for asylum were received on Tuesday in the new "transit zones" set up at the border, of which almost all - 93 - were the most important transition to Röszke.
Among the applicants were 13 families with small children and two elderly people.
On Wednesday morning, 40 refugees would have stayed there.
In practice, however, no one has a prospect of getting asylum in Hungary.
In Hungarian view, Serbia is a "safe third country."
The refused asylum seekers should be deployed there.
Before the "transit zone" in Röszke, only a few hundred refugees gathered.
In Röszke, workers started to clean up.
They collected the trash that tens of thousands of people left at the edge of the street in recent weeks.
Lock gates were dismantled and one of the reception warehouses in the border site was rebuilt.
No one wanted to comment on the purpose of this reconstruction.
Austria reaches few refugees after the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary.
The country has also strengthened its border controls.
Around 20,000 migrants were still in the country according to government data.
In Salzburg, about 1400 people are waiting for the trip to Germany.
Traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning on instructions from German authorities.
In Freilassing, smaller groups of refugees regularly entered on foot.
Mayor drove "stranded" across the border
"We were busy cleaning up after the bridge party on Sunday, when ten people suddenly stood with travel bags at the entrance of the tent," said Wernsteins Mayor Alois Stadler.
Tourists, they wanted to take the train to Passau.
However, because Germany had stopped the train traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the refugee stream, "said Stadler, who immediately offered his help and the disrupted along with two other helpers and their cars across the border to the near Passau.
Previously, we first cheered the unexpected guests, with jause and drinks.
We said we'd take her to Passau by car.
"This was of course for us," said Stadler in the OÖN conversation.
You were very grateful.
A man was not allowed to give a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire department.
"We were very pleased," said Stadler.
On Sunday evening, the stranded train passengers moved from an ICE to a regional train towards Passau in Wels, to try to cross the border after the short-term announcement that the train was stopped to Germany.
However, the regional train was set in front of the border in Wernstein at the Inn.
In Wernstein the cross-border is generally high in course.
The bridge festival connected to the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday cheerful, day before a two bridge race sports - organized by the Union Wernstein and Bavaria from Neukirchen.
The fact that Viktor Orbán now sends us another thousand cigarettes is a logical result of a hypocritical policy:
Instead of helping immediately in the camp of Röszke in the construction of structures that guarantee humanity, our Chancellor has placed the position of the Hungarian Government in the dark circle of national socialism publicly and officially.
It is not just those of Austria who are now faced with chaotic conditions in the border areas.
The poultry will also have to note that the "promised country" that she has invited and welcomed is nothing but another refugee camp.
It will be a major challenge, given the continuing flows of refugees and the coming winter, to create decent conditions for protection seekers with us.
And it will be even greater - to maintain peace, security and stability in Austria.
Konrad on the search for 35,000 winter-resistant quarters
Konrad has all its hands to do with refugee housing.
Christian Konrad is used to having his word weight.
The government has set up the former powerful Raiffeisen banker to set up quarters for the thousands of refugees.
The chaos at the first reception centre Traiskirchen has already been handled by Konrad.
"We no longer have homeless people in Traiskirchen," he reported his first success.
The accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday had also taken place without a great spin, said Konrad and praised the organisational "Master's Performance."
On the other hand, the Ministry of the Interior spoke of a "crisis situation."
In total, Konrad expects a need of 85,000 quarters in the year.
In order to meet the number, there are still 35,000 accommodations to be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 are to provide the countries, 15,000 of the federation.
If there are more refugees, we can do it.
"But it's not a barrel without ground," said Konrad.
He has already had talks with the heads of the country.
They would have assured him to create quarters for the future refugees.
"It's going well in Upper Austria," said Ferry Maier.
The former VP Mandatar supports Konrad.
Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn, to clarify how the church will help.
The Asylum Coordinator also puts great expectations in the ORF action "Help like us."
On the platform, individuals can offer easy accommodation.
It is also hoped for hotels that are empty in winter.
Konrad and Maier yesterday criticized the standards for accommodation as "very high."
In emergency times it cannot be that quarterers have to comply with a certain height of the towel holder or size of the upper lights.
For a limited period of time, "emergency standards" should apply.
Conrad's experience is that he is more successful in lodging, unlike the Ministry of the Interior.
I am an older gentleman, who is not simply told the truth in the face.
Conviction is his most important weapon.
Konrad and Maier do not cause any costs to the Republic, as they said themselves.
Your employees want to increase them to three to four.
Its own quarterly search has not yet been successful.
Konrad wanted to set up a container at Stephansplatz as an office.
But there are obviously problems with the approval.
Linz calls for better division
At the moment, no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips-Arena and Design Center to accommodate refugees is planning the city of Linz.
This is not necessary at the moment as it is currently possible to accommodate those affected without these measures, says Mayor Klaus Luger (SP).
However, for the emergency, further locations should be tested for their suitability.
The city leader criticizes the division of refugees within the country.
Other districts must also make their contribution here.
Seehofer: "Borders are not sealed off"
In a longer telephone call with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU) on Monday, Landeshauptmann Josef Pühringer (VP) accrued further action on the refugee issue.
Seehofer has assured me that the German borders will not be locked off.
Refugees to the Federal Republic could continue to travel.
However, there are now the relevant border controls.
Special trains with refugees to Germany will no longer exist for the time being.
However, the protection seekers would be brought to Germany with regular trains.
The other EU Member States once again called for increased solidarity in the refugee issue.
The fact that Austria is re-introducing controls at its borders is "a logical consequence" for Pühringer from the German action.
The next runtastic is a matter of time
The General Restoration of the "New Shipyard" in the Linzer Industrial Line is officially completed.
In four of the six floors of the office and production building, the listed IT group S & T is included, and the rest (2700 square meters) is to be rented to young, innovative companies from the technology sector.
"In IT the smart heads are our raw material - and we have to try to work for us," says S & T Chief Hannes Niederhauser.
He could imagine investing in startup companies of the New Shipyard and then acquiring some.
From the beginning, S & T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - some of which Niederhauser promises: "The next runtastic is just a matter of time."
1.7 million euros were invested by S & T in the site, 3.3 million euros from the Technical Centre, which belongs to one third of the city of Linz, the Land of Upper Austria and the Federation (FFG).
The building is parked by Linz AG for 60 years to S & T as well as Techcenter.
30 percent of the 2700 square meters remaining area in the building are already rented, for further 40 percent there are requests.
Lia Peroni owner opened second business in the Arkade
Furla handbags are at the heart of the new shop.
Actually, Jutta Breit wanted to lay down a dog.
This project had to postpone the 49-year-old owner of Lia Peroni in the pigeon market arcade in short: finally, she has now gained growth in the form of another business place.
In the Furla shop opposite the business where they sell bags, bags, shoes and clothing of various manufacturers, everything is about women's handbags of the brand Furla, wallet is from 75 euros.
Larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros.
The new shop has been in operation since yesterday.
Previously, several weeks had been rebuilt.
"I've been thinking about opening another store for a long time," says Breit.
Among other things, the decision was that the Furla producers who are at home in Bologna were also affected by the idea of their own location where only their handbags are sold.
"We are the only ones in the large area of Linz who sell this brand," says the mother of two daughters who have Italian roots themselves.
Her fashion interest has been put wide from her mother into the cradle.
I am the most suited if something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices.
Why some of these women are in discussion when they look at a beautiful handbag, the specialist woman cannot answer with the last certainty.
Maybe it's because a beautiful bag upgrades every outfit.
The Brulljesmacher from Kallstadt
The Pfalzer ancestors of Donald Trump came from a place whose inhabitants are called a member.
This property also connects some with the billionaire who wants to be the President of the United States.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for exciters.
Whether he speaks in hostility, affects journalists or reveals gaps of knowledge in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US President's Office is vigorously launching the campaign.
And cut it off well.
This is also registered in the Pfalzische Kallstadt, where the grandparents of the real estate billionaire originate.
The New Yorker with the fountain hair is a term for many in the Winzerdorf on the wine road.
Some in the 1200-dwelling place is more than -fifty corners related to it.
His grandfather came from Kallstadt in the Palatinate: Donald Trump, here in the campaign mode.
The Cold Town Simone Wendel made a film about Trump.
And what do the villagers think about his goal of becoming the most powerful man in the world?
"I think they find this kind of exciting, but in their cold city way, too, are not very impressed," says Simone Wendel.
The native Cold Town has made a fun documentary about the place and its famous Sprösslinge, among which the Ketchup family Heinz also counts next to Trump.
Trump, who is not known for humility, also speaks in "Kings of Kallstadt" (2014) - so with the statement that he would certainly also succeed if he lived in Kallstadt.
He didn't bring it there to the king of the hearts.
Although there is respect for the performance of the family, but also tendency to believe that Trump is "already a bit of a big mole," says Wendel.
By chance, the nickname, the Callstadt in the district, "Die Brulljesmacher" - was high German: the Anger, she says.
So Trump comes from the village of the Ancients.
The Trump's success story began in 1885, when the later grandfather emigrated and opened a place for gold diggers in the United States.
Grundstein des Immobilienkonzerns war erste Grundstücksverkauf in New York.
But the life of the grandparents was not free of tragedy: your desire to return to the home for a long time failed in the Bavarian state, to which the Palatinate belonged at that time.
He did not record Trump because he once left without permission, the director of the Institute for Pope History and People's Knowledge, Roland Paul, had declared a film start.
Trump is the grandson of a "illegal emigrant."
This is in contrast to the sometimes marked statements of the descendant.
He had repeatedly spoken abruptly about Mexican immigrants in the United States and called for the construction of a border wall to scare illegal immigrants.
"Like the poltered, this is not so sympathetic," says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant relative trumps ("The grandma was a born trump, the grandfather was born Heinz").
The winner in retirement sees the American rather distant, "he is always so exciting."
Does he think Trump's coming?
"I can't imagine that," says the 72-year-old.
"He never took care of Kallstadt."
The pensionist Veronika Schramm mentioned like some cold town that a descendant of the Heinz family donated something to the church organ when visiting, which generally came well.
"I can't imagine that from Donald," says the 68-year-old.
She thinks it would be better if he didn't win the choice, because "he has such radical views, I don't know if that's good."
If those who were in charge at the time of his grandfather in the United States would have been like him, "he would never have arrived there."
"There are more interesting topics than him," says Winner's daughter Sarah Bühler.
And as president?
"My president is not," she says.
And, "The grapes will be mature without the President Trump."
Wendel's film, for which Trump has been interviewed for a long time, has seen 12 000 cinematographer, even in the USA the interest awakens.
The Oberbayerische Gemeinde Ramsau bei Berchtesgaden is Germany's first "Bergsteigerdorf."
From the hands of the Vice President of the German Alpenclub, Ludwig Wucherpfennig, the 1800 inhabitants village received the award for soft tourism in the Berchtesgaden National Park on Wednesday.
In Austria there are already 20 "Mountaineering Doors."
In the neighbouring country, the Alpine Association is responsible for awarding the award.
A mountain farmer village may not have more than 2500 inhabitants.
At least one fifth of its area must be designated as a protected area.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the reviews, despite the attempts of Nine to take over the loss of leadership at the Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson hurry to Canberra to report after the loss of leadership of the Liberals, but it has not made any major delays in the reviews for today.
The Nine breakfast show was broadcast by the Federal capital when Malcolm Turnbull made Tony Abbott fall.
The Rivale Sunrise, with the moderators David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was part of a one-week series of international television broadcasts, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This disadvantage of the distance seemed not to matter for Australian television viewers, as Sunrise achieved on average 397,000 viewers in the five capitals, compared to today 339,000.
Today, there was a slight increase compared to the ratings for Monday (317.000) and last Tuesday (283.000), but his number remained behind that of last Thursday (343.000).
Today has closed the gap to Sunrise in recent months.
In August today reached an average of 318.000 compared to the 330.000 of Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the difference was between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far, in September, Sunrise has an average of 349.000 viewers at 314.000 at Today.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning.
The winds of change affect these morning people more than Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for the check!

The great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series star of Packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama of a newly enlightened father, who decided to settle with his two children on the coast of New Zealand, reached a very impressive number of 1,219 million spectators.
Critics had wondered whether Thomson could wear a hit show solo without the Rafters Star Rebecca Gibney.
The result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear "yes."
The X-Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.136 million spectators and easily beat The Block (838.000) and TBL Families (726.000).
Seven had mixed results on night two of The Chase Australia.
The first half-hour (17: 00 to 5: 30) of the new Quiz show, moderated by Andrew O'Keefe, published on average 446,000 spectators.
The second half hour (17: 30 to 18: 00) jumped to 623.000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuire's Hot Seat (613.000).
On Monday evening, the first half hour of The Chase Australia achieved 520,000 spectators and in the second half of the hour, 720,000 were set.
Hot-Seat average 620,000.
The fall in the quotas of the second evening of The Chase Australia will vote with confidence that Hot-Seat will eventually be enforced at 17: 30.
The Chase Australia is a substitute for a million dollars minute that did not get over McGuire's show.

The last three agree: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose?
Secret revealed?...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may be unaware of who wins The Bachelor.
The woman where Sam Wood finally ends up in The Bachelor was held in great secrecy.
And none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose.
But when we checked in with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before three of them become, you may accidentally have given a clue to who will be the winner.
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed to the final on Thursday
All three women have taken a lyrical view of why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positive attitude as reasons why they want to be his partner.
However, if the question is asked, "If you don't, who should get the last rose of Woods," their answers could become the destructor who won the Bachelor's heart.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly called Mackay, except themselves, the best partner for Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from the first day.
"From the moment I went into the house and noticed (Sarahs) and Sam's energies, I felt they were quite compatible, and I thought that throughout the show," said Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah stands on Earth with both feet, it's so much fun to be with her," added Markoski.
I've seen them together, and they have the right chemistry.
They feel comfortable and comfortable together.
Sarah Mackay thinks that she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple.
From her point of view, Mackay said that the visit last week made it clear to her that Wood could be "the One."
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and the family, I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I am now unconditional on him," she said.
And when she was asked who Wood should choose, if not she, she was mysterious.
"I don't know if I can say that," she said.
I love the remaining girls alike - it's an undecided between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be broadcast to ten on Wednesday, 7: 30.
Originally published as Sarah's first choice for Sam Wood?
Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the United States - and there were many other teams who sent requests after his impressive open training day at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and Coach Jim Tomsula and it looks like a smart decision.
Some trainers would have banished Hayne to the bank for the rest of the game when he lost a quarrel as the Aussie-Rugby-Liga-Convertit did at his first point return on Tuesday at 20-3 victory against Minnesota.
But Tomsula trusted his husband and gave Hayne the next opportunity to return a point and also to the ongoing game after an injury to Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his true face in the changing cabin after the game.
Instead of milling his rookies before the rest of the team through the mill, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly strengthened Hayne in his post-game press conference.
The 49er sports reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget his trapped catch and take care of the next game.
Jarryd Hayne patches at a point that was restored by the Minnesota Vikings in the first quarter of the game
It was certainly not the start that Hayne and his massive Australian followers had hoped for his NFL debut.
Hayne left the field following the fumble fluctuating and later told the Australian Radio Duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not imagine a worse start in his NFL career,
"That was one thing that happens, you just take care of the next game, and that's it," said Hayne.
Hayne compared the Schnitzer with his original debut in 2007, when a passport in his own in-goal area led to a try for Queensland.
It was a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne positioned for a photo with fans, holding an Australian flag after the game and posted it on his Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss the rights of gay people
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest man, was arrested on a Siberian rolling field with arms force.
After he had openly challenged President Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, seized his oil company Yukos and prevented his democratic efforts.
The free voters demand the recruitment of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high numbers of refugees.
At the beginning of the FW autumn clauses in Great Wall Town, Heads of the Party and Group Hubert Aiwanger warned against a serious crisis at Bavaria's schools if there are not exactly new teachers for the many new students: "We need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep schools from collapsing," Aiwanger said.
"Otherwise, we will get disruptions in the Bavarian education system."
The countryside group of the free voters will meet in the subfrench municipality until Friday.
In fact, quite other main themes were planned.
But the record number of refugees now also dominates the free voter meeting.
"Of course the issue of asylum will overlay the clauses," said Aiwanger.
Aiwanger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria, as it was during the Yugoslavia wars in the 1990s.
"That's not how it goes, we have to deal with the causes," said the free electoral chief.
Rejected asylum seekers want to postpone the free voters as soon as possible.
That is why Aiwanger also required more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum appeals: "We also need at least 50 new asylum judges," said Aiwanger.
The FW chief criticised that several federal states were not consistent: "We need unified federal standards of the federal states."
"Bayern is pushing off, others are not."
"We need to get more active."
But the country policy in the city of the Great Wall should not fall under the table.
A permanent burner for years remains on the agenda: education policy.
For the new school year, Cultural Minister Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) at 47 gymnasians started the pilot experiment "Medium-level plus," with an extension of the high-school middle-level from three to four years - as a result it will take nine years to graduate again.
But Aiwanger doesn't go far enough.
"The subject G9 needs to be accelerated," said the FW boss.
We demand freedom of choice for all the gymnasians who want it.
Free drive at the G9 wherever desired.

4 people killed after policemen shot rubber shots on demonstrators in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber shots into a crowd of people demonstrating against the proposed new Constitution, said an official on Wednesday.
The violence broke out on Tuesday night in the district of Rupandehi, about 175 miles west of the capital of Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, head district officer, said that more than 1,000 demonstrators had gathered outside a police station, with some of you throwing stones and fire bombs.
Mr. Dhakal said the police had used tear gas and then shot into the air before she relied on rubber shots.
Twenty cops and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the rubber boots used, which are known to be able to kill, but which are traditionally used as less fatal alternatives, apparently produced such a high death rate.
The dispute was the last violent protests in weeks in Nepal's southern levels, where members of the ethnic group of Madhesi say that new provinces formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence.
There were also protests in Western Nepal from the ethnic group of Tharus who want their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been in violent conflicts since the 10th century.
Killed August when the four major political parties signed an agreement to split the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has been centrally governed for centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008, but the legislators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
The legislators voted this week on certain clauses in the draft Constitution in Kathmandu, and officials said that the new Constitution could enter into force on Sunday.
Construction area planned in the city
The property at the Emder Youth Center Old Post is to be rebuilt.
The city is currently preparing everything for marketing the 4000 square meters area.
A mixture of trade, commerce and housing is planned - but there are no specific offers yet.
Emden - The city of Emden wants to market a land of about 4000 square meters in a direct neighborhood to the Old Post Youth Centre.
Preparations are currently under way.
It is planned to use the site for a mixture of trade, commerce and housing.
You wait for the corresponding offers, it says from the city.
What investor is concerned is not yet clear.
Accordingly, no contracts had been concluded.
The city of Emden had bought a part of the property, located on the Ringstraße / corner of the Great Street, a few months ago and had the building on it ripped off.
Project Hieve: Details are on the table
The plans for the holiday house settlement at the small sea near Emden take shape.
The investor presented public plans for the project for the first time.
Some airlines are still concerned - they fear the sale of their leisure refuge
For months behind closed doors had been negotiated, groomed, debated and drawn.
Now the plans for a new holiday house settlement near Emden are on the table.
The interested party, the medium-sized emder company "System Construction," presented its plans publicly on Monday evening in the Emder Council's Committee on Urban Development for the first time.
This item had originally been on the non-public part of the agenda.
Under the pressure of the project critics and the FDP group, who prevailed on the investor and the administration of secrecy, Ralf Behrends went from the system construction management to the offensive: "We have not yet responded to all questions," he said in front of the council members and more than 50 visitors.
But it would be good to meet all the rumors now.
The 10 to 12 million euro project has been under discussion for months.
Heavy reactions among seafood owners who had come to the meeting highlighted the pictures and new details of the desired hotel building.
Roberto Schulz, owner of the sea bay and member of the board of directors in the representation of the airlines, Pro Hieve, complains: "This is going to be a gigantic boost that surprises all other buildings."
He also fears, like some other project critics, that the intended size of the plant would increase considerably: "There must be whole bus loads to calculate this," said Schulz.
What happens exactly on the well a hectare large area of the former hostel, however, is still open.
There's no operator yet.
"First we must have a conclusive concept," Ralf Behrends said.
Because this was still missing, the cultivation plans were also variable.
Twin-generation at Gorillas in the Frankfurter Zoo
The Frankfurter Zoo is pleased to be young at his gorillas.
The 26-year-old Dian brought twins to life yesterday.
Twin births are rare in Gorilla's.
The last one in a German zoo is almost 50 years old and had been to Frankfurt in 1967, it is said by the zoo.
The sex of the newborn Gorilla twins is not yet established, as Mother Dian has kept her close to her body so far.
At first, the "picture" had been reported.
NHC predicts 60% chance for cyclone south of the Cape Verde islands
On Tuesday, the US National Hurricane Center predicted a wide deep pressure system about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verde islands, which has a 60% chance to develop into a tropical whirlstorm in the next 48 hours.
Another clearly defined low pressure system, for example, in the middle between the Cape Verde islands and the small Antilles, has also a 60% potential to form a tropical whirlstorm in the next two days, added the weather experts stationed in Miami.
Google launches double donation campaign to collect $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL. O) announced a double donation campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organisations to help thousands of refugees who have routed the European nations as they flee from the war-torn and harmed countries.
Google has an unusual personal approach to announcing the donation call on its blog.
Instead of having a manager make the announcement, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled from Kabul with her family when she was seven years old, wrote about her personal experience.
"Our journey included many dark railways and buses, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I was lucky.
But since the refugee and migrant crisis has grown in Europe, many people like my family are desperately looking for help.
The donations are made to four non-profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants: doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said that the first global donations collected up to a value of 5.5 million on google.com / refugee to $11 million are doubled.
Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since World War II, largely caused by the four-year civil war in Syria, which has displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many flee from the war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

For slightly overweight diabetics weight loss surgery can be helpful.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes may take at least five years after a new study.
It is still too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those receiving non-surgical treatments.
"The mortality data take a long time to show something," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on weight loss surgery, who wrote a lead article on the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight-loss operations or adipositas surgery, use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body's ability to take food.
Over the years, Adipositas surgery for the treatment of type 2 diabetes has been shown to be effective, but most studies have been performed in people who are ill-fed with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a certain degree of weight in terms of size, is considered to be normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI over 30 are considered to be fatty.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov / 1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, the researchers from Taiwanese Min-Sheng General Hospital used data that they collected in a study since 2007, comparing two types of adipositas surgery - gastric bypass and gastric sludge - to medical treatment for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight.
The average BMI of those undergoing this operation decreased from 31 to 24.5 to the end of the fifth year in this study.
In the meantime, BMI remained approximately the same in those who received non-surgical diabetes treatments with 29.
Among those undergoing surgical surgery, 36% of the patients resolved the diabetes disease completely and 28%.
In the medical-treated group, diabetes was completely resolved with only one percent and in part with only about two percent.
In addition, the results of the control of blood pressure, triglycerides and "poor" LDL cholesterol "were generally better in the 'surgical' group," the authors found out.
Researchers also monitored the patient's blood levels of haemoglobin A1c, reflecting the blood sugar levels over time.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers write.
After the operation, the mean haemoglobin A1c level decreased from around 9 percent to about 6 percent.
However, in the medical treatment group it remained stable at about 8 percent.
But this better "glycaemic control" - as reflected in the improved haemoglobin A1c level - did not reduce mortality in five years, according to the senior researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results for the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the Bypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the host rectomy group (18.7 versus 14.2 kg), achieved greater reductions in BMI (7.4 versus 5.1) and haemoglobin A1c (3.1% versus 2.1%) and rather reported complete overcoming diabetes (46.9% versus 16.7%).
While the new study does not show a survival advantage of surgery after five years, there are indications from a study of more serious people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life, says Blackstone from the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, it was about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years in fatty people who underwent an adipositas operation - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study showed no advantage for survival in surgical patients, Blackstone said it was calming for people with a BMI below 35 who are interested in the procedure.
"This is the critical point of this study because she says that this operation is lower in this lower BMI group," she said, without an increased risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient with his BMI is between 27 and 30.
"I think we're waiting too long for people to take this seriously," she said.
I think that once they have collected these genetic changes that have connected their bodies firmly to fat and diabetes, a reversal is really difficult. "
Love History plays in the Hunsrück
It is a topic that is currently becoming more attentive in Belletristik: a young woman, unpopular and indecent at school, returns to the swarm of her youth after years, and this woman falls in love with her.
So also in the recently published novel "Actually we are not so" by Luisa Binder.
In addition to the history of love, the novel is probably especially interesting for Hunsrücker readers, because he plays in boring and surrounding localities.
The main professional author grew up in boring and was pleased that she could put a literary monument on her home.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT news
Europe could not accept all refugees, said the Dalai Lama, and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis is in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for the end of violence in the countries of origin of refugees.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the continuing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten-day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which deals with ethics studies.
He called for the interests of humanity to be placed before the interests of individual nations or even continents under the circumstances.
He also stressed that the response of the Western European countries to the refugee crisis was admirable, but that the situation was not appropriate.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama of Germany and Austria commended efforts to deal with the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"To take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you need to think about long-term solutions, how to create real peace and real development, mainly through education, for these Muslim countries," he stressed.
In the end, we need to think about how to reduce killing in their countries.
We must reduce the use of violence.
"The use of violence has never solved these problems," he added.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush's actions after the terrorist attack of September 11, and showed that the violent reaction of the United States led to a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 11 September, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush, and I told him that the way to resolve this problem is in the absence of violence.
"I know his motives were good, but he used violence, and that caused unexpected consequences," said Dalai Lama.
Four-fold increase in the use of hand disinfectants by children in the last 4 years
Poison control centres in the USA report an almost 400% increase in the number of children under 12 years who swallow highly alcoholic hand disinfectant, according to the Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, Director of the Georgia Poison Center, the cases of revenues of hand disinfectants in children under 12 years of age reporting toxic control centres increased from 3.266 in 2010 to 16.117 in 2014.
"Children come to these products more and more frequently, and unfortunately a percentage of them go into emergency," said Lopez CNN.
He said that some children deliberately drink disinfectants while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mutation in social media.
Videos on YouTube show how young disinfectants drink only because of a cheap experience.
Young people have allegedly mixed disinfectants with alcoholic oral water to obtain a harder drink.
Younger children can be attracted by attractive scents of the disinfectants.
"A child does not think this is bad for it," said Lopez.
Many of the more attractive (hand disinfectants) are those that are perfumed.
There are disinfectants with strawberry, grape and orange scent that are very attractive for children.
Hand disinfectants contain between 45% and 95% alcohol somewhere.
Few injectors can lead to alcohol poisoning, especially in infants.
"It is highly concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the toxic emergency centre at the hospital of the University of Kansas, the transmitter Fox 4 in Kansa City.
So, you wouldn't leave a drink of whiskey around, but people leave this hand disinfectant in the reach of children, and when children come to it, it's a quick possibility to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently had taken four injections from a strawberry scent of hand disinfectant in school, was brought into an emergency.
Her blood alcohol concentration was 179, twice higher than the threshold that is legally considered drunk in an adult, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency doctor who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah lurked her words and was unable to go when she arrived at the emergency.
Doctors supervised them in a separate child hospital for signs of brain trauma, as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and hit her head, said Ritchey.
"That was very frightening," said Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, CNN.
It could have been deadly for my child.
Lopez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol-free products or disinfectants and to store hand disinfectants outside the child's range.
Apart from alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants were associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women died in Ontario after swallowing hand disinfectants containing a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Health authorities' staff suspect that the product contained methanol, a deadly solution, instead of ethyl alcohol, which was listed as an active substance.
In January, three students of the fourth class in the state of New York planned to poison their "common" teacher by interpreting antibacterial products around the teaching room, "it reported a police report.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand disinfectants and banished them from her room.
The police considered the devastated plan as a "thrust" and referred disciplinary measures to the school authority.
Villingen swings: Three vehicles damaged

Griffiths plays talk about disharmony down
There are rumors about disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, which was spontaneously rejected by Griffiths. This insisted that he and his crew comrades are not under increased control because they are preparing for the confrontation with the Dutch table guide.
I don't think we feel under pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
The lack of title competition in Scottish football bores Dutch - de Boer
The former rangers middle field player and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Boer has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic, there is no title rivalry with the rangers.
De Boer, currently an ambassador to Ajax, said: "In the Netherlands they no longer show the highlights of the Celtic Games and why?"
It's because the Rangers aren't here.
People here don't just talk about the rangers' return.
You're talking about the Old Company.
They're talking about both teams, and that's what she's interested in.
There's a lot of tension in the old company games, and it's not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games.
I'm gonna turn things around, Deila swore.
RONNY Deila has accepted that Celtic has to fight, but the Norwegian boss swore to change things.
After the defeat against Malmö and the subsequent exit from the Champions League, the defeat against 10-men from Aberdeen, which are now clearly at the top of the table with five points ahead.
But Deila said, "Celtic had bad times before, and we will come back."
Now we want to get out of there as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what happens.
We feel exactly that way - but we have to move on.
We really need, really the support of Celtic, because that makes the players better.
Coming together now is so important.
Warburton careful on January transfers
In spite of his comments just a few weeks ago, which indicated that he was picking up some January transfers, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is careful when signing new access and insists that he does not want to disturb the Ibrox squad's unit.
Brentford's ex-boss said, "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
The players who come in the summer have this preseason time to integrate what you saw with our own group in this season.
The crew is really good.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic Target Michu with Return Instructions
Swansea Stormer Michu, with Celtic in conversation during the transfer period, suggested that he could withdraw when his contract expires with the Swan.

McInnes said, "There is no team that has won everything, in pocal games or legers that have not even won games of this kind."
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged while it is increasing in the United Kingdom as a whole.
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged between May and July at 164,000, while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million in the same period.
Scotland's unemployment rate of 5.9 per cent was higher than the UKs of 5.5 per cent, as shown by the National Statistics Office (ONS) figures.
Meanwhile, employment in Scotland fell by 12.000 during the three months, with the number of employees now at 2.612.000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0 per cent over the quarter - a figure above the UK average of 73.5 per cent.
The State Secretary for Scotland David Mundell commented on the latest figures and said: "The government's long-term plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy."
It is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment.
The drunks interrupted the process
Since the security staff couldn't rescue the situation, the staff called the police.
Only with the use of pepper spray were the officers able to take the stops in custody.
A respiratory alcohol test showed 0.89 promille in a 16-year-old.
The growing man was picked up by his mother.
A 28-year-old had 2,15 promille and remained first in custody.
Why I will be witness to an execution in Oklahoma
A little later today, except for a late legal intervention, I will see a man being killed.
When it happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'll be sitting in an audience gallery at the death chamber at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed by the poison syringe.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death.
The invitation was made for the first time in January about his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
When the day came closer, I began to fear myself.
So why would I do it?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to see executions in the US, and as there are often more applications available than places, a more magical lottery takes place to decide who is elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media places from 12 to 5.
Whoever is chosen will watch it without emotion.
I can't do this.
I will sit next to Richard Glossips's closest friend who I have developed my own relationship with over the months with telephone records and a two and a half hour visit.
I like this guy.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can't be a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me of giving up my impartiality on Twitter.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it, and you get access.
I'm complaining to her.
She realized that she could have "it could have been better formulated," but she still thinks it's wrong what I do.
Richard Glossip had problems with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what I have to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he did.
I told him he could remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international reporter present to write there.
When he dies, he thinks that the promotion of the movement will help against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a reporter from Huffington Post, will be sitting next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of Podcasts I've made.
I don't want to go back to all the details here.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a beneficiary of the act.
But I think there's a strong likelihood that he's not guilty of murder.
I'm sure there's not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from this perspective, I will see him die.
I can't say to be really objective.
There will be other reporters you can turn to.
What you'll get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death.
Man after wet police persecution hunting convinces to get out of the Canning River
The Canning Vale policeman remained dry when he persuaded the man from the Canning River.
An attempt by a man from Perth to hang the police was unsuccessful when he was in the sharp and sumpy water, just a few metres away from a police officer who tried to "convince him gently to return to the shore."
The police of Canning Vale were called to a house-peace incident in Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they discovered the suspect, he tried to escape them towards Canning River.
But he didn't get too far.
"He stood in the water and said 'I can't come out, come and get me,' said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet, so he applied a more reliable tactics - "A good policeman negotiated."
"Sometimes people do funny things to try to escape," said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
Championship football player Ben Cousins offers an unforgettable example.
In 2006 cousins drove his car into the ditches to avoid an alcohol control and then tried to swim over the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful, but inspired locals to the humorous planning of a Ben Cousin Biathlon.
Peter Moody claims that Stewards tried to spy on him and threatened to end the race sport
Peter Moody claims that Stewards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his stables last year and threatened to end the race immediately.
He focused on the stewards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they conducted a personal campaign against him with the late scratching of Lady Tatai for a racing day treatment, the last straw on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive cobalt bump sample at Lidaris that he can't explain.
He had restrained 18 months for the spying accusations and did not want it to "look like too high-hanging grapes."
"I had no intention of saying anything about it, and I've been sitting on it for a long time, but sometimes you're so frustrated that everything comes out at once," said Moody.
You know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'm gonna go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to go around the raised head, and I want my owners to think that I'm trying my best for them.
If they start thinking I'm not doing this, I shouldn't be a coach anymore.
I'll have to think about what I'm doing with my license.
Previously, Moody had put the bomb up in an interview with racing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable.
"Eighteen months ago Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - whom I will name when I'm asked - and offered him a job in my stables to provide information about what I do in my stables," said Moody at Racing.com.
You seem to think I'm a fraud.
If this is the case, they should certainly touch their nose because they failed to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former Chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, President of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, were aware of this at the time and are still there today.
Should that make me think it's gonna be personal?
Did the RVL behave cowardly and maybe make people outside of trainers responsible for what is going on in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I that bad for the industry?
Maybe people out there think it's me.
Maybe they have to take my license and abandon me, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying is making her think about it now.
But I've come to the point where I don't care, and that makes me sad.
That really makes me sad.
I will put pressure on them and urge them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The trainer's frustration levels have built up with the long-standing cobalt investigation at Lidari, and the late scratching led him to say that he could "throw his license over the table."
Moody, best known by his preparation of the unbeaten Master Black Caviar, called the racing day treatment rule "ridiculous," after a pack of mud or clay had been applied on the horse legs, which was contrary to the rules.
"It's against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for this, "he said.
"One of my employees misplaced mud on the leg.
It could have been like this last night.
It could have been like this all day ago, whatever it was.
But it was the same on the racing day.
Moody could be confronted with a three-month disqualification for treatment with the pack on the race day. An investigation of this issue has been opened.
It's a joke.
People who set up these rules don't know anything about the horse.
"We all realize that we need rules, but here you've gone too far," said Moody.
Man arrested after driver escape
The police arrested a man this weekend after a hit with a cyclist and a subsequent driver's escape in Cobram.
The cyclist was sent with the helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after he was hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Murray Valley motorway.
The police said the driver went on without stopping to help the injured driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia came to the police in Shepparton.
It is expected to be accused of driving and abandoned assistance and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, stays in the hospital. He is in a stable condition.
Melbourne Storm Coach Craig Bellamy strikes against rivals for claims to ring battles
Melbourne Storm Trainer Craig Bellamy has described criticism of tackling his players as "agenda setting" of two NRL's Premier League favorites.
Sydney Rooster Coach Trent Robinson said that the arbitrators allowed the storm players "ring fights" with his team during the high Storm victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Bronco's coach Wayne Bennett made a barely concealed comment on the Storm team after his team had achieved the final victory against North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night. He called the game a "model example" of the Rugby League and said that the two from Queensland were not "too good" in the ring.
Bellamy defended his team's tactics and said that they were only focused on their "contact."
Bellamy added that the criticism of two leading trainers in his team was confident, as it meant they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team.
"This keeps coming up - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talking about ring fights when they hit us 24: 2," said Bellamy on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we have not changed our defensive system or our techniques all year round, but in the last six weeks we have made our contact at Tackles a real focus, and that has given us the trend turn.
Trent has been there for three years now, and he obviously has a great team to train. He is therefore probably not used to losing, so it was a bit of a shock for him.
It is already strange, as this always comes up at this time of year.
Bellamy attacked Bennet's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennetts St. George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "boring" football.
Wayne's talking about exciting football.
He compared his game on Saturday night with ours on Friday night and how exciting her game was, "said Bellamy.
I remember that in 2010 St George was criticized as a boring team, and Wayne said he's gonna take care of this shit.
But now he has a team that can play and that we look exciting, especially his young players with their speed.
This is the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of player.
He made this statement in 2010, now he wants all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can play like these.
I build more trust because they say these things because they're a little worried about having to play against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think about us when it was about the Big Games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game Storm against Roosters achieved a higher result than the game Broncos against cowboys.
The Broncos game was a good game, I haven't looked at it yet, but what was the result? 16: 12?
Our game was 20: 18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is this an exciting game?
Or are breaks and no points exciting?
It's the game plans for me.
If they mention us, it means that we will meet them at one stage.
The Storm team is free this weekend because they have won the right to receive either North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks on the next Saturday night in the pre-final in the AAMI Park. Ticket sale starts from next Tuesday morning.
Serbs with $200,000 bail after drug charges
A man who may be threatening a lifelong punishment for his attempt to come into the possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled to Queensland was released against a deposit of $200,000.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of the five men arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the Yacht Solay that came from South America via Vanuatu and built in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was observed as he met his co-accused in the marina during the morning and later in the Café Coomera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo.
Despite a potentially life-long penalty for attempting to own a commercial amount of cocaine, the lawyer of Maksimovic argued that there was no evidence that he tried to own the entire quantity and that in the café could have been for an harmless reason.
The judge of the Supreme Court, Peter Flanagan, was concerned about the danger of escaping Maksimovic.
He has clear relations with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia, "he explained to the court on Wednesday.
In the criminal case, he lied to the police about his whereabouts.
Maksimovic's mother and stepfather had offered a deposit of $200,000 as a security to reach his release.
"After reading the statements made by the two persons, it is clear that the requirement of a security of $200,000 represents a real financial burden," said Judge Flanagan.
But that alone won't be enough to stop him from not appearing, he warned.
Maksimovic was released against bail, under the conditions that he leaves his Australian and Serbian passport, returns to the police every day and keeps to an exit barrier of 18: 00-06: 00.
Accident on A5 at Karlsruhe: Driver house rips apart
In case of an accident involving three trucks on the 5 motorway at Karlsruhe, a truck driver was severely injured on Tuesday night.

The third driver noticed it too late and attempted to evaporate at the last moment to the left, as the police informed.
The driver's house was completely torn apart.
The driver was seriously injured into a hospital.
The A5 between Bruchsal and Karlsruhe-Nord was completely locked for six hours to 2 o'clock.
There was a damage of 122,000 euros.
Stevan Hogg used phone by girls to attract pedophile to send pictures
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to demand pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone when he was asleep, logged in to an online messaging service, from which he received a number of indecent pictures of children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping hogg.
She saw it, found the confusing messages and alarmed her mother immediately.
The police took care of it and saw the five pictures, then analyzed computers found under the address and discovered "related" web searches that used the terms for searching for indecent pictures of children.
Hogg then claimed to the officials that he did it because it would lead to "pedophile on the Internet" and then pretend "to be a policeman to scare them."
The prosecutor Eilidh Robertson said to the Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it was an addiction that he was addicted to frightening people.
He admitted that the searches on the computer were carried out by him, but said it was because he wanted to claim to be a policeman to scare pedophile.
He was asked for his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and who he asked to send more photos.
He said he did it to attract her.
He said he was sick in his head when he drank, and he said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Ms. Robertson added, "When the girl found the news on the phone, she called her mother and was on the chatter and crying.
She also saw the indecent images on the phone and confronted the defendant with it.
The girl was interviewed and said that the accused computer and playstation used to talk to girls that looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, declared guilty in the sense of the prosecution that he had taken indecent pictures of children on 14 June last year, that he had violated the conditions on 25 January of this year and not appeared in court for a hearing on 24 March of this year.
Defense lawyer Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not appear in the register of sexual offences, as one could argue that "no significant sexual element" was found in his crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the sentence until October to receive background reports on social work.
Hogg was granted bail in this case but was held in custody for hearings on other outstanding cases.
He was included in the list of sexual offences before the date of the judgment.
Schleuser slides on small border crossing to Germany
More and more refugees are being picked up outside the major control points at the German-Austrian border.
Many sleepers left people growing at smaller border crossing for fear of discovery and arrest
on the Austrian side, a speaker of the Federal Police said.
Along the Inn border, more than 1000 refugees have been arrested in the district of Passau and Rottal-Inn since Tuesday.
They had reached the German side on foot over bridges and dust bridges.
They are received and passed on to registration by federal politicians.
According to the Federal Police Data, the Munich Central Railway Station again saw a significant increase in the number of refugees compared to the weekly start on Wednesday.
By 8: 00 alone, around 700 people arrived in the capital of the country, said a speaker in the morning.
After the reintroduction of controls at the German-Austrian border, on Tuesday 1759 refugees had reached the city.
Stuttgart: Runner of Tropensturm "Henry" expected in the southwest
Meteorologists warn against storms in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon.
Due to a low pressure area across Western Europe, the German weather service (DWD) announced in Stuttgart that hot sea air is currently moving into the country.
The strong defeat is the descent of the tropical storm "Henry," which has been drawn from the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic in recent days.
Heavy storms and thunderstorms are expected especially in Baden.
According to DWD, until Thursday morning in the Black Forest, on the Swabian Alb and in the bottom sea rice, there are also beaches from 60 to 90 hours.
On Friday the sun can then be seen longer.
The mass is doing it: every two years the cars on the IAA show their news.
2015 is particularly important for the compact cars that are currently selling very well.
Vehicles from the compact class are currently particularly demanded: Approximately 28.1 percent of the new registrations were made available to this segment alone in August, according to the KBA.
This is also reflected on the IAA (Publikumdays 17 to 27 September).
This year, many new compact models are presented between all the futuristic concept vehicles and new top-class and luxury cars.
One of the biggest premiers for the German car industry is the Opel Astra, which will be with the dealers in autumn.
"The Astra is an extremely important model for us," said Opel Chief Karl-Thomas Neumann at the fair.
He's part of the core of the brand.
In order for the volume model to be sold well, the new Astra should not be much more expensive either.
Opel puts an entrance below the largest competitor VW Golf, which starts at 17 650 euros.
The current Astra costs from 16 990 Euro.
The Astra is available with a new 1.4-litre engine with 74 kW / 100 hp.
In addition, the Hessen offer additional diesel and petrol engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / 200 hp, including three-cylinder petrol engines for the first time.
In contrast to the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus, Opel Astra is only five doors.
The second version will follow the combi in the spring, which is already on the IAA.
And what is going on with new compact cars next to the Astra on the IAA?
Renault Mégane: Renault sends the fourth generation of his Astra competitor Mégane to race.
At the fair the Mégane can be seen exclusively as a five-door door in a conventional and emphasized sports GT version.
He'll be in trade at the beginning of next year, then as a combi.
Infiniti: The Infiniti Q30 is a new segment.
The Nissan derivative wants to find its position in the highly growing segment with the new model.
The compact infiniti fits with its swung lines fully into the design line of the brand.
The basic model will receive a petrol engine with a power of at least 90 kW / 122 hp.
However, there is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp.
Suzuki Baleno: New in the segment is also the Suzuki Baleno, who celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt.
The model is offered with petrol engines, including a newly developed 1.0-litre turbine engine and a power of 82 kW / 111 hp.
The maximum torque is 170 newton meters (Nm) according to the manufacturer's data.
Sales start of the Baleno in Europe is in the spring of 2016.
DS 4: Not entirely new, but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4, which can be seen on the IAA.
Outside, the designers of the noble Citroën drawer placed mainly hand on the front: Here the cooler grill was redrawn and the modified headlamps were equipped with LED technology.
In the interior, the infotainment system was modernised, the number of buttons was reduced by a touch screen and for the first time incorporated Apples CarPlay.
In addition, on the IAA in the compact class a series of revisions and new variants such as the refreshed Mercedes A class or the Peugeot 308 GTI.
JVA Berlin-Tegel: Five square meters of cell are human unworthy
The Federal Constitutional Court has given the right to an ex-prisoner of the judiciary institution Tegel, which had been housed in a small cell for months.
Because of the violation of their human dignity, prisoners are in principle entitled to financial compensation when they are housed in too small cells.
This was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday.
According to the judges, even if they were locked in the too narrow rooms for a few days, the judges can hope for money (as follows: 1 BvR 1127 / 14).
This was a success for an ex-prisoner with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe: he was housed in a single cell of approximately five square metres of ground between June and November 2009 at the Berlin Tegel Court of Justice, and the toilet was not spatially separated.
After that, the man who, according to his lawyer, is now on free foot was moved to a larger cell.
His appeal for the unworthy detention conditions against the Land of Berlin failed.
However, the Constitutional Judges raised the judgment of the Berlin Chamber Court and rejected the case for re-examination there.
You see the human dignity of the man injured.
The Court of First Instance now decides on the amount of compensation
Even though, for legal reasons of the period in question, only a few days of detention were relevant for the compensation, it was said that there was a claim for compensation.
Otherwise, it would be "to fear a waste of the legal protection of personality."
The Board Court must now clarify the amount of compensation.
In the past, constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners.
So they only agreed to a prisoner's compensation in April because he was locked up naked in a cell.
According to a 2011 decision, human dignity is also the multiple occupation of a cell without a separate toilet.
Karlsruhe also confirmed on Wednesday the Constitutional Court of Berlin, which in a parallel case, in November 2009, confirmed a deceptive lodging of a prisoner.
The plaintiff was lodged daily for three months between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the case of Karlsruhe.
The Berlin prisons had also come to the headlines in recent weeks because of the lack of staff.
So prisoners are kept locked up for 23 hours, aggressiveness is increasing, even fighting is supposed to have already come because of the tense situation.
According to the Justice Press Office, 21 posts in Tegel are not occupied due to a lack of young people, 19 should be dropped in 2016.
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy: "We can do this"
Migration of refugees is a huge challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept them.
What's going on in Germany?
Approximately 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year, according to the forecasts of the Federal Ministry of the Interior, and according to Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), Germany is even able to receive one million refugees.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated determination in view of the unusual challenge: "I say again and again: We can do this, and we can do it."
What is happening to Germany is the following overview.
According to different forecasts, apartments are used each year between 350000 (estimated by the Federal Ministry of Construction) and 400000 (estimated by the Pestel Institute) for the next five years.
This is almost twice as much as it has been built to date (250000 apartments).
Dramatic is the shortage of housing, but especially for affordable rentals: yearly 60000 to 80000 social dwellings fall out of the lease price, and for these particularly favourable dwellings, refugees will also apply.
Federal Minister of Construction Barbara Hendricks (SPD) therefore wants to double the funding, from currently 518 million to one billion euros.
This is far too little from the point of view of the Pestel Institute: 80 000 social dwellings would have to be created annually and the federal government would have to invest in funding of 6.4 billion a year.
Some are scientists and Federal Minister of Construction in the fact that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in housing.
According to estimates from the Labour Market and Vocational Research Institute, 55 per cent of the poultry population in Germany can be employed in the long term.
However, refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualifications to help them get in, criticises Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education in the Bertelsmann Foundation.
However, for the integration of refugees, it is crucial whether they find work in Germany.
Work is the key to social contacts, for appreciation in the host society, but also for the self-esteem of immigrants, says Migration researcher Dietrich Thränhardt.
In Germany, according to Thränhardt, there has been a political turn: from the ban on labour for refugees to recognise work.
While there was an earlier ban on asylum seekers from up to five years, it was reduced to three months in November 2014, as well as the residence obligation limited to a place of residence for asylum seekers.
In society, even because of the lack of expertise, a majority of the views have been expressed that refugees should be given faster access to the labour market.
A major obstacle to access to the labour market is the lack of German knowledge.
There is not yet sufficient provision for general and professional language courses.
Studies also show that jobs are the most frequently provided by personal contacts.
The construction of networks is therefore, in Thränhardt's view, the King's Way to work integration.
The Berlin School Administration has found that only a few escaped parents give their children to the Kitas, estimated 10 to 15 percent: "For the discarded parents it is very important to keep the family together," says Ilja Koschembar, spokesperson for youth and family in the Berlin Senate administration.
In order to convince the family of the advantages of Kita, the administration distributes handboards in different languages.
If the need for educators is to rise sharply because of the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacity, for example by allowing more specialised schools.
In the countries, pupils with no German knowledge are prepared for the class in welcome classes.
However, they are not always taught by fully trained teachers, but, as in Berlin, also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language.
There is no lack of them, says Beate Stoffers of the Berlin School Administration.
The German Studentenwerk estimates that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany.
In principle, no federal asylum seekers or patient students are forbidden - the only exception so far was Berlin, internal senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has now given up his position.
Student refugees could be facilitated access to university.
For refugees with a residence allowance or duplication will no longer receive benefits under the Asylum Applicants Act when they start studying.
In principle, the latter do not receive a bafög, as they do not fall within the circle of the basic persons.
Sustained refugees have so far had to live in Germany for four years to be Bafög-entitled, from 1 January 2016 this margin is shortened to 15 months.
However, this financial gap must also be closed: Steffen Krach, Berlin's State Secretary for Science, and the German Student Works are demanding.
Students should get Bafög immediately.
Islam will play a more important role in the future, because many refugees are Muslims, and for many, religion is an important part of their identity.
The state should gradually grant Islam the same rights as they have the churches, and develop existing state-church law into a new state-religion relationship.
It would also be important to set up an Islamic welfare association that professionally cares about the new arrivals.
The right also includes obligations.
For example, Islam representatives must agree on clear contacts and be willing to cooperate with the State in many areas and provide it with certain controls.
This includes the willingness to act against religious fundamentalism.
On Thursday, the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, expressed concern that religious conflicts could also be registered to Germany.
Those who wanted to exert such conflicts in Germany have "immediately their right to stay here, in Germany," he said in the Bavarian broadcasting.
He proposed to translate the Basic Law into Arabic.
In the future, integration will be much more than today a topic of society as a whole.
This will also have to change the majority society, and the elimination of discrimination and racism will be more pressing.
Although Germany - as a result of European decisions - has had an anti-discrimination body and a general equality law for a decade.
But it learns very slowly, as the NSU murder series showed, systematically ignored the racist motive in the police and authorities.
The same opportunities for all: what migrant organisations and the interests of non-white Germans have long demanded and what international agreements like the anti-racism Convention require Germany to do in the coming years must become reality if the country is to remain peaceful and take advantage of its new citizens' opportunities - for the good of all.
In general, Germany is able to provide medical care for the refugees expected so far, says doctor president Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
"As far as manpower and capacity are concerned, we can do this," he said to the daily mirror.
However, additional money must be transferred to the system for this purpose.
In order to avoid bottlenecks, Montgomery asks to hand out health cards to all arrivals at the same time as registration.
Services provided could later be counted with the Länder.
And in the long term it is highly questionable to feed as many people with the limited performance catalogue as provided for by the law on asylum seekers.
Otherwise, the doctors make the language barriers more important.
Already, as the Berlin health scientist Thea Borde has demonstrated, migrants are less informed about their diseases than other patients.
Not only in clinics, but also in medical practice, it calls for interpretation costs.
However, many refugees would already have more general medical contact points in the emergency ambulances.
And with another diagnostic look.
Among refugees, for example, there are significantly more untreated disabilities, and young people are talking about HIV education.
With the partly other illness images German doctors come from their training but clearly, Montgomery says.
"Parasite seizures or tuberculosis are not so hard to detect." And as far as the medical deficiency is concerned, the refugees may even be in sight of relief.
The Syrians have a highly developed education system, some refugees are even doctors.
However, in order to be able to practice, they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly re-examine them.
At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psychologically ill according to estimates of the Bundespsychotherapist (BPtK): most people suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression.
Dietrich Munz, President of the BPtK, explains that refugees are particularly vulnerable.
A recently published study by TU Munich shows that every fifth Syrian refugee child arrives in Germany traumatized.
Those who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder suffer, among other things, from flashbacks with respiratory distress, dizziness, heart races and death fears.
Other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders, severe horrors and emotional deafness.
In order to prevent the symptoms from becoming chronic, early treatment is necessary, Munz said.
However, so far only four percent of the psychically ill refugees are receiving psychotherapy.
While psychically ill asylum seekers can apply for psychotherapy in the social services, the treatment usually takes several months.
In addition, in the social services, specialists or doctors who are not trained for mental diseases would decide whether or not therapy is necessary.
This often leads to error assessments, says Munz.
Manege invites to dream
With the new stage "Passion" the Circus Probst reacts to the traditions of circus art.
The goal is to draw every age group into the band of fascinating acrobatics, animal dressings and unique entertainment.
Now the Circus is inviting sample to wash into the mansions on the brick to dream.
"Our passion is the circus."
"I can't imagine living without my circus family," says Stephanie Probst, animal teacher and juniorchefin.
"Passion" - under this motto is the current maneuver performance.
For more than 33 years the circus has been in the hands of the family sample.
So the gift of enthusiasm lies in the blood of the family.
"It is important for us to get people away from their everyday life and take them to a completely different world for two hours," emphasises the 27-year-old juniorchefin.
"Manegencocktail with World City Flair," that's what Director Reinhard Probst calls his concept.
50 cities on the 3 000 kilometres long tour can now experience this flair.
The program of the circus convinces with talented artists from all over the world.
Excellent at the international circus festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family draws the audience with joke and charm into her band.
The Castillo Brothers also understand their craft.
With the heroes of the movies, the Cuban duo wants to take it easy.
lightness and mobility - with these words they identify themselves.
Their humorous art on the mast is to conquer women's hearts in the storm.
Apart from numerous salmon ointments, the acrobatics of the Circus sample also fascinates with fingertips and joints.
Balancing with the unicycle on a bullet?
No problem for He Yuan.
Snake people fascinate and scare at the same time.
Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics as little others and fascinated with their mobility.
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in all respects.
"The animals belong to our family," emphasises Stephanie's mother, Brigitte Probst.
Deficiencies in the attitude of circus are only too often the subject of various animal welfare organisations.
Stephanie Probst also says: "If our animals are not well, we are not well."
About 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit.
The "four-leg artists," as they are called loving, will be read from the eyes as possible.
We want to work with the animals and have fun with them.
If the animal doesn't feel well, it doesn't want to go into the manages either.
So the supreme commandment: take good care of the animals.
Especially on her Zebroid Jumbo, a mixture of a Shetland Ponyhengst and a Zebrastute, the family sample is proud.
The two animals have lived together for eight years and nothing has happened.
"But then, suddenly, our little jumbo was there," says Brigitte's test.
The Zebroid is not yet ready for the manure, but it is the unique mascot of the Circus sample.
So for every visitor there should be something there.
"One is safe," says Stephanie Probst: "No matter whether five or 1,200 spectators, we always do our best and are with all our hearts."
The Circus Probst invites you daily from 17 to 20 September at 17 and 20 o'clock for his ideas.
On Sunday the program starts at 11 and 4.
Thursday is family day, for the performance at 5: 00 the prices are reduced.
Furthermore, the zoo is open every day from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Simbabwean Robert Mugabe takes the wrong speech in Parliament
Mr. Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year.
He remained unharmed, but the video of the case spread quickly through the social media.
The opening of Parliament was also tormented by claims by opposition Members that they had received anonymous death threats and were warned to accompany Mr Mugabe's speech by calling.
Last month they had booked it and interrupted it during his speech on the situation of the nation in Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The speaker of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) Innocent Gonese said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their phones that they warned against disturbing Mr. Mugabe's speech.
"The message comes from a number that is not displayed, but it has the title 'Death'," he said journalists to Mugabe's speech.
It warns the Members concerned that immunity in Parliament will end, and as soon as they leave Parliament, their parliamentary immunity will no longer be effective.
The chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai was "concerned" about the dangers for politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will reduce up to 30.000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to reduce 25.000 to 30.000 jobs in the context of restructuring and savings efforts in the company's services.
HP will be divided into two listed companies later this year and the computer and printer business will separate from its rapidly growing company hardware and its service business.
The expected job reduction leads to a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter, said HP in an explanation.
"These restructuring measures will allow a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, HP Chairman and Chief Executive, who is to lead the unit after separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it is today HP, and we have a wide and deepened portfolio of shops that support companies in the transition to a new style of business," said Whitman.
As an independent company, we are better placed than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $50 billion annual turnover and "will be focused on the provision of unprecedented, integrated technology solutions for companies so far," explains the company.
It divided a company founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stanford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to produce electrical installations and their Palo Alto Garage was called "the birthplace of the Silicon Valley."
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to manage the return from traditional PCs to mobile devices.
The action of HP, the second largest PC manufacturer in the world and one of the largest US tech companies, is the latest in this area, based on the belief that closely focused companies provide better performance.
FC Arsenal Captain Mikel Arteta says teammates have to stand behind the injured Jack Wilshere before the game against Dynamo Zagreb
Wenger pointed out to Wilshere that it was only September, and if his rehabilitation takes place according to plan, there is no reason why he can't play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England and, given his history, his participation in the European Championship next summer is certainly still uncertain.
The great shame of this current problem is that Wilshere had severely ended the last season after a separate ankle injury and then returned to his old swing during the preceding season.
"This kind of injury does not threaten the career," said Wenger.
It's a bone that didn't heal well.
This is not a major matter.
This was just an accident.
It wasn't connected to his ankles or the injuries he had before.
This may be true from a purely medical point of view, but as Wenger acknowledged, there is the associated risk of further injuries, whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
It also develops an unpleasant pattern.
The investigation of Premier Injuries Ltd recorded 23 different diseases of Wilshere since his debut six years ago.
He also played in only 65 of Arsenals 157 league games in the last five games.
The wider picture for Arsenal is that in six of eight games since 2007 / 08 they were one of the two Premier League clubs that have recorded most injury days.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the injury rate will continue over the last season.
"Sometimes, when you come back from an injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time in which you have to strengthen your body and win combat power," said Wenger.
Jack's young enough to overcome this.
I hope his body stabilizes, I am confident that he will and he will go through a career of the kind he deserves.
Arsenal begins his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Dinamo Zagreb before the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday, and Wenger is setting up a rotation within the team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey did not travel to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta should start.
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I try to keep the balance and give the players who need to take a little break," said Wenger.
Although Arsenal is clear favorites to continue through Group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the playgrounds with the greatest intimidation effect in Europe.
Dynamo was also unhit after 41 games after the "unvictorious" campaign was launched in the last season.
The stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening, measured on the judge scale 3.2.
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has drawn the lesson from the last season with the Champions League surrender against Monaco and continues to be driven from the distant hope to lead the association with his management to his first Europapokal triumph.
"This drive is immense," said Wenger.
It's never worked with Arsenal.
We were very close to it in 2006, but on the other hand, I am long enough in business to be realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: the Comedy show that gives us serious lessons about male friendships
The lack of similar performances in shows is apparent, especially with regard to how the need for men to open up has now become even more desperate than ever before, as suicide rates among young men prove at a 15-year high.
In 2013, it was the main cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK, and it remains three times more common in men than in women.
In striving to address the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserable (CALM - campaign against a pathetic life) announced 2015 as the year of man, with the aim of questioning the culture that prevents men from looking for help if they need it.
Friendship is the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge.
A recent study in more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms found that if the suffering had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with "healthy mood," his chances of recovery doubled.
For those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halves the risks of mental problems.
But, of course, you have to have friends first, so a friendship can work.
In the age of communication through social media, with its focus on style over substance, the inmediability of the response is often more important than a significant contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, lifeless and successful, even though in reality isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinal values; money, image, social status, everything at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship, which has a much deeper impact on our mental health.
And as a video game inventor and billionaire recently explained, money really can't buy happiness.
The beauty of Friends was that this focus was put on the head.
Every character was not defined by his work, but by his personality, which shinned by interaction as a friend.
The humor of Joey and Chandler's frequent humiliations, the moments of watching football in cozy seats and the desire of Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can refer to it in any case, even if they often refrain from fully exploring their feelings.
As a staff of the phone care told me: "My listening role for people who feel depressed and are at risk of suicide has really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference."
The men who contact us often don't feel able to talk to friends.
The old phrase "I can handle it" has a tremendous effect, like the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when you speak openly about problems. "
Friends is one of the shows that comes into my mind when I try to offer longer-term management mechanisms.
It clearly presents the small moments of male friendships.
As much as my objective external status via the phone may also help people in moments of despair, the long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so, if you visit this weekend Comedy Central FriendsFest with the completely newly designed scenes at the celebration of the day, why don't you take your friends to a drink at the Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see someone sitting around in Starbucks alone, give him a smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship could make.
Friends are sent to Comedy Central from beginning to end - the entire 236 episodes - for # FriendsFest
Di Maria meets to help PSG crush Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his hit against Malmö.
Di Maria meets at his debut at the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG move to Malmö.
Here's the game report and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani held a course when Paris Saint-Germain started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2-0 victory against Malmö in the Princess Park Stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as a PSG player who brought the French champion on the way, but afterwards they missed a number of opportunities before they finally increased their lead when Cavani reached a headball tor in the 61st minute.
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donezk also in Group A, Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish Master, as they aim not only for the qualification for KO rounds, but also for an improvement on the way to the quarterfinals in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they got the points, it was not a class game of Laurent Blanc's team with Zlatan Ibrahimovics missed opportunities in front of the gate. He was later in the game against his home city team and against the association with which he started his illustrious career already in 1999.
"It is not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League. Therefore it is a good start to win 2: 0, to cause problems to our opponents and to look back relaxed, even if there are certain things that we still have to perfect during the season," said Blanc.
"That's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we did not achieve one or two more gates. "
Ibrahimovic returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team, which in the weekend could hold a 2: 2 undecided place against Bordeaux in the First League, but he was stabbed in the fourth minute by Di Maria.
The Argentine wingstorm was called the man who can take PSG to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United last month, and he indicated why when he walked in Marco Verrattis Pass behind the Malmö defense before he closed off to Johan Wiland beautifully into the long corner of the network.
But if someone believed that PSG would win a great victory, it was disappointed.
Malmö, who beat Celtic in a play-off to reach this stage, joined Anpiff with nine national players in the field and was with a five-man defense and two deep in the middle field a heavy opponent.
But apart from a shot by Nikola Djurdjic, far from Kevin Trapps posts passing the 34 minute, they offered little attack.
Instead, PSG himself sometimes gave up with some miscarriages and bad graduates, not least by Ibrahimovic, who was patched in the first half alone in not less than five trials and then abandoned after Cavani had used it after the restart.
Nevertheless, he proved much more skill when he put his fellow players into play, and it was a passport of Ibrahimovic that turned Di Maria into a shooting shot, which was led by Wiland in the 52nd minute at the post...
The second gate finally fell shortly after the hour brand thanks to Cavani. The Uruguay reached its sixth season office after Ibrahimovic had caught a left flank of Maxwell.
This ended all the thoughts that Malmö could come back to the game, and only an excellent intervention from Wiland from the shortest distance to stop David Luiz, could keep the final result low before replacement player Ezequiel Lavezzi was discovered a gate at the end.
The coach of Malmö, Age Hareide, later admitted that PSG played a class over his team, and the Norwegian said, "Our last Champions League game was last December last year.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, which has not the same level.
The qualification games are not enough. "
Hut off from Paris!
It was a great game of them!
Glencore collects $2.5 billion by stock sales
The Swiss mining giant Glencore, which is affected by falling raw material prices, collected $2.5 billion on Wednesday through a stock sale as part of its huge debt elimination plan.
The company Glencore registered in London said in a statement that it sold new shares worth about £1.6 billion to pay off its own debt.
The company, which lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is struggling with falling commodity prices, as China's economic downturn is pressing demand and devastating market effects.
The issue of reference rights brought Glencore's share rate to the top of the London Stock Exchange in the early Wednesday morning.
The share increased by 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore had announced last week the $2.5 billion stock sale as part of the broader plans to wipe around a third of its $30 billion debt.
The company sold the new shares to 125 pence per share, meaning a 2.4 percent discount on the final course on Tuesday.
There were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.99 percent of the group.
Concerns about long-term impaired growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by about half, coal, copper and other commodity prices have decreased by 20 to 40 percent.

The White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the United States at the end of the month, confirmed the White House in a statement on Tuesday.
The visit, Xi's first official in Washington, takes place on 25 September and reiterates President Barack Obama's journey to Beijing last November, said the statement.
The US President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan this evening at a state dinner after the two leaders have had bilateral talks.
"President Xi's visit will provide the opportunity to expand American-Chinese cooperation on a number of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, while also giving President Obama and President Xi the opportunity to respond constructively to areas of disagreement," added the statement.
XI, whose visit was announced first in February, is expected to meet several US technology leaders on his way to Washington before going to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to address a number of controversial questions, including Washington's concerns regarding alleged cyberspy of China and its increasing self-awareness in the controversial waters of the South Chinese Sea.

Xavi: Pep Guardiola prevented us from switching to FC Bavaria in 2008
World and European Master Xavi has been playing for the al-Sadd Sport Club in Katar since summer 2015
The FC Bavaria was obviously a few years ago in front of the commitment of Spain's Superstar Xavi, who then played for FC Barcelona.
Eight times Spanish champion, three times Cup winner, four times Champions League winner, two times Club champion, two times European champion, one time World champion - the title list of Xavi is stunning.
In the summer, the 35-year-old left Barcelona after 24 years and moved to the al-Sadd Sport Club to Katar.
But in an interview with the Marca, Xavi now tells us that he was already standing before the EM in 2008 before the departure from Barcelona.
"They told me that Barça wanted to sell me."
"Madrid won everything at that time, we won nothing," he says.
It was also registered by FC Bavaria.
Xavi: "There was an offer from Bavaria."
"Rummenigge wanted me."

Guardiola was the reason that Xavi did not change
The change did not happen.
And the decisive man for this is working today for the German record champion: Pep Guardiola.
Xavi explains why: "Barça contracted Guardiola and I played a great EM."
"Pep told me that I wouldn't change, that he couldn't imagine the team without me."
"That's how he got me."
Who knows how Bayern's season 2008 / 2009 would have run with Xavi.
Xavi stood for Barca in the quarter finals of the Champions League against the Bavarian over the entire distance on the lawn, switched off the roots (4: 0, 1: 1) and celebrated the king's class triumph at the end.
Matt Damon plays diversity in film creation down
Matt Damon confronted the African film maker Effie Brown during a discussion about diversity and said she was not needed behind the scenes.
During a episode of Sunday Night of HBOs Project Greenlight, the experienced actor Brown interrupted when he stressed the need for alternative perspectives in relation to a black protagonist in the selected script of the project.
"If we talk about diversity, then you do it in the occupation of the film and not in the occupation of the show," Damon assured.
Brown reacted shocked, with insulted disbelief and cried "Hoo! Wow. Okay," when the comments of the actor of The Martian confirmed.
Damon and Brown joined the producer colleagues Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show finalists.
"I would like to call on people to think about how they treat the figure of harmony - whoever will be the director," Brown first said.
The only black person, and she's a whore that's beaten by her white pimp.
The producer of Dear White People joined the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the governance rights of the film; Damon argued that their director could "give us something we don't want to do."
After the discussion was broadcast, the social media exploded before disapproving Damon's comments.
Twitter users Mr. Pooni expressed his anger over the clip by writing "Matt Damon talks about the only black person in the room, so he can explain their diversity - that's SO WISS that it hurts."
The Tweet earned more than 5,000 Retweets and 4,000 liques since its publication.
Damon's comments come at a time when precise racial representation in the media is at the forefront of the social debate.
After the teenager Michael Brown was killed by a white policeman in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement gained effect throughout the country and urged legislators and authorities to dictate discriminatory practices against colored stops.
In February the singer Prince made an inspiration to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards.
"Albums still matter," he said.
Like books and black life, albums still have their meaning.
Recently, leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement have published a statement in response to the question of the Fox News personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck, whether the group should be considered a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter network is a love group," the leaders said.
Recently it was announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers, producers and media mogule invited to visit the Pope to discuss the presentation of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he has accepted the invitation or has already hit the Pope is unclear.
American Ninja Warrior Crowns First Champion
Professional sports climbers and service assistants Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete who won the American Ninja Warrior on Monday evening and took the big price of $1 million home.
The competition show, which just finished its 7th season, had never experienced a competitor who could complete all stages of his obstacle course.
= = References = = = = External links = = * Official website
One of the last tasks was to climb on a 75-foot climbing rope in 30 seconds.
British ended the task within time, with which he was the first athlete to complete the striking phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior. However, Caldiero ended this challenge three seconds faster, making him a winner.
Caldiero spoke to E! News after the hard-fought victory, still under the shock about the win of the Great Prize of $1 million.
"I mean, it's amazing to think about, I've never earned more than $10,000 or had it to live," said Isaac E! about his bunch of money.
As suddenly... as I can't even imagine how this is... the future is unknown.
The leading producer Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the final and why British, although he was the first to end the course at all, does not receive any prize money.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
"If there is more than one finalist, it will get him with the fastest time," Weed said.
How much the money is a wonderful price and changes life, it receives the great gratification.
I don't think he's having any trouble about it.
He's just so happy to have done what he did.
= = References = = = = External links = =
He's such a great guy and a family father.
He's a hero for his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If someone should beat me, I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have felt the same way if they had changed the roles.
America Ninja Warrior was renewed for an eighth season, the shooting will begin in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers slip past Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS--The second half of the season was not very funny for the Detroit Tigers.
They used to be one of the best teams in baseball, and today the Tigers are at the last place in the American League Central.
The Tigers are reduced to their role as Spoiler, but this part played perfectly against the Minnesota Twins with 5-4 in the Target Field on Tuesday.
The Twins wasted a chance to rise within a half of the Houston Astros game for the second American League Wildcard square.
For Detroit, though only for one evening, it was a return of the three letter F word that was so difficult to figure out over a large part of the second half of the season.
"All victories are fun, no matter how it comes," said Tigers Manager Brad Ausmus.
Tiger-Pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit posted three times in the first two innings, then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) beat up 6 times in the 1 / 3 innings and allowed three runs.
It was only his third successful start in his last nine lots.
"I want to end strongly this year," Simon said.
It's hard to throw every game in the bullpen, and that's why I want to go into the game completely concentrated.
The designed Tiger-Hitter Victor Martinez had three matches and was in two runs, his first RBIs since mid-August.
It was the first three-hit game of Martinez since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6th.
"He has swung the battlehole well," said Ausmus.
He looked good at (impact training), looked much better in the bull, and he put it directly into the game.
With three rounds in the rear meeting at the end of the seventh innings, the Twins had their best chance to get back into play.
Center Fielder Byron Buxton finished the inning with a double on the left field line.
Right Fielder Aaron Hicks reached a bunt, and Simon brought his second Baseman Brian Dozier to the Strikeout before he was replaced by the left hand Blaine Hardy.
Hardy attacked Mauer, the only man he was confronted with, in front of the nominated Rookie slayer Miguel Sano, who entrises a two-run to the right hand Drew Verhagen.
With a couple of runners and the final run on the second Verhagen brought third Baseman Trevor Plouffe to a double game.
It was the leading 27 times in the Major League this season that Plouffe beat a double game
After Detroit added an Insurance Run at the end of the ninth innings, Wall created a RBI double against the tiger Bruce Rondon and reached the stand of 5-4.
The right hand, however, stabbed Sano at three pitches for his fifth save.
Detroit benefited from a yet unmoving Phil Hughes to start the game.
The Tigers achieved three runs in the first two innings against the right-wing veteran, who had been removed from the injury list before the game after he had missed more than a month for a spinal disorder.
"Obviously not the beginning I wanted," said Hughes, "but I felt better when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pitches there in the third inning."
After receiving the Leadoff Batter, Hushes gave a single to Second Baseman Ian Kinsler.
A two-out walk for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez to the game, who created a single "up the middle" at the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez made his 0-21 success series with the runners in the scoring position.
The third Baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single on the right side, created another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third, which ended the threat.
The Tigers added a one-out double by Catcher James McCann and a two-out single by Center-Fielder Anthony Gose to the 3-0.
"That was a big hit," said Twins manager Paul Molitor.
He didn't hit very well, but he caught the right place.
Hughes was in a pitch count, did not reach points in the third inning before he was replaced by the Reliever right hand A.J.Achter.
At Hughes there were three rounds at six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.
NOTES: Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez decided for an injury to the shoulders.
He is investigated by Dr. James Andrews, who operated Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez, since mid-August on the list of injuries due to a fracture of the shoulder, is to be activated for the start on Wednesday.
With Sanchez out of the game, LHP Daniel Morris is deleted from the injury list to start against the Twins.
Norris with 1-1 at four starters with the Tigers, since he was purchased in exchange with LHP David Price on July 30
He has been missing since August 20th because of a fracture in the right hip joint.
The Tigers and the Twins will end their series of three games in the Target Field on Wednesday
Norris (2-2.4.43 ERA) will play against Minnesotas RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73)
Hundreds of refugees are supposed to stay in Wiesbaden
A train with hundreds of refugees is on their way to Hessen.
His arrival was expected for the night to Wednesday.
The people in it will then be accommodated in emergency accommodations in Wiesbaden, as the city of Wiesbaden announced on Tuesday night.
She expected 450 to 750 refugees to arrive.
Several sports halls of the Hessian capital had been prepared for this case in recent days.
Up to 1000 refugees can be temporarily accommodated there.
They will then be distributed to other municipalities.
In the past ten days alone, according to the first-entry government Bureau, 7500 people had arrived in Hessen.
Frankfurt and Hanau have also established emergency accommodation in Sporthals because of the large number of refugees.
Ischinger: German military measures in Syria an option
The Head of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, considers military actions with German participation in Syria as an opportunity.
"I believe that the decisive reflection on military action options should not take place without Germany," he said.
He gave the European States a "collective outrage."
Four years ago one was glad that the Kelch passed military participation in Germany.
"Now the conflict is going to end up in front of our door," he said in the German radio.
The former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid on the ground for refugees.
Austria controls on southern and eastern borders
After Germany, Austria has also re-introduced controls at its southern and eastern borders.
The Austrian Minister for the Interior Johanna Mikl-Leitner stated on Tuesday night at the Austrian TV station ORF that no one will be sent back to Hungary.
Germany also did not send any refugees back to Austria.
"No, it's so agreed," she said.
On the question of an agreement that Germany could include a certain number of refugees from Austria per day, Mikl-Leitner said that there had already been discussions on this matter between the Director-General for Public Security and representatives of Germany.
She did not mention specific figures and referred to talks on Wednesday in Berlin.
In recent days, tens of thousands of refugees have come from Hungary via the so-called Balkan route.
Their goal is mostly Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian colleague Werner Faymann, together with several other EU Heads of State and Government, requested a special summit for next week.
Germany had begun temporary border controls on Sunday.
The EU States have not yet been able to agree on a common approach to the crisis.
On next Tuesday (22 September), the EU Interior Ministers intend to take a new start at a special meeting on a mandatory distribution of further 120 000 refugees.
In view of the large number of refugees in Germany, the alliance aims to strengthen the support of the countries in the initial reception and distribution of people.
The Confederation will manage this together with the countries, announced Merkel on late Tuesday night after almost four hours of discussion with the Prime Minister of the Office in Berlin.
Merkel underlined that those who need protection also receive it.
But those who have no lead-limiting perspectives could not stay in Germany either.
This view had been strongly shared in the round.
The Chancellor stressed that the state as a whole now had to deal with a "huge effort of strength."
Thousands of desperate refugees are now trapped on the Balkans route.
Hungary had closed its 175 kilometers long border with Serbia the night to Tuesday.
A few hours later, the government announced in Budapest that the border with Romania should also be closed with a fence.
This neighbouring country belongs to the EU differently than Serbia.
Hungary wanted to prevent Schlepper from searching routes over Romania, Hungary's Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said about the planned new border fence.
The Romanian government immediately condemned the plan.
There were first arrests of people who had cut through the fence.
In Turkey, there were thousands of other migrants on the way to the Greek border.
Space probe "Cassini" finds ocean on Saturnmond Enceladus
Under the ice tank of the Saturn Moon Enceladus, a global ocean swings.
This concludes researchers from observations of the space probe "Cassini."
Thus the moon is easily diving around the ring planet on its track.
Although this movement was small, but still too large for a continuous fixed sky body, it is said in a message from the Cornell University in Ithaca (US State New York) from Tuesday.
The researchers present their analyses in the "Icarus" specimen.
It has been known for a long time that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of Enceladus.
Thus, "Cassini" had already discovered ice volcanoes on the south pole of the Saturn Moon in 2006, spitting water steam and ice particles and thus feeding the so-called e-ring of Saturn.
At least at the South Pole there had to be a underground sea, the astronomers closed at that time.
However, the extension of the hidden ocean was not clarified.
Rama missing 1860 Munich several weeks
The 1860 Munich has to resign about a month from the openness officer Valdet Rama.
An investigation showed an adductor injury to the 27-year-old, the association informed.
Rama had already complained about pain at the beginning of the week.
According to Munich Lions, the diagnosis means "expected four weeks of forced break."
"This is hard for us, Rama is a terrible loss."
"Of course we need to think now," said Sportdirektor Necat Aygün of the "picture" newspaper with a view to the possible commitment of a united professional.
However, as a trainingguest, the Sixties first presented a defendant.
The 30-year-old Hrvoje Cale was last active in Belgium and was previously under contract with VfL Wolfsburg.
The Croatian currently has the opportunity to prove its ability.
Torjager Rubin Okotie can return to crew training next week after his concussion.
On Thursday, the Austrian national player will start running training.
At Fortuna Düsseldorf (0: 3), Okotie had been injured in the party with a severe collapse on his head.
In contrast to the first fears, he remained without a serious blasphemy.
No diet fruit - mangos contain a lot of sugar
Mangos are exotic and juicy-sweet.
But whoever wants to keep an eye on his narrow line, he is often more advised from them.
Because mangos contain relatively much sugar - especially sucrose.
The exotic fruits are still healthy: B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. In particular, mangos contain a lot of vitamin A and its precursor beta-carotine.
Anyone who eats the fruits therefore supports visibility, immune system and metabolism processes in the body.
When buying mangos should not be too soft or too solid and smell pleasant.
The shell color alone says nothing about how mature the fruit is - so green mangos can also taste very delicious.
They should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days.
Then, of course, they taste pure or in sweet food.
But a mango also gives a special note to hearty dishes.
It relieves the slightly bitter taste of some lettuce salads such as chicory and radiccio.
And a mangochutney fits well with fish, poultry, lamb and wild.
The UPS package service restores up to 95000 aid for Christmas business in the USA.
The company has already started recruitment of seasonal workers, UPS informed us on Tuesday.
Especially drivers are being searched.
Last year UPS had already increased its staff for the holiday season by 95000 aid.
Given the booming online business, UPS and his competitor FedEx have been making arrangements for being armed for Christmas business since last year.
In 2013, delayed deliveries had brought in harsh criticism to the package services.
First fountain storm, then marked cold front
The next night, in the valleys of the Alpine North side of the fountain, Meteoschweiz reported on Tuesday.
On Wednesday and the night to Thursday, the fountain partly blows through the fountain valleys with storm strength.
After birth on Thursday morning, a marked cold front crosses us, which brings strong rainfall, wind beaches and a temperature decline.
As MeteoNews writes in a communication, Switzerland is currently on the front of a large area of deep pressure over the British islands in a strong south-west stream.
On the Alpine North side, the night breaks through the valleys to the Wednesday of the fohn.
As a result, the foe blows in the fountain valleys from 60 to 100 km / h until Thursday morning, and is in part combined with more than 100 km / h in the Urnerland.
The fountain can walk into the adjacent middle country, and on the mountains even orchestra floors are possible of more than 120 km / h.
While in the north on Wednesday stormy fowl cares for summer temperatures from 23 to 27 degrees, the moisture starts to stumble on the Alpine socket.
This is where rain starts until Thursday night.
In total, south of the Alps in the next 48 hours will have to be estimated with partially more than 100 litres of rain per square meter, after large quantities of rain have fallen in the last few days.
On Thursday morning, the fox goes out of the air, and then a cold front rolls from west to east over Switzerland with strong, partially violently enforced rain.
Together with the cold front the wind freshes up strongly to stormy, and the temperatures fall significantly.
The following days appear in the north autumn at 15 to 20 degrees, in the south it becomes sunny and warmer at up to 25 degrees in the weekend.
Rome now has a Martin Luther square
Nearly 500 years after the reform, there is now a Martin Luther square in Rome.
In the presence of city president Ignazio Marino, a nameless place in the park on the Oppio hill was baptized on Wednesday on the name of the German reformator.
On the "Piazza Martin Lutero" he is now honored as "German theologist of the Reformation."
The park is located in the middle of the old Rome right next to the colosseum.
The pronunciation had been requested by the working community of the evangelical churches in Rome.
On Wednesday, Jens-Martin Kruse, the priest of the Evangelical Lutheran community in Rome, reminded us that protesters in the city of the Pope could often live as a minority only in hidden faith for centuries.
With the place it becomes symbolic that their tradition of Christian faith in Rome was welcome.
Martin Luther (1483-1546) was a young Augustine monk who stayed in Rome for a few months in 1510 / 11.
He felt the city at that time as a lost sin babel.
According to historians, his negative impressions should have strengthened him in his subsequent struggle against Rome.
Luther had then begun the division of the evening church with his thesis against the debris trade.
Hammer Artists invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the (golden) thorn crown is one of the main works that Otmar Alt has painted for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost wrote the introduction and updated biblical texts.
At the beginning was the word?
No, not at the Otmar Old Bible, which has now appeared with magnificent pictures.
At the beginning the picture was for Otmar Alt, who formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and screen in 150 motifs.
His "language" with colored colours and imaginative shapes has been given to the 75-year-old - which is not in any way equivalent to "funny" images.
On the contrary: Adapted to the respective topics, this can seem quite dark.
About three years Otmar Alt has worked on his Bible project, for which he has made a subjective and artistic selection from the many themes of the "Book of All Books."
Cycles have emerged that dedicate themselves to topics such as crossroads, plagues, commandments or fathers.
He has thus spontaneously fascinated several partners: this applies to the Luther publisher with its theological orientation as well as to the Kettler publisher with its focus on art books.
And there is, above all, the author Klaus Altepost, who has dealt with the respective sites of the Bible on the basis of painting.
He interpreted the Bible sites selected by Otmar Alt and thus "translated" into today in current contexts.
These texts are like verbal mirrors of old painting.
They are embedded between the original Bible quotation by Martin Luther and each one of the artists who formulates his personal thoughts about the situation.
The jewelry tape has golden letters.
Thus, the 75-year-old allows twice a deep insight into his soul, his emotions.
This is a high degree of intimacy.
Emotions were ultimately even triggers to the Bible project: Otmar Alt, born in 1940 in Wernigerode and raised in Berlin, comes from a family belonging to the strict protestant ruler order.
"There the education happened with the pipe stock," Otmar Alt remembers.
"I have tried to work this up to perhaps be able to deal with the Lord Father again."
His second concern is to restore the importance of art in fast life: "The perception of image worlds is now characterised by advertising, and it is loud.
Symbolism is being pushed out there.
Artists have a different desire and desire to show things.
Pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative.
"In this respect, I am a dinosaurer."
Otmar Alt wants the viewers to "fall into the images," let them work on themselves, discover and feel the strength they have: "The picture is looking for its opposite."
Klaus Altepost confessed on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar-Alt Bible in the Otmar-Alt Foundation, "always" to be a lover of Otmar Alts art: "I like how he understands life with his pictures."
Old did not take full account of the Bible, but selected the important and mysterious topics for him.
"This was not a cooperation at eye level," says Altepost: "This is about the images, the text only explains." The creation was a picture Bible.
For Hans Möhler of the Luther publisher, this work is an invitation to "deepen his life and find freedom."
Otmar Alts pictures speak for Möhler both the (biblical) language of love and the language of responsibility.
Part of the original - paper and canvas images - is presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on 15 November in the Otmar-Alt Foundation.
Starting construction for BMX train approaching
Plans made, found place, company commissioned, ground hills modeled for a round course: one year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BMX railway was already over.
Failure in politics and administration led to mischief, especially among the inhabitants who did not want to tolerate the railways.
So hills moved down, new place sought - now with formal planning and application for construction approval.
In October, the first communist Sabine Mosebach-Bock was now able to notify in the Committee on Children and Youth.
"I hope this year is still visible," she said.
It should then be started without "further memory break" with the work of the former indoor pool.
DFB intensifies engagement for refugees
The DFB expands its commitment to refugees by 2019, and the Federal League makes a clear signal on the weekend.
The soccer responds to the emerging situation in Germany and ensures policy's help in addressing the problems that arise.
"I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since the reunification."
"No one can say in principle that this is none of my business, I have nothing to do with it."
"This must interest everyone to get this subject under control," said DFB Chief Wolfgang Niersbach.
At the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin, he intends to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively.
"I'll be at the Chancellor's Office next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State Ms. Özoğuz and the Chancellor there."
"The subject will certainly play a central role," he announced.
Football could and would help.
But the decisive waves must be political.
The German Football Alliance has therefore extended its refugee initiative "1: 0 for a welcome" by four years.
"On the Egidius-Braun Foundation, we have ensured that this programme will continue by 2019," Niersbach explained at the edge of the UEFA meeting in St. Julian's / Malta.
Some federal ligists also support this programme.
Already this weekend, the 36 pros put a clear sign when they will bear the impression "We help - # refugee welcome" on the left triangle instead of the usual sponsorship logo (Hermes).
"We also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can only," said Leverkusens Sports Manager Rudi Völler of the "picture" newspaper (Tuesday) and called the project "self-understanding."
"The refugee drama goes on everyone, no one can look away."
"We football federal ligists can, no, we need to use our radiation power, our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly," Hertha Manager Michael Preetz said.
Hoffenheim's managing director Peter Rettig spoke of a "prominent sign of the league."
At the EM qualification game against Hungary this Friday, the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Saale.
Niersbach described the support of refugees as "a major Community work of German football."
The fact that all 36 licensing associations had started their own projects in their places is great.
It is just so great that small and smallest clubs are active there.
The message "1: 0 for a welcome," which we have spent, is living in football.
"This is of enormous importance," he said.
In this and next year, the association, together with the DFB selection and the federal government, will provide EUR 300 000 for the integration of refugees.
"The clubs have already called the whole sum for 2015," Niersbach reported.
Reports: SAP Board Head loses an eye in case of accident
The head of the board of Europe's largest software group, Bill McDermott, has lost the left eye by a fall in early July.
During the accident on the staircase in his brother's house in the United States, he fell on a water glass that he wore in his left hand after midnight, reporting the "Economic Week" on Wednesday.
"He was almost bleeding, was fainted, then dragged himself out on the street - that's what he told us last week," quotes the "WiWo" SAP founder Hasso Platner.
McDermott was able to follow his work.
"At the beginning of October we meet before the Supervisory Council meeting in Walldorf," said Platner.
The 54-year-old manager was involved in the meeting and "fully workable."
McDermott announced in an interview with the "South German newspaper" (Thursday edition) that he would return to Germany in October and continue to lead the software concerts.
"I'm full of SAP, full of my job."
"Of course, I have been in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Hasso Platner all the time," said McDermott the "SZ."
McDermott is usually hanging between Germany and the USA, but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP central in Walldorf.
It is important for him to go to the public with such a personal history, the manager of the "SZ" said: "Everyone can happen such a thing."
"It's important to get back up when you fall."
McLaren replacement pilot Magnussen out of battle...
Magnussen twittered a corresponding photo and explained that he suffered the injury when he fell off the wheel.
He is therefore not as interested in leaving in Singapore on the weekend as a reserve driver for the two tribal pilots Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button as a week later at Japan's Great Prize.
Football: BVB without Reus against Krasnodar: Weidenfeller in the Gate
At Borussia Dortmund all hopes for a comeback of Marco Reus in the first group game of the Europe League have finally broken down.
The national player will also be missing from the table leader of the German Football League in the duel with the FK Krasnodar on Thursday (7: 00 / Sky).
"Unfortunately, we cannot rely on him," said Thomas Tuchel on Wednesday.
Whether Reus will be back at the Bundesliga top game against Leverkusen on Sunday, the BVB coach left open: "We expect him to return to training on Friday."
In view of the high burden of his professionals, Tuchel will not only change his stem melf on the Reus position.
This is how he announced a change on the gate guard position.
This is why Roman Weidenfeller occupies the place of Stammkeeper Roman Bürki.
"He trained at an absolute top level," the soccer teacher praised the world champion.
However, if weidenfeller will be used in all Europe League games in the future, Tuchel left it open.
With high probability he will also contest the second party.
The research statement by co-player Reus that the final entry for the BVB in the Europe League must be the goal, considers middle field player Julian Weigl to be understandable: "Marco is not so wrong."
"I think we have a good chance to take the title off."
Roboterautos: Government wants to play a leading role for Germany
Germany should, according to the will of the Federal Government, be a pioneer in the change of the car technology.
The Federal Cabinet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which includes investments in the development of digital infrastructure.
On Wednesday in Frankfurt, Dobrindt spoke of a "new mobility age" on the edge of the IAA Automesse.
The automated and networked driving will increase traffic safety and reduce the impact, said Dobrindt.
He also wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G7 countries, who also meet with industry representatives at the IAA.
The Ministry of Transport's strategy paper underlines, among other things, the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a rapid transition to digital broadcasting.
In order to test new technology, a test route on the 9 motorway in Bavaria is currently being developed.
In order to avoid "additional liability risks to the driver," the Federal Government intends to review the legal framework "and, where necessary, to adapt to new developments."
For example, Germany intends to make an international effort to increase the maximum permitted speed for self-driving cars from 10 to 130 hours kilometres.
The Federal Government also intends to amend the Vienna Convention, which so far only provides for people as drivers.
In automated driving the car increasingly takes the lead, the driver becomes a passenger more and more.
The technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds.
According to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, high-automated driving on motorways will be technically possible by 2020.
Nevertheless, driving-free vehicles on public roads should be "expected only far after 2020."
The value added in the field of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions at the site of Germany estimates the authors of the study for 2025 to approximately 8.4 billion euros.
"The digital connection of the car can lead to more safety and efficiency in road transport," SPD transport policy Sören Bartol said.
However, the issue of liability in the event of accidents and the safety of the personal data of drivers must be clearly clarified.
However, the German self-driving cars are still sceptical - much more than French or American.
An inquiry by the Forsa Institute on behalf of the Examination Organization Decra presented to the AA on Wednesday results that only eight percent of the Germans believe that self-driving cars will be enforced in the next ten years, 32 percent only expect in 20 years, 31 percent do not believe in it at all.
In France, 21 per cent of respondents account for self-driving cars by 2025 and 33 per cent in the US.
However, the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely entirely on a self-driving vehicle.
After a survey of the Digital Association Bitkom, only seven percent would agree to give control over all the roads.
On the highway, the traffic in flowing traffic could be expected to be 15 percent, at least 45 percent.
Well every fourth would leave the car control under no circumstances.
Boll cancels team and double start at table tennis EM
The Düsseldorf wants to strike only in individual cases in the title struggles from 25 September to 4 October.
The final decision shall be taken by 22 September at the latest.
"This is a huge loss for our team."
"The boys found out in the morning."
"But we are strong enough to get the title even without Timo," said Bundestrainer Jörg Roßkopf during the EM course in Düsseldorf.
Boll was at that time on the flight to a long-term sponsorship event in China.
The 34-year-old German Master is expected back on Friday.
"Without Timo, the disadvantage is that we are no longer such a clear favourite," said Single European Master Dimitrij Ovtcharov.
The Hamelner, who mentioned the set list in Jekaterinburg, also reminded the EM 2013 in Schwechat.
"At that time Timo was missing too, and we became European masters."
"We should focus on this," said the World Ranking Fifth.
The English football national player Luke Shaw of Manchester United has suffered a serious injury to the right leg.
At the PSV Eindhoven Champions League, the defender was hit by Héctor Moreno and replaced after long treatment.
The first diagnosis showed that the 20-year-old co-player of Bastian Schweinsteiger had been broken.
Gaultier feels too old for an inventor terrible
It is a mixture of very great fashion show and a wax figure scary cabinet: The designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich.
The highlights: Shovewindow dolls, which look terrifying human thanks to video projections.
They carry the spectacular creations of the French designer, who, among other things, became the great star of the fashion scene with Madonna's stage outfit - and by putting men in skirts.
"I can't say today that I am the inventor of terrible skin couture because I have white hair."
"Before it was bleached, it is now real," said Gaultier.
For the visitors of the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk" (From the Citizens' Step on the Step), which is to be seen from September 18 at the Kunsthalle of the Hypo-Cultural Foundation, it is a good luck that the fashion creator has changed his initial opposing attitude to a show about his person.
In fact, he had been opposed, because, "For me an exhibition sounded a little after death," he said.
If you die, you get to the museum.
The impressive collection had already been made in the Canadian Montreal and in Paris Station.
"It's about so much more than just beautiful clothes," said the director of the art hall, Roger Dieders.
It is about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibits give an insight into the barely overlooking work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed a training.
Chronologically, the show is not built, but it is an excellent choreographer's overall work for which a lot of effort has been done: For example, to freshen the dolls, a stylist was specifically engaged.
14 tonnes of material have been cared to Munich according to the curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot.
Shortly before the start of the Oktoberfest, there was a special slander in it: a leather pants outfit with corset.
Heidi meets Madonna.
He has always been interested in strong women ("women are smarter than men") and for people who are a little different, said Gaultier.
Gaultier's old Teddy can also be seen in the exhibition.
He stands for the designer's first, brave, fashionable, fashionable attempts.
As a child (he was not a good student and bad in football) he wore his Teddy BH's and dresses, said Gaultier.
To play with a doll, his parents wouldn't have allowed him.
He later taught himself the design of fashion.
He stole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers, as Gaultier told us in Munich.
I bought them later, of course.
He couldn't pay the models for his first fashion show.
They didn't get anything, but they were allowed to keep their clothes.
Jewelry instead of Gardine - Plauener Spitze as fashion niche
In the past, the long embroidery machines were in and to plow about making meters.
The embroidered fabrics and tips were produced in a large amount for customers who, for example, continued to process them to blankets and curtains.
This alone no longer works today, explains Andreas Reinhardt, Managing Director of the Modespitze Plauen.
Instead, fashion is important again.
In the early times of the Plauen top, fashion played a greater role, then was pushed out by the home textile industry - and is now rediscovered as niche.
Reinhardt gives some examples: top in jewelry, accessories such as pockets and regional desires.
Overall, the so-called vintage mode, which is based on past styles, is an increasing potential for supply.
Whoever does not serve niches in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market.
With us, they already make up half of all orders.
Modespitze Plauen is a member of the Plauener Spitze and Embroidery Branchenverband together with nine other companies.
Only they can wear the protected label.
Over the last 15 years, around 80% of turnover has been broken down.
Private trade and wholesale are almost no longer available.
Our products do not reach the customer in this way.
The mass goods are now produced much cheaper in Asian space and almost exclusively distributed via chains.
In addition, exports are weaker, currently to Russia and the USA.
So enough reasons for new ways.
The industry association is also trying to point out through environmental awareness, as Cordula Bauer from the embroidery in Falkenstein explains: "Since this year we have been running a quality seal that shows that we produce environmentally and socially tolerable."
Reinhardt added: "This also refers to the materials used."
Diplomdesigner Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberger Außenstelle der Westsächsischen Hochschule Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Art - and specializes in embroidery and tips.
In order to counteract the competition from the Asian area, high-quality and innovative products must be found.
It takes time and courage.
There is a tendency between the most fresh ideas of designers and the companies that need to think economically in particular, "says Schmidt.
Therefore, an existing design is often only slightly varied to keep a customer strain.
A few years ago, the textile designer Kati Reuter revived the historic snowball tip.
The machine sticks small bullets in some places.
The Plauener Goldschmiedemeisterin Bianca Hallebach-Krauße inspired himself: "Before I could not begin anything with traditional Plauener Spitze."
Now she uses the snowball tip for her jewelry.
In an exhaustive process, it shapes the pattern in silver.
"Many people in the region are identifying themselves with the theme of Plauen's top - young and old," Reuter says.
It also delivers to the United States, Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors have lived in Plauen and surroundings and who want a memorial.
So I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of the Plauen top.
Disney Plants New "Mary Poppins" Film
You should not touch legends, but Disney still cares for a new movie of his classic Mary Poppins.
According to "Entertainment Weekly," however, it is not a refilm but a kind of continuation that plays 20 years after the first film with the magical child girl.
It is about Nanny's experience with the Banks family in times of the world economic crisis in England.
Anyone who plays Poppins over 50 years after Julie Andrews is still unclear.
But the director is quite clear: Rob Marshall, last with "Into the Woods" in the cinema.
Xi urges to open the economy wider for the world
The economy must open itself more widely outside to promote growth, President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday a group commissioned to manage the reform.
"China should endeavour to attract foreign investment and know-how and to improve business start-ups strategies," he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Management Group for the deepening of a comprehensive reform.
To promote new foundations and to promote reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and provide new place for economic growth, said Xi.
The management group has adopted a number of directives, including a negative list of market access rules, relaxation of border control policies, promotion of state enterprises (SOE), inclusion of private capital, and overhaul of the resident reporting system.
According to the statement, a negative list is drawn up identifying sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment.
The system is gradually tested and improved by testing programs.
The initiative is important since it gives the market a greater role in allocating resources, guarantees a legal business environment and makes the market more open, said the statement.
The government will also relieve control of the powers conferred on companies and ensure that companies decide how to manage their business.
The statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
In the context of an offer to open state-controlled sectors, further areas are opened for private investment.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide better services for them," said the statement.
In addition, it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the "Green Card" by optimizing the requirements and facilitating the application process.
The right of lawyers to exercise their duties and to use professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at a meeting.
The meeting also attended Prime Minister Li Keqiang and important leaders such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, as reported in a statement published after the meeting.
EU wants to double mercury limit in predatory fish
The European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predators and thus give consumers a significantly higher dose of nerve poison.
The consumer organisation Foodwatch, which has a corresponding EU working paper, strongly criticised the plans: "The risks and side effects of misplaced industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full weaning of pregnant and infant children," said Matthias Wolfschmidt of Foodwatch.
According to Wolfschmidt, the limit values of the nerve poison for large fish at the end of the food chain, such as shark or swordfish, are to be increased from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish for "economic reasons."
However, large predators are already so heavily burdened with mercury that on the basis of the still applicable limits, about 50% of catches are not allowed to be sold.
After doubling the limit values, only 14.5 per cent would be unsold.
In return for this relaxation, Foodwatch states that the EU intends to tighten the limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram.
However, Foodwatch called this "trick," because smaller peacekeeping fish, such as carpets, are usually so low that they are already complying with the planned maximum values today.
The reduction in small fish is therefore "a perfide distraction manoeuvre that only helps the economy," said Wolfschmidt.
Mercury is a heavy metal that is highly toxic to humans, which is highly enriched through the food chain, especially in predators.
The federal government therefore warns that "already small quantities can cause, especially in the case of unborn damage to the nervous system."
However, the Federal Ministry of the Environment explains on its homepage with regard to the current maximum levels that a "health hazard to the general population" cannot be expected.
Mercury comes mainly through coal burning into the environment.
According to a written information from the Federal Ministry of the Environment to the Green Bundestag secretary Annalena Baerbock, two thirds of the total quantity of mercury issued in Germany.
The concentration of mercury in fish such as Elbe, Rhine and Danube was "persistent and surface-covered," the "mirror" had quoted from the paper in March.
Last year, European-wide warnings of mercury in fish were already among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU RASFF warning system.
