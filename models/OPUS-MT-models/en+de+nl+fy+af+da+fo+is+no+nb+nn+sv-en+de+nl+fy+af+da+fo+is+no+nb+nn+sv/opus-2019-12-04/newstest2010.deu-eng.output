Barack Obama receives the Peace Nobel Prize as the fourth President of the United States
American President Barack Obama is coming to Oslo, Norway for 26 hours to receive the Nobel Peace Prize here as the fourth President of the United States in history.
In addition, he receives the diploma as well as the medal and a check of $1.4 million for his extraordinary efforts to intensify world diplomacy and cooperation among the peoples.
The head of the White House will arrive tomorrow with his wife Michelle in the northern metropolis and will be busy all the time.
First he visits the Nobel Institute, where he meets the five committee members who chose him in October from 172 people and 33 organisations.
The presidential couple then planned a meeting with the Norwegian King Harald V. and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon the visit reaches its highlight with the ceremony, at which Obama takes over the prestige price.
He receives this as the fourth President of the United States, but only as the third who receives the prize directly in office.
The White House already avised that Obama will talk about the Afghanistan War when taking over the prize.
The President does not want to avoid this issue because he knows that he is taking the price as a President who is currently conducting war in two countries.
He strengthened the efforts of the war a few days ago by sending further troops to Afghanistan, which none of his critics forget to highlight.
At the ceremony Obama also received the golden medal, the diploma and the check over ten million Swedish crowns (approximately 24 million Czech crowns).
He intends to donate the money for charitable purposes, but he has not yet decided on a specific charitable work.
The event programme then provides for a banquet with the President and his wife, where, apart from the King and Queen of Norway, the Prime Minister and another 250 invited guests will be present.
Obama was very reluctant from the beginning to the price.
He suggested, for example, that he had the feeling that he didn't fully deserve the price.
He also repeated several times that it is not only for him but for all who strive for the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement, he noted that this was for him "call for action."
Natural protectors are accused of blackmail
The Chief Meritz Police accused the chairman of the Civil Society "Naturschutzgemeinschaft Leitmeritz" of blackmail.
In several cases he filed appeals against some construction procedures last year, for the withdrawal of his professions he called for money from the investors to his favor, said the chief seritz police preacher, Alena Romova.
The Chairman of the Principal Meritz Natural Protection Community, Lubomir Studnicka.
Now he's in jail and he's threatening a prison sentence of up to three years.
The Sortier Trash Container in Brunnen doesn't smell good
In Prague, people can sort the beverage packages, in the South Morocco localities you find again on step and step the sorting trash container.
And in brunette?
There you have to book a few minutes to find the appropriate garbage tons.
I don't want to say that the waste separation in the well would not work at all.
But it seems to me that the Council rulers are not sufficiently concerned with this problem, even if we are the second largest city in the Republic.
Brünn is located in the waste separation in the Urwaldliga, not only because we, as citizens here, are always allowed to dispose of only paper, glass and plastics, but above all because of the number of waste tons for such waste.
Have they ever tried to dispose, for example, of the PET bottles in a collection basket?
It's just art, it takes time and strong nerves.
The only place I have found until now is the milling place opposite the roofed goose.
Mr Underka should not upset us with his colleagues, but that seems to me too little.
Except that the separation of waste is not a honey licking in other parts.
That's why all my friends don't sort the trash.
It's faulty.
They are too far from the garbage tones.
I'm not surprised.
I offered myself after the celebration to dispose of some glass and plastic bottles.
But on the Konicova street, I didn't see any color trash tones in sight.
Fortunately, I got in the right place when I was driving the tram.
But the trash almost ran over.
This is still the centre of Brunnen, which represents the whole city, isn't it?!
However, ecology and some kind of aesthetic probably leaves the brunns socialists cold.
You prefer to buy the city an ice hockey league that makes us embarrassed throughout the Republic rather than buying a few more garbage tons and offering the sorting of other raw materials for a cleaner well.
I am glad that I could confirm my assumption also with official statistics after searching on the Internet for a while.
According to the data of the company EKO-KOM, Brünn really stands in the entire district of South Morocco the worst.
The "Paroubek" budget has withdrawn the money for pensions and sickness benefits
After the left party, despite the government's opinion, gave more money to farmers and officials, there is no more money in the budget for pensions, sickness allowances and building parks.
But not for government debt interest or international court disputes.
This causes them even more problems that will be with the government in the second half of next year, says the Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists passed the wage increase for some groups, they assumed that the government would also borrow the money for sensitive spending, age pensions or sickness benefits. "This is just a postponement of the problems in the future, mining," says Janota.
The loans are gradually paying higher interest rates, and you have to repay the money sometime.
Too much to choose from, where to take from, the state fund is empty.
If the social benefits or costs of the state operation are not reduced, the tax should be increased.
For all those that the left party now gave more money: the fire department, the teachers, the farmers.
And later for her children.
To get the pensions or the sickness allowance, whose account has disappeared 1.8 billion, people don't have to be afraid, they get that money.
But for the price that the state owes itself even more - next year, it will not only be 163 billion, but much more in the state fund.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, debt will rise so much faster and together with it also costs and interest.
The State will need the money for compensation, then it will no longer suffice to increase VAT only slightly or to reduce maternity allowance, as the government did in its counterdeficit package.
As a result of the money drafting in favour of some electoral groups, five billion will also be missing next year for the expansion of motorways and railways.
These are mainly the sections gained in competition, which can no longer be reprojected and possibly billed.
Get the highest, which is not free of charge.
This means delays or cancellation of thirty large buildings, is also at risk of European money creation, warns the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The CSSD has proposed that it solves the flow of money salomonically - it attacks the CEZ share profits in which the state is the owner of the majority, and from which the money is then spent in the transport fund.
The problem is that the level of dividend is never safe and it is not an infinite source.
Last year, 18 billion CEZ fled into the budget.
Every year, dividends pay the environmental damage liquidation, fill the pension account, and this money also serves as a reserve for the planned pension reform.
In addition, this trick increases the real budget deficit by 5.7 per cent of GDP according to the EU rules.
But this does not end the carnival of the restorations.
Almost three billion were reduced in the budget for various compensation for the victims of communism and crimes or for the costs of court disputes, even for building savings.
Whether the state can handle it without this money is not safe.
This is pure gambling.
If we lose an international court dispute, we have to pay for it anyway, Janota makes it clear.
The Minister must then save money internally or, in the worst case, attack the government budget reserve.
Hundreds of millions are also missing for the already launched two-billion project "State Fund," which is intended to allow on-line monitoring of what the individual authorities spend the money on.
The first stage starts in January.
If the Minister of Finance did not find the money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and in this case there would be sanctions, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will control two operating systems
The Americans expect for the future a phone on which the user can switch by pressing a single button between different operating systems.
The plans presented look promising.
It is enough to just press one button, and Windows Mobile will change Android within a few seconds.
This is exactly what the American company wants to introduce VMware, which focuses mainly on the development of the virtual software for computers.
We allow you to perform two user profiles simultaneously on the phone.
You can switch between these, you can separate them into two home- and work profiles.
Both will work parallel, Srinivas Krishnamurti suggested by the company VMware at the interview for the magazine Computerworld.
It was presented in November last year and presented for the first time a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
The virtualization of smart phones is not a fiction.
VMware successfully introduced the smartphone test pattern with two operating systems to the journalist.
One was a modified Nokia N800 with a RAM memory of 128 MB, on which the above systems were simultaneously running Windows Mobile and Android.
The development of the new technology for mobile phones is fully underway.
Now the company VMware is working with European and American operators on the smartphones virtualization and to the customer the equipment should come within 2012.
Snow deficiency on the mountains tortures hotel owners
Scneelose slopes do not only care the giant mountain residents.
The missing snow also frightens people from ordering skiing in hotels and pensions.
Therefore you can still get free rooms for all winter dates incl. Christmas and New Year's.
Our pages are frequently visited.
People go through the offers, determine the prices, but now they are afraid to order mandatory.
And when they call us, they immediately ask if we think this year's Christmas party will be on snow or "on matt," the operator of the information portal Spindl.Info, Martin Jandura, introduced.
Anyone who wants the New Year's stay in the spider mill exactly according to his ideas should no longer hesitate with the order.
If you prefer saving and when the quality of the stay comes in second place, you can try to wait a few more days.
The Spindelmühle hotel owners now offer mostly weekly stays for the New Year's Day.
I think they will be trying to sell them for a while, but then they will also have to give up and go into shorter times.
And then the free rooms will disappear quickly, judged Jandura.
Free beds at all winter terminals always offer the travel agency Ingtours in Vrchlabi.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week that has not been sold out yet.
In our offer, about half of the seats are still free.
That is why we have already prepared a few cheaper Christmas stays for the last moment, the director of the travel agency Ingtours, Petr Schiefert, introduced.
The Vrchlabi travel agency can also offer the New Year's Day in Giant Mountains, but there are fewer free places here.
The first fourteen days of February are also good, the remaining winter dates are sold on average.
This year's interest in winter stays is also negatively influenced by the fact that there is always no snow in huge mountains.
People are waiting for snow to fall.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes are snowed within a week, Christmas will also be sold out, says Schiefert.
Conversely and slightly better than last year it is possible to occupy the rooms at Hotel Horizont in Pecpod Snezkou.
We are about five percent better than last year.
On New Year's Day and Christmas we only have a few free rooms.
There is great interest in the Polish holidays in January, and in February the business will also run well, informed the director of the best Pec hotel, Karel Rada.
At 80 percent for the New Year's Eve Hotel Omnia is also occupied at the central parking lot in Janske Lazne.
On the other hand, half of the beds remain free for Christmas at the latest hotel in Janske Lazne.
It was a pleasure to surprise us this year of January, for which we are already occupied at about 60 percent.
A little weaker is now February, but at the moment when the snow comes, the interest in the stay in the giant mountains will certainly increase, the Director of Hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch, led.
The huge mountain hotel owners are now waiting for a larger snow cover.
On Thursday it should cool down and if it comes down, it should be on the mountains snow.
But after that, Jiri Jakubsky informed from the location of the Czech Weather Office in Hradec Kralove.
USA: Repeat is the mother of wisdom
It is almost strange with which student striving Barack Obama, the President with his reputation of the smartest, repeats the strategy of his predecessor in the Afghanistan issue he thought himself was the dumbest.
Finally, when he was expecting his sensual Afghanistan doctrine, it turned out that he wrote it down through the copy paper from the Busch-Iraq scenario three years ago.
Not only did he use the spell "like in Iraq" several times in the text itself, he even used the name of the Bush Declaration of January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "New Forward" without enchanting.
Even three years ago, he criticized the Bush idea - fresh troop quotas in Iraq plagued by the Civil War - as "irresponsible and in their follow-up catastrophic decision."
However, subsequent months showed that the Bush strategy based on military recommendations was the only possible and so far very successful one no longer speaks in the news about Iraq.
Bush's reputation was not improved, because objectively he left his successor a much more grateful starting situation than it was expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will be repeated.
He was asked to increase the force quota once again to the military, especially the chief commander of Afghanistan Operation General Stanley McCristal, who, despite the subordination habits, criticized the enchanting shooters in the White House hard.
He demanded 40,000 soldiers to reverse the situation to the better.
The President hesitated three months, but did not come up with a better idea and so he cheated on the General wenistens by 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe, he has pressed for another 5,000, even though he originally calculated at least 10,000.
Very problematic about the whole Obama strategy is his plan to withdraw the troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and to complete this process within three years. The whole Obama doctrine leaves more questions than answers.
Some doubt that the half-increase will have the same effect as the measure in Iraq.
Even in spite of the Brotherwar of recent years, Iraq's society is relatively well structured, its leaders honour the values.
The Afghan situation is characterised by the contraindication - no one can rely on anyone and no agreements are held.
Under these conditions it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces who are used to changing their opinion every day.
The political institutions, even if formally founded correctly, will only remain pheasants behind which patriarchal stem relations will continue to grow.
The balance of interests between the different ethnic groups is unusually complicated, especially because of the invisibility of the conditions which further complicate the Pakistani and Iran influences.
The construction of a "capable state of action," which is the minimalist objective of the entire operation, is also very unrealistic.
The horizon of the Obama strategy is exaggerated by its voluntarism
Over the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only further deteriorated and is now at the edge of the explosion.
It believes that the small soldiers who have broken out in the war screaming about the "early return" can create a miracle here only a truly romantic soul that cannot be impressed by facts.
From a political point of view, the date set for the troop withdrawal is purely irresponsible because the Taliban will accept this as an indirect confession of the American defeat.
The last NATO Summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to participate in the fighters in Afghanistan is negligible.
Europe's politicians can and do not want to explain to their voters how the security of Germany or Italy is linked to the war in the Hindukusch Mountain Forestry.
Another possible factor that can have a radical impact on the situation is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions do not affect the Iranians, the United States has a very serious question as to whether the problem should not be solved with troops.
This question needs to be answered during the period when America is going to Obama for victorious withdrawal from Afghanistan.
However, every solution will also mean a dramatic reversal of the Afghan situation.
The only consolation patch for Barack Obama is the fact that three years remain until the presidential election, so there is plenty of time to move to another strategy, if it were to prove to be a total failure.
The managers of the Bank Goldman Sachs no longer receive premium bonuses in cash
The leaders of the American bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive premiums in cash this year.
This has been announced by the company, which responds to the sharp criticism of their wage practices.
A group of 30 top managers receives shares instead of money, but they can only be sold in five years.
In addition, the shares may be withdrawn from the managers in the case of excessive risk.
Goldman Sachs, according to the Reuters Agency, is thus at the forefront of the efforts to connect the premium eboni of Wall Street with long-term performance.
I believe that Wall Street is aware of the further direction in which it has to go, the former banker of the company JPMorgan, Douglas Elliott, led.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs became the target of criticism after she had left for the first three quarters of this year almost 17 billion dollars for premium bonuses.
The total amount of premium bonuses during this year will probably be higher than 20 billion dollars in spite of the measure announced today, according to the Reuters Agency.
The high premium bonuses in the banking sector have become the hottest political issue at the beginning of the financial crisis in a number of countries.
The UK reported on Wednesday that it intends to charge the credits of the banks, which exceed 25,000 pounds, one time with a tax of 50 percent.
Similar steps are also preparing France.
This year women have won the Nobel Prizes in all disciplines, except in physics.
Five record women today in Stockholm took this year's Nobel Prizes in the specialized categories and for literature from the hands of the King of Sweden Carl XVI. Gustaf.
In addition to the four scientists, the German writer was Romanian descent, Herta Müller, among them.
The Nobel Prize for Medicine has received two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, together with their countryman Jack Szostak for research in the chromosone field.
The price for chemistry has been received by Israeli Ada Jonath, together with the Americans, Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, for clarification of the Ribosom structure and function.
The last Laureatin awarded the Nobel Prize for Economy, which the American Elinor Ostrom and her Landsmann Oliver Williamson received for analysis of the economic report.
The only category in which no woman received a Nobel Prize this year was physics.
Today, the scientists Charles Kao for research in the fiber field and George Smith together with Willard Boyl for the CCD chip invention, which is the basis of all digital chambers, fax devices or astronomical remote pipes.
Each of these winners has received the diploma, the Nobel medals and the certificate of the purchase of the money price.
It is 10 million Swedish crowns in each category.
If there are several winners in each category, the money price will be divided among them.
Traditionally, the American President, Barak Obama, has received the most expected Nobel Peace Prize this afternoon in Oslo.
In his speech he recognised the controversy of his appointment, because he is only at the beginning of his journey and is also at the forefront of the country that runs two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
However, in respect of his policy, he added that wars are necessary in certain situations for the struggle against world peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota is considering the resignation. Klaus invited him to the castle
President Vaclav Klaus will receive the Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, on Friday morning, thinking about his stay in the government because he disagrees with the implementation of the State budget for the next year in the form that was released by the Assembly of Members on Wednesday.
It is assumed that the budget and perhaps the stay of Janota in the cabinet will be the topics of the Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
According to him, the real deficit is too high, which also deepens the crisis of public finances.
The president, Radim Ochvat, informed about the meeting.
Janota wants to negotiate with the Prime Minister Jan Fischer on Monday.
According to the budget law, which now receives Klaus for signature, the Czech Republic should have a deficit of 163 billion kroner.
In Parliament, however, on Wednesday, we voted on the Left Party's proposals for a change in money and increased the money for the state officials' salaries, for the maintenance of the social benefits and direct wages of farmers.
The government has prevented the proposals of social democracy from hiding the budget deficit.
Therefore, between the left party on the one hand and the government, Klaus and the right party, on the other hand, there has been a sharp domestic dispute because of the question mark on the further work of the Fishermen's Civil Service Cabinet on which the ODS, CSSD and Green Party agreed in spring.
Critics claim that the budget, as it was adopted by Parliament, practically liquids the package of savings measures implemented by the fisheries government in the autumn, which, according to their understanding, is intended to end the state debt.
Klaus, who can sign the law on the state budget but does not have to, today at the meeting breakfast with the entrepreneurs said that politicians have neglected the "serious problem" which "represents the unsustainable deficit" of public finances for a long time.
In his view, there is no good solution today.
Improvement could only bring about a strong government which could build on a broader consensus among the political parties.
The ODS president, Mirek Topolanek, pointed out that the budget is horrible and that the government should weigh up its further existence.
The ODS Vice-President, Petr Necas, told CTK that the concept of the civil servant cabinet with the support of the CSSD, ODS and the Green Party apparently no longer works.
Premier Fischer described in the editorial work similar words as "strong expressions."
The CSSD chief, Jiri Paroubek, responded to the topolanek words that the fact deficit was horrible, that the former government of Topolanek had prepared for this year, and that exceeds 200 billion crowns.
Already on Wednesday, the CSSD assessed the approval of the state budget for the next year as a success.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Mandela was played in the new film by Clint Eastwood by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film "Invictus: The Unbeaten" in the world shows a lot of the country whose struggle and victory despite some criticisms that the main role was occupied by an American actor.
The story tells about sport, racial relationships and about Nelson Mandela.
The untiring fighter against the racist apartheid regime in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is in his life history the American Oscar actor, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said he was asked by the one-ninety-year-old Mandela to represent him in the Eastwood movie.
Another important role is taken over by Matt Damon.
I told him, "If I'm gonna play you, I have to meet you.
The two-seventy-year-old actor who had received the prize for his role in the Eastwood drama from the boxing area "Million Dollar Baby," was already the leader of the movement to abolish slavery, which finally became a slave holder, a fictional US president, and also God in "Evan Almighty," but rarely someone who is still alive and for many people as important as Mandela.
The former South African State Man was in prison for 27 years for his active activity in ending apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released in 1990 and became President of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "unbeaten," and at the same time it is the name of a poem of the English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The requirement was to speak
The film describes a true situation in which Nelson Mandela joined his forces with the captain of the South African Rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to agree on the country. The new President Mandela knows that his people remain racial and economically divided even after apartheid.
He believes that he can agree his people through sport, so he decides to agree to the rugby players that belong to the outside world.
Finally, the South African team rises up to the World Cup of 1995.
Freeman worked several years to bring the Mandela story to the cinema wall.
He had no other purpose than to play this role to bring it as closely as possible to reality, said Freeman.
The biggest challenge was, of course, to speak like him.
The actor said if he and the world politician were to be in the same country, he would try to meet Mandela, eat with him at dinner and be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake Mandela's hand.
I noticed when I shake your hand, I take your energy, it's being transferred, and I had the feeling I know how you feel, he said.
For me, it's important to have become another person.
Matt Damon plays in the film François Pienaar, captain of the national rugby team, in which the white players have considered it.
The actor said he had six months to prepare himself for the role in the hard rugby world.
It was a great surprise for him when he met Pienaar for the first time in his house.
I remember when I rang the door bell that he opened and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was: 'In the movie I look much bigger'.
Despite the obvious differences in the stature of the actors compared to their actual models, he has received positive reviews under the direction of the director Eastwood "Invictus: Unbeaten" and is also talking about prospects for an Oscar.
The film critic of the magazine Daily Variety, Todd McCarthy, summarised his evaluation in the following words: "That was very good history, very well executed film."
In the film reviews on the web pages rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive evaluations.
Light secret about Norway dissolved: The Russians have tested a missile
A special light effect on Norway was observed unknown origin.
The Russian Ministry of Defence did not admit until yesterday that an intercontinental ballistic missile was tested near the Norwegian border.
However, the start was not successful again and the rocket called "Bulava," which should originally be the pride of the Russian army, will slowly become the nightmare of Russian generality as well as the Prime Minister, Vladimir Putin.
Also his repeated presence on site at the rocket test had no positive effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulava has mostly not been started or damaged in the air.
In the Russian newspapers you already write about "Bulava" as about a "missile that doesn't fly."
A rocket that doesn't fly but lights
This already 13th attempt, went normal at the beginning.
Only at the end of the flight have technical damage occurred on the rocket again.
Probably exploded the engine at the third rocket level.
This time, "Bulava" started from the Atom-U-boat Dmitrij Donskij, which drove under the water of the White Sea.
This rocket type allows the shooting from the submarine.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light caused by an indefinite flying object over the north road was actually the damaged "Bulava."
In addition, the Norwegians have not doubted since the first moment that it is a Russian missile.
This time, generality has preserved itself against it and claims that one cannot speak clearly of failure.
The first two stages of the missile did not fail and the accident was only the third stage affected.
In the previous cases, the engines were damaged in the first stage.
Even if no test start took place without error, the head of the Ministry of Defence considers only six out of thirteen to be unsuccessful.
The almost fifty percent success therefore fulfils the generality with optimism and thus continues to claim that the "bulava" will fly once without problems and will carry up to ten hypersound nuclear heads with a total weight of up to 1.15 tonnes.
The legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract with the CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
The legendary defense player Vjaceslav Fetisov is again in a professional ice hockey game with 51 years.
The former world champion, Olympic player and Stanley Cup holder helps his team CSKA Moscow in distress, and is probably already in the Friday duel KHL against Petersburg.
Fetisov, who has completed his career with forty years, in 1998, is currently president of the CSKA.
After Denis Kuljas is injured, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov has regularly trained and agreed that he will support the team.
We only need to clarify some remaining formalities, the Agency AP quoted the coach of the Moscow Club of Sergej Nemcinov.
In the meantime it is not clear whether the comeback of the famous ice hockey player will only affect one game.
I mean, Fetisov is one of those who can raise the morals of other players, co-player Nemcinov introduced.
When Fetisov comes back to the ice surface, he becomes the oldest Russian professional ice hockey game after AP.
In the NHL, the legendary stormer Gordie Howe played a whole season for Hartford at the age of fifty and was able to win 15 matches and 26 assistants.
The oldest of the famous five, Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful ice hockey players in history.
In the dress of the Soviet Union he won two Olympic gold medals, seven world championships, and he also triumphed in Canada Cup as well as in the Junior World Championship.
In the second part of his career he also gathered successes in the NHL, where he lifted the Stanley Cup twice over the head in the Detroit Dress.
He has been a member of the ice hockey star room since 2001.
Hyundai gave up the trade unions. All overtime is cancelled
The management of the Nosovice automobile factory Hyundai agreed with the trade union to abolish all overtime.
On Monday, due to often ordered overtime, the trade union announced the willingness to strike.
This was confirmed by the spokesman of the Hyundai automobile factory, Petr Vanek.
But the management wants to agree with the trade unions on a Saturday shift this week.
We must not abandon our production plan, which is a principle, so on Saturday, 19 December, voluntary overtime was proposed for the reason that two working shifts would be worked, said Vanek.
The Sedmicka.cz website wrote that the company offered a bonus of 400 CZK to employees who would work the Saturday shift.
The staff will also receive this in the aftermath for the Saturday shift of 28 November.
According to Vanek, the company has decided to change the mode of motivation of employees for the proposed overtime.
Either they can pay the overtime supplement or they can take a replacement holiday on December 28 and so the Christmas holidays extend, Vanek introduced.
In addition, all employees of the Saturday shift are paid the ticket and lunch.
With regard to the fact that the overtime was the most urgent and burning point regarding the demands and complaints of trade union workers who had stopped production last week, the management of yesterday afternoon decided with immediate effect on the abolition of all overtime for the month of December, Vaněk introduced.
The employees of the automobile factory had been forced until last week to work almost every day after the eight-hour shift.
From the signing of the agreement, the union will revoke the willingness to strike.
Further negotiations between the management of the automobile factory and the trade unions are to be held on Friday afternoon.
The trade union leader, Petr Kuchar, said on Wednesday that if they can agree on the fulfilment of the demands and sign a joint document, they would be willing to revoke the strikes.
Last week, on Wednesday, the situation in the automobile factory spiced up, when about 400 employees were spontaneously striking because of constant overtime.
They also protested against the bad payment conditions and alleged harassment.
The management held, however, that employees had to make overtime to meet the automotive supply needs.
The trade unions also called for no sanctions to be imposed on the employees who had interrupted production last Wednesday at their Monday strike call.
In the area of overtime, trade unions call for a minimum reduction in overtime work.
In addition, they are demanding that this year the fee of 5000 kroner be paid.
The Nosovice- Automobile factory Hyundai now employs 2,000 people.
Serial production started in the company in November last year.
Up to this September, some 80,000 vehicles were manufactured here and the current production capacity is 200,000 vehicles per year.
Czech Discovery: a substance that also acts in 'stolen' HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists is testing new connections to prevent the spread of HIV viruses in the organism.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also works with the viruses that are already resistant to medicines.
This fact outweighs the disadvantage that the connection to common virus variants does not work as strong as any of the existing medicines.
The disease AIDS cannot be healed yet.
However, patients can prolong their drug composition and prevent the proliferation of HIV viruses in their body.
However, your use is accompanied by a whole series of side effects.
Incomplete suppression of virus propagation also results in the development of sg. Resistance viruses that are no longer effective against medicines.
The work of experts from three institutions of the Academy of Sciences CR, from the VSCHT (Chemical-Technological University) Prague and from the University of Heidelberg opens the way to deal with virus resistance.
They have shown that the substances described as metalokarborans have an effect on the protein that is responsible for the propagation of the HIV virus.
The metalocarborans are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the virus propagation in a different way than all medicines used today, so they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work the scientists come to new 'improved' connections which were prepared on the basis of the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to the virus protein.
The metalocarborans have a unique three-dimensional structure: two vibrant cages consisting of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms and linked by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Homemade and resistant virus
HIV protease is the protein of the HIV virus which is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the HIV-protease divisions, there would be no ripe virus particles.
When we turn off the HIV protease, we also shut down the propagation of the virus in the patient's body, the scientists explain in the press report published by the Institute for Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences CR.
In the work published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe the whole series of connections in which two couples of cages (see table) are coupled by a short organic chain, which will then be systematically changed.
A little weaker but more reliable
The effect of this range of substances against HIV protease was tested in the reagent glass, including against their persistent (resistant) variants obtained by HIV infected patients.
The effect of metalokarborane on the usual enzyme variant is not as strong as in the clinically used medicinal products, but does not lose its effect on the resistant variants against which the used medicinal products are often uneffective.
The unique mechanism of action as well as its other properties, such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and possibility of other chemical forms, makes the metalocarborans interesting connections for further development of effective anti-HIV medicinal products, says Pavlina Rezacova, head of the structural biology laboratory of the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
Fight for budget. ODS went on fishermen who is fighting
The chairman of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, described the approved budget for the next year as "horrible" and the government of the Prime Minister of Jan Fischer should consider its continued existence.
The statement of the ODS was described by the Prime Minister as "strong expressions."
It's supposed to be time for the analysis.
The Vice-President of the ODS, Petr Necas, said that the concept of the Civil Service Cabinet with the support of the CSSD, ODS and the Green Party apparently no longer works.
According to Necas, the Prime Minister has to decide whether he intends to rely on the minority in Parliament when it comes to the fight against the rising deficit or whether he is staying in office with the links of Parliament.
The approach of ODS and the Social Democrats to the problem of public deficits is diametrically different, as Necas pointed out.
On Wednesday, Parliament adopted the budget for 2010, but with amendments from the Left Party over 12 billion kroner.
Parliament has increased the money for government officials, for the maintenance of social benefits and for direct payments to farmers.
In doing so, the government has prevented the proposals of social democracy from hiding the budget deficit.
Czechoslovakia should operate with a balance of 163 billion kroner.
The ODS has left the Chamber before the vote, so it complied with the government's wish, because the amended budget is only a less bad variant of the budget provisional. Frase not clear
Disappointment and senseless
The Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, has spoken about his disappointment and a sense of senseless, against which Prime Minister Jan Fischer has pointed out that the government is still assessing the current situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janota had seriously threatened to resign in case the amendments were adopted, the situation would look different.
According to Czech television, Janota signed up with the Prime Minister for Monday after the government business.
He pointed out that he was considering his further stay in the office.
The reason for this is his disappointment about the budget.
According to Necas, the nominees of social democracy (CSSD), who had implemented the changes in the budget, have nothing to do with this in the government.
The Prime Minister should also say clearly that he will resign if Parliament continues to adopt deficit-enhancing laws, such as those relating to sickness benefits and pensions or service-related novels.
Topolanek: Ministers nominated by ODS did not wrong
This is a matter for the Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS did not make mistakes, Topolanek highlighted in a text message from the US.
It has mentioned that in some ministries there are people in the deputy function who confess to TOP 09 who voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that if fishermen decide not to fight the deficit level of public finances, "it is perfectly logical and correct that they are based on the left majority currently in Parliament."
Then he is allegedly unable to expect the support and tolerance of the bourgeois Democrats.
I have not thought about it, and if that is going to happen, then I will deal with it, the Minister of Defence Martin Bartak, nominated by the Citizens' Democrats, said to the journalists in Parliament.
Prime Minister Fischer flew to Brussels in the afternoon at the European Council meeting.
The ODS resigned at the request of the Prime Minister
At the same time, Necas stressed that the ODS would probably vote against the amended budget on Wednesday in Parliament if the Prime Minister expressly asked the Members of the Citizens' Democrats to allow them to adopt the budget.
We do not appear to be orphans, we are not small children, and he then responded to the question whether the ODS was not pushed back in the political negotiations on the budget by the absence of the party chairman in Parliament and in the Czech Republic.
I didn't realize my voice would be missing.
Even when I abstained from the mandate, I knew that in the next few months, above all, it would be about the Bolshevics of Parliament and the destruction of everything positive, Topolanek himself responded.
According to the new roadmap of the CD (Czech Railway), less trains will drive for about the same price.
The Czech Railway is terminating or limiting from 13 December some less loaded fast and local trains, while other connections are being strengthened.
The total volume of transport will be reduced by two percent from the date of validity of the new roadmap compared to today.
Most tariffs incl. basic and customer travel rates are not changed.
For example, several connections to the capital are given to the inhabitants of the Ostrava area, the railroad uses trains of the type Pendolino.
The fast train will no longer drive to Bratislava (Pressburg).
Less fast trains will also drive on the route Prague - Pisek - Budweis, in principle the direct connections from Prague to Letohrad will be reduced.
The largest reduction is planned in the district of Hradec Kralove (Königsgraz), a total of eight percent, but an increase in Prague and the surroundings can be welcomed.
Two night trains on the route Prague - Tabor - Budweis are also lifted and on a few days a week the operation of some fast trains on the route Prague - Pisek - Budweis is reduced.
Among the major changes are the introduction of the new direct road from Milovice to Prague, at the moment the inhabitants of Milovice in Lysa nad Labem must change.
It is the fifteenth road of the Esko suburban transport system, whose opening is possible thanks to the railway electrification from Lysa nad Labem to Milovice.
The long distance to the capital will end at the target station Prague - main station.
The CD introduces more connection lines SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and the trains to Sumperk / Jesenik will drive at the time of two hours.
With the Pendolino the passengers have been unable to drive to Bratislava since 13 December.
This year's Regional Railway Account: increase of 200 million
The fast trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport, in total the railways receive four billion kroner to compensate for the so-called liquidity loss in the next year, just like this year. The local trains provide the districts, in total they pay eight billion kroner for it in the next year, with the state spending three billion.
This year the regional trains are 200 million Czech crowns more expensive.
For the local trains and the fast trains, the railway has renewed a ten-year contract, so far the contract has always been concluded for only one year.
Railways praise the system, and perhaps it did not therefore take the price increase with the vast majority of tickets.
Changes can only be made with one-day CD Net and with cheap eLiska Internet tickets.
For passengers without the customer card, the price of CD Net is increased from 450 kroner to 600 kroner.
The price eLiska will then depend on the ridden stick, until now it was uniform for the journey between any district cities and cost 160 crowns.
Philippine millitants hold more than 50 people, the children were released.
Millitante today kidnapped 75 people in the south of the Philippines, including some primary students and their teachers.
This has led the agency to AFP, which initially only informed over 65 kidnappers.
All 17 children arrested were released after eight hours, including one teacher.
It was kidnapped in the province of Agusan del Sur.
About 19 millitants allegedly used the hostages as a living shield in the escape from the police.
The local negotiators are now trying to release the remaining hostages.
According to the AFP agency, the millitants are part of the New People's Army (NPA), which is the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP, the police persecuted the kidnappers for the violence that demanded revenge trafficking between the two local family planes.
In the south of the Philippines, in the province of Maguindanao, due to the recent massacre where 57 people were killed, the standard law was imposed.
Among the victims of the 23 November massacre, which was associated with the election to the Governing Council, were 30 journalists.
Because of suspicion of participation in the massacre, the governor of this South Phillippine province and his father Andal Ampatuan, Patriarch of the influential ampatuan clan, were arrested.
Muslim separatists are also active on the island of Mindanao.
But those who resumed the peace negotiations with the Phillippine government on Tuesday.
The history of South Africa affects everyone, says Morgan Freeman a.k.a. Nelson Mandela
In the next few days, the new Hollywood film Clint Eastwoods comes to the American cinemas "Invictus: the Unbeaten," which includes part of the life history of the former President of the Republic of South Africa, Nelsona Mandela.
The role of the world-famous fighter against apartheid has been given to Morgan Freeman, who was allegedly elected by Mandela himself a few years ago.
The nephew role of the legendary South African champion in Rugby, Francois Pienaar, has been given Matt Damon.
With the cinematographic start of the film, responses from critics as well as from the public are also loud.
Nelson Mandela
His full name is Nelson Rolihlaha Mandela, born 18 July 1918 in South African Mvez.
In 1988 he received the Sakar Prize and in 1993 together with the Klerk the Peace Nobel Prize.
He was elected President of the Republic of South Africa in 1994-1999.
Big expectations are put in the film because it comes to cinemas at a time when South Africa culminates the preparations for the world championship, but at the same time the media shake the world public with scary news about growing racial hatred and the discrimination of the inhabitants by the black ruling majority.
According to the news agency AP, the responses to the new film in South Africa are currently entirely positive, despite numerous reservations about the occupation of the main roles with American Hollywoodstars.
Morgan Freeman is still proud of his own words on the new film.
I have dreamed of this role for many years and have prepared for it well.
Several times I also met Nelson Mandela personally, so that I can receive his energy - as they say - he performed in an interview after the festival premiere of the film in Los Angeles.
I think it's good if we can get this movie to the personality of Mandela and his message.
This is a story of South Africa, but it affects everyone, he added.
In the dress of the Rugby National Team
The film is based on the book presentation of British writer John Carlin, freely translated 'In the role of the enemy': Nelson Mandela and the game that the people have united, portrays the South African defender of human rights during its first presidential election period.
Morgan Freeman is endeavouring to bring together two racial groups and since year and day together, and as Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also plays in his role in the South African National Rugbydress on the world cupfield that South Africa won at that time.
Mandela harvested large ovations, mostly from the white audience, for entering the dress, which is almost like a holy act in South Africa, fourteen years ago, and thus won the recognition of the white population.
The Rugby Championship may be doing it to bring people back together to a single people, the Rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" in the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in South Africa is improving, that will only show itself.
However, the white South Africans are skeptical, such as in a short interview for LN the Rugby fan, Christopher Dawson, who escaped from the country to Britain.
The championship begins on June 11, 2010.
In the Louny area, transformers burn for several 10 million crowns
The fire broke out in the morning at the Ceps company's transformer in the circuit system near the municipality of Vyskov in the Louny area.
According to the spokesman of the district fire department Usti nad Labem, Lukas Marvan, six units attacked the fire.
Originally, the firemen wanted the transformers to burn out, but later it changed the view and now the fire is wiped with a mixture of water - foam and special liquids.
The cause was a technical defect, a transformer internal curve.
No one was injured, Havarie did not endanger the security operation of the management system according to the company preacher, Pavla Mandatova.
The damage was estimated to be several 10 million crowns, and the damage will be more precise only after the fire.
The destroyed transformer must be replaced by a new one according to Mandatova.
For more than 10 years, Ceps has done nothing similar to that of society, mistakes of this kind are rare, complementary.
The power supply was not interrupted by the speaker of the company CEZ for North Bohemia, Sona Holingerova, and the fire of the Trafostation did not affect the functioning of households, authorities and companies.
A.G. Ceps operates in the Czech territory as the sole operator of the control system, the electric lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renovates and develops 39 switching systems with 67 transformers, with which the electrical energy is transferred into distribution system and line line with a length of 4339 kilometres.
Jancura crimes against three heads of the CSSD.
The owner of the Student Agency, Radim Jancura, is today committing criminal charges for seduction against three socially-democratic leaders.
Against Michal Hasek from the district of Southern Morocco, Radko Martinek from the district of Pardubice and the head of the district of Olomouc, Martin Tesarik.
Jancura said this in a twenty-minute inteview in the radio journal.
The action relates to the firm's efforts to operate regional train traffic in some districts.
In the end, however, all regions have signed the long-term contracts with the Czech railways.
All three ladders attack us and say that we take out the rosin, while we have only presented the offer over the extent of the match with them.
They claim that we are expensive than the Czech railways because we would know the prices of the Czech railways that were concluded last week.
There's nothing left but to fight us.
Because of this humiliation of the company Student Agency, Jancura said to the radio journal.
At the same time, he argued that he had evidence from all districts that they have taken their steps in accordance with European law.
That is why we are preparing a complaint for the European Commission.
Hasek believes that the collection of the criminal record is a continuation of the Jancura media show, which serves him as a free advertising for his society and for his own person.
Of course, I am willing to defend my good name and the good reputation of my district, and I also call on further leaders to do so.
I assume that even in this matter it will become clear that Jancura is the one that manipulates the public in the case of regional rail transport and uses lying and untrue arguments, said Hasek.
Jancura reported last week that he had invested several million crowns in advertising, which will point to the detrimental step of the districts.
He told the radio journal that he wanted to interrupt the campaign after Christmas, and that he wanted to continue it after New Year.
He clarified that he will lead the campaign against corruption as such.
The campaign started Jancura after the districts agreed on the operation of regional rail transport with the Czech railways and had not issued any tenders for the order at a height of 150 billion kroner.
According to Vancura, such behaviour is illegal and contrary to the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
According to Jancura, he was already threatened by a member of the CSSD because of the criticism of train traffic in the districts.
The only threat was if we do not abandon the possibility of losing bus licences.
He introduced himself as a member of the CSSD, I know who it is, I do not say his name, said Jancura today to the radio journal.
Vaccination against pneumococcus free and voluntary
Immaculation against pneumococcus changes the population from January.
It should be the first to be free and voluntary for the families.
But now, voices report that duty vaccination would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococcus culminate.
The pharmaceutical institute has already established the maximum prices of vaccines to be paid to health insurance.
Experts are also aware of the vaccination process.
New vaccination
Vaccines free for August children
From January, children can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococcus born on August 2, last year and later.
The condition is that they have not yet received a vaccine dose.
Anyone who has already started the vaccination last year or earlier must also pay far more repetition vaccination itself.
The first dose of the vaccine must be given between the third and fifth month of life of the child.
Last year, a quarter of the families had their children vaccinated against pneumococcus.
The parents paid 1600 kroner and more for one dose.
Four doses are required for the vaccination of the younger children.
As a whole, the experts estimate that health insurance is spending 300,000 to 450,000 kroner per year for the vaccine doses.
However, they save during the treatment that children would need without vaccination.
So far, the State has spent about 500,000 per year on all the children's land vaccinations.
The duty vaccination was introduced with the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococcus causes central ear inflammation, but also severe infections including brain inflammation and blood poisoning.
Pneumococcal infections have caused us to die in hospitals per year up to 28 children aged up to 10 years.
Outside the Czech Republic, the compulsory vaccination of children against pneumococci was introduced in about 40 countries.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
At the same time, it is said that this vaccination could be mandatory in the future.
From January onwards, it will be paid and voluntarily paid by the insurance companies.
For example, the Head of the Nahlas Civil Society, Rudolf Kalovsky, mentioned that duty vaccination would be better.
His association has been throwing for the pneumococcal vaccination in the long term.
The experts at the international conference in which our association was involved were not very satisfied with the fact that we have voluntary vaccination.
That's not exactly ideal.
On the other hand, we are pleased that we have succeeded at least in enforcing this.
I believe that this is the way we have to go now, Kalovsky led.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococcus.
At this moment we are not considering this at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil sessions.
Voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, the doctors say.
The chairman of the company of practical children's doctors, Hana Cabrnochova, admits that voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages.
If all children were vaccinated, then one could think about reducing the number of repetition vaccinations "In a situation where the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccination has been started as a volunteer," says Cabrnochova.
Experts expect more than 80 percent of parents to have their infants vaccinated against pneumococcus from next year.
Vaccination against pneumococci is also groundbreaking that it is the first area vaccination paid by the health insurance companies and not by the State.
Insurances should spend the money on prevention, so they save for further treatment, captures Cabrnochova.
The doctors have to buy the vaccines themselves.
However, this involves the concern of the practical children's doctors concerning the purchase of the vaccines.
According to the original plan, the vaccines should be purchased by the insurance companies and then the doctors receive them on the same path as other vaccines issued by the State to them.
However, some Members feared that insurance could "carry out the money from health insurance."
Therefore, the doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves and wait until the insurance companies pay them.
According to the estimates, the individual practical doctors will have to invest 40,000 kroner per month, which is a significant sum.
This is not going to be easy, says Cabrnochova.
US Artist Son involved in "Museumsthief"
The son of the famous American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta was accused of trying to steal paintings worth $20 million from his father's museum.
According to the police of Pennsylvania, Alfonso Frank Frazetta was taken into his vehicle with trailers at the invitation of 90 paintings.
They say Frank Frazetta junior and another man would have used a baker to penetrate the museum into the Pocono mountains.
The 81-year-old Frank Frazetta Senior is famous for his presentation of designs such as Conan the Barbar and Tarzan.
As the news agency Associated Press reported, the artist stayed at the time of the incident in Florida.
AP quoted an unmentioned police officer who said that Frank Frazetta Junior could have been motivated by a family order.
According to a police statement, Frazetta Jr., the agency reported that his father ordered him to "enter the museum with all the means to bring all the paintings into a camp."
The agency informed Frank Frazetta Senior that he had granted some permission.
Labour defends real and tax increases
Ministers have defended the tax increases and expenditure ceilings announced in the preliminary report against the criticism of opposition, economy and trade unions.
The Conservatives said that Alistair Darling had left an opportunity to "waive" to show that he meant it seriously with the reduction of the deficit by postponing the decisions until after the election.
The Treasury Chancellor was also in charge of targeting low and medium-income workers.
Its main proposals include a 0.5% increase in social security and a 1% cut-off limit of public wages for 2011.
Social security problems
The trade unions, on the other hand, have protested that low-wage recipients will be punished for a recession that they did not cause and warned against the forthcoming "problems."
The increase in social security - to about 3 billion British pounds per year - has aggravated the private sector saying that this is a tax on jobs, although the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase limited to those earning more than £20,000 per year will affect about 10 million workers.
BACKGROUND OF THE PREVIOUS REPORT
Increase of social security by 0.5% from April 2011
This year the economy shrinking by more than the expected 4.75%
New 50% tax on bank bonuses
1 percent increase in corporation tax for small companies rejected
Tax discounts for electric vehicles and wind turbines
Increase of government pensions by 2.5%
According to estimates from the Treasury, someone with an annual income of £30.000 will be poorer by £90 per year and someone with £40,000 per year will be poorer by £190 while a person with £10,000 will be more rich by £110.
Ministers said that their objective of deficit elimination by 2013 meant "difficult decisions," but they also said that 60% of the additional taxes would be charged to the 5% of top earners.
Minister of Finance Stephen Timms argued that the estimated tax increases and expenditure stops compared to the necessary measures would be "a drop on the hot stone."
"These are large numbers. They will bring us the deficit elimination and this is also essential over the period of the next four years" he informed the BBC.
Timms said he was confident that the economy would return to growth by the end of the year.
The Labour Party's forecasts of future economic growth - which affect the extent of new debt and the speed of deficit reduction - were questioned after the treasurer was forced to revise earlier figures.
He said in his opinion that the economy is likely to shrink by 4.75% this year - much more than the fall by 3.5% predicted in April - while debt would be higher by £3 billion than expected in the past.
"Adjusted opportunity"
The Conservatives, who want to launch a new campaign on Thursday to warn against the "debt crisis" of Labour, said that the planned debt of £789 billion over the next six years is unsustainable.
They added that Ministers have failed to present a credible plan on how to repay this and "cynically" before difficult decisions until after the election - which must take place by June 2010 at the latest.
"They didn't say anything important about what they were going to do," said the Shadow Finance Minister Philip Hammond. "They had their opportunity to do this and they let them pass."
"The important announcements are made only after the election, whoever wins them."
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and the police will be kept from future reductions, unlike in the Conservatives' proposals, which see the deficit reduction coming faster and more quickly.
But the Liberal Democrats said that the money gained by the tax increases and expenditure stops is used to cover expenditure for the next year, not to reduce the deficit, and therefore argue that the plans are "built on sand."
The political editor of the BBC, Nick Robinson, said that at the time of the announcements - such as the above inflation adjustment for some invalidity pensions next April - the treasure cancellor would suspend the accusation of voting, as the money could simply be recovered next year.
Labour insists on providing extra aid if people need it most and that the situation will be reconsidered in September 2010.
"Hohler Etat"
Although the ministers have not announced any real details beyond 2011, economists say that the pressure on public spending will only come to bear in the medium term.
The recognised Institute for Tax Investigations said that the figures of the treasurer would mean strong cuts in many areas, possibly in the future in the areas of transport, higher education, science and defence.
"It only moves the pain to later," said his director Robert Chote.
"The important announcements are made only after the election, whoever wins them," added Roger Bootle, economic advisor to the economic audit company Deloitte.
"This was only the holy pre-factual report. The markets recognise this."
FBI investigates "arrests of US citizens in Pakistan"
The FBI is investigating the arrest of five reported US citizens for suspicion of extreme connections in Pakistan.
The men were arrested during a robbery on a house in Sarghoda, in the eastern Pandschab province, the American Embassy in Pakistan informed the BBC.
The FBI said it's being investigated whether these are the same men who were reported missing last month in the U.S. state of Virginia.
The U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs said they were also looking for information about the men.
Three of them are supposed to be Pakistani descendants, one is Egyptian origin and the other has a jemenian background.
"If they are American citizens, of course, we are very interested in the charges they are accused of and under what circumstances they are held," said spokesman Ian Kelly.
The FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the authority was informed of the arrests and was associated with the families of the missing students.
"We work with the Pakistani authorities to find out their identities and the purpose of their stay there, if they are actually the missing students," she said.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washington informed that the men were arrested in a house belonging to the uncle of one of the students.
He said that the local police have been interested in the house before and that no charges have been filed against the arrested men.
The news agency Reuters reported that it refused Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton to comment on the arrests, but she said that the US must "cooperate more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan to eradicate the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people."
The five students were reported missing by your families in North Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty condemns "abuse" in Iran
According to a report by the Human Rights Organisation Amnesty International, human rights in Iran are still as bad as in the past 20 years.
The report details "abuse patterns" by the regime, both before and after the contested presidential elections in June.
One man quoted in the report said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes, another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran rejected previous criticism of its human rights balance.
Officials said that such criticism was politically motivated.
After the contested election of President Mahmud Ahmadinedschad, thousands of people were arrested in Iran and dozens were killed, leading to the biggest road protests since the Islamic revolution in 1979.
Dozens of prisoners were sentenced to death and accused persons said that at least five people were sentenced to death.
The BBC-Tehran correspondent Jon Leyne, who is now in London, said that at the beginning of the protests the highest leaders, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, recognised some of the abuse allegations and ordered the closure of the Kahrizak Criminal Institute.
But since then there has been no tolerance from the authorities for criticism, said our correspondent.
"False confession"
Amnesty International quoted the report by 26-year-old computer students Ebrahim Mehtari, who said that he was accused of "working with Facebook networks" and protesting the election results.
"They beat me in the face more often," he was quoted.
"I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, in my neck, on my head... they threatened me with death and they humiliated me."
After five days he signed a false confession and was, still bloody and half unconscious, released on the street, Amnesty informed.
The President-in-Office candidate Mehdi Karroubi said that some demonstrators who had been arrested after the election were tortured to death in August and raped others.
The Iranian authorities denied the allegations of rape, but they admitted that abuses have taken place.
Amnesty also mentioned the case of a former prisoner who said that he had been arrested with 75 others more than eight weeks in a container in a prison facility in Kahrizak.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian Parliament and the judicial authorities had set up a committee to investigate the disturbances following the election and the reactions of the government, but so Amnesty, the mandates and the power of these institutions would be unclear and the results obtained by the parliamentary committees would not have been published.
The group said that in the last three weeks at least 90 people have been arrested to prevent further demonstrations.
Skihang was set up in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to transform a landmark in Bristol into a competition piste.
The ski piste of this parking event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who fought for money prices.
At the top of the hanging in the Brandon Hill Park there was a short jump at the beginning of a 100 meter long hanging.
The student John Hickman, who studied medicine in the fourth year, said there was a beautiful view from the top of the hangar, but it was also quite intimidating.
It's a great look with all the lights of the city that shine below.
He added: "There are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country here - some real talents."
Prices were awarded for the best artpieces or tricks exported on the hook.
After the event on Thursday night, the snow is left to melt.
Still she and we
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
In a time when Swiss voters voted in favour of a ban on minarette construction and the concern about the alleged Islamisation of Europe is widespread, John Bowen, an American academic, wrote a well-considered report on whether Muslims can be integrated and integrated into one of Europe's most secularized societies.
Some readers will read this new book of admiration for the author's last work: "Why the French don't love copper towels" (original title: "Why the French Don't Like Headscarves") (2006), an elegant and denigrating study of a dispute that the country shared and employed over anderthalb decades and whose effects still have to be perceived today.
Bowen's latest book offers a broader and cooler spectrum.
As a good anthropologist, he wants not only to know what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what really happens in the area.
He spent months in mosques, schools and institutions that now offer the 5 to 6 million Muslims in France, as it calls Bowen "Islamic spaces."
He is a good listener, he presents debates between teachers and students about the questions they are most concerned about.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or a town hall (or both)?
Should young Muslims be taught about evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it possible for a Muslim to use a interest-oriented banking system to get a mortgage?
It is these apparently profane affairs, he claims to be the everyday life, in contrast to the political tragedies that the media are dealing with.
The author recognizes a new generation of Imamen, Teachers and Intellectuals, none of them with a known name, possibly with the exception of Tarik Ramadan, a born Arab-Muslim scholar and academic in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how it is possible to be a good Muslim and, on the other hand, a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They don't have all the arguments on their side.
The Conservatives are suspicious of the idea of a French or European Islamic.
The thinkers and activists that Bowen questioned are mostly united with their Salafi objects - supporters of the purist sunnitic Islamic associated with Saudi Arabia - which today show a small but influential presence among Europe's Muslims.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But an agreement requires giving and taking on both sides.
He questioned the extent to which French political decision-makers (and the intellectual elite so passionately guarding the separation of church and state) really feel obliged to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims may experience more rough treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews who, on their side, had to make their historical compromise with secular Republican.
He is more aware of a "tightening up of value screws" than an increasing pragmatism.
Can Islam be French? After reading this book you are inclined to say "Yes, but not yet."
The most uncomforted view of the world
The Arctic changes faster and more dramatically than any other environmental region on Earth.
The ice that identifies it melts with alarming speed and takes life with it that can't survive anywhere else.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing interests have gone into the newly open water, with diplomats, lawyers and now also authors in their peeling water.
Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, signs in "On thin ice" (original title: "On Thin Ice") a natural history of the icons of the north, the ice bear.
In the complex history and policy of whaling, he describes the long tradition of the Arctic researchers who have proved themselves in hunting the ice bears.
Admiral Nelson's encounter with an ice bear as a brave 14-year-old enemy to the lake, who fought only with the rifle of his muscles, is certainly a legend, but others are true.
Young bears caught when they swim behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers were brought into zoo and circus.
A circus performance at the beginning of the 20th century showed 75 ice bears in an idea.
Even today zoo plants still typically possess a million of the livelihood of a wild living old animal. The climate is rarely suitable: the iceberry in Singapore became completely green by the algae that grow in the hollow hair of its fur.

Ellis refers to the reports of other authors and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters represent for the survival of the species.
Although forbidden in Norway, America and Russia, killing continues in Greenland and Canada where hunters in helicopters and motor sliding inuit use powerful storm guns to bring their prey to the track.
Ironically, the ice will remain the longest in the waters in the north of these two hunting nations.
In his new book "After the Ice," Alun Anderson, a former editor of the science magazine "New Scientist," offers a clear and worrying description of the science of the Arctic and a packing insight into how the future could evolve.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographer can declare the speed of change adequately.
This is not due to a lack of explanatory attempts.
The pioneering trips of Fridtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century had for the first time conceived the confusing of the package.
In the cold war, submarine boats conceived the shifting grades during the undergoing.
A useful supplement is satellite measurements and the large-scale application of measuring songs on icebergs, but still much is achieved by unshocked people camping outside in the cold.
Anderson looks into the strange, tiny world of the inflow system within the Arctic ice, formed by salt water rinnsale, which are put together during the freezing.
But, starting from the bear on the ice to the microscopic little miracles in the ice, all of them are threatened when the summer rice passes, which is expected between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months... that could be us."
Navy prisoners were among the 6,000 who settled cranes in Arlington.
The top-freed De'Angello Robinson traveled seven hours by bus to put a single crane on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other marines who took the trip from Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the National cemetery in Arlington to decorate graves, the day was a tribute to the men and women in whose footsteps they took.
In a few months, wherever we are brought back from, we could be, said Robinson about the fallen soldiers.
If we were, I wish someone would do the same for me, so I'm trying to show my respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who had gathered on Saturday morning to lay cranes on the graves of veterans in several sections of the Arlington cemetery.
Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, founded this tradition in 1992 when he and some others decided to decorate several hundred graves at the cemetery in Arlington.
It is now an 18-year-old tradition, and Morrill and his wife Karen, who make this trip every year, are stopping in different cities along the way to perform events dedicated to the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America, which also extended the event to other states.
This year, volunteers put more than 16,000 cranes on the graves at the Arlington cemetery, in areas at the Pentagon, on the graves of the Fayetteville National Friedhof in Arkansas, in the Battery Park in New York and at the United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
The Walmart Foundation donated more than 150,000 dollars for the purchase and transport of the cranes for the second time.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster said she did the trip to Arlington in memory of her husband, a deceased professional soldier.
Although her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said, this is her way to return something to those who sacrificed.
She said this is a small contribution to how we civilians can support our soldiers.
It's like visiting a family grave.
The volunteers walked across the extensive lawn areas and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers had older graves from the 1st and 2nd World War and Vietnam War as a goal, as they are not visited as often as the newer graves, as the organizers.
The mood was cheerful, children played and couples held by the hand while they carried the fresh pine branches to the gray tombstones.
Each round crane was dark green with a small red loop attached to the upper part.
The section 60, which is nearby and where mainly veterans of the wars are buried in Iraq and Afghanistan, remained almost calm.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 cranes to decorate this section, but the darker mood of the current wars fulfilled this area.
Individuals cried openly, others prayed and families and friends held together in the eisive air.
Some read the names measured in stone, while others were bending down to small black-white square cards that had been stuck for those in the wet mud whose tombstones were not yet finished.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who cast bitter tears in front of the grave of her son.
She drove 8 hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the tomb of Marine Frantry sub-officer David Shane Spicer, who fell in battle in July.
No one should ever forget why we're free, my son paid for it, she said.
"If I haven't been in a long time, I want someone to remember him."
Contractors of the US Government arrested by Cuban authorities
The Cuban government arrested a contractor of the US government who sold mobile phones and notebook computers in the country, said representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Saturday.
The contractor who has not yet been identified works for Development Alternatives Inc. based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for customers such as USAID, the US International Development Authority and the World Bank.
Consular officials of the US Interest Representative in Havanna are trying to gain access to the prisoner arrested on December 5.
The specific charges have not yet been published, although Cuban law allows a Cuban citizen or foreign visitor to be arrested for almost everything under the accusation of "danger."
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including light protests and critical writings, pose a risk of arrest.
Government hostile graffiti and statements are considered to be a serious crime.
Cuba has a growing blogger community, led by the popular reporter Yoani Sánchez, who often describes how she and her husband are persecuted and attacked by government representatives.
Sánchez has repeatedly requested permission to leave the country to receive prices, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of an American contractor is likely to increase the tensions between the Communist Government of the Castro brother in Cuba and the Obama Government, which had sought a "slow" approach to improving relations with the island.
The news of the arrest was first reported by the New York Times on Friday night.
The new US policy points to the fact that the United States will provide a counterpart when the Cuban Government takes concrete steps in this direction, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more space for opposition.
Mobile phones and notebooks are legal in Cuba, although they are new and desired products in a country where the average earnings of a government employee are $15 per month.
The Cuban government has only allowed ordinary citizens to purchase a mobile phone since this year, they are used for sending text messages, as a 15-minute telephone call would cost a daily salary.
Internet use is extremely limited on the island.
It is accessible in expensive hotels and there for foreign visitors and at some government agencies, such as universities.
Cubans who want to log in often have to report their names to the government.
Access is restricted to many websites.
In Cuba, the arrest of an American is rare.
Most of the few US citizens who are in prison in Cuba sit behind bars for crimes such as drug smuggling, said Gloria Berbena, the press preacher of the US interest representative in Havana.
Berbena said she couldn't give any more information about arrest.
The arrest and the detention are clearly wrong.
An activity that would be legal in any other free society - the delivery of free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, head of the American section of the Human Rights Watch group, who recently issued a tough report on freedom in Cuba entitled "New Castro, the same Cuba," a response to the establishment of Raul Castro as the leader of the country that replaced the sick older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that the accused were very often arrested, convicted and imprisoned within a day.
He said that every solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just when both countries move towards more dialogue.
Pakistani government representatives discover plan to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, Pakistani authorities discovered a allegedly leading head of a conspiracy aimed at sending five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill US soldiers, and said that they hoped that this case could help detect a widespread network of terrorist advertisers looking for the Internet for radicalised young men.
Investigators said that they had been looking for an untransparent rebel known as Saifullah, who had invited the men to Pakistan after he had invented them because one of them had endorsed YouTube on the Internet video page comments on terrorist attacks.
After their arrival in Pakistan, Saifullah became the leaders of these men and tried to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan's tribal belt, which is the home of Al Kaida and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of Pakistan's intelligence service who was informed about the matter said on Saturday, Saifullah couldn't convince the Al-Kaida leaders that the men are not part of a CIA conspiracy to undermigrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were held for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the ineconomical mountains in the north-west, which have become a terrorist refuge.
They were considered part of a hidden operation.
That is why they were rejected, said the government officer who wanted to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the matter.
The government official said that the men were in no way discouraged and continued to try to receive the right recommendations to obtain access to the Al-Kaida camps when they were arrested by the Pakistani Criminal Enforcement Authorities.
The case of the five men - who are still in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI - underlines the decisive role of recruiters in identifying future terrorists and perhaps even more important in deciding who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, it has made the US Secret Service a matter of urgency to place human assets within Al Kaida.
The recruiters of the organization act as guardians who do not let in those whose commitment to the Holy War is not serious enough and those who might be spies.
American Woman recruits are subjected to a special examination by A Kaida, said analysts.
However, due to their potential access to US targets and their propaganda value, they are also considered extremely attractive for the group.
Evan Kohlmann, the senior analyst of the NEFA Foundation based in the United States, said that terrorist groups have become much more careful over recent years as to who they allow access, because the US Secret Services have become experts of their recruitment methods.
If you try to lock someone in these groups, what better way could you go than to follow the recruitment model that so many have already followed?, said Kohlmann.
The model is now based on much more on the Internet.
Ten thousand demonstrators call for climate action in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched through the streets on Saturday and asked the negotiators at the Bella Congress Centre of the city to act in climate protection.
Demonstrators said that 100,000 people had joined the event, whereas the police ratings were rather about 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists lit small explosives near some government buildings in the city center.
On a day when the climate negotiations supported by the UN did not happen much, thousands of activists wandered through the city with transparency, on which "There was no planet B" and one in Spanish, saying "The Earth says" enough. "
Some stars joined the protest, for example the Danish model, photographer Helena Christensen, who said that the travels to Peru, the home country of her mother, make her aware of the heartbreaking problems that the country has to face due to the already noticeable effects of climate change.
That is part of the motives why I decided to participate in the great demonstration - in order to continue the word and appeal to the world leaders to create a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it has to be done now and there is no way to get around it.
The police prevented the demonstrators from getting too close to the Bella center and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly because they were either masked or carried pocket knives.
According to Danish law, these actions are prohibited in the event of demonstrations.
According to an audience who did not want to be mentioned, since he was involved in the climate negotiations, masked demonstrators in black clothing set up several explosives near the Copenhagen main channel, where several ministries are nearby.
They threw them near the buildings, he said and added that they started as lightning missiles, but then were followed by "a few major explosions."
In the inside of the Congress Centre, people gathered in front of television screens to follow the demonstration all afternoon.
But the protest has apparently not reached the consciousness of the main functionaries, such as Su Wie, China's chief climate negotiators.
When he was asked whether he thought that the demonstration would have a constructive effect on international considerations, he said in English: "This is something I was not aware of."
Then he went to Mandarin and said, "Because the place of the event is big, I can't hear what happens outside."
He noted that it depends on the individual's perspective whether the demonstration would harm or help.
It shows the focus of the general public and of various sectors on climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "one can also say that they disturb the negotiations or the freedom of other people."
Test data show persistent breeding air
The testimony of mathematics was welcome last week for the public schools in Washington D. C.
Although the Washington District is still far behind the schools of the country that produce maximum benefits, the testimonies show that the fourth and eighth classes have made faster progress in the past two years than cities that include Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
However, what is included in the latest figures of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is the persistent performance gap between African American and white pupils, both at local and national level.
In the last two years, the average number of white quadrilators from Washington D. C. rose from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but only three points from 209 to 212.
The performance gap actually increased from 53 to 58 points between 2007 and 2009.
The progress of the African American eight-classers remained essentially the same, falling around a statistically negligible point from 245 to 244.
The average number of white pupils was not included in the test data as the sample size was not large enough.
The picture over a six-year period is also not more encouraging.
The gap, which separated white and black four-class in 2003, when the first NAEP was recorded in this district, was 60 scales (262 to 202).
And even though the number of points that children have reached both groups has grown in this period, the difference has hardly decreased with now 58 points.
Some educators from the district expressed their concern last week that the results of the school Chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and the democratic mayor Adrian M. Fenty have been promoted most of white pupils who are already powerful children.
This suggests that we have increased the overall appreciation by treating those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and difficult, said Jeff Smith, board member of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that supports education equality in Washington D.C..
I do not jump up for a margin of two or three points and down, said the democratic Washington City Council member, Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in the fourth grade of Eaton primary school.
Brown, a frequent critic of the management style of Rhee, said the message of the test points is that the city's middle schools need urgent attention.
Of course, you always want to see the positive signs, I respect that.
But what scares me is that we do not spend nearly the time and energy that we would have to use for our middle school.
Rhee said that the district must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of the weak pupils.
This autumn, for example, some teachers are trained to use a new lesson plan, the Wilson reading system, which aims at pupils in the upper classes of primary school and middle school, which basic skills of reading have not mastered at the beginning of their school training and which are significantly behind their equal class comrades.
Daily mathematics, a curriculum that takes the forefront from the kindergarten to the sixth class of games and lifelong experience, was brought to Washington under the former leading school inspector Clifford Janey and this curriculum is attributed to some of the NAEP progress reported last week.
I believe that we must continue to work to make the best measures available to the pupils who are below the emergency level, said Rhee.
Others say that the NAEP results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to improve the overall performance of the system while continuing to provide additional money and resources for the poor schools that are necessary to reduce the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, Professor of Education at the University of California in Berkeley, investigating urban test results.
The conventional cure is to focus its resources and management reforms on schools located in the poorest areas of Washington D.C..
The objective could give rise to political repercussions which are working against this important item of agenda.
The weakness is, of course, as with other city school inspectors, that it tries to keep the white and black middle layer.
Our focus is to ensure that we create a system of great schools.
We need to strengthen our schools in the urban areas so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be sure that their children can receive excellent public education.
Janey, who is now a school inspector in Newark, said this week in an interview that one of the most important elements for closing the performance gap is to extend the traditional public school year, which is currently 180 days in Washington, to compete with charter schools.
One has to increase the school year to almost 200 days to have the power to change, Janey, who came to an agreement with his teachers' union last year about 185 days a year, which he considers to be "a milestone" on the way to a greater increase in the next contract.
Higher education for more people than future prospects
The travel bus reaches Gettysburg College with a loud pipe.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, rises out and blinks a moment at the sight of the white columns, the brick facades and the smaragdgreen lawn.
Graciela's parents barely finished high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela, who was buried in Silver Spring and now lives in Riverdale, had never set a foot on a college campus.
Their attitude and that of the other eight classmen of the group, who explore Gettysburg, where the class costs $38.690 per year, was rather the one of an honourable visitor than the one of an enthusiastic future students.
"Yes! Here I will be soon!" said Graciela, who would like to study medicine when the leader announced that they had now entered the building for science.
"Wow, really?" said she thoughtfully when she was reported the low professor-to-student relationship of the school.
College in Pennsylvania was the seventh that the children visited on their three-day tour and now they have fully taken the intended message: The question is not whether you go to college.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there is growing concern about the large number of children born in the US of Hispanic immigrants who do not end high school or become pregnant as teenagers, but on the other hand, there are hundreds of thousands who receive college training necessary to get into the middle class.
In fact, one of five of the "second generation" of Hispanic Americans closes the college - which is a remarkable achievement since many of their immigrant parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, came to the United States without having completed high school.
Their success stories are important, say researchers, because they show the way forward for a generation that will play a huge role in the labour force of the country.
Those who investigate powerful children say that they often have a natural affinity for school and a propulsion to succeed.
Many of them also have parents who set high targets and find ways to compensate their lack of confidence in American schools.
But consultancy programmes also play a major role by helping Graciela and millions of children like them to go to college, especially if these efforts continue for a longer time.
If you look at low-income children whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them find their way through the system, a single measure will not solve the problem either at any point, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California in Davis, who studied HispanoAmerican students.
We need to think about providing a supportive network for these children from pre-school to high school.
The federal program that Graciela's college tour had funded is a useful example.
It is known as GEAR UP - a gang up - and provides more than $300 million a year for local school systems to start college preparatory programmes starting when income-weak students are in middle school and continue until they have completed high school.
According to the US Department of Education, the programme has helped more than 10 million students since 1999, of which more than 60% have gone to college.
Iraqi oil ministry concludes contracts with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi Government has been able to rebuild its damaged infrastructure in two auctions closed on Saturday.
The 10 contracts concluded with foreign oil companies by the Iraqi oil ministry suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are prepared to play an important role in the renovation of the Iraqi oil industry, which has been paralysed for decades by war and economic sanctions.
American companies could only book shares in two of the 10 auctioned fields for themselves.
Seven American companies had paid for participating in the second auction that started on Friday.
The only company that made a bid has drawn the shorter.
Two American companies were able to conclude contracts for auctioned fields in June.
The thinly seated representatives of American oil multis in opening the Iraqi oil industry surprised the analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its gates after 6 years of war and instead of US companies give the way to Asian and European, said Ruba Husari, the editor of Iraq Oil Forum, an online news service.
There will be no more offers in Iraq for a long time.
Security concerns, which have still been highlighted by massive coordinated bombardments on Tuesday and political instability by the withdrawal of the US military, have probably prevented American oil companies, as analysts said, to engage more in Iraq, which has the third most proven crude oil reserves in the world.
In some cases, US companies were disadvantaged because competitors, in particular the Chinese and other state-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower wage costs and rather take risks because they do not have to take responsibility for shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies that could conclude contracts with the Ministry.
Greater US companies such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, who have close relations with the Iraqi oil ministry and have been with technical advice in recent years, have gone empty.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main players in two of the contracts that were awarded this weekend.
The State China National Petroleum Corporation has offered more contracts than any other company and has been able to go home with large packages of contracts for two larger fields.
We all know, said the spokesman of the Ministry of Oil, Assam Jihad, that China is on the way to become one of the great world economy as well as a technology force.
We are convinced that the Chinese company will be able to measure with its partners and will fulfil its obligations towards Iraq.
For the bidding of pre-selected companies, bids were made which were then compared with the fee per barrel oil that the Ministry was willing to pay to increase the output of each field beyond the current level.
Top planner of Al Kaida apparently killed in Pakistan
In an apparent US missile attack along the Pakistani border to Afghanistan, a top operational plan of Al Kaida should have been killed this week, as reported by representatives of the US terrorist fight on Friday.
This would, if it were confirmed, be the second fatal attack on a high responsibility of the terrorist organisation this autumn.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs who, according to US sources and Pakistani government representatives in the region, were killed by a number of missiles who met their vehicle on Tuesday near the city of Miran Shah in the province of North Waziristan.
Local authorities reported that the missiles were fired by a drone type used by the CIA in Pakistani's unlawless strain belt.
They drove in a white vehicle towards the Afghan border when the car was hit, said a government representative of a Pakistani civilian secret service from Miran Shah by phone.
Local residents suspected to be militants ran to the place and quickly took everything that was left of the "completely destroyed bodies."
The local authorities could not confirm the identity of the victims, but two representatives of the US fight against terrorism led to indefinite evidence that Somali belonged to the dead.
Somali was described as the leading military planner of Al Kaida, who led operations of terrorist groups outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was involved in conspiracies all over the world, noted a senior official who wanted to remain anonymous, and referred to the delicate nature of the American air attacks on Pakistani soil.
If you take your central role as given, this included the planning of attacks against the US and Europe.
He took strategic instructions from the top leaders of Al Kaida and put them into operation plans for possible terrorist attacks.
The second American government representative said that Somali had risen rapidly in the Al-Kaida hierarchy and had best links with other extremists in the region.
He may not be known to some Americans, said the second representative of the government, but this does not in any way reduce the danger he posed to us and our allies.
If his death was confirmed, Somali would be the second leading Al Kaida or Taliban leader who was killed since September when a similar attack took place in Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a military group in the tribe area and three other topactivists.
Since the summer, according to a summary of the Long War Journal, the rate of attacks by drones of the CIA has fallen from an average of six operations per month to two websites of a non-profit organisation.
The page reported that the decline can be based on improved tactics of the terrorist groups, which have taken steps to reduce their admissibility while at the same time killing suspected informants brutally.
Leading UN Messenger in Kabul will resign
On Friday, the UN's leading envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said that he would resign from his office in March, ending a stumbling term of term of office, which was affected by allegations of widespread corruption in the UN-supported Afghan presidential election.
Eides's departure takes place when the Obama government has decided to send another 30,000 US soldiers to Afghanistan.
The UN Embassy said that he supported the increase in the force, but also expressed his concern that the US timetable for military withdrawal, which is to begin in 18 months, could allow other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to speed up the construction of Afghan security forces and thus send the right signal to the Afghans that they can trust the international community, said Eide in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civil helpers to help in the political transition of Afghanistan.
He said that the military increase must correspond to an increase on the civilian side.
Eide said that he did not settle his office, but only fulfilled an agreement with his family in March 2008 to stay in Kabul for only two years.
He said he wanted the notification to UNO.
General Ban Ki-moon now pass on so that he has time to provide a replacement.
What I said was that he'd better start looking for a successor, said Eide.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to UN representatives, Ban has started looking for a replacement.
The UN representatives say that he has considered the Swedish-Italian-voting Staffan di Mistura, who recently led the UN mission in Baghdad and the French Jean-Marie Guéhenno, who has previously led UN peacekeeping operations.
Eiden's position in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September to prefer President Hamid Karzai in the presidential election in the country and to hide evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide has rejected all accusations, but he also said that the allegations of Galbraith - who was fired - "have undoubtedly damaged the mission because there was already a great degree of scepticism regarding international interference in the election."
Eide said that he recommended the appointment of a leading civilian representative to coordinate the assistance measures of the American armed forces in Afghanistan.
He also insisted that the UN leadership would allow its successor to recruit more staff from the United States and other Western countries donating for the Afghan mission, and said that this would strengthen their confidence in the proper use of their money.
Eide expressed his disappointment about the limitation of his forces in Afghanistan and said that the contentious UN recruitment arrangements have undermined his ability to bring in capable people.
The UN rules are so designed that I have been able to recruit only one person since May, he said.
This is catastrophic and must not go on like this.
US Defence Minister Gates: Iran must expect additional sanctions
Minister of Defence Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world forces will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because he has not participated in discussions on its nuclear plans.
During a 7-day journey through the war areas in Afghanistan and Iraq, Gates spoke to a group of about 300 US soldiers in Nordirac and reduced the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
In Iran there are no good choices, he said as an answer to the question of a soldier about the likelihood of such a development.
"One of the things that lie on my soul is, if we have learned something from Iraq over the last six years, which is the unpredictability of the war."
The Obama government is considering a penalty package aimed at the military and political elite of Iran, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could also affect the average Sirene.
He said that a "package of positive and negative incentives" is needed to convince the Iranian government that it is less protected with nuclear weapons in reality, because "their people will suffer enormous" sanctions.
On Friday, in an opinion by the speaker of the White House, Robert Gibbs, the American government joined the European leaders in warning that Iran must expect "credible" consequences if it fails to comply with its nuclear programme with the demands of the UN Security Council and its nuclear monitoring organisation, the International Atomic Energy Authority.
Iran continues to claim that the knowledge of nuclear technology should only be gained for peaceful purposes.
During talks in Geneva on 1 October, Iran said that it would resume talks to restrict its nuclear programme and would abandon a substantial part of its stock of enriched uranium in exchange for urgently needed nuclear fuel for its medical research reactor.
The US government has pushed for this kind of agreement to build trust between the two parties and gain time for negotiations.
However, Iran seems to have left the negotiations on the provisional agreements since then -- in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership differs whether they should commit themselves to the United States.
The fact that Iran has simply abandoned the international community with regard to some of the proposals that it had already agreed to in early October, has, frankly, brought together the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, in a way that they were never associated with important additional sanctions for Iran, said Gates.
President Obama set 31 December as a deadline for Iran to respond to these proposals before he will continue to pursue other options, including those called "repressive sanctions" by Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton.
In an opinion delivered in New York, the Iranian Representation to the United Nations condemned what they called on Thursday "unfounded and unfounded claims" of some Security Council members on Iran's nuclear activities and said that they are ready to continue talks with the United States and five other world forces to "achieve an appropriate long-term solution."
Gates, who was supposed to return to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in the morning before fleeing to the oil-rich Kurdish region in Iraq to meet the soldiers in Kirkuk and with Kurdish government representatives in Irbil.
The tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq remain high, particularly in terms of borders, ownership rights and the distribution of public revenue.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential of conflict in order to prevent delays in the US plans to reduce the American force strength by the end of August from 115,000 to 50,000.
Gates also tried to disseminate the Kurdish concern about the forthcoming troop withdrawal. US representatives quoted Gates, who said to Masud Barzani, President of the Kurdish Regional Government, "We will receive your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a united Iraq.
We won't leave you. "
A change of course in the ageing China
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda aplacats that kept them lectures that "Mother Earth is too tired to entertain more children" and "A baby means another grave."
These lessons have been learned so well that, as government officials in Shanghai, who suddenly began to change the course this summer because of the low birth rate and the ageing population and encouraged young couples to have more than one child, their answer was immediately and definitively: "No way."
We have already invested all our time and energy in a child.
There is nothing left for a second child, said Wang, 31, a staff director with an eight-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, which has produced two generations of notoriously thick, relieved single children, called loving "small emperors," a population crisis in the country.
The average birth rate fell to 1.8 children per couple compared to 6 at the time this policy came into force.
Population sector is determined, while the number of populations from 60 years and older in 2020 is to increase from 16.7 percent of the population by 2050 to 31.1 percent explosively. This is far above the global average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is stronger in rich coastal towns with educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-olds and older people accounted for almost 22 percent of the reported inhabitants of Shanghais, while birth rates were below one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, head of the Shanghai City Population and Family Planning Commission, has said that couples have to have babies in the productive age to "help to reduce the ratio of older population shares and reduce the labour shortage of the future."
Shanghai will soon be "as old - but not as rich - as the industrialized countries, like Japan and Sweden," she said.
A gradual relaxation
In the Constitution of the Land in 1978, China's One-Child Policy is probably the most controversial authority introduced by the ruling Communist Party so far.
Marriages who violate this policy must expect enormous fines - up to their three-yearly salary in some regions - and discrimination at their workplace.
Chinese representatives have attributed to this policy that the critical use of national natural resources could be avoided, against which human rights representatives have condemned abuses in the enforcement of politics.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women who have already had a child to take off.
Many couples also had sex-selective abortions, creating an unnaturally high ratio of men to women.
In recent years, government representatives for the population have gradually weakened their attitude to one-child policy.
In 2004, they have allowed more exceptions to the rule - including city residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and wife were single children - and in 2007 the tone of many hard slogans was painted.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research at the University of Beijing said that government representatives have recently even discussed more radical changes, for example, allowing couples to allow two children with a single child.
Shanghai was the first Chinese city to start an aggressive campaign to promote more births in July.
Placates taught families to have only one child were replaced almost by directives that describe in detail who is interested in a second child and how to apply for authorisation.
The city administration has sent urban employees and volunteers for family planning to visit couples at home and to push through information sheets under the doors.
She also asked to provide psychological and financial advice for those who have more than one child.
The reaction was not very encouraging, said family planning representatives.
Disappointing reaction
Although officials from a rural small town in the outside areas of Shanghai said that a recovery can be seen in the applications of couples who want a second child after the launch of the campaign, the urban districts do not report any change.
The municipality Huinan with a population of 115.000 still receives only four to five applications per month as an example.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that the expected number of births in the city in 2010 despite the campaign will still be around 165,000 -- slightly higher than 2009, but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee of the Shanghai municipality of Caolu, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people don't want to have children anymore.
She said she wanted to give her first one the best.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said that they would like to have two children and that is legally permitted.
But they own, how many Chinese, just a small government health and life insurance.
Without a social network, they say that this decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West are misjudging the one-child policy as a human rights issue, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is pregnant with her first child in the seventh month.
Yeah, they're robbing us the opportunity to have more than one child.
However, the problem is not simply political.
The problem is money.
Other couples indicate psychological reasons for her hesitation.
Wang, the director of the staff, said that she only wanted a child because she was also a single child. "We were the center of the family and used to be everyone caring for us.
We are not used to taking care of others and do not really want to do so. "
Chen Zijian, a 42-year-old who belongs to a translation company, said it more unflooded.
For middle-aged parents with a double career, through which the birth rate decreases, he said that it is about being successful and that one must be selfish.
The age group of today's 20- to 39-year-olds grew up with watching their parents fight during the early days of the Chinese capitalist experiment and they do not want such a life for themselves, he said.
Also a single child, he said, puts huge demands on the time of parents.
A mother must give up her social life for at least two years.
Then there is the space question -- "You have to rebuild your apartment" -- and the life planning -- "When the child is 9 months old, you have to have a CV ready for the best preschool."
Most of his friends are ready to go through this once, said Chen, but not twice.
Our generation is the first to achieve a higher standard of living, he said.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
UN Group draws up emission reduction plan
The climate conference sponsored by the UN - which has so far been characterised by wild posts and mutual accusations - has again set a focus on Friday with the publication of a document, which will record an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gases for the next 40 years, with industrialised nations being obliged to shoulder the greatest burden in the near future.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement on greenhouse gases, has highlighted both the remaining obstacles and the way forward.
But it was considered to be important progress in a negotiating process which is due to expire as next week more than 100 top politicians from all over the world will arrive in Copenhagen.
The text, drafted by a UN working group specifically for this, is silent from the amount of money that rich countries should give to the poor countries so that they can manage global warming in the short and long term.
It also offers a range of key options, including how industrial and large emerging countries can limit their carbon emissions and how high the upper limit of the global temperature rise that policy makers would contribute to.
The process is given great flexibility, according to John Coequyt, the leading representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted the six-page document, has compiled a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the leading UN Climate Protection Representative, Yvo de Boer, called "the great whole."
It shows the basis for a possible agreement in which industrialised nations would jointly reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 per cent by 2020, compared with 1990 limit values, while larger developing countries would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 per cent over the same period.
Together, countries could reduce emissions by 50 to 95 per cent by 2050.
The European Community has also given the talks on Friday a tribute through its commitment to provide 3.6 billion US dollars per year over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to the effects of climate change - from masters of floods and droughts to avoid deforestation.
Friday still brought the same verbal fireworks that had determined the talks last week.
The US Climate Subordinate Todd Star has rejected formulations requiring binding reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for industrialised countries, compared to voluntary reductions for larger emerging countries, if they are not financed by industrialised countries.
This train announced that the Obama government is driving a harder line with China than representatives of the Bush government not even two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without the emergence of major emerging countries and taking measures, as star, who also complained that the text does not go far enough, to ensure that the reductions could also be confirmed by external members.
Stern gave his opinion an hour after the Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister He Yafei's statement, which said that the leading American climate negotiator was either lacking in "reason" or it was "highly irresponsible" of him that he said at the beginning of the week that the United States would not help China financially to master global warming.
By risking the future economic leadership of the large world forces, broken lines have arisen both within industrial nations and between industrial nations and emerging countries.
The current struggle also relates to the rescue of individual economies, as well as to the rescue of the planet, with China and the United States committing themselves for their corresponding commitments, while poorer countries claim that the two dozens of most influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take more courageous measures.
Ricardo Ulate, a Costa Rica delegate, said that it was not surprising that the great powers struggled to bear the costs of the greenhouse gas emissions, as even the countries concerned were going to act more aggressively in making the countries with very high greenhouse gas charges accountable for their actions.
This is clearly a game from which a new economic dominance will develop, according to Ulate, who also acts as a regional climate change consultant for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries that are most exposed to the effects of climate change indicated that they would continue to fight for a legally binding Treaty in Copenhagen, although the leading participants say that the talks will best lead to a political agreement.
The alliance of the small island states with 43 members presented a 24-page draft of the Treaty early on Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who runs the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the offensive of the small island states "exerts political pressure on the whole political process," partly because they are now united and demand action from emerging countries such as China and India.
The talks were given a new urgency when the delegates focused on the fact that most open questions still need to be resolved before the government leaders arrive to reach agreement.
High-level representatives, such as the Indian Minister for the Environment Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Deputy Minister, escaped their aircraft and rushed through the corridors of the Bella Centre to meet behind closed doors and press conferences, to cancel claims negotiated during the next week.
The purely magnitude of the meeting -- 13,000 people enter and out in the congress centre every day, guitar-acting activists organize night shows where they make fun of the countries that they think betray and sell themselves, and contract designs are passed by hand instead of by e-mail -- is already a challenge.
The intensity is just building up: almost all the important ministers are here now and from Wednesday, 60 government leaders will be in Copenhagen.
We come to the Oberliga, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice President for Global Policy of the Organisation Conservation International.
The heavy weights are coming.
United Kingdom's first 225 km / h faster train defines the Monday feeling new
Monday morning at 5: 13 a pipe will penetrate the darkness to announce a journey that represents a revolution in traffic in Britain.
The first high-speed donor train in the country will reach 225 km / h on its lightning trip from Ashfort, Kent, to London St. Pancras and lay 93 km in 38 minutes.
To Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, Dame Kelly Holmes will then be on board the first Javelin pendler service from London.
He hopes that the new UK service will eventually connect to an international rail network with faster, reliable trains and will connect the large urban areas of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
The neglected province could become living commuter towns, working time would be drastically reduced and the shift of aircraft and car to rail would reduce national carbon emissions and congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three major parties believe in this vision.
But the many billions of British pounds needed for the construction of a new national rail network could still slow down the inevitable planning battle and the fears of environmental damage on the British high-speed tracks.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company founded in January to submit a feasibility study to the government, according to the Times, Lord Adonis will submit the report on 30 December.
This gives him a detailed route map of the next planned stage of the high-speed rail network.
The new railway line to connect London to the West Midlands will pass by with a margin of five metres in urban areas and places where the effects on the environment are controversial.
In the free area, the plan will show the concept within a distance of 25 meters from the final route.
HS2 is also intended to create three options for a larger high-speed rail network leading north.
Lord Adonis will respond to this in spring.
The preferred option is an Y-shaped route with a single high-speed route to the West Midlands.
The route would divide in or near Birmingham and a branch would lead west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another to the north east to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"It seems to be the best-functioning option," said a railway insider.
After completion, the travel time between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first subroute, which would not be opened before 2025, would allow travellers to leave the London-Birmingham route in 49 minutes, compared to today, over an hour.
The drafts give trains the opportunity to drive at a speed of 400 km / h, which would make the British rail network the fastest Europe.
The first route was planned so that 400 meters long trains with a maximum capacity of 1,100 people can drive on it.
Up to 18 trains could be in operation per hour on the London-Birmingham route.
This would in turn mean that in London an end station would be needed where 20,000 travellers per hour could be made up.
Given the spatial constraints in the capital, it is expected that an existing railway station will be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network.
Train experts say that only St. Pancras International or Euston have this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether this plan should be pursued or not, but the long-term public advisory and planning measures mean that a final decision will be taken only after the parliamentary elections.
But even if it moves the wheels, the rail network must be built in sections.
The trains would have to switch first from the high-speed trains to existing rail trains in the north of Birmingham, which would keep the travel time between London and Scotland for over three hours.
This is considered to be a crucial point of knock-out to ensure a change from plane to rail, a guiding measure for the rail revolution.
Tax payers are charged for mortgage for 75,000 pounds orange of a conservative
Alan Duncan, the leading member of the Conservatives, has charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds per year for the cost of an orange he was building in his home in his constituency.
The prison spokesman of the party, degraded by David Cameron because he complained that underhouse members have to live "of skinny rations," has increased his mortgage by £75,000 to build an egg wood factory building at his two house in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge the taxpayer the additional interest income, a sum of hundreds of pounds per month.
The members of the subhouse approved the applications at that time and they were not questioned by Sir Thomas Legs, who carried out a review of the expenditure of the subhouse members. Last night Duncan said that the applications could have been "not even cleaner or more understandable."
Duncan, one of the richest members of the house, has a two-storey house in a village in his constituency Rutland and Melton.
Nearby houses have reached a purchase price of almost one million pounds (1.1 million euros).
The ground floor includes kitchen, living and dining room, but the Fees Office, a expenditure control office of the underhouse, has agreed that Duncan needs more space.
Last year he built a winter garden called "orange" in the plans.
Neighbors described him as a "glass house for entertainment."
Duncan was also not invited to comment on increased money absorption during a recent investigation of his previous mortgage contracts by the Committee on Standards and Privileges.
The Committee released him last month after an examination of its expenditure from the breach of the rules.
In 2004 Duncan transferred the security for a mortgage of over 271,406 pounds (300,000 euros) from his London House to his electorate, which he had bought in 1991, a year before his election as MEP.
Documents published this week show that until March last year Duncan was refunded approximately £1,400 (1,500 euros) per month as mortgages.
In April, his claims increased to over £1.800 (2.000 euros) per month.
The interest rate of Duncan's RBS mortgage has not changed during this period, which reflects that the total increase was used to finance the cash absorption of £75,000 (€85,000).
The normal gradual RBS mortgage rate decreased from 7.94 per cent in December 2007 to 4 per cent in March this year, where it still stands.
The latest documents published by the House show that Duncan continued to claim his entitlement to £1.250 (€1.400) per month in May.
Duncan lost his position as opposition leader of the subhouse in September, after a undercover reporter filmed him when he said after the spending panel that Members of Parliament would live "of skinny rations."
"In essence, when you work for the state, you have to live by skinny rations and be treated as S * * * * * e."
He said, "I have spent my money on my garden, and I have earned a disappearing small portion of what belongs to it.
And I could have asked for the whole damn sum, but I'm not doing it. "
The MEP, a millionaire from his previous career as an oil wholesaler, was attacked for the first time in May because of his spending, as it became clear that he had requested thousands of pounds for his garden before he had clarified with the Fees Office that this could "be considered as an excessive demand."
As a protest in Duncan's lawn, an activist buried a hole in the form of a pound sign after knowing that he had requested 4,000 pounds (4,500 euros) for three years.
When he was questioned last night about the increased mortgage, Duncan said, "This was approved both by the Fees Office and afterwards by lay to the value increase."
He added: "There is no debate about hiding and swirling or bending the rules or similar.
Everything is completely transparent and moves strictly within the rules, is approved and everything.
It could not be cleaner and clearer at all. "
Come all your faithful to admire Brighton's beach cabin adventure calendar
Beach huts in Brighton have found a new life content for the winter months as an interactive advent calendar.
"Beyond," an alternative church group that encourages spiritual discoveries through creativity, has invited 24 owners to decorate their huts with Christmas songs for every December.
The event started on 1 December and visitors were allowed to watch the latest cottage every day from 17: 30 to 18: 30 pm with free glow wine and traditional Mince Pies, filled with dried vegetables.
The Christmas songs selected so far are "I saw three ships," "O come, o come, Emmanuel," and "The first Noel," where the cabin dekoration is the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is a volunteer spiritual of the Chichester Diocese and head of Beyond.
He said, "We want to make religion more important for people in a post-Christian society.
Why do we, as a church, expect people to enter a strange old building? I think the church should go to people and organize enthusiastic celebrations.
The idea of the beach hut advent calendar began as a conversation with some friends at dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastic creative and living place and we try to express this through our spirituality. "
Strong mobilisation in Copenhagen and the world for climate.
Ten thousand people demonstrated on Saturday worldwide and in Copenhagen to demand an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against climate warming, where the police have made several hundred arrests.
At least thirty thousand people according to the police, hundreds of thousands according to the organisers, marched in the cold of the Danish capital, on the edge of the United Nations climate conference, which should lead to a conclusion by Friday, which could enter into force from 2013 onwards.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish Chairman of the Climate Conference, the increasing mobilisation in the world for the climate contributes to what is illustrated by these demonstrations that the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen would be very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital took place shortly after the train passed by, when a group of 300 demonstrators, dressed in black, shopkeepers had broken with patches and hammers, a journalist of the AFP found.
Anti-distress officers have intervened immediately and without regard.
The police have announced that 600 to 700 people, according to your opinion mainly members of the Black Blocs, have been arrested in the east of France, in April, by this extremely violent group of fragments that have already become famous at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg.
The Coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, has strongly criticised the conditions under which hundreds of militants had been arrested "without distinction," and has stressed that about a hundred of you were "still held in the streets on Saturday evening," despite the extreme cold with gloves and seat position.
The rather peaceful train went from Parliament towards the Bella Centre where the negotiations took place.
The demonstrators have stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to get in.
A stage was installed in order to welcome the planned speakers, for one evening with candle light, with the participation of the former South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
Most of the demonstrators traveled with buses and trains from the large European cities, but also many Asian people, including some Chinese and Korean, were present, as well as some Africans.
Approximately 3,000 people, most of you with sky blue raincoats, have made a first appearance in Copenhagen in the morning, since you followed the call of the Earth's friends "to form blue times" for the "climactic".
We are going to go on the streets to demand compensation for the ecological debt for the south, said Lidy Nacpil, Filipino activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We cannot go on like this and say: we have time, said Angelique Kidjo, singer from Benin.
There are rivers in Africa that dried out, water running where you can walk, as it has never been in the past.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, founded in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Agreement, the movement of globalisation critics has approached environmental organisations.
European Commissioner José Bové, the form of globalisation critics, announced that he came to Copenhagen to link "Climate Justice and Social Justice": "Today there is no difference between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world."
The Asian-Pacific area, where many islands are particularly at risk as a result of warming, has given the start for the demonstrations.
According to Australian organisers, about 50,000 people have gone on the streets.
In Manila there were a few hundred people, mostly students who marched in red and hosted bandanas where you smoked the solar energy.
In Hong Kong or in Djakarta, but also in Canada, some hundreds of demonstrators took place in order to demand a vigorous approach to climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the network "350" have gathered a few hundred people, namely in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
Some people gathered in Geneva.
The separatist Abkhazia chose its president, denouncing Georgia that this is a "joke."
Abkhazia chose his president on Saturday, this happened a little more than a year after Moscow had recognised this pro-Russian separatist Georgian area as self-employed, denounced Tbilissi the "strike."
Approximately 131,000 people were invited to participate in the first election after the Russian-Georgian war of August 2008 for control over the South Ossetic area, another Georgian territory recognised by Russia.
The polls closed at 5: 00 GMT.
The election participation was approximately 58% a few hours before the elections were closed, according to the Afghan electoral commissioner.
The first preliminary results should be announced in the night from Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates, including the former President Serguei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemns the election.
These elections are a farce.
On the one hand, the Georgian President Mikheil Saakachvili regrets that Abkhazia is now under russily secure total occupation, his press princess, Manana Manjgaladze, has declared.
In addition to Russia, only Nikaragua and Venezuela have recognised the independence of this area with 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world perceives it as part of Georgia, which is legally occupied by Russia.
After it had separated from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, with thousands of people dying, Abkhazia would like to prove that it is ready to join the international community by this election.
This process is a stage in our new life, a new era, as an independent state, has explained Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claims to have chosen for Mr Bagapch.
She was one of the electors who went to elect a electoral office that was in a school in the capital of Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with a few palms in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian dominance is the heart of this presidential election, in a region with beautiful landscapes on the Black Sea.
Large signs on which Bagapch can be seen on the side of the Russian President and the Heads of Government, Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are everywhere in this small area that has 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, which is located in the east of the country, the head of the district, Beslan Archba, has prepared a warm welcome to the Russian representatives who have come to monitor the conduct of the elections.
We, the Afghan people, are thankful, he said at a small celebration, as an impetus to Moscow's support, in particular as regards the decision to recognise Abchazia's independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognised by the United Nations, Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian Parliament, responded and raised a glass of vodka.
On the other hand, the opposition represented by the former Vice-President and two Russian businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticised the agreements concluded with Moscow last year, such as the one in which Abkhazia leaves Russia to control the railways for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Banba, claims to support neither the current government nor the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one voice is necessary to win the election.
If none of the candidates reaches this limit, a second round of elections must be organised within two weeks.
Climate: Demos worldwide, incidents in Copenhagen
Ten thousand people demonstrated all over the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding treaty from the Copenhagen climate conference, where the police, at any time operational, arrested about 700 people at the edge of an important demonstration.
Thirty thousand people according to the police, hundreds of thousands according to the organisers have demonstrated in the afternoon reasons in the Danish capital, who will receive delegates from 193 countries, which are looking for an agreement to enter into force on 1 January 2013 until 18 December.
From Parliament, the peaceful train marched towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations are taking place.
The demonstrators have stopped about 500 meters from the center and have not tried to penetrate.
A stage was built to welcome the planned speakers for a evening with candle light, with the participation of the former South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
Some moments after the train had passed by, a group of demonstrators who were all dressed in black and armed with baking stones and hammers started beating slices, a journalist of the AFP found.
Anti-distress officers have immediately crossed you in and have intervened without regard by throwing some of you on the floor.
The police have proclaimed that 600 to 700 people were arrested and have clarified that they are mainly members of the Black Blocs, these extremely violent fragmentation groups that have already made themselves famous at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, in the east of France, in April.
In the evening, a police officer suffered injury by a plaster stone during the incidents where, according to the police, about twenty people were provisionally arrested, at the chin. Four vehicles burned near a occupied house.
"We have the extreme groups under control," said the spokesman of the police, Henrik Jakobsen, while the helicopters of the ordermen crashed in the air.
Most of the demonstrators travelling by rail or by their own vehicle from German cities, London, Amsterdam or Milan were Europeans.
However, there were also many Asian people, including Chinese and Korean, and Africans.
Almost 3,000 people, mostly in the sky blue raincoat, formed in the morning in Copenhagen after the call of "Friends of the Earth" to a first group that should represent the "blue seas" for "climate justice."
"Today we go on the road to demand that the ecological debt be repaid to the people of the South," said the activist Lidy Nacpil of the Jubilee South Coalition of the Philippines in Copenhagen.
"We can no longer say: We still have time," says the singer Angélique Kidjo from Benin.
"In Africa, there are rivers that devastated, there are watercourses that you can walk through, which has never been the case before."
The first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was launched in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of globalisation opponents has approached environmental protection organisations.
The French Member of the European Parliament and globalisation critic José Bové, said to AFP that he had come to Copenhagen to "combine climate justice and social justice." There is no longer a difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world. "
The Oxfam organisation has mobilised several personalities such as the Danish model Helena Christensen or the former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, who is addressing the masses.
The Asian-Pacific area, in which many islands are particularly vulnerable to global warming, has given rise to demonstrations.
In Australia, according to the words of the organizers, about 50,000 people have gone on the street.
In Manila, several hundreds of people, in the majority of students, dressed red with bandanas, have made advertising for solar energy in front of the city administration of the Philippines capital.
Hundreds of demonstrators have also gathered in Hong Kong and Djakarta in an action against climate change.
During the demonstrations organised by the "network of 350" several hundred people joined together, especially in Paris, Marseille in the south, Lille in the north, Bordeaux in the west and Lyon in the east.
Several people gathered in Geneva.
According to Chatel, the geography and history of the subjects are strengthened from the school reform of Lycéen.
The National Education Minister Luc Chatel said in an interview which appeared in the Sunday newspaper Journal du dimanche that the subject geography and history are strengthened from the school reform of Lycéen, even if they are not taught mandatory in the terminals (12th school year).
"The students of the Première (11th year of school) now have all four hours and the same program," Mr Chatel confirms.
For the minister, "this hypocrisy must be overcome," because after him, "the scientific profile is no longer a scientific profile," but in general a concentration "of the best students."
"The economic and social and literary profile (ES and L) must not become a subprofile of science," he said: "I have not yet heard many historians and intellectuals who have been upset about the lack of historical-geographic education in the terminals on technical lyceen."
On Saturday, an IFOP survey published in the Humanité revealed that almost seven out of ten French (69%) criticize the state project of cancellation of compulsory teaching in history and geography in Terminal S (12th school year with scientific profile). Many teachers and intellectuals also support this project, as well as the left and some representatives of the right.
The Minister replied that there was no question of limiting the philosophy of the terminal S.
Luc Chatel also defended the education reform for teachers, while 16 organisations (students and trade unions) had called on Tuesday to protest against the project, which, in their opinion, is the victim of the educational training of future teachers.
The Minister stated that they were subject to a professional qualification examination at the beginning of the year in Master 2 (M2) and to a qualification examination at the end of the year in which their teaching skills were examined.
In addition, they carry out internships during the year in the M2 and then teach the students one year in front of them as teachers in the internship.
He continued to say, "If you add all the trainees you have offered before the performance test, you will reach more hours that you have spent in front of the students, i.e. more than 300 hours."
Finally, the Minister stated that he would like to offer "the individual right to education" - a "thing that does not exist in popular education."
He reaffirmed that he wanted to abolish the school card "by 2012."
15 minutes for the climate at the "Ecole Normal Supérieure"
Fifteen minutes to discuss the commitment at the Copenhagen Summit: this is the challenge that Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, had to face on Saturday morning at the Ecole Normal Supérieure in the Rue d'Ulm in Paris.
As a journalist of the AFP noted, the Nobel Peace Prize winner Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences in which experts turn to the audience fifteen minutes each with filmed contributions.
One would like to do something to reach people and raise the feeling that they want to learn more, said Edouard Hannezo, 22 years and one of the organisers of this day, at the edge of the conference. The name of this event goes back to the name given by the students to the fish in the Bassin of the school.
"Among the experts were selected by the twenty participants, even after their charisma," he clarified.
"You can talk about climate warming for hours. But the core targets can also be explained in a few minutes," said Jean Jouzel of the AFP, who spoke free only with the help of films before about 50 people.
"This is part of our role as scientists," he underlined in the hope that the listeners may derive from the fact that "the Copenhagen Conference is based on an absolutely serious scientific dossier."
The videos played by these conferences will be found online on the page of the school from December 15.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February and will then take place every two months.
Late payment: angry prison guards, actions planned
On Friday, the trade unions of the enforcement officers called for a general day of action to ensure that the premiums and overtime, whose payment was postponed for budgetary reasons until January, were transferred before Christmas holidays.
The Second Trade Union of Criminal Enforcement Officials ("FO-Pénitentiaire") called on the employees who do not have a service to demonstrate and block them on Tuesday morning before the Criminal Enforcement Institute to draw attention to the "theft of what they are entitled to."
The 3rd Trade Union of Criminal Enforcement Officials ("CGT-Pénitentiaire") called for "to unite a strong mobilisation in the various prisons," on which the non-payment of the overtime, night supplements and Sunday and holiday supplements in December will be burned as "shameful and unacceptable" market.
The first union of criminal enforcement officers, the Autonomous Federal Criminal Organization (UFAP / UNSA), called for "general mobilisation (...) to show the dissatisfaction and anger."
The management of the Criminal Enforcement Institute and the Ministry of Justice stated that overtime increased sharply in 2009 and not all were foreseen in the budget, but they guarantee that the remaining claims will be paid in January.
As the Ministry of Justice announced in the evening, Michèle Alliot-Marie sent a letter to the trade unions of criminal enforcement officers guaranteeing that the payment will take place next month.
"I am well aware of the efforts of staff to keep our criminal enforcement system working and to modernise," the Minister of Justice informed in this letter.
"I have instructed the executive body to take immediate action to ensure that such a situation, which has arisen as a result of a lack of assessment of overtime, is not repeated in the future," added Mrs Alliot-Marie.
As a result, the December salary is thin, except for the management staff benefiting from high service and target premiums, the UFAP / UNSA declares for which the "budgetary constraints" must be maintained.
"This is an absolute scandal," the inter-regional trade union FO in Marseille disgraces and announces to boycott "all meetings and calls" up to new instructions.
"The staff does not go to work on Sundays and holidays when the hours of October in December are still not paid. This also applies to their overtime," also threatens the FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
"In a time when more and more tasks are embedded to us without more staff being hired, the attempt to enrich in the funds of the staff is more than inappropriate," said the CGT union of Bordeaux.
According to trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions; some are less affected than others.
In any case, however, it is wrong to state the Secretary-General of the UFAP, Jean-François Forget.

The American President, Barack Obama, who will spend Christmas with his family in the White House for the first time, said to the TV talkmaster Oprah Winfrey that he is getting better and better gifts than he is.

Michelle Obama strongly rejected the allegations of her husband about the quality of the gifts. "I made you beautiful gifts last year," she necks the president.
"So please," he swore them shelmingly and pointed to the First Lady's pearl chain: "And who gave you this?"
During this one-hour radiation in unforced atmosphere with the famous TV moderator Barack Obama had so strongly supported during his campaign, the president and his wife also spoke about gifts that they loved most as a child.
Barack Obama remembered a bicycle with ten corridors and also a basketball that his father, whom he rarely saw, had brought to him for Christmas from Kenya.

"I didn't know at all how to arrange the furniture in a house, so I put them all on the wall instead of grouping them around the fireplace. But I loved this little doll house," Michelle Obama said.
Johnny Hallyday reoperates, RTL confirms that he was moved into artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was again operated in Los Angeles for significant "damage" after an operation in France. According to the people surrounding him, the situation was "under control," although RTL confirmed that the singer was moved into artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rock musician was re-operated in the Cedars-Sinai hospital in Los Angeles the night from Wednesday to Thursday, after the American doctors had found "damage caused by the operation of a tape incident," which he had suffered in Paris on 26 November, so his production company in Paris, which added that these damage would have necessitated a re-operation.
Nevertheless, the singer's production company wanted to clarify that the situation was "under control" and informed that a new medical opinion would be available no later than 48 hours.
According to RTL, the partner during the last tour of the singer, Johnny Hallyday was moved to an artificial coma to avoid "pain and complications."
However, only after 48 hours there was a little more certainty about the patient's condition when he opened his eyes added RTL.
At the request of the AFP there was neither a confirmation nor a comment from the production company.
RTL also confirms that "from certain sources," that after his first operation in Paris "no drunk" was laid.
The Rocker had been operated in the international clinic of Parc Monceau for a band disc incident.
The operation planned for several days was carried out by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor who had already treated many stars.

Euro-2009 / Short track: First place for Bousquet over its favorite distance
The French Frédérick Bousquet, three-fold medal winner at the 2009 swimming world championships, took an international title on Thursday about his favorite distance, 50m Freistil, at the Euro-2009 short track in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition, where the polyurethane suits were allowed for the last time, there were only three world records, while a real record flute was expected.
One record was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto over 4 x 200 m layers and the other by Russia at 4 x 50m layers of the gentlemen.
Too bad for Bousquet, who wanted to attack the 50m Freistil after the world record, whose record he holds in the big basin (20.94).
At one of the two king's distances in swimming, 50m-free style, the 28-year-old French claimed in 20.53 Sek. In a finale with ten swims at the start (usually eight) - a premiere at international level.
Bousquet forced the Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and the Russians Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but he failed to break the world record (20.30) as planned.
"One can believe in ever greater and in this case I said, if the world record is in my reach, I will try."
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers started in polyurethane suits that are prohibited from 1 January 2010.
With 238 World Records since February 2008, these combinations end their epic in Istanbul, which began in 1999 at the same competition.
This time, the use of the combination has not been paid out for the German Paul Biedermann, two times the world champion in the basin this summer in Rome and the world record.
The young swimmer has not managed to improve his best time over 400m Freistil (3: 32.77), yet he has performed with the second best time in his career (3: 34.55), before the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3: 35.75) and the Danish Mads Glaesner (3: 36.82).
"I didn't give everything this time.
I knew I couldn't reach a world record today, but I defended my title and fulfilled my task. "
"Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future," said Biedermann.
USA: Count plate at Zola estimated at 1.5 million US dollars
A Roman tomb plate, which appeared exclusively with the French writer Emile Zola, was estimated to be $1.5 million above its value on Thursday, according to the art dealer Sotheby's.
This plate is two meters long and 63 cm high. It comes from the IIth century after Christ and has always been rated with 150,000 to 250,000 dollars.
The marble, on which "four scenes of dionysos are presented in a sophisticated architectural decor surrounded by Satyren and Bacchus characters, is a rare piece. There are only four or five of them in the world," said Florent Heintz, Vice President for auctioning Roman and Egyptian antiques at Sotheby's, on Tuesday against the AFP.
It was sold under hundreds of pieces.
"The sale is still running, but this part is certainly what the buyers have offered most so far," says the speaker of Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy to the AFP.
The discovery of this purchase of the marble by Emile Zola goes far back.
The record was almost 300 years in Rome in the famous collection of the Borghese family at home, and then she appeared piece by piece with the French actress Cécile Sorel, who was used in her bathroom of her Paris hotel and appeared with Paul Reynaud, Minister in the III French Republic and President of the Council, before Marschall Pétain came to power.
The next 50 years are in the dark.
When searching the Louvre database, Florent Heintz discovered that this plate was part of an "inheritance of Emile Zola," which was opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of the "Thérèse Raquin" and the Fresko "Rougon-Macquart."
Zelayas exit trial from Honduras towards Mexico has been deceived
On Thursday, Mexico had declared the conditions for the transfer of the crashed Honduras President Manuel Zelaya to domestic soil as incompatible after the Putsch Government had rejected this lesson as unacceptable.
After a telephone conversation with President Zelaya that took place at night, everything seems to indicate that the possibilities of carrying out this transfer differ, the Mexican Minister for Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosa, explained.
According to the Immigration Authority, the plane submitted by the Mexican Government, which had arrived in Salvador on Wednesday for the purpose of the transfer of M. Zelayas, had returned to its starting point.
The Putsch government wanted M. Zelaya to "take off" and ask for political asylum in the country.
However, the President-in-Office refused to do so because he wished to return to Mexico as the greetest head of the state.
The Putsch regime "has suffered a renewed failure by moving me to give up at my expense (...), they wanted me to thank you," said on Thursday M. Zelaya to Radio Globo, in which he often spoke to Radio Globo since the beginning of the political crisis that has been continuing in the Central American country for five months.
I can stay here well and like ten years, here I have my guitar, added the crashed President, who had escaped two and a half months ago to the Brazilian Embassy of Tegucigalpa, under the attack of some chords.
On Wednesday, Oscar Raul Matute, Minister of Interior of the Putsch Government, explained to Honduras Radio HRN, the Mexican Embassy has submitted a request for guidance, which we unfortunately cannot accept, since it does not include an application for asylum.
I am not asking for asylum in any country at all, Manuel Zelaya had answered in an interview with the Telesur channel whose seat is in Caracas.
A possible exit from Honduras, he had emphasized, he would only do as President of the Honduran people.
On Wednesday, the rumors of an exit of M. Zelayas had mobilised the followers of the crashed president, who had joined the Brazilian Embassy and gathered around them, and then the military in there had strengthened its efforts.
The Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticised the position of the Putsch government.
This, according to its assessment, reveals the marginal character of this government in view of international standards.
Zelaya, who had approached the Socialist Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, had fallen down on 28 June, on the day of the referendum organised by him to prepare his re-election, against the advice of the Supreme Court, the Army and the Congress.
He returned from his exile in Costa Rica on 21 September surprisingly and fled into the Brazilian Embassy.
If he leaves, he will be imprisoned for treason, which he is accused of by the judiciary, according to the Putsch government.
The Putsch President, Roberto Micheletti, has managed to organise a presidential election on November 29 to replace M. Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo had been recognized by the United States in the course of the controversial elections, but was rejected by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, the Cogress had voted massively against Mr Zelaya's return to office until the end of his mandate on 27 January.
Wall Street in recovery, the US trade balance nourishes optimism
The New York Stock Exchange closed on Thursday with a high level, the figures of the American trade balance show a price recovery of US shares and their partners: the Dow Jones has added 0.67%, the Nasdaq has added 0.33%.
According to the numbers at the end of the stock exchange, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen from 68.78 points to 10.405.83 points, the Nasdaq, which is dominated by technology, from 7.13 points to 2.190.06 points.
The extended Index Standard & Poor's 500 was written at 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1.102.35 points.
There are good news from various industries, judged Lindsey Piegza by FTN Financial.
However, this remains anecdotic under the premise that the market focuses only on "half-glass" they measure.
According to Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors are focused mainly on the figures of the American trade balance, "which has an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter."
The US trade deficit fell by 7.6% in October to 32.9 billion dollars.
On the other hand, analysts had expected a deficit increase.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The major news is the increase in the total volume of trade, especially in goods exports, reflecting the economic growth of the main trading partners of the United States, so Christopher Cornell commented on business research Economy.com.
On the other hand, unemployment reports in the United States have risen against all expectations last week and have now reached the level of 474,000 requests.
However, during the last four weeks, Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors stressed that the average of new job seekers had fallen to the depth of the year.
The bond market has fallen.
The profitability of government bonds to 10 years has increased to 3,482% compared to the 3,432% from the Tuesday evening, the profitability of bonds to 30 years to 4,492% compared to the 4,408% from the eve.
Cuba: Hundreds of partisans standing in power whistle out "Ladies in Weiss"
On Thursday, hundreds of partisans standing on the Cuban power popped out the wives of political prisoners who met in Havana for the purpose of the World Human Rights Day and also misled another sound, resulting in a good dozen dissidents being temporarily arrested.
Around the forty "ladies in Weiss," spouses or nearby political prisoners, were popped on the open street of the government under Raul Castro, just as they were on foot march into the center of the capital to demand the liberation of political prisoners, a journalist of the AFP confirmed.
Down with the Yankies!, "Söldner!," "the road belongs to the revolutionaries!" "It lives Fidel and Raul!" scanned the powerful partisans with raised fist against the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civilian agents who had appeared to "ensure their protection."
A similar demonstration against the "ladies in Weiss" had taken place in Havanna the morning, where neither injured nor arrested.
On the other hand, a dozen dissidents, who also attended the demonstration on Thursday in view of the International Day of Human Rights, were temporarily arrested by civilian police officers, confirmed a reporter of the AFP.
According to this journalist, the police have forced the dissidents of the government's partisans to engage in civil vehicles under force use.
The temporary detention of dissidents under such circumstances is usually limited to a few hours.
As candidates to the Sakharov Prizes awarded by the European Parliament in 2005, "Ladies in Weiss" organised an unauthorised march for the purpose of "Request for the release of all political prisoners," the number of which has about 200 persons according to the dissemination list, Laura Pollan, one of the leaders whose husband Hector Maceda is holding a 20-year prison sentence.
M. Maceda belongs to the group of 75 Cuban dissidents, imprisoned in March 2003, 53 of whom are sitting behind bars until now.
The Cuban authorities consider the regime opponents to be "mercenaries" or "agents" in the service of the declared archbishop of the United States.
A rarity in itself is that Cuban television reported on the demonstration events held on Thursday between militants pro-government fighters and "counter-revolutionaries."
The leadership of a single party, the Communist Party, Cuba, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of the disruption of rights and freedoms, in particular those of freedom of expression.
Crazy kills 80 years old with the knife and leaves 5 injured in Clichy-la-Garenne
A madman armed with two knives killed an eighties-year-old on Friday against late afternoon at the main business time in the city center of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) and injured five more people.
According to the first information of the interrogation, the 28-year-old attacker had injured the eighties for unexplained reasons in or before a pharmacy on the Boulevard Jean-Jaures with two knives and this, according to police information, in the presence of witnesses.
The old man, born in 1929, according to a member of the Alliance Police Institute, is responsible for the consequences of his injuries in the hospital.
In or before the same pharmacy he had a couple with a pregnant woman.
The man, about in the triangles, has been attacked and injured.
The first two victims were severely injured in the hospital where the eighties died.
The other injured is in danger of life, as he, according to police sources, apparently affected vital organs.
The pregnant woman has become ill as a result of the events and is supposed to have been hospitalised in a police source in the "shock state."
The armed man who seemed to be under an influence of alcohol or drugs, according to police records, should be evacuated immediately on the street, the same Boulevard Jean Jaures.
He would have injured two more passengers, apparently by accident: a three-year-old and a forty-year-old, while the latter of both were difficult.
The scenario stayed in the dark in the evening.
He had been armed with two meat knives that he wears crossed behind his back, said on site Arnaud Pressé, a responsible for the syndicate Alliance of the area Hauts-de-Seine.
Several passengers, including young people, are supposed to have, according to the testimonies identified by the AFP, tried to bond the madmen.
I saw a guy in the threesome with a green vest.
Three young people tried to intervene.
They didn't make it because the guy was well built, told Alberto, a waiter of a close bar.
A horde fell over him, he added, including a city policeman who broke his wrist.
Still on the Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at the level of house number 61, two city police officers, including their superior, have tried to arrest the armed man and were injured with knife stitches, according to police information.
The event has been played in one of the main cartridges of Clichy-la-Garenne, where a number of shops are located.
Passengers have come to me to tell me that there's an injured person outside.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old person lying on the ground, I put her in first-aid position and noticed a slapping wound in the stomach area, told Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, the AFP.
Five minutes later, a second person, about thirty years old, was injured by cut wounds.
The state police forces finally arrested the man who didn't carry ID.
The Attorney General of Nanterre has commissioned the Department of Police of Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92) to investigate the case.
The madman has been hospitalised on Thursday night.
In view of his condition, he has not yet been heard in court.
A police source doesn't exclude him from being delivered to a nervous cure facility.
According to another police source, six police officers were banging him at the police commissioner in Clichy, where he had been abducted.
He was "in a state of excitement" like "all spiritually confused of this kind, in which the forces are released during the day."
USA: Polanski's attorney calls again for the prosecution
The attorney of the French-Polish film maker Roman Polanski has called for, for a repeated time on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, Western United States), to allow the prosecution of his client, who is currently in court at his residence in Switzerland due to a more than 30 years ago sitting loss.
Chad Hummel, the lawyer of the director of the "Pianist," challenged serious procedural errors in the second district of California before three judges of the Appeal Court at the time of the negotiations in 1977.
I demand instead punishment, said M. Hummel, before adding that the behavior of the Judge Laurence Rider band, at the time of the trial with the case, "let a cold back run down."
According to him, the Judge Rittenband, who has now died, had discussed with a prosecutor, before he had fallen his judgment, who should have told him that Roman Polanski deserved refuge - which is a serious procedural error.
This discussion was created in the documentary film "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski: persecuted and desired), especially by the prosecutor David Wells.
At the end of September, M. Wells had declared that he had "lied" to the authors of the documentary film.
If the Court refuses to terminate the criminal proceedings, Mr Hummel calls for the leadership of a process which would enable him to provide evidence of his argument.
On the one hand, the accusation has repeated the evidence already explained in the first instance, i.e. that a discussion on the abolition of the facts imposed on the defendant cannot be seriously considered until Roman Polanski appears in court.
In 1978, the 76-year-old director fled from the United States before the prosecution of "illegal sexual relations" with a 13-year-old.
He hasn't travelled to the United States since that time.
The Deputy Prosecutor of Los Angeles County, Phyllis Asayama, had stated that Roman Polanski had to "be there to attend the trial."
Would you like to disseminate the message in this matter not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused persons who are an escape opportunity?, Asayma asks.
In their opinion, "the film maker asks the Court for a favor and therefore despises his authority."
One of the three judges - who now have 90 days to announce their decision - even pointed out that "there were other escape alternatives."
Hummel was not the only one who asked for the prosecution against Roman Polanski.
The lawyer of Samantha Geimer, the victim, also once again demanded the revocation of the criminal proceedings.
She remembered that her client would no longer be able to be harassed by any restoration of Polanski's affair and added: "No one in this room can say that this process was fair.
Thirty-two years are enough. "
Roman Polanski was arrested in Switzerland on September 26, on the occasion of an American arrest warrant.
After spending two months behind bars, he was then sentenced to house arrest in his chalet in Gstaad in anticipation of any extradition.
Wall Street is braked by the rise of the dollar and closes without course.
The New York Stock Exchange closed off on Friday without a course in a market that was ripped between better indicators than the US and an increase in the dollar: Dow Jones won 0.63%, Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
Based on the final figures available when closing, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has increased by 65.67 points to 10.471.50 points, while the technologically dominated Nasdaq has given 0.55 points to 2.190.31 points.
The extended Index Standard & Poor's 500 has increased by 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
"Honestly, the market is quite quiet," Mace found lightning silver from Marblehead Asset Management.
"It remains narrow, the volume of trade has become very low and I think that this will remain so by the end of the year."
The trend was supported by the publication of better economic indicators that "contributed to improving the market view to the solidity of the economic recovery," the analysts of Charles Schwab summarised.
In the USA, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November, which has already been two months in succession and far more than planned.
In addition, the confidence of American consumers improved significantly in December to 73.4 compared to 67.4 in the previous month, according to the index preview of the University of Michigan.
However, the indexes have been hampered by a new increase in the dollar rate, which has reached the highest level over the euro for two months, thereby "pushing down the sectors vulnerable to the economic situation," said Owen Fitzpatrick, Deutsche Bank.
The technological values have thus lost a bit of ground.
The obligatory market has fallen.
The yield of the treasury loan over 10 years rose by 3.540% on Wednesday evening compared to 3.482% and the yield of the loan over 30 years to 4.497% compared to 4.492% of the day before.
Election of Miss World again in South Africa
After a month of tour through South Africa, the 112 candidates to the title of Miss World on Saturday will exceed the last hurdle to realize their dream: to be elected to the most beautiful woman in the world and watch this before a billion television viewers.
During this great beauty fair, which is held for the second time in succession in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already enjoyed their ticket to the semifinals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were renamed Miss Sportive or also Miss Top Model during their African stay.
This was a true strudel of pleasure.
Beautiful cities to visit, such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Horn, was simply extraordinary.
I've seen a lot of things and made a lot of experiences!, said Miss Sierra Leone with full enthusiasm.
This competition takes place in South Africa for the ninth time and will be broadcast live from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, on Saturday, from 5 a.m. (3 p.m.) from mid-European time.
I couldn't imagine a better country to surrender my crown.
This experience was just fascinating.
I am happy to have made this experience twice, underlined Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of South African summer.
For the young Russians, their second stay in South Africa was characterised by numerous exchanges of experience with candidates and the rediscovery of "breathtaking landscapes."
After a month of Galas, samples, meetings with the press and safari, the Miss now focuses on the competition.
The Pooja Chopra is hoping to step into the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, who was elected in 2000 and will also be present in this election, as well as Aishwarya Rai, who was elected in 1994 and were both Bollywoodstars.
It is of course the dream of any woman to be crowned once as the most beautiful woman in the world, but this is not just about the look.
We are ambassadors of our country and I would like to come home with the crown, and Miss India is throwing in with a wide smile.
According to the organizers, this 59th edition is underlined by music and dance.
The candidates defend in traditional desires and not to forget in the bathing suit.
The performance is presented by a television moderator, the Chinese Angela Chow, the ex-beauty queen from South Africa, Michelle McLean and a manager of the Miss World Committee, Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it knows to receive the world with a barely surrendered heart and pride, assures Julia Morley, Chairman of Miss World.
The candidates, like last year, made a safari, visited the famous Township in Soweto, but this time they cost by bicycle and local cuisine.
However, the meeting with the South African President Jacob Zuma, who gave them the hand, was extraordinary.
Not usually for a head of state, Miss Sierra Leone noted.
Their most beautiful memory, however, will undoubtedly remain the redemption in Cape Town (Southwest) to the World Football Championship in June 2010, a kind of country, to advertise a little more for this event.
I'm wrong with people I'd probably never get closer to.
I will certainly return to the 2010 World Championship, promised Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
According to his son David, the news about Johnny Hallyday is "very positive"
The news about Johnny Hallyday is "very positive," his son David assured on Friday when he arrived at the airport of Los Angeles, where he visited his father who has been there for a few days in the hospital.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong, everything is going very well, said David Hallyday to the press when he left the plane where he arrived shortly after 13: 00 local time (21: 00 MEZ) from Paris.
The son of the singer, who made a relaxed impression, assured that he would "quickly" go to the hospital of Cedars-Sinai, where Johnny Hallyday was deposited in Paris on Monday for a bacterial follow-up infection following an operation on November 26.
The singer was "transferred to an artificial coma this night in Los Angeles to alleviate his severe pain and to carry out his treatment," announced the press service.
Johnny Hallyday was transferred to an artificial coma by the doctors of the Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, in which he was deposited on Monday because of bacterial follow-up infection after a band disc operation in Paris on November 26.
In the night from Wednesday to Thursday, the singer had to undergo another surgery due to the recent illness of the operation.
His wife Laeticia attended a school event in the French Gymnasium of Los Angeles on Friday morning, where her daughter Jade went to school, recorded a photographer of the AFP.
The head of the orthopaedic and traumatic surgery department at the Hôpital Pitié-Salpêtrière, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer on Monday at the hospital in Los Angeles.
The producer has severely burdened the neurosurgeon Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, who operated the singer at the Clinique internationale du parc Monceau in Paris on November 26.
They told us he was doing the pure massacre.
The Los Angeles surgeons said they were completely disappointed, Mr. Camus said.
I heard about the possibility of initiating a trial, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday has travelled "far too fast with the permission of the Paris surgeon to Los Angeles."
I personally contacted this doctor who assured me that he would consider this journey as completely unproblematic, which had surprised me, since I have already two tape disc operations myself, he added.
Shortly before he announced to RTL that the singer apparently had left the hospital after the operation "without drainage, without everything."
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is very well known in the artist environment.
He had operated the actress Marie Trintignant, a few days before her death in Vilnius, at a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, where he practiced at that time.
In 2007 he had also operated the actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to absorb a hematoma after a brain bleeding.
However, he is also a doctor with a questionable reputation, who has been condemned several times for misleading operations and not to forget, for tax restraint and fraud.
Me Olivier Metzner, attorney of the medical chamber, has called him "a man without scrupel," who has to "regularly" responsibility in front of the board and "anything other than recommended."
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux made a statement on Friday about his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
This said that the intervention had been "perfect" and the post-operational investigations would have been "normal."
The operation "called no bleeding and therefore does not require drainage," he added.
In any case, the singer's tour, whose health problems have arisen since last summer, seems to be questioned.
It is quite clear that it is somewhat too short for a continuation of the tour on 8 January (in Amiens), Mr Camus said.
The Party Alliance UDF (Union for French Democracy) becomes energetic and calls on the Nouveau Centre Party not to use its seal anymore
On Friday, the Party Alliance, which is supervised by François Bayrou's MoDem party, responded heavily to an attempt to take over the seal, once founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, from the chairman of the party Nouveau Centre, Hervé Morin, and called on him to use this seal on no more document under threat of a judicial persecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announces his intention to take over this UDF seal, as he believes that François Bayrou would not be worthy of defending this political heritage after he had given his hand to the left.
By the way, the Minister of Defence, whose party partner is UMP, wanted to reaffirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
In response to his efforts, he received the support of Mr Hervé de Charette (former UMP, now NC), who was the first to apply for this brand to the "Institut national de la propriété industrielle" in 2004.
However, the office of the party federation UDF supervised by François Bayrous's friends broke its silence and clearly understood that they were not allowed to deprive themselves and set a deadline for the Minister and the honourable Member to cease using this seal and to transfer the property rights of the trade mark to it.
In recent days you have made numerous statements that you would propose your political movement to take over the UDF seal +, the party alliance wrote in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 office members, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, the MoDem party and Senator Jean Arthuis of the Central Alliance.
You probably also thought you had the right to print the name of this movement + Nouveau center +, the slogan + of today's UDF +, on their political material as well as on the homepage of your website.
As you know, you have no right to use this mark, the UDF's office declared and called on the party NC to "immediately remove the name of UDF from all material and from (its) website."
In addition, Hervé de Charette asked "to transfer the property rights of the trademark to its legal creditors."
If you refuse to do so, we will sue you to respect the law and to defend the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warned.
In their letter, they emphasise that UDF has been a full political movement since 1978 and recall that Morin and his friends have "made the choice" to leave this 2007 to create a competitive movement, as others had already done in 2002 to create the UMP party.
The Nouveau centre party therefore has no rights, according to the signatory, to use the UDF seal (Union pour la démocratie française).
They continue to recall that the last congress of the UDF in 2007 adopted the three-year accession to the MoDem party and the establishment of a department to defend "the material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As far as Hervé de Charette is concerned, the office continues to "have been a member of the UDF for three years when he applied for the brand name."
He benefits in a scandalous and fraudulent way, from the lack of deposit of the UDF acronym to do this for himself.
You should also remember that this negligence is the best way to transform itself into a crime, and ironise the strategy of the NC: "In politics as well as in life, it seems more worthy to make ourselves a name instead of trying to get out of anonymity by taking a name in a fraudulent way that you have no legal claim to."
Affaire Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier is condemned for exploitation of weakness
The Nanterre Court decided on Friday to assess the artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether he, as the daughter of the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt claims, has used a weak moment of the eighties to dispose of a part of his wealth.
The 62-year-old photographer, who is known for his Starphotographs, will have to be responsible for the exploitation of weakness in court on 15 and 16 April 2010, a criminal offence that will be sentenced with a maximum of three years of imprisonment and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that there will indeed be a process in this affair worthy of the saga of one of the richest families of France, in which mother and daughter are afflicted, while at the same time having the hands of the Cosmetic Empire L'Oréal.
However, the 15th Criminal Board ordered a medical examination of the 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt, which is carried out jointly by three doctors.
L'Oréal's heir and principal intervener has so far refused to undertake such an investigation, in particular not under the conditions laid down during the investigation by the Nanterre Public Prosecutor.
The doctors appointed on Friday will submit a report before 10 March 2010, in which you will make it clear whether and at what times Liliane Bettencourt may have been in a state of weakness.
I think she's going to undergo these investigations.
I'll talk to her, said the lawyer of Mrs. Bettencourt, Me Georges Kiejman, after the trial.
As regards the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, he is very pleased with the decision of the Court of First Instance.
This is an excellent news (...). The opinion will prove that he (banier) has manipulated this old lady that you have to protect, he confirmed.
For two years the only daughter of Liliane Bettencourt has initiated a criminal lawsuit against François-Marie Banier, photographer and all-round artists, accusing him of exploiting the weakness of her mother for years in order to make up for a total of one billion euros in the form of bank cheques, insurance policies or paintings.
On the other hand, Liliane Bettencourt had always refused to be manipulated by the photographer, which she considered to be a long-standing friend.
Although the court had to examine the admissibility of the action initiated by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, the plaidoyers of lawyers on Friday led to a large family debris.
For example, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer called on three letters sent by his client to her notary (1999, 2003 and 2005), in which she wrote that she was suspicious of the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
According to her lawyer, Liliane Bettencourt added the following: "Could you please explain to my daughter that I have written to Banier for fifteen years, one to two times a day.
Françoise I've never been able to speak since her marriage. "
The Public Prosecutor of Nanterre reiterated its view that the applicant had no right to react, in particular because in the last few days a preliminary court refused to initiate a judicial proceedings against her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully legal, is not protected and has no guardian.
No one has the right to act in their place, "confirmed the prosecutor, Marie-Christine Daubigney.
The court has now decided to issue a judgment after the process of admissibility of Mme Bettencourt-Meyers has taken place.
Managing revolution or the end of strategic early education?
If nothing changes in the leadership of the great French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence has been for nothing...
For over a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies with regard to its employees, the position of the companies vis-à-vis the consumers before the marketing revolution said: it is the best for the staff to join "values" determines the best as it had been previously hanged on consumer products by the technicians in the workplace.
By giving the customer in the centre of the companies the marketing revolution has given the strategies of conquering the markets in the place... although the authoritarian temptation products separate factors to impose customer preferences again regularly!
Demobilization of employees can lead to fatal demoralisation.
The suicide of France Telecom, PSA or Renault is only the top of a much larger phenomenon that affects employees in particular.
This demobilization has a negative impact on the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, especially those of R & D, which is even more important, on those of economic intelligence.
In fact, the IE (Intelligence Economique = Economic Intelligence) "calls for a proactive approach and a forward-looking approach from all the parties involved," requesting the employees to use the instructions of authoritarian management completely contradictory.
We therefore call for an operational revolution, which would consist of putting employees at the centre of the company's concerns as well as customers.
The very prominent benefit of internal opinion surveys
Will the internal opinion surveys, such as the questionnaire presented to Orange to his wage catchers, stimulate this revolution in terms of management practice?
I'm afraid not.
- First of all, because I found that in the face of a new situation, after many omissions, the whole structure finally wants to do what it has always done.
Even because authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of power - increases proportionally to the importance of its own failure.
And finally, because most executives have a much simplified idea of human behaviour.
Their interpretation of psychology is mechanic.
They take over the old behavioric theory, recently reactivated by the American "neuroscience" and unknowingly widespread by research institutes and through the media, by intellectual comfort.
Thus, and by suggesting that it is possible to use the "lever" (sic) to engage employees, a current Le Figaro.fr survey published by Ipsos strengthens the leaders in a attitude to a mechanistic control system that is inappropriate for today's world.
Identify and measure the mobilisation factors
Instead, an operational revolution necessary for the smooth functioning of modern companies requires the adoption of a final approach to human behaviour.
It consists in integrating a fundamental protocol in any consideration or practice of governance: for employees, commitment to the company is only possible if it clearly appears to be a means of realising part of their dreams, ambitions and projects.
At the moment only the studies from the multifunctional analysis take over this concept of motivation of employees.
These studies have shown that they evaluate their companies on the basis of a specified doxa, which allows them to assess, through their perceived image of the company, what it offers them to achieve their life objectives.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these mobilisation factors, managers of companies can control, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and place their human resource management back in the right place.
Thus they create a fertile soil which is favourable to the coordinated development of a robust and efficient economic intelligence.
The speech of Oslo: the "fair war" gives Obama praise from the right
On Friday, American rights welcomed the speech held by Barack Obama in Oslo on the eve of the evening and were pleased that the Peace Nobel Prize 2009 defended the concept of "fair war" against the enemies of the United States.
This time the Conservatives, who had mocked the award to Obama on 9 October, applauded the speech of the President, the example of the former Vice-President candidate for the 2008 elections, Sarah Palin.
I liked what he said, Palin said that the face of the right wing of the Republican Party in the daily newspaper USA Today and added that she itself raised the subject of a "sometimes necessary" war in its recently published memoirs.
Of course, the war is the last thing I think the Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We have to stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, who inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, tried on Thursday in Oslo to justify the use of violence; a way to explain his decision of nine days ago to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, said that the predecessor had done "very good work" in Oslo.
I felt that the speech was really very good, the former President of the House of Representatives, who particularly recognised the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in the words of Obama.
In some parts, I felt this speech quite historically, Ginrich, who was questioned in the radio show "The Takeaway."
The previous member, who was considered to be a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the presidential election in 2012, said that he was pleased to have seen a "President of the Left," which reminded the members of the Nobel Committee that "they could not be free and could not afford a price for peace if there was no use of violence."
For Michael Gerson, former writer of George W. Bush and now editor at Washington Post, Obama has held "a very American speech."
In addition to the fact that he is "cosmopolite," as "he always does," he said, "speaking like an American president," when he pointed out that Europeans live "as in a security bubble they did not create themselves and do not do much for their protection," said Gerson.
Among the few unconvinced rights, the former UN ambassador John Bolton, a falcon of the era Bush, described the speech on the website of the National Review Online as "boring, high-minded and inspirational."
On the left of the President, the democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is concerned about how Barack Obama defends the return to the armed forces.
If you pack the war under the cover of justice, the massacre of the innocent can easily be justified, he warns.
However, the press of the moderate left continues to be praised by the President.
The Los Angeles Times, who still believes that the Nobel Prize was awarded early to Obama, called the speech itself for a speaker like him who is known for his talent as "monumental work."
The speech in Oslo "provides a drafting plan for the management of international decisions against conflicts, poverty and oppression," the California newspaper is enthusiastic.
The New York Times considers that Obama "announced the necessary discourse" and calls his speech "dark and exemplary at the same time."
Fernfahrer: Three marathons for an agreement that ensures the supply for Christmas
After a three-week bargaining marathon, the trade unions of the road association and the TLF - the only employer organisation that remained until the end - reached an agreement that ends the strike warrant and the threatening serious supply deficiency at Christmas.
At the signing meeting on Friday evening, the State Secretary responsible for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, welcomed the agreement which was launched on Wednesday morning after several weeks of negotiations.
After a second negotiating night, negotiators separated early Friday morning in the hope to sign the agreement quickly late in the morning.
And this, although the three employers' associations (FNTR, Unostra and OTRE) had left the meeting.
However, more than six hours from the beginning of the meeting at 11: 00 until the conclusion of the agreement, and the agreement was signed at 6: 00.
The conflict "would have caused the company a great deal of damage" and "it was to fear that it would affect the holidays at the end of the year," said Bussereau.
The agreement provides for a 4% wage increase for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest wage groups (international transport).
The hourly rate for workers with the lowest wages thus increases from 8.72 euros to 9.06 euros.
"This is not very much, but we first start small," says Patrice Clos (FO).
The activists are now ordered not to block the supply centres anymore.
"However, there will probably always be some rebellious who are not satisfied with the agreement," he added.
The TLF president Philippe Grillot spoke of a "good agreement," although it was "difficult to allow these wage increases in view of international competition."
According to him, the increase is 170 euros per month for the low and 100 to 120 euros for the high wage groups.
"This agreement is based on the sound sense of mind and respect for employees," said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) spoke of "a historical agreement."
Mr Jaubert (CGT) spoke on this subject on "an acceptable compromise."
The agreement also provides for an increase of 3% in travel costs and the maintenance of the total road transport net in the first half of 2010, which will in particular enable the issue of 13 months' salary and the modernisation of collective agreements to be addressed.
Mr Bussereau recalled that "the sinking of taxes for employers of EUR 100 million" was the subject of an amendment by the government to the 2009 corrected budget bill adopted by the National Assembly in the night from Thursday to Friday.
The government calls for a "identical" vote from the Senate.
The signature of the TLF allows the agreement to apply first to the companies affiliated to this organisation and then, in the event of an extension by the Minister of Labour, to be applied to the whole profession.
This will be the case "in the shortest time," Bussereau assures.
The opposition of employers' associations can only delay the procedure.
The FNTR association argued "fraudulent trade" because the EUR 100 million "had already been promised to the sector to compensate for a part of the carbon tax."
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate as soon as possible, but not on the basis of a common analysis, but in order not to torment the Gans at the coming Christmas days, the Unostra complains.
For the Otre Association, the agreement "threatens to kick a big grave for the small and medium-sized enterprises of the industry over the next 12 months."
Line RER A: Disruptions this weekend, trade unions dissatisfied with the proposals of RATP
The disturbances on the line RER A, the largest fast-track network in France for the large area of Paris and the Île-de-France, continued on the weekend, while a meeting on Friday, the second strike day between the trade unions and the management of the RATP (Independent Parisian passenger transport administration) leaves the strikers waiting further with their demands for wage allowances.
At this important shopping weekend before Christmas, there were no trains between 10: 00 and 20: 00. On the central route (between La Défense and the nation) only one of two trains and outside the central trains was only one of four trains ready to operate.
The connection to SNCF trains was interrupted in Nanterre Préfecture, which forced travellers to move.
The purchase chain Galeries Lafayette, which counts 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "the RATP is trying to connect the big business to transport technically."
The RER A line crosses the Paris conurbation area from west to east.
The course section of the RATP connects the places Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre as well as Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one of two trains to the main traffic time planned, and almost none during the poor time.
As already on Thursday, there was no human will on the railways as the inhabitants of the Île-de-France had set up the situation.
So early in the morning, the train station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was far less overrun than usual, especially because of the lack of gymnasists.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, engineer (29), said he would have been extra "one and a half hours earlier to get to work on time."
The SNCF, which had planned to provide assistance to travellers by staff and directors, pointed out that there had been no bottlenecks at Saint-Lazare station.
The trains operated by SNCF on the RER A line from or towards Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or drove through the Saint-Lazare train station to ensure the connection to the metro.
On Saturday and Sunday, the main gatherings of the strikers took place again, during which the results that the associations had classified after the meeting with the leadership top on Friday afternoon were "modest."
The RER Managing Director proposed the specific preparation of a protocol for the RER A line with regard to all relevant aspects, working hours, career courses, etc.
However, this is not what the drivers want. According to Thierry Garon (Sud) they demand a long-term wage supplement.
The CGT was disappointed that the RATP itself put its wage proposals into brackets and stressed that the leadership tip is "unable to solve a problem, while that was possible for the televisions and SNCF."
The RATP made it clear that a new meeting was planned for the "comprehensive examination of working conditions" for Monday.
This also shows the associations that the company "ignores the weekend drivers."
In the morning about 150 drivers visited the establishment of a committee in Paris.
Once again it was the leadership that until now refused any discussion during the strike, and sealed a meeting after a calming of the situation.
On Tuesday, the conflict threatened to extend to the RER B line after a preannouncement by Unsa and Indépendants.
The associations demand a wage supplement from 120 (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indépendants). They also complain of the worsening of working conditions on this route, on which millions of travellers are travelling daily.
The drivers of the RER line with years of professional experience receive a gross wage of EUR 2.200 to 2.700 and a wage supplement of EUR 600 to 650 for shiftwork and Sundays and holidays.
Turkish Constitutional Court dissolves pro-Kurdish party. Decision with serious consequences
On Friday, the Turkish Constitutional Court announced the dissolution of the country's Prokurdic Main Party; a decision followed by the immediate angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision is threatening to make the work of the government, which strives to bring the Kurdish community to an end to the conflicts that have been going on for 25 years.
The "Party for a Democratic Society" (DTP) was dissolved as it had become a "place for activities which are detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," according to the President of the Constitutional Court of Hasim Kiliç four days after the decision against the press.
According to Kiliç, the decision would have been taken unanimously by 11 judges, with a majority of seven votes required to impose the resolution. He also pointed out that 37 of the leaders of the party, including the chairman of Ahmet Turk and the Parliamentary Minister Aysel Tugluk, were excluded from political events for the period of five years.
The judge also proclaimed the abolition of parliamentary immunity, which enjoys Turkey and Tugluk, as well as the confiscation of the party's goods.
The DTP now has 21 seats in Parliament (of 550).
The leaders of the parties expressed themselves before the judgment that parliamentarians would rather leave Parliament than take part in parental parliamentarians.
The decision followed a procedure initiated in 2007 by the Prosecutor of the Turkish Federal Court of Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya. He accused the DTP of following the "instructions" of the working party Kurdistans (PKK), which is regarded by Ankara and many other countries as a terrorist organisation.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political window of the PKK rebels.
The party assures that it has no connection with the PKK, but refuses to call it a terrorist organisation and calls on the government to negotiate.
The constitutional court's judgment is based on the government's intention to meet the Kurdish community and propose a number of measures to strengthen the rights of the Kurds in order to defeat the support of the PKK by the Kurds and to put an end to the conflicts.
The DTP leaders reaffirm that a resolution could lead to a recurrence of tensions in Southeast Anatolia, where numerous demonstrations against the terms of arrest of PKK Chief Abdullah Öcalan had led to collapse with the police in recent weeks.
Since the court's announcement, thousands of demonstrators have gathered in front of the DTP's premises in the Million City of Diyarbakir in the south-east, which is mostly populated by Kurds.
The crew used tear gas grenades and watercandles when the demonstrators started throwing molotowcocktails and stones.
Hundreds of people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the judgment, Turk assumed that the decision of the Court of First Instance would "further deepen despair."
"Turkey cannot resolve this (Kurdish, Anm. d. Editorial) question on the basis of the prohibition of a party," he explained to the press.
The government, consisting of a party from the Islamic movement, also regretted the decision.
"We oppose the closing of the parties in principle.
This does not solve the problems, "said Minister for Energy, Tan Yildiz.
"This decision is a torpedition of democratic opening promoted by the government," said the political market observer Ahmet Island.
"You can obviously get caught up with a reaction from the PKK," he adds.
On Thursday, the PKK attacked seven soldiers in the north of Turkey three days earlier. It was one of the most brutal attacks in recent months.
The snowfall can come
A really rough winter, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to harass the citizens, says the Winter Service Manager of the FES.
But so that his employees can try and control the whole vehicle technique.
In the weekend, according to meteorologists, it could be this time for the first time.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
The FES is working according to a precise plan.
As soon as it snows surface-covering in Frankfurt and the temperatures are below zero degrees, 20 so-called A routes are driven with large-scale vehicles, explains Brauburger.
These include, for example, main traffic and transit roads such as the New Way and the Hanauer Landstraße.
But also firefighter trains, OPNV routes, pedestrian zones and routes with divisions, such as the Atzelbergstraße.
The service of the FES begins at 3 o'clock in the morning
The approx. 1040 kilometres should be scattered in a maximum of three hours, if necessary, with moisture salt, which is better liable.
This is why the FES starts at 3: 00 in the morning, "so that the routes are free until the occupation starts."
It's gonna be hard if it's not snowing until 7: 30.
Then we have a problem, says the Winter Service Manager, "because then no one is willing to make space for the scratch vehicles."
Only after that, if it doesn't sneak any further, are the adhesive and exploratory roads, including the Council-Beil road, on the line.
The last priority are side and side roads.
There will be complaints there, knows Brauburger.
At five o'clock in the morning, the FES 'pedestrians are on their way, hazard points and transitions will be cleared as a priority.
The FES could usually not care about all cycling routes.
There is a special service in Frankfurt, which keeps an eye on the bridges from 22 to 4: 30, says Brauburger.
As there is on this quick slide, as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees, the scatter is on the way.
If necessary, this is also called by the police.
The cave of the dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like many other meat-eating dinosaurs: the two meters long and 1,50 meters big animal ran on two strong rear legs, had a long skull with sharp, bent teeth, short arms with sickle balls and a long tail.
If the kind had lived a few million years later, it wouldn't be anything special.
But Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body characteristics, Sterling Nesbitt reports from the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in the journal Science of Thursday.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in today's New Mexico, which was at the equator in a dry zone of the supercontinent of Pangäa.
Tawa opens a new window for early evolution of the dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
He shows us a lot about the relationships, the spread and the characteristics of the early dinosaurs.
In 2006 Nesbitt and other paleontologists began digging on the Ghost Ranch in the north of New Mexico.
We sometimes found a dozen dinosaurs on one day, which is unprecedented for trias deposits, report team member Randall Irmis from the Utah Museum of Natural History.
Some of the bones quickly identified the researchers as new art
During the excavation they together the remnants of a total of five individuals.
Fund confirms theories about Dino Early History
The name "Tawa" is from the sunshots of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt it is an extraordinary fund: "Dinosaur fossils from the trias are extremely rare, usually only individual fractures are found."
Other dinosaurs do not necessarily share enthusiasm.
This fund is not particularly spectacular, but it confirms some theories about the early history of the dinosaurs, says Martin Sander from the University of Bonn.
According to the current lecture, the dinosaurs appeared for the first time about 230 million years ago.
However, many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, so the allocation of these Ur-dinos is mostly controversial.
For example, the experts discuss when the oaks split up into their three main development lines: the meat-eating theropods, which later included the Tyrannosaurus rex, the Velociraptor and also the birds, known as the "Langhhalse" four-leg sauropods and their relatives, and the plants eating ornithiski (bird basin saucer), which included, for example, the types of triceratops and stegosaurus.
After the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa hallae is an original theropode.
It has an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, says Nesbitt.
On the head of Tawa hallae, for example, the researchers found signs of air bags, as they also possess the descendants of the theropods, the birds.
Thanks to the airbags, the breath of the birds is more efficient than that of the mammals.
In Tawa hallae the bones of the spine were apparently partly filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive theropod with airbags, says Randall Irmis.
Since the related line of the giant sauropods had later also air bags and light-building bones, probably the common ancestor of both groups had already produced this useful innovation.
At least three migration waves to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs so far lived in South America, the researchers follow that the lizards appeared there for the first time.
As a result, the three development lines separated early and spread from South America across all parts of the earth, which were still a single land mass as a supercontinent of Pangäa.
For this, the fact that the team together with Tawa hallae found the remains of two other, not very closely related theropods.
The three cannot come from a common immigrant ancestors, the researchers argue.
We believe that there were at least three migration waves to North America, says Alan Turner from the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-author of the science study.
There are also contradictions.
An even older species, Silesaurus, belonging to a group of dinosaurs, lived in today's Poland, says Bonner Paläontologist Martin Sander.
His opinion could be a distorted picture, because in South America just very many primitive Dino fossils have been preserved, while there is little to find on other continents.
As the dinosaurs managed to develop from a relatively rare side line of the reptile tree to the dominant farmers of the Earth's Middle Ages, it is still mysterious.
During the Trias, the dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, for example with the ancestors of today's crocodiles and the flight sailors and with many more eches.
At the end of the Trias, the dinosaurs spread around the world and developed many new species, while relatives on the border died from Trias to Jura.
Successful history didn't last forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There could have been a mass death that happened to survive the dinosaurs, but not the other reptiles.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted so they could beat the competition out of the field.
The success story did not last forever.
150 million years later, a meteorithm hit a group of animals to flowering, which had also evolved in the Trias and since then a treasure period has been delayed: the mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
The University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna, or Berkeley in California, is a professor at the University of Toronto.
Teachers from Naples are coming from Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police cleanup of the occupied casino of the Frankfurter Goethe University beats waves worldwide.
278 Professors and teachers from the Goethe University, but also from universities throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, are solidarity with the protesting students at the Campus Westend.
In a statement written in German and English, they "disapprove" of the police operation initiated by the Bureau.
Uni President Werner Müller-Estler had cleared the buildings occupied by students and teachers in the educational strike last week because walls and works of art had been shattered.
Five students were injured.
The material damage, judges the signatories, did not justify "the violent dissolution of self-organized teaching events of students and teachers by a police command."
Cleaning is a "unacceptable intervention" in the freedom of research and teaching.
The exclusive focus on vandalism served "the ditification and criticizing of the protest" and distracted from the content.
The Bureau has withdrawn the necessary discourse.
The doctors are demanding immediate dismissal of criminal prosecution.
The majority of the occupants did not support the damage.
Protest legitimized
The youth of the Verdi trade union and the German trade union association are also solidarity with the students.
The protest is legitimate expression of growing concern for the future, says Verdi-Landesjugendssekretär Alexander Klein.
Hessens Science Minister Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) defended the action of Unipresident and police.
We are grateful to the President of the Union.
Destroy and occupation are completely unacceptable means, she said in a current hour on Thursday at the Wiesbaden Landtag.
We understand the protest, but we do not understand vandalism, so the CDU Landtag Commissioner Peter Beuth.
Otherwise, the opposition groups saw SPD, Green and Left.
The CDU takes painted walls to pretend to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (left).
Instead of dealing with the arguments and demands of students, it was cleared.
The Left has tabled a request calling on the Minister of the Interior to report on the police operation.
New Silicon Valley
For many years she was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of the ten districts of the capital of Moscow, was a strictly guarded location in the Soviet Union for secret armaments research.
Today, the municipality with its 216 000 inhabitants, 37 kilometres from Moscow centre, is considered "Russian Silicon Valley."
Important research and production facilities for micro- and nanoelectronics are located here.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograd had made contact with the Frankfurt Science site Riedberg - with the Unisinstitutions and the companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and on Wednesday Selenograd and Riedberg signed a "Protocol on closer cooperation."
The Moscow Deputy Mayor Juri Rosljak and Prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd introduced the Russian delegation, signed for Frankfurt by Planning Desert Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises will travel to Selenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
It is a question of continuous scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
Firms of the FIZ are allowed to take foot on the growing Russian market.
On the other hand, Russian science companies want to obtain orders in Germany.
Selenograd is the seat of major Russian research institutions and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, the large companies Sitronics and Rosssijskaja Elektronika.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a so-called "Socialist Planning Town" for Armed Forces.
Selenograd (literally translated "Grünstadt") received his name from the wooded hill landscape in which the research facilities are embedded.
Stuttgarter Brake Clot
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 cannot be taken up high enough.
For the promoters of the project it is simply "the new heart of Europe."
S21 is much more than the deployment of a station, more than a monstrous construction project that will fall the city of the Baden-Württemberg country capital for a decade into heillless building chaos.
Stuttgart 21 was created from the spirit of the 1980s.
Headlines with tracks that end in the middle of the city were then considered as a 19th-century transport fossil, which worked like brakes of modern rail transport, as it once took enormous time to convert locomotives from the back to the front.
Get in, hold on, go on - that's how it goes.
And that is why the headstations should disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a transit station, which is located on a half-way of the trans-European rail magistrate between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava - therefore the slogan of the "heart of Europe."
S21 is actually being tackled, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even very ambitious planners have realized that it is almost unbearable in the Hessian and Bavarian capital to implement the defeat.
However, headstations have no longer a problem with entry and exit since there have been modern turning trains with motor vehicles and steering cars at both ends.
Nevertheless: Stuttgart 21 next to the ICE-Neubauroute to Ulm is now under way.
National and local politicians have enforced it.
The railway is involved, even because the risks of the largest infrastructure-specific project of the Republic of taxpayers and not the state-owned corporations bear.
Town-building, the project can still be reasonably justified.
New city space is created, which - believe the computer-generated graphics of the planners - is equipped with a lot of green.
S21 is harmful to the rail transport system.
The transit station and the extension of the route are intended for passenger transport, which, typically in the 1980s, was attributed to huge growth.
At that time, there was not yet the competition of the cheap fliers.
Modern transport policy must, however, first of all be aimed at strengthening freight transport, as rail transport is much more environmentally friendly than road trucks.
But the new construction line is not suitable for freight trains because of heavy climbs.
Even more serious is that S21 indirectly operates many other railway projects.
About six billion euros are to be banned in the Swabian.
That's the official number.
Experts think ten to 15 billion are realistic.
It says that in the next decade the money will be missing at other nodes and bottlenecks in the network.
A total of sixty major projects are on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the extension of the 180 kilometres long distance through the Rheintal.
Since 1987, the trail has been built in the time lupentempo.
It would be urgently necessary to press the tube right here.
But S21 will work as a brake clot.
The Rheintal route becomes a bottle neck for international freight transport: in the heart of Europe.
Government examines judgment on the airport
The Land Government has left open in the Wiesbaden Landtag whether it will go against the judgment of the Hessische Verwaltungsgerichtshof (VGH) as a night flight ban in revision.
The CDU / FDP coalition instructed experts to have the more than 400 pages comprehensive VGH judgement judged legally, said Minister for Economic Affairs Dieter Posch (FDP).
The VGH in Kassel had written that this day, in the event of the construction of the planned North West runway at Frankfurt airport, the country had to reregulate the night flight ban.
The approval of 17 flights between 23 and 5 o'clock, as provided by the national government, is not compatible with the legal protection of the population against night noise.
The coalition must decide by 4 January whether it is against the judgment in review.
The opposition criticised this suspension and urged the government representatives to refrain from revising the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
SPD leader Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel called on CDU and FDP to return to their promises made before the election to a night flight ban. Otherwise, this would be considered as a "breakdown of word."
It is damn hard to keep his word, said Green Chief Tarek Al-Wazir in a speech on the FDP electoral slogan "We keep word."
Minister Posch rejected the accusation of Schäfer-Gümbel, the state government attempts to come to their nightflights with "legal distortion and tricksery."
A precise legal examination takes their time.
The coalition did not want to operate on the basis of a "quick first impression."
We need a legally secure decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As it represents the opposition, the statements of his group on the night-flight ban have never been.
US banks pay back aid
The crisis-shaken US major banks are striking their state ties.
On Wednesday, the Bank of America paid back the assistance from the Tarp Bank for a total of 45 billion dollars (about 30 billion euros) to a hit.
And the Citigroup also plans to repay state aid after a report from the US Sender CNBC.
Institutes want to remove the restrictions associated with the adoption of the money, such as the limitation of the payment of managerial bonuses and the payment of high fees.
The Bank of America had purchased some $19 billion of fresh money from investors for converting bonds.
The rest of the sum she took from her own cash, which was well filled with, among other things, parcel sales.
Banking manager Kenneth Lewis explicitly thanked the American taxpayer on Wednesday night: the money injection has helped over a very difficult time.
The money house had raised itself to the highlight of the financial crisis with the acquisition of the investment bank Merrill Lynch.
The Citigroup also wants to obtain money on the capital market for the purpose of exempting its liabilities to the State.
Even on Thursday, the US Bank could announce a $20 billion heavy increase in its capital, CNBC reported calling for circles.
A Citigroup speaker didn't want to speak.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already repaid their assistance.
Quick choice
Then everything went faster than thought.
Only two weeks after the ZDF Board of Directors had pushed Nikolaus Brender out of the office, the station can present a successor.
Last night, the board wanted to vote on the staff.
Peter Frey, head of the ZDF capital studio in Berlin, was the favourite.
However, there was no confirmation from the transmitter - officially not to precede the procedure.
However, it should also have played a role not to further damage the ZDF operator Markus Schächter, nor should this proposal be passed by the Board of Directors.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the board.
The result of the vote was not yet established at the end of this edition.
Two weeks ago, with his proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years, Schächter failed in the board of directors.
Only seven members expressed themselves in favour of Brender, seven voted against him. Brender's defeat was a tremendous defeat for shadows, but one expected.
Because the majority of the Union in the Board of Directors had indicated weeks before the election that Brender did not want to confirm in office.
Organized had the resistance to the chief editor of the Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch.
With the argument that under Brender, the ZDF's news broadcasts had lost on intake quotas, he refused another term of office of the high-level editor.
Until the election, there were therefore protests in which the political influence on the ZDF was ejected.
Last but not least, even 35 state-rulers had been involved in the debate, which considered Kochs to be unconstitutional.
It didn't make any sense.
To person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and romance.
After that, he worked at the Southwest Radio and the Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983, Frey moved to ZDF, first to the "today-journal."
Afterwards stations: 1988 to 1990 personal reporter of the editor-in-chief; 1991 / 92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 director and moderator of the "morning magazine"; until 2001 head of the ZDF foreign policy; since then head of the ZDF capital studio.
The Greens announced a constitutional complaint after the debut of Brenders, which was still elected on Wednesday by the Medium Magazine industry magazine as a journalist of the year.
Mr Koch's counterpart in the board of directors, the Rheinland-Pfalz Prime Minister Kurt Beck, said last week that the countries should change the ZDF State treaty in such a way that the intent's personal acts cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
However, a extract of party politicians from the ZDF's supervisory bodies also excluded Beck.
Brender's presumptive successor Peter Frey had recommended to the Board of Directors with a smart chess move - by vigorously criticising the board immediately after the Brender departing.
Thanks to this record's journalistic independence, both shadows could nominate him without facial loss for the post of the chief editor and the board of directors, without suspecting to bring a party dealer into office.
Frey is allocated to the Left Liberals anyway.
Study is being deflected
Partial success for students: After a year of the educational strike, the country's cultural ministers finally agreed on Thursday: at a meeting of the Cultural Ministers and Higher Rectors Conference, both sides agreed to improve the study conditions of Bachelor and Master.
Students should be able to do their studies in the future.
In detail, they agreed to reduce the test loads: in principle, each study module should only complete with a single test.
In addition, the work burden of students should be reviewed and "a realistic and acceptable measure" guaranteed.
Policies and universities also want to simplify the recognition of qualifications between universities within and outside Germany.
The countries committed themselves to making common structural guidelines for bachelor and master courses more flexible.
Moreover, there should be no derogations from these countries.
Less tests
Since the start of the student protest in June, cultural ministers and university rectors have the whistled word of better studyability in their mouth.
Now it was filled with a concrete content for the first time.
The so-called accreditation council decided to reduce the number of examinations partially drastically: "Each module usually closes with only one examination," it says in a 30-page paper that is intended to partially rearrange the admission of courses.
With the "significant reduction of the audit burden," the accreditation council president Reinhold Grimm stated that a "failure development should be stopped which significantly impeded the studyability."
In addition, "studyability" should be the "decisive criterion" in design in the future.
For example, modules such as "hard to check" whether "unnecessary constraints of students in the choice of
It is also important to ensure that the European Union is fully involved in the implementation of the acquis in the field of human rights and human rights.
Students would have the right to have room for self-initiative and to promote them.
The rules are to be applied for the authorisation of new courses, but also for the review of existing courses.
These must be "recredited" every five years - which means that it will take until 2015 until all the studies have been reviewed.
10 accreditation agencies in the Federal Republic are responsible for this, under the authority of the accreditation council set up by the countries.
In October, the Cultural Ministers urged the countries to "strongly" to influence the agencies in such a way that the substance was not too large and the audit regime was not too rigorous.
In individual Länder, universities and higher education have already agreed with the national ministries on appropriate measures.
As the only country so far, Rhineland-Palatinate committed additional funds for the further development of the Bologna process.
Of the money, universities are intended to set up, in particular, tutors' programmes and to strengthen study counselling as well as audit and foreign offices.
Countries and universities want to spend 10 million euros on this.
At the beginning of 2010, the government intends to introduce a novelle of the higher education law to Parliament.
According to this, only one examination is required for the completion of a study model.
Study design should be more flexible, and the recognition of qualifications at other universities should be ensured and access to the master facilitated.
By the end of next year, all the country's studies are to be checked for their study ability.
Government and opposition had again argued on Thursday about the country's study conditions.
In addition to praise, however, there was also criticism of the decisions.
The federal board of the Juso University Groups called for the design of education policy to cease "behind closed doors" of ministers and academic directors in the future.
At the latest after the educational strikes, students should now be "a word" as a subject.
The future academics received support from the President of the High School Rector Conference (HRK), Margret Wintermantel: "We need the students' experience," she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Cultural Ministers with which the HRK discussed a joint reform paper.
The Trade Union Education and Science (GEW) did not go far enough to make the Bonner decisions: it calls for a legal claim that allows every graduate with a bachelor degree to access a further master course.
On the other hand, the countries must ensure that the current generation of Bachelor students will have sufficient Master Students with the best possible study conditions available tomorrow, according to GEW member of the Board of Directors Andreas Keller.
The countries need to recruit significantly more teachers.
However, the Cultural Ministers did not express their views on free access to the master.
More than one footnote to Herta Müller
Entry into Germany and out is pretty much almost no control... "is the initial line of a poem by Lyriker Werner Söllner, in which this in disturbing language fences addresses the arrival experience of a dissident who has won freedom but at the same time lost his language space.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in the Romanian Banat, had first worked as German and English teachers in Bucharest and later as a lecturer in a children's book publisher before moving to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
Söllner has been awarded with various literature prizes, in 1993 he held the legendary Frankfurter Poetry lectures at the Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been head of the Hessische Literaturforum at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
On Tuesday, during a meeting in Munich, he held a significant extraterritorial review on the subject of "German literature in Romania in the mirror and scratch of its Securitate Acts."
Seems to be insecure and shy, Söllner leaves a statement in which he gave his cooperation to Romanian writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak and Helmuth Frauendorfer, as an IM for the Romanian Securitate Securitate.
In 1989, Söllner received the German language prize together with some of the attendants.
The recruitment attempts would have begun smoothly, first in 1971.
I am, finally, "so someone who has not fought enough against the Securitate's intimidation attempts."
The Lyriker Werner Söllner is in Walter.
Almost at the same time as the Nobel Prize honour for Herta Müller and its unprecedented literary discussion with the mechanisms of dictatorship, the literary scene and, in particular, the community of German authors from Romania are shocked by a case that makes the foundations and defeat of a political system based on monitoring and occupation.
Werner Söllner is not only a perpetrator, but also a victim, as far as it is known.
In his Securitate file, IM Walter played a role, said after the confession of Söllners of the literary scientist Michael Markel and referred to the positive influence of IM Walter for him.
He "pulled him out" in all the different points for him at that time, said Markel.
It is a moral need for him to make this comment.
Söllner's statement was unexpected in the form and before this audience, but completely surprising is not the commitment of a former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian Secret Service.
Germany had been a cozy reserve for Securitate Spitzel, Herta Müller had already written in July in the time after having read her own file, 914 pages.
The people concerned are speculated, and in some cases they may have known which clear name was hidden behind the cover name Sorin, Voicu and even Walter.
Contrary to the fact that the Stasi files are now very procedural, it is still very diffuse to deal with the backslides of Securitate monitoring.
A systematic education has been deprived and hampered in recent years.
One of the Birthler Authority's National Council for the Preparation of Securitate Acts (CNSAS) was established only in 1999, but the issue of the Acts has been rather slow since then.
Only since 2005 has there been a law governing the administration of the files.
That the influence of former Securitate members in Romania is still very large, after the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller, an interview in which a former Securitate chief from Temesvar expressed abruptly about the prize winner.
She's got a psychosis, and they've only been questioned once.
The infamy of power meant to be able to express itself completely unholy in the form of freedom of expression.
Certainly, the case of Söllner is inevitable, as often in connection with distracted guilt.
Why only now? Who has been hurt? The specific reaction of the listeners to Söllner's confession makes hope that the continuation of this chapter will be determined by insight rather than by guilt and shame.
The Genese of Herta Müller's work, which yesterday received the Nobel Prize, is more than a footnote.
Supplement to the Champions League
It seemed that there was just a adrett dressed outdoor servant from a very nice Christmas celebration on which a sports article manufacturer Goodies had distributed when the new VfB coach Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag of the equipment, rose a quarter hour after midnight into a called C class.
The man with the brilliant glow let himself drive because of the still foreign city he was in.
Otherwise he could have been driving himself - alcohol was finally not in the game, and drunk of luck the 55-year-old was just as little.
Had been a pleasant evening, but tomorrow's work goes on.
Or just go right ahead.
In the words of the first three days before, Swiss: "We have reached the eighth final," namely in the Champions League thanks to the 3: 1 success against Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not let ourselves blinded from success: it will be a brutal hard fight against the descent."
The "much more important task" is ahead on Sunday.
Then it is important to repeat the royal class performance in the league's everyday life in Mainz.
And turn off the yet again revealed weaknesses after the fast three gates through Marica (5.), Trasch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11.).
Exposure
The eighth final of the Champions League (Hinspielen 16 / 17 + 23 / 24 February / Play 9 / 10 + 16 / 17 March) will be released on December 18 in Nyon.
So the joy of the fulminant conscience of the successor of Babylon continued to behave.
Not only with the alleged healer who had provided self-confidence, willingness to use and joy of play to the unsafe Stuttgart professionals in the short time.
I went to the players and told them that they should remember their strengths, and stopped them to be braver, soulsticker Gross explained the so simple success recipe, which had no effect under therapist Babbel.
He has unfolded a certain magic, admitted Babbel-advocate Jens Lehmann, "when a new impulse comes to football, sometimes things happen that one had not thought to be possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, thanks to his dynamics, graduated to the best player in the place after weeks of injury, tried to describe the "phenomenon" that was found with the spokesman "fresh wind" and the operation of the new supervisor: "He is a man who demands through and discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation. "
It was apparently under Babbel.
The VfB Stuttgart is not yet over the mountain, warns sports board Horst Heldt
The VfB Stuttgart needs constancy, however.
Like Gross, players and managers were afraid to overestimate the victory against a completely superfluous defense of Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow, before four days later the evil awakening came to Leverkusen at the 0: 4, Khedira gave thought.
And athletic board Horst Heldt pointed out that although one seasonal goal was achieved, the other was still far away.
We're not over the mountain yet.
The fact that Heldt was not happy to celebrate for three months on his 40th birthday even after the first home victory, was a fresh experience of the events of the weekend, which were broadcast in the form of a television interview by Torhüter Jens Lehmann immediately before the beginning of the game.
There are decisions that take the others and not the Jens, the hero opposed the harsh criticism of Lehmann.
He had accused the board of leadership of weakness and decided to switch to pressure of puberating fans.
Lehmann also considered that his free day after the game had been deleted as a sign of lack of sovereignty and disgrace.
Lehmann's testimony was "characterised by pure egoism," hired Heldt back and announced consequences for the final man.
I don't think you're gonna be friends for the two forty-year-olds anymore.
After all, they agreed with everyone else that without the preparatory work by the dissolved coach team, the playful and struggling strong idea would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "a great share of success," said Heldt and Lehmann unisono - and also the man agreed with the plastic bag.
WM-Fight in gravity
Hot Duell in Bern: Always provoked challenger Kevin Johnson World Champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavy weight title according to version of the WBC.
The judgment of the point judges was unanimously ruled.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko remains boxing world champion in gravity.
The 38-year-old champion after version of the band WBC defeated the US American Kevin Johnson unanimously in the night to Saturday in Bern by points (120: 108, 120: 108, 119: 109).
For Klitschko it was the third successful title defense after his comeback in October 2008.
The Ukrainian was previously twice the world champion of the WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, it didn't work with the K.o. that everyone expected.
Klitschko built his balance to 39 victories in 41 professional fights, twice he had to beat himself because of injuries.
challenger Johnson had to accept the first defeat in the 24th battle.
In front of about 17,000 people in the Berner Arena, the 2,02 meters large Klitschko wanted to dictate the fight mainly with his left leadership.
The eleven centimeter smaller Johnson, who had announced the end of the Klitschko era before the duel, repeatedly withdrew the World Champion's beats, so that Klitschko could not make a decisive goal of his dangerous rights.
In total, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenger and only tried to get over the rounds.
Although he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, his beats rarely hit the world champion.
After all, he was only the second boxer to Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who went over the full distance of twelve rounds with Klitschko.
The challenger had provided some wirbels before the struggle in the Swiss capital.
He insulted Klitschko as a "ugly zombie," who "can't do anything right."
On Friday, the champion was able to provoke Johnson to push the sunglasses from his nose "to see his eyes."
Fourth victory to Klitschkos Comeback
Klitschko also remained victorious in his fourth battle after his comeback on October 11, 2008.
After nearly four years of retirement, he had beaten the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and "recovered his" WBC belt, "which he had previously had to surrender unfought.
This year he then conquered Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and in September Chris Arreola from the United States.
I only got one hit in this fight and am physically very good in shape, Klitschko had founded the fast return into the ring.
His dream remains, however, the association of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Wladimir is the world champion of WBO and IBF.
However, the British David Haye is wearing the belt of the WBA, after which he was able to detonate the 2,13 meters of Nikolai Walujev.
Haye had previously canceled a battle planned for September against Vitali Klitschko.
His promotion company is now already planning the fight against Klitschko in the London Wembleystadion.
Case Kunduz
Frontalattack from the opposition: Green Group leader Jürgen Trittin has called Defence Minister Guttenberg a liar for false information on Kunduz affair.
SPD and Left demand information from the Chancellor.
Hamburg / Berlin - According to recent findings on Kunduz's air attack, the opposition Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) has subjected a conscious deception.
The Minister said "knowingly the untruth" on the deadly bombardment of two tanks from September, "said Green Group Head Jürgen Trittin on Saturday in the ARD News" Daylight Review. "
It's called landlings: He lied.
The order to kill had been issued in breach of the rules of the International Protection Force for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the substance of the report which NATO had read by Mr Guttenberg, said Trittin.
On Friday, it had become known that the attack was not only about destroying the kidnapped trucks, but also about killing two Taliban leaders specifically.
In the US Air Attack requested by German Kunduz Commander Colonel Klein, up to 142 people had been killed or injured according to NATO investigation report.
On Saturday, Green, SPD and Left, Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) asked to speak immediately before the Bundestag and also to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Ms Merkel has to clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing is part of the federal government's Afghanistan policy - and whether the Chancellor Office, Federal Defence and Intelligence have approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and Green colleague Renate Künast called for.
President Ulrich Wilhelm strongly rejected the criticism.
The Chancellor Office did not influence concrete operations of the Federal Defense in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, there were also doubts about the presentation of the Ministry of the background to the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert.
According to information from SPIEGEL, the two Guttenberg have correctly and fully informed about the background of the tank attack.
Officially it had been said that they had denied the existence of NATO reports and left the Minister sensitive details.
However, from the environment of the two senior officers, they alleged that they had even referred to several reports by the Ministry of Defence, including a two-page document by Colonel Klein and a field hunter report.
In the meantime, Wichert should have asked for clarification in a letter, the "Frankfurt General Sunday Newspaper."
He has not received an answer so far, says he.
The Ministry did not comment on the allegations on Saturday and pointed out that this would be clarified in the committee of inquiry of the Bundestag, which intends to be established next Wednesday.
Dream worlds
Some see images in awake condition and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only in the case of psychologically ill people and in the drug drain, the limits between imagination and reality are flooding.
As long as it happens in sleep, everything's fine.
If we lie in our dark rooms with closed eyes, we can give ourselves to the most wild ideas and imagination.
But those who experience sorrowful conditions, see and hear things that others do not see or hear, in the modern western world, are usually considered crazy or drug-like, at least as special.
But such images and voices are not only produced in the case of psychically ill or in the drug outlet.
Guilt has our imagination: The same neuronal processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels, sometimes make the limits between dream, delusion and reality flood.
Tragic changes in guard consciousness conditions can occur in the most different forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst case crazy.
Even though triggers and effects may differ, the visions of Mystician Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age Prophet Carlos Castaneda, shamanic impressions, psychosis and hallucinations can be attributed to similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions occur when the balance of the neuronal bottoms of the brain - especially dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - is depleted and the interaction of different parts of the brain is disturbed.
Complex hallucinations and crazy thoughts occur very often during a schizophrenic psychosis.
The gravity has no more power over him
The connection of madness and dream has occupied philosopher and medic since ancient times.
Aristotle's conception of hallucinations as a form of dream in the awakening state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, confirmed in 1861 a "great similarity of irresism with dreams," for Sigmund Freud was the dream "a psychosis, with all the inconveniences, delusions, insanity, insanity."
It's autumn 2001 when Henning T. turns into a comic figure.
His body is two-dimensional and quietchy.
The gravity has no more power over him, he's floating on the room blanket.
He feels a kick.
Behind him whistled devil shaping with blood red, distorted frogs, teeth fleeting.
They chase him, kick him with heavy, flaming boots, throw him against the walls, he feels the pain on the whole body.
Loud, evil voices drown from walls and radio.
He can't stand them anymore, the voices that humiliate and insult him.
Henning T. rips two cables out of the stereo system, knits them to a sling and attaches them to a hook on the ceiling.
He walks up on a speaker and sets the sling around his neck.
Jump.
The snake is loose.
This is a lesson to you, the voices scream in a drum-fed choir, "Go to the clinic and let you heal!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychotics, the last one is 2 years ago, the first almost 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is schizophrenic-paranoid psychosis, and he is also manic-depressed, he takes medication, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He's learned to live with his illness, he's been married for three years.
In the psychosis I have experienced the worst fear and deepest despair, he says.
The trumpets are cruel reality
About one percent of the population is at least once in life suffering from schizophrenia, in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second largest disease after depression.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis, the affected people can usually no longer distinguish between the internal and external world, they are in a superior state that can lead to hallucinations, size, relationship or persecution.
Especially common is the voice hearing - voices commanding, commenting or dialoging.
Also optical hallucinations are not rare.
The person concerned can no longer separate important from insignificant, the brain can no longer filter disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded by impressions.
Like the dream, the psychosis also opens the locks for a flood of ideas and fantasies that emerge from deeper consciousness layers.
The reality perception in the psychosis is subjectcentred, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, Superior of the General Psychiatry Clinic at Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrene is located in the center of the event, everything has a focus on it.
At the same time, he comes into a passive role, he is overwhelmed by the events, just like in his dream, and cannot make them active.
Schizophrene therefore often feels threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A reality balance is usually not possible for them, the trumpets are cruel reality, awakening excluded.
Once in life have experienced a hallucination
Unlike in the dream, Fuchs says, "however, the sensual and spatial structure of the reality that is perceived in the psychosis remains in principle."
The insane thoughts and hallucinations are found in reality, the xenophobia of experience takes place in the real context.
Why exactly our brain beats Kapriolen, researchers still face puzzles.
Exceptions can lead to short-term loss of reality for every person, says Fuchs.
But not everyone will develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic application to schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that the genes are not the determinant factors.
Researchers assume that there are minimal brain damage in the affected population.
We suspect that the neuronal maturation of the brain is disturbed at an early stage of development, due to a viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, for example, explains Fuchs.
But there is still a mystery about how the disturbance of the neuronal system can be achieved, which, at first, does not manifest itself for many years.
Environmental influences also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be triggers to a psychosis when the disposition is present.
Also hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis as they intervene in the transmitter system.
When our brain goes hot
The crazy thing is, psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and swallow expensive medications to get rid of them, others spend money on drugs to get them, says the Lübecker Psychology Professor Erich Box.
Whether trug images are considered to be pleasant or unpleasant is often just a question of the point of view.
Box has been collecting reports of hallucinations and delusions for ten years, last year he has evaluated his results in the book "The Irrational World in our Heads."
Hallucinations are one of the typical accompanying phenomena of psychosis, but also of astonishing many other diseases.
These include, in addition to mental disorders such as borderline or depression, diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer and skull brain trauma.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions even the brain hallucinates healthy people.
Hallucinations, according to boxes, are composed of memorial content that are normally withheld.
They arise when brain areas in which senses are processed are overactive or inhibited too little; if our brain is hot or even if stimulation is missing.
Drugs can cause this condition as much as brain damage or psychosis.
But as well as irritation, stress, love number or other mental exceptions.
In recent studies, up to one third of the respondents indicated that they had experienced a hallucination at least once in life.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and visits the gymnasium there.
A very normal girl, actually.
If there weren't the pictures and voices there.
During the break it may occur that a slack boy with long, dark hair responds to it.
When it answers to him, the fellow students look at it surprised - no one else sees or listens to this boy.
You think the shy girl is a sponsor's nightmare, but Sarah K. doesn't dream, she knows that.
She's awake, she hears and sees this boy, just as she hears and sees the girl in the bank.
She can even feel his presence, at least for moments.
A pleasant feeling is that she likes the boy.
Am I crazy?, she sometimes asks herself.
But she knows that this boy and the other trumpets are not real and disappear again.
At night the apparitions are usually scary
Often the trumpets are also a burden.
When she sits in the classroom, she sometimes cannot follow the teaching material, because the teacher in her eyes and ears is just presenting a new fellow student while he explains mathematical equations for all other people and is visible on the table.
At night, the apparitions are usually scary.
If she waits in her dark room for sleep, which comes far too rarely and much too late, she often cannot distinguish whether she is awake or already dreams, whether the pictures she sees arise, the frogs or the girl with the bleeding cut wounds on arms and legs, in front of her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, scream at the shapes.
Parents and friends don't tell them that they'd think they're crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She passed the abitur last year and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Since she contacted the psychologist in the Internet, she knows exactly that she's not crazy.
Wahn is also an art work of despair
If someone is socially isolated or suffering from irritation, he has with great probability after a while hallucinations, says box.
I guess the brain is then underemployed and takes care of its entertainment.
Sarah K., a single child, was afraid of other children as a little girl, often played alone.
Her hallucinations began when she was 13, that the man she calls Daddy since she could think is not her body father.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same brain areas that also process real impressions and noises, it is difficult to distinguish between people like Sarah K. from Trugbilder and Reality. "Every experience," says box, "occurs in the brain, reality occurs there.
Hallucinations are also images that cause the brain to emerge, so they seem so real. "
Also night dreams value boxes as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people do not differ fundamentally from those of acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrene, psychologically healthy people are able to recognise their trugs as irreal.
Therefore, box advises his patients to appreciate the hallucinations as a special ability.
Border state between dream and hallucination
Unfortunately, in our too conscious-centered world imaginary experience is mostly pathologized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, Professor in Heidelberg and Chief of the Clinic for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy at the Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
Psychosis is a serious, painful illness, but it also has positive, creative - crazy is also an art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has investigated the so-called oneiroid form of experience, a special form of the sadly altered guard consciousness.
Oneiroids are highly complex, detailed quasi dreams that the living person thinks are real and that he can't differentiate afterwards from the watch state.
The oneiroid state of consciousness occurs in trauma or disease-related extreme situations, for example in polyradiculite patients who experience motor paralysis with full consciousness.
If a human being is threatened by loss of himself and the world, for example by persistent, complete inability of movement, he replaces the life-threatening real situation by its own imaginary world, which is decoupled from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
A kind of boundary between dream and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to deal with a situation in reality, a world change takes place, but the real situation is present in imagination.
An intense form of sensation and sensation in an intolerable situation in itself, which allows us to do not undergo our own design in a nothingness of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
The Zürcher Art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his oneiroid experiences in his book "Duchsel" as a rescue action of the soul.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness after a heartbeat surgery with subsequent heart transplant is departed on journeys days while his body is convicted of being unmoved at the intensive care station.
Claussen dives into a self-created world, visits foreign times and places: He experiences himself as a bed camp old man, on board a train laboratory, a robot guards his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages under nobles that produce drugs from blood.
If dragged by a Greek on the motorcycle in its homeland, surfing with his top bed in the corporate snow of the Alps and meets a Korean mafioso.
He goes all the way up in the imagined event, everything is real, even later in memory.
These inner trips differ fundamentally from every dream for clauses.
Dream is a different condition, he describes his experience.
On the contrary, the memories of mental journeys are still clear to me after years and in next-matter details.
More clearly and more intense than truly experienced.
The intensity of this experience blows the horizon of our other life-worldly experiences, says the psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
In the end, oneiroids, psychosis, hallucinations and drug outlook show how fragile our inner images of the outside reality are also in guard.
Any change in the state of consciousness, refurbished the psychologist box, "can lead to a deformation of what we call reality."
An experience that can be quite enriching.
The snowfall can come
Burda
Children should take over the publisher at 27 years
The new publisher Kallen is an interim solution: in the long term Hubert Burda wants to give his company into the hands of his two children, he said to SPIEGEL.
The holding will also belong to 100 percent of the family in the future.
Hamburg - The publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the long term in the hands of his children.
Both children inherit at 27 years and have the firm will to enter the company, the 69-year-old said to SPIEGEL.
We have carefully arranged the details of this.
The question of whether they are active in the company is only then asked.
The question is also whether they are capable of doing so.
It is not possible to introduce 7500 employees to their children if they are not sufficiently capable.
This will kill the children and the company as well.
Burda had announced on Thursday that he would withdraw from the board of directors from January, and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
The 52-year-old Callen has been a board member with Burda since 1999.
First, he was responsible for technology.
Later with the sector of the Treasury the responsibility for the company's assets and after the exit of Jürgen Todenhöfer also the responsibility for direct marketing, abroad, pressure and finance.
For the first time, no family member is at the top of the publisher.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who was 42 years old today, died a few years ago.
The designation of Kallen also served to bridge "10, 15 years," said Burda.
The holding should be 100 percent of the family in the future, said Burda.
With regard to the cases of fate dancing and Schaeffler, Burda said that even family companies are not safe before the fall: "This always concerned families who were able to be infected by a capital demand that was completely speculated and thought they could rise up to a very big player.
My strategy was never that.
He had "never dreams of power," said Burda.
I do not see myself as the political predecessor of this country, as it was Springer, and I do not want to play in the world with 'Time', these shops have become too big.
Perfect beauty
Everything you want in terms of beauty and well-being is now available to you.
At least this is what El Corte Inglés has done, which has recently opened a shop with an area of more than 1000 m ² in the shopping centre in Callao (Madrid), where everything is only about body care.
In the wellness area, which is located on the eighth floor, one can find among other renowned companies, such as Hedonai, who provide for a rehearsal with lasers; Spaxión, with rooms to relax and for beauty treatments; the hairdressers Luis & Tachi, Marina d'Or with a gym or L'Occitane with their natural cosmetics.
However, there is also a food department that produces more than 130 different tea varieties through its tea house.
Enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner while having a fantastic view of the capital, or renting the relaxation area for two hours to get on your own "beauty party" with eight friends and then relax in the whirlpool or with massages and a glass champagne, these are just some of the possibilities that Spaxión offers.
The total area is 250 m ², which is divided into 12 rooms for the latest facial and body treatments and for hydro therapy.
For example, for the cavitation in the fight against cellulitis or with vibrating surfaces.
The gym also has this type of equipment, and there are also virtual trainers who take care of the customer's training units and thus provide them with complete personal training.
You start a training unit with the entry of a personal password on a touch screen that is located opposite the devices.
After that, various videos show you how to perform your training units properly.
The head of the gym ensures that 15 minutes (including heating and detonation exercises) are completely sufficient to train the body muscles.
Except, after you have trained your body, you still want to visit the hairdresser, the company Luis & Tachi has a space in which treatments for recovering hair splendor, shine and health are offered for your hair in personalised manner.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to be the key words for this wellness area in the middle of the city, which is always open from 10: 00 a.m. to 10: 00 a.m. in the evening 365 days a year.
The most diverse Decolletés
Christmas is getting closer and this is why it is another good opportunity to copy the look of the stars and get their dresses in our wardrobe.
The form of the decolleté, which is very important to highlight the silhouette, is one of the points that must be considered.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie has chosen an exaggerated and very complicated decolleté.
Endesa and Barcelona with the electric car
The electricity company Endesa has created the "LIVE office" together with the city of Barcelona.
This is a project for the development and promotion of electric cars in the Catalan capital.
The "LIVE office" (logistics for the introduction of the electric car) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the introduction of the electric car in the city and will make arrangements on mobility by managing, coordinating, subsidising, etc.
On the other hand, the MOVELE project will be designed to summarize the activities and opinions of the sectors involved.
This is an attempt to advance the means of transport in the future.
3 "Electrical cities"
However, Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the introduction of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville also participate in this project.
These are the three cities selected by the government in the MOVELE project to accelerate the introduction of the electric car.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework contract with the Government of Catalonia (la Generalitat).
This framework agreement aims to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These activities include activities related to energy and, in particular, their performance.
However, it is not the only initiative in which Endesa participates in the promotion of the electric car.
The company participates in standardisation groups across Europe and has a wide range of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees "a horizon of tranquility" for the automotive sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, prophecy of the Spanish automobile industry, which is the largest exporter of the country, "a horizon of tranquility."
In the presentation of the economic report for 2009 by the President of the Government, Zapatero reiterated the measures launched by the government in support of the automotive sector during the year.
"Without the plan for the competitiveness of the automotive industry, we would now have a panorama of negligence and closure of some of our main production works," the President of the Government said.
"Thanks to this plan and the willingness of automobile manufacturers to continue to produce in Spain in a highly competitive industry, we can see a quiet horizon for this industry, which is our largest export sector," he added.
He also recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, which is part of the overall plan for the automotive industry (PIA), provided EUR 800 million for projects of 19 vehicle manufacturers and 137 suppliers, which in turn provided investment of more than EUR 3 billion.
The Heads of Government stated that these investments are intended both for the development of new models and for the modernisation of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also underlined the government's efforts to stimulate demand, in response to plan 2000 E, which is applied in cooperation with the autonomous communities and car manufacturers.
According to the Heads of Government, this plan allows for an average reduction of 6% in exhaust gases for new vehicles sold on the Spanish market, which in turn led to a "strong increase" in the approvals which "increased by 40%" in November.
On 20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
The first edition of the International Classical Automobile Fair will be held in Madrid, an exhibition for specialists and lovers of the world of engines.

Mazda3 i-Stop: environmentally sustainable sport
Mazda wants to prove that sport is compatible with environmental protection.
For this reason, Mazda recently introduced the engine's automatic stop and adjacent system, baptized on the name i-stop, a device which is currently available only for the 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
This second generation of Mazdas 3 is highlighted by its good notes in the overall picture.
The final processing, the execution of the vehicle, the comfort, its street behavior, the mechanics, the i-stop system...
All these aspects are "very good" with the new Mazda3.
Starting at the front seats you can see that the front seats offer excellent ergonomics and good stop.
The game of the steering wheel is also excellent.
When looking further at the unit, which consists of the instrument panel and the armature board, it can be seen that Mazda is located with a variety of buttons and buttons in the visionary colors red and blue, on the same line as the Japanese trend towards a futuristic interior design.
This style partly reminds us of the style of Honda Civics.
Therefore, it can be said without further notice that both the Mazda 3 and the Civic, both Japanese models, are lifting away from the sobriety of German cars, especially from the Volkswagen Golf, which all want to be overrun.
The passenger room of these two Japanese compact cars offers more than ever the appropriate comfort, so that four adults can only drive comfortably by car.
All of this comes with a large spacious and clearly shaped trunk.
The stop and start-up system is currently only available for the 2-litre petrol engine with 150 hp and a 6-speed circuit.
This engine is a real enjoyment. It emerges through its fence, through its silent sound, its performance and its low consumption.
And all those who do not drive many kilometres a year should consider this i-stop with petrol engine because of its great comfort in walking circuit and its low consumption, even though in Mazda in particular the diesel models are the most sold.
With regard to the equipment, the so-called model Sportive selected for testing is a special feature, as it has a much larger number of elements from the serial equipment.
From the serial equipment, especially the RVM (RVM) assistant, which eliminates the dead angle, as well as the operating elements for traction and stability, the speed control, the light sensitive inner mirrors, the board computer with a large screen, the sensors for parking, an independent air conditioning, rain and light sensors, Bluetooth and audio-Bluetooth as well as the chrome 17-inch rims.
Moreover, this version also includes, as if this was not enough equipment, the Premium package, which contains the following for additional 1,500 euros: in addition to other elements, especially the learning bixenon headlamps and the sound system BOSE with CD charger.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-stop is one of the best compact cars in his class.
It is particularly outstanding with regard to the materials used, due to its driving behaviour and the diversity of equipment.
In addition, those who do not leave many kilometres a year can also buy the i-stop version, which is only available with a 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
The only negative of this model is its slightly high price, which lies between 21,770 euros for the model Luxury and 23,270 euros for the experimental model Sportive.
In return for this high price, however, the Mazda3 offers us every day on the new highest pass.
A premiere with a lot of glamour
L. A. rolls out the red carpet of sensibility for Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
At the premiere of "Nine," the stars, dressed in models that look as elegant as sexy more than ever. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe," as elegant as always, decided for a dark "lady" dress.
The promises of FonPeek
Peek is first limited, a device with which you can only read your e-mails, without a way to see certain attachments or surf through the Internet.
It enjoyed his five minutes of glory when it chose the magazine Time to be one of the products of the year.
Seeing it on the street is rather unlikely, but the idea itself is nevertheless of particular interest to young people.
Unlike the smartphones, Peek costs only very little and has a very favourable flatrate, for example only half of the price of the flatrate of an iPhone.
After the company has seen the success of this, it has placed two new devices on the market: one that is intended only for Twitter, the other with a lifelong free service for data, unlike Peek, where one has to pay a six times higher price.
Fonpeek, which was presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of this invention and hence its third version.
It has the same limits as its American counterpart, but has a surprise ready.
The monthly maintenance price for the telephone, about 12 euros a month, includes roaming for all over Europe.
Those who travel around the world with a smartphone already know what it means to have to abandon all the data in order to read his emails as soon as you cross the national border or if you desperately look for a café with WIFI (or a connection with phone).
The idea of roaming with flatrate is incredibly seductive and should have been possible for a long time.
It is true that some telephone providers already offer special contracts and prices for foreign stays, but my experience is that you already need a PhD in Physics and a good glasses to read all the small prints.
The repeated criticism by the European Commission on affordable roaming tariffs throughout Europe remained almost always unrespected.
Out of your own country, you are always afraid to read your emails and that right.
That a small device like FonPeek (where it is always amazing that it has the name Fon, although it does not have WiFi / WiFi) can offer this kind of tariffs, means that the telephone providers must slowly, but certainly, rethink and start to consider different ways of using their data network.
Kindle is another good example of this, and its prices include downloading books and further requests on the Internet.
No vetting and no hook.
This is an Internet-enabled device and you only pay for it once, namely when you buy it, not monthly.
And that is exactly what I expect one day from FonPeek, a purchase opportunity with lifelong Internet access as it already offers the Peek in the USA.
And not because I want to buy it.
I'll read my emails by the phone, thank you.
But I expect this because I think it would be a more appropriate model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The Fetic Color of Michelle
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite color of the American First Lady.
Already when Barack Obama entered office as President of the United States, she appeared in a dress and a coat of this color and chose the same color again to accompany him at his second most important moment in his life: the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama has worn very similar models at both occasions: apart from the fact that it was almost the same color - a shiny green yellow -, the clothes consisted of three parts - dress, jacket and coat of the same fabric, and for that it wore something large-shaped or a necklace.
It goes even so far that at first sight it seemed that the First Lady of the United States wanted to follow the example of the Princess of Asturias and had decided to wear the same dress at more than one occasion.
However, the two dresses differ greatly in the type of fabric from which they are manufactured.
At the introduction she wore a dress of top and in Oslo one of the moulded Samt.
The accessories were also different: for the first time green shoes with half-high sets and for the second time a durable model but gold colors.
The hair was also different every time: the hair was stuck up at this occasion as a hair crane, while the previous hair was wearing open.
75% of working mothers have had problems at work because of their maternity
Discrimination in work has increased in recent years, especially in the younger women who want to have children.
This is the result of the study carried out by CSIC in cooperation with the Institute for Women "Fertility and career of women in Spain."
The survey below 9.737 women between 15 and 75 years of age leaves no doubt about this: 75% of women in work see their career mechanisms in the labour market limited due to their maternity.
The study reveals that there are great differences in the decision to establish a family and the number of children, depending on whether or not the women work and if so what kind of work they do.
Those of them who do not work outside the house, work only half-day or do not have a fixed contract will become mothers and have more children.
On the other hand, women with firm employment, especially in the public sector, are postponing the creation of a family and maternity and therefore also have fewer children.
"Women in the age group between 35 and 49 with a fixed job will receive their first child on average only 3.7 years after retirement, an increase to 4.1 years for women with fixed employment who have taken longer to achieve this and who have not achieved their first child until much later.
Moreover, the kind of work also has a great influence on maternity, although less than the calendar regarding reception readiness, "explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor which must be taken into account in the age of women in marriage and the first child.
According to the survey, age is higher at the time of marriage and the first child, the higher the level of education.
This difference was also found in women of equal age.
For example, women in the group between 35 and 49 years of age, depending on whether they only have primary education or higher education, have become mothers for the first time with 25.1 or 32.1.
There is also a further difference between women, depending on their level of education.
While women with primary graduation are getting married before their first festivities and receive their first child, women with a middle or high school degree are making it quite different and are looking for a festivities and getting married after that and then having their first child, Delgado finds out.
Diane Kruger is also worth it
L'Oréal Paris has recently added a new name to the list of ambassadors he has always envy: Diane Kruger.
From the next year the German actress will be the image of various products of the brand and will also say the widely known advertisement "Because you are worth it."
The main actress from "Joyeux Noël," one of the most elegant actresses at international level, will become another famous outskirts like before her Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the last to join this exclusive club were the actresses Evangeline Lilly ("Lost") and Freida Pinto ("Slumdog Millonaire").
Among the men, the cosmetics company has only exceptional embassies: Patrick Dempsey ("Grey's Anatomy ') and Matthew Fox (actor colleague of Evangeline in" Lost').
The award ceremony of the British fashion industry
The British have an important word to speak with in the fashion world.
Their highest representatives - fashion designers and models, both from yesterday and today - met at the annual award ceremony held in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
They had all appeared to this occasion.
The ex-model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was chosen as the best model this year.
The poker game by Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent presents in "Poker der Asse" (Alfaguara, illustrations of Fernando Vicente) to the thirty X-rays of writers who have accompanied him in his literary life (and in some cases also in real life).
He does not use a predictable and fearful genre (short biography, life and work) but is looking for a modesty to the glorious heart of the Creator.
The journey is exciting and Vicent saves neither fear nor enlightenment.
Obviously, that this book is a delicious reading kiss, it is also a moving call for reading and repeatedly reading.
Here are some cuts from the book.
About Albert Camus: "When I read his pages, I found out that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but rather a spiritual, almost sensual drive, just as I have always felt without having found words for it: the joy in contrast to the unhealing fate, the moral without guilt and the innocence without any God."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, Allegorist Christ, he wrote about what he had in his blood, not in his mind, between ignorance and ignorance, with a magnificent poetic humor, without any sense, like the knife blade that almost killed him."
About Graham Greene: "Our husband was united by this woman with a passion that lasted for thirteen years, who had to go into her band, in whose flesh the emotions were united with the pleasure of repentance, a spiritual privilege that consisted of coming to heaven on the way of destruction."
About James Joyce: "The Odysseus" was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. This is one of the 8000s summit in world literature, you have to climb up on the north wall, on the wall where the best climbers try again and again. "
About William Faulkner: "He was a funny cheat.
He sometimes said about himself that he was the inheritance of a guardian of the county and again several times he said that he was the son of a black and a crocodile.
Both dreams were made of a certain size. "
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: This writer recorded the insane cry, which was removed from a bridge from that personality from Munich, so that his echo could go deep into the night of the 20th century in his literary way. This was what he made in a journey on which he escaped from himself and prayed the afterworld with a speech of violence before the worms.
About Dorothy Parker: "One day she kneel down and prayed: my dear God, I ask you to do everything in your power so that I will finally stop writing like a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "On his grave these verses of Spencer are engraved: 'sleep after effort, / after the thunderstorm of the port, / the peace after war, / after a saturated life you find favor in death."
About Virginia Wolf: "In her luggage she always had her depression.
The husband took it with total normality when she told him that Eduard VII spelled it between the Azaleen or sang the birds in Greek.
It is not known any other case where the man had so much patience and was in love with a neurotic whose literary talent was much greater than her insanity. "
About Pío Baroja: "What else did Martín-Santos do to try to invade Joyce in Baroja?
What did Benet intend to do if he did not bring Baroja to Faulkner's weapons?
What did Cela do, except to destroy the glory of that man, so that he could put himself on this podium? "
Cowardly aggression
My 70-year-old mother walked through our neighborhood last week in the village of Fuenlabrada, when suddenly a group of young people ranged from 15 to 18 years next to her and our dog, our dog is a mixture that we picked up from the animal home and weighing just six kilos, and then from a hot sky they blew him two steps and hurt him hard.
Our remorse cannot be put in words, because it is incomprehensible to us, where the fun is supposed to be with a cheap aggression against a small and helpless animal, which was naturally carried out on the line.
In addition, the suffocation that a woman who walked comfortably got when she wanted to justify these people because of the incident, she even feared for her own life, because if such a madman attacked a dog, he might also make the same thing with a woman, a child, an older gentleman or probably even with anyone who is weaker than himself.
The incident occurred in a normally quiet neighborhood at 5: 00 in the afternoon on a very common Tuesday.
The dog's been crying all day.
Of course, we have made an ad at a nearby police station, but we have great doubts as to whether this will bring anything at all and avoid any prejudice from the outset, we just want to make it clear that the cowardly criminals were Spaniards.
Our remorse about what happened has led us to show this incident.
We cannot understand what needs to be done in the heads of these young people, that they find a cheap attack on a helpless animal funny, on an animal that gives us love, society and friendship.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and people have remained.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the helmet
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, in cooperation with the Spanish Transport Safety Foundation (Fesvial), launched a campaign to promote helmet use, especially for the younger motorcycle drivers, as both companies announced today.
This initiative aims to draw attention to the importance of helmet use, as it is ultimately the only protective element that can prevent head injuries or even death in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is part of its commitment to transport safety, which "includes far more than just the design and manufacture of products that are becoming safer every day" and reiterated that they also contribute with other actions of educational and informative nature to getting this goal closer every day.
This new campaign to promote helmet use on the motorcycle, which runs under the slogan 'To be or not to be', will distribute posters at a first stage to more than 500 motorcycle workshops in order to achieve the best possible dissemination.
Finally, Michelin emphasised that transport safety is "a constant concern" of the company, and precisely because it always sees itself as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheel vehicles obliged to be one of its main objectives to develop ever safer products.
Sale of small trucks rises again
After almost two years, the car market for small carriers is finally starting to see some light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9.425 vehicles registered in Spain in November represent an increase of 12.6% in 2008, and, much more importantly, they are the first increase at all after 22 consecutive months with a steady decline, according to the figures presented by Anfac and Ganvam.
However, these good figures are currently only to be enjoyed with great caution as the reference data used for comparison in November 2008 was a particularly bad sales year with a 60% decrease in the previous year.
However, it must be borne in mind that, apart from the increase in the last month, the total figures of these 11 months are still 40% below the sales figures of the previous financial year.
Since January, a total of 95.853 vehicles have been sold, but in this number all vehicles comprising the small transport market are included: trailers of passenger cars, pickups, small transports, small trucks and lighter trucks / chassis.
Furthermore, the same clouds of thunderstorms are still in the sky, which are most affected by demand, because even though some of the vehicles are purchased by private individuals, the majority of sales to small and medium-sized enterprises that make purchases with third-party financing in almost 100% of all cases.
In this way, further factors must be included in these restrictions, which are the result of the revolving money of credit institutions, such as the increase in unemployment rates or the continuation of the poor economic situation.
With this panorama and in contrast to passenger cars, financial support has not helped in buying a vehicle of the plan 2000E.
However, this plan is not only intended for individuals, but also for self-employed and small businesses, if they want to buy a small transport of up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 emissions not exceeding 160 grams per kilometre, but the low sales figures speak for themselves.
Just yesterday Ganvam remembered that it was essential for the state to pay special attention to these small lorries as well as, of course, industrial vehicles (trucks and cars).
The automobile dealer association prophecies for 2010 a year similar to the one that just passed, for which it expects a 19% sales failure (for passenger cars and land cars).
Support for brake manoeuvres in critical situations is now mandatory
As was the case at the time with the ABS anti-blocking braking system and as it is now happening with the stability control ESP, the emergency braking aid systems must become mandatory in European cars.
In fact, they are already mandatory for all newly authorised passenger cars and light small carriers, and for the remaining vehicles a licence period was set until the end of February 2011.
The measure adopted by the European Union aims to improve the protection of foot-and-mouth workers, but these brake systems can also help to prevent many road accidents because of their operation.
The task of the emergency brake assistant is to exert more pressure on the brakes in the event of a critical brake manoeuvre which recognizes the system using the brake strength carried out by the driver on the brake pedal.
However, this system does not exert this pressure until the end.
According to a study commissioned by the component manufacturer for the Bosch vehicles, one third of the drivers involved in an accident did not have a chance to step on the brake pedal and half of them had not braked with full force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
On the other hand, the brake aid intervenes with maximum force in the braking system and thus reduces the brake time and thus also the brake distance that a car relieves during the braking process.
According to an EU study, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving foot-and-mouth damage could be prevented every year if all cars were equipped with this type of emergency brake assistants.
There would be even fewer accidents - one expects that every fourth accident could be prevented with personal damage - as soon as the so-called intelligent emergency braking systems become popular.
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system that detects (via radar or camera) obstacles and warns the driver, while at the same time exercising a light pressure on the brakes.
If the driver responds, the system will help him to increase pressure on the brake pedal if necessary.
If the driver fails to respond to the warning and even if the collapse is inevitable, the brake assistant exercises the maximum pressure on the brakes to keep the damage as low as possible.
General Motors shifts the plan for Opel until January
While the team of the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) has already been informed by Nick Reilly, the new chairman of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will start in the first April week, probably on the 8th, according to Javier Ortega, the American vehicle manufacturer points out that he needs more time to complete the rescue plan for Opel.
In fact, Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, wants the interested party to agree in advance on each single point of the plan.
And for this reason it may be that the final document, which will first be presented to the workers and then to the governments of the countries in which there are works, will be postponed by the beginning of 2010.
On the other hand, GM is assured that it will make a decision on Saab's sale in the next few days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish Government has increased the pressure on the American car carriage so that it can make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to be in contact with some possible new buyers.
One of these buyers could be Geely, who would also like to buy Volvo, but the option of the Dutch manufacturer of Skyper sports cars, which has backup from the Russian Converg group, is becoming stronger.
If none of these buyers were to reach an agreement, GM could sell some assets to the Chinese BAIC.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year, if it has not been sold until then, will continue to be maintained.
At the control of Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of their latest and very expensive jewels, the engineers used the Boxster S as the basis and really managed to make it easier by 80 kilo, which is now only 1,275 kilo to the balance.
In order to create something like this, they left 21 kilo alone on the automatic folding-up roof, which was replaced by a cellular roof with manual drive; thanks to the aluminum doors used in this model "disappear" another 15; by the removal of the air conditioning again 13; also, the fuel tank has been reduced from 64 to 54 litres, so that another 7 kilo has been saved; by the installation of sports Bacquet seats again 12 and with the light 19-inch rivers again five.
Then the absence of the audio system CDR-30 had again achieved six kilo less and the lack of kilo was achieved by the exchange of the door handles by fabric handles.
Although it is also available with the double coupling drive PDK, the test drive was carried out with a 6-standard hand drive, mainly on the smaller highways of California, on mountain routes that really passed very curved.
With his driving behavior, he can only be given the note without delay.
However, the reduction of his weight did not lead to the fact that he would no longer be so safe on the road.
It is more the opposite: for a long time now we have not tried such a small and easy model, which gives you a feeling of great safety in the curves, even at high speed.
He is a small athlete able to warm up his muscles at a low course in the necessary time until we give him the orders to race, to brake, to recover and then to get everything out of his engine again...
He does everything they say to him. The car does everything we suggest to him with our hands on the steering wheel, thanks to its steering, which is as communicative as well as precise.
And he's doing it with the precision of a surgeon.
A motor sound for all tastes
The sound of its V6 boxer with 320 hp (10 more than the Boxster S) has been extremely successful and can be increased by means of the 'sport' option as well as by means of a system that can change the engine noise that has already been used at the Panamera for the first time.
The acceleration capacity is unthinkable brutal, whether out of the stand or when reaccelerating.
The feathers are strong, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the land roads on which we drove with the boxster Spyder was already quite damaged, but the car mastered the battleholes well.
The electronic assistants had almost nothing to do on the entire route; and that, although we found some of these curves of ice in the morning gray and roller splinters in the morning.
In summary, you can say that it is an ultra-light car, a car with which you have an indescriptive passport, as otherwise it may be rarely and in it is much more than just a small improvement of the Boxster S.
The car will come on the market in February 2010 and cost EUR 70.831.
Bag Girl '
The singer, a bus friend of Karl Lagerfeld, is the face of the cosmetics line Coco Cocoon and an occasional starlight in the fashion look of 'maison', she presents her evil face with the same necklace as her bags of Chanel.
Much more than "Bad Girl" or "It Girl," she's a "Bag Girl."
The Bakonia gives itself a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral celebrated an excellent triumph with 82-91 in his visit to the complicated football field of Maccabi Electra, despite the many outstanding players in the team of Dusko Ivanovic, and thus comes to the first place within his group after the great performance of Mirza Teletovic, who was with eight triples the best of his team (29 at the evaluation).
The Vitoria team was able to replace the significant failures of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov by a large dose of deployment and team work, even if they had to wait until the bitter end for their victory.
The great hits out of the perimeter with 16 evaluated triple contributed to their final victory.
The game began with the leadership of the blue roots, which sat at the top of the display panel from the beginning.
Since the first four baskets of the team from Vitoria already came out of the perimeter, one could already imagine that they had come to the field with well-heated wrist.
They were English and Teletovic, who were mainly responsible for the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was hardly different, only that the team from Álava chose to play Barac insides and for the game of Eliyahu, who was received at his return to the team with whistles and applause, which is his home to further expand its advantage until the break (34-43).
Teletovic already began to highlight itself as the best of his team with 13 points, even if the "minus six" assessment of splitting had already imagined that this would not be the best evening of the Brazilian.
Nevertheless, despite the obvious advantage in the break, the game was not decided yet and the maccaians wanted to remind the Vitorians that not everyone wins on their field, and thanks to the constantly attacking "hand of Elías" they returned to play.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the "Yellow" turning the rowing (50-49).
More disadvantages
The team of Ivanovic, injured, but everything other than dead, had to prepare a few trains with matching security to get back air and with one of them suddenly came the gun of Mirza Teletovic, who with three almost consecutive triple and with the support of English and Ribas made sure that on the display panel a restoration distance was displayed again of (54-67) which the host was able to dispose of at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The Alavesen were blown in the last quarter and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already announced that they would not allow anyone to take away the victory they had earned in the first thirty minutes.
Nonetheless, Pnini and Eidson resigned, not the best of their team and tried to give their team power again by three points from the line (70-77).
Nevertheless, and although Splitter was set off because of Fouls, the team of Ivanovic did not give up, defended well and although the Israelis still picked up in the last minute (80-85), the game had already lost a winner and Tel Aviv for the first time in this season.
Injuries prevented Unicaja being offered the forehead
Unicaja lost loud in Greece against Olympiacos and had to take off the lead in the Euroliga Group B, and that in a game marked by the failures of Unicajas (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), especially in the interior game, which facilitated the Greeks victory.
The Málaga team was neither afraid of the mood in the hall of peace and friendship nor of the opposing team, which may be one of the strongest in Europe and possess a lot of money.
Thanks to their present game in the first quarter, Andalusians were allowed to begin dreaming. An aggressive defense and three consecutive three times, two of them by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, the host blinded with 12-18 in the 9th minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of Unicaja, even though the local team with an interior game between Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis made it possible that the display panel in the 13th minute 22-20 showed for its favor, the minute in which it would almost have come to battle between the two Americans Beverley and Williams because of an action and therefore both were disqualified.
The Greek team finally began to warm up and put its superiority on both sides of the game, while the disappearance of the English Joel Freeland due to an injury and the three self-caused mistakes of Carlos Jiménez left clear traces at Unicaja.
Among their players in the inner field and the Lithuanian predecessor Linas Kleizas, with its triple, they increased their advantage in the 19th minute to 44-32.
A pickup hunt was impossible
The third quarter was characterized by many attacks against the team of Olympiacos, which, despite its 19 losses, was superior and even managed to compensate the difference between the game performed in Málaga with 66-48 in the 27th minute, which in turn led the leadership within the group to fluctuate.
Unicaja tried to move beyond the many casualties and the exit of the injured shoots Robert Archibald during the game.
Despite the many drawbacks for Unicaja, in the 31st minute thanks to the leadership and the triple of Cook and the use of Lewis again came a little hope for 66-57.
Nevertheless, it was actually impossible because the Olympiacos, as soon as he attacked and showed its superiority with centimeters within the basket area, were not to brake.
The Croatian captain Nikola Vujcic managed to increase the basket difference to 81-62 in the 37th minute and Unicaja had to give up and the leadership had to resign to Olympiacos.
How much should you earn because of your profile on Facebook?
Facebook users can now learn their salary due to their new application, Trovit, the search engine with most ads of real estate, job offers and cars in Spain, which they should earn due to their profile.
The tool "How much should you earn?" calculates the salaries of users using more than 140,000 jobs offered by Trovit in Spain. Users are available a form in Facebook to enter their profession, professional experience, age and the city in which they work.
Already after a week after the application was available for the first time, the search engine found that the Spanish worker feels "badly paid on average," explains the person responsible for the Trovit product, Albert Ribera, in a press release.
The Spaniards are the worst paid according to the data that Trovit has through its search engines in Great Britain and France.
A British programmer receives an annual gross salary of 45.226 euros and a French of 31.059, unlike the 24,000 euros earned by a Spanish.
Consequently, a truck driver has an annual net content of 34.247 euros in England, 25.751 in France and 16.420 euros in Spain.
According to Trovit, the poorest paid work in Spain is a waiter with €11.592 net annually; followed by the work of a seller with €14.725 and of a worker with €15.667.
The most sought places on the Internet in the last three months are one driver, half-day places and social workers.
Brazil calls Zelaya a date to leave
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya's stay in its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The President of the Office shall leave the diplomatic representation no later than 27 January 2010when his mandate expires formally
Francisco Catunda, the trade delegate of the Brazilian Embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows that he must have left the message he had found since September 21.
"He is aware that he must leave on January 27th, as his mandate expires on that day and he must seek a new accommodation."
The station also quoted the ex-president, who confirmed his intention to leave the message before the scheduled date: "My position is to go as soon as possible, logical with the backing of the government of Brazil," Zelaya on the phone.
After the elections on 29 November (where Porfirio Lobo was the winner), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian Embassy until January.
However, this week he tried to get refuge in Brazil.
However, this failed in the refusal of Zelayas to recognise the status of an asylum-seeking politician who wanted to force the "de facto" government under the chairmanship of Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much!
After the most relaxing days since last spring, where the inflation of assets was the dominant mood on the markets, the uncertainty has returned to the markets again, which is not surprising in any case, since this is their natural state, in a context in which the brokers make decisions about a naturally uncertain future.
The measure used to stabilise the markets was to compensate the debts with the direct purchase of assets and to allow indirect liquidity free hands at interest rates moving around zero so that banks buy assets in this way to settle.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets are virtually finished and, without questioning their heterodoxious liquidity policy, start spreading some sand into the gear, as the BCE näc has already made with its annual auction next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without these heterodoxious measures and we are now witnessing a reverse in reducing risk premiums.
The fluctuations of the stock exchanges and the differences in the company bonuses are rising again, even though they are still far from the paranormal amounts they reached at the beginning of the year.
The States saw themselves forced to rule private risks and state debt increased again.
We are now relying on quality and the USA, Japan and Germany are the preferred place of refuge of investors, which in turn leads to an increase in the differences between the euro-zone countries with regard to Germany.
Spain has so far hardly been affected by this episode of instability, but then Standard & Poor's came and threatened with a new revision downwards regarding the evaluation of Spain.
On the other hand, a certain uncertainty does not harm the defenders of moral risk, who once again tried to raise awareness among those responsible for world economic policy, for what they had caused, because they had curtailed the devastating effects that led to the limitation of loans to the loss of jobs when they were supposed to decide on a new day of thanks.
Nevertheless, what happened in Dubai indicates a tribal war between the Emirates in order to restore the power in the Emirates and the development in Greece has been anticipated earlier.
A government that conceals government debt, elections and a new government that makes the same sense.
Prodi made it in Italy to Berlusconi and Sócrates in Portugal to Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense that Ecofin will save Hungary from the failure to comply with its foreign payments at the beginning of the year and thus allow a euro Member State to cease to fulfil its obligations.
On the other hand, it is logical that ECOFIN has forced the Greek Government to be transparent and to include its citizens in the need for exceptional measures in order to maintain the stability of state funds.
Yes, as expected, we are ahead of an episode of normalisation of risk premiums, after some extensions of too high amounts, that would now be within the expected range.
In the case of Spain, there is no need to worry as long as the differences in government debt increase at the same speed as European corporate bonuses.
However, if the European differences were to be reduced and the Spanish would continue to increase, this would be a special Spanish risk.
The one by Standard & Poor's is a farce. While the current preceding indicators force a large part of market research institutes to prefer their recovery scenarios and correct their 2011 scenario upwards, including the OCDE and the European Commission, which come back with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, all this does not promise a long lifetime despite warnings.
Once again, it seems that it is an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish shares, although at the moment "caution in driving."
Associated branches
The chairman of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, first met yesterday in Parliament's subcommittee, where the energy strategy for Spain will be debated in the next two decades.
After his appearance, followed by the Chairman of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press some points about what he had presented to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to the president of Iberdrola, Spain has to invest EUR 50 billion by 2020 and another EUR 60 billion from that date to 2030, subject to the precondition that current nuclear power plants continue to operate.
If this were not the case, the investment required would not be 60 billion, but up to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola believes that we should no longer invest in an increase in energy production capacity, but in distribution networks and international allies.
From 2020 onwards, the question will change and the performance should be increased.
His proposal focuses on both gas and coal plants with coal dioxide capture facilities and, of course, on renewable energies.
In this case it assumes that 18,000 MW is needed more, under the preference of course by other "support energies."
Galán, who believes that the draft text for a sustainable economy, which has just been adopted by the government, is in line with what his company has demanded, did not want to say anything against this law as to how to create incentives for national coal consumption, which would be exactly the opposite of all policies in the fight against climate change.
In his opinion, "in the long term, this direction is clearly set, despite some" individual "measures, as the president of Iberdrola mentioned.
If it is as it is, Galán believes that the decisions on investments should be taken already now, even if they are in the long term, as it will take some time and a stable remuneration framework must be created to tackle them.
Ferrovial gets the "handling" of Aer Lingus at ten airports
The subsidiary of Ferrovial for services at airports on the ground, Swiss Swissport, is the preferred partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus for the luggage service at ten European airports in which they are represented.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are some of the most important.
The agreement on which no figures have been announced so far is based on five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the government of Castile-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed yesterday a protocol on cooperation to create an innovation centre for intelligent infrastructure.
The alliance plans investments of 20 million to 2012, of which 50% will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be to study energy efficiency on motorways and airports.
Acciona is competing with high depth and bouygues for its first motorway construction in Australia
Acciona is fighting for the approval of its first motorway in Australia, a market in which they are already represented as energy and water companies.
The construction that it is about is a tunnel that will cost 1.7 billion Australian dollars (about 1,047 billion euros).
The French company Bouygues and the German high-depth are his competitors.
A 5 km long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the best opportunity for Acciona to establish itself in the country as a construction company and motorway operator.
The city administration wants to complete the construction by the end of 2014.
After the management of public-private cooperation (PPP is the English abbreviation) had decided to advance the project according to a business plan prepared by Ernst & Young, the administration is already in possession of a final list of candidates for construction and toll management.
In anticipation of the offers presented in May, the estimated investment amounts to 1.7 billion Australian dollars (EUR 1,047 billion), with three consortia, mainly of European construction companies, competing with each other at the last stage.
The group called Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first company is one of the largest construction companies in Australia, while the second is based in Italy, one of the best engineers in deep construction.
The team of Acciona joins the Northern Direct Consortium, composed of the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield, which is responsible for infrastructure and the French construction group Bouygues.
The third and last consortium, which is in the narrower choice, is called LBRJV, formed from the capital of the Australian Leighton (subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, which is part of ACS), the local Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the French company Razel, which specializes in public construction.
The Australian infrastructure market promises enormous construction and privatisation, but has a hurry to overcome, as only the purchase of a local construction company will give rise to access.
A strategy that has been followed by the above-mentioned companies high-depth or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, and which is still to be pursued by the Spanish giants.
Even ACP has obtained access to this market only by its participation of 30% in high depth, owner of the abovementioned Leighton.
Millions of assets
Acciona is of the utmost importance in this geographical area for the sector where it is already well known for its activities as a supplier of energy and in the desalination industry.
Among other assets, it already has its largest wind mill park (192 MW) in Victoria and the group of companies that was instructed to build and manage Adelaide's disposal plant with a budget of 700 million.
Its intention is now to consolidate itself in these two areas and to use these synergies to obtain access to the branches of construction and infrastructure.
The underground toll route, which is promoted by the Office for Infrastructure of the City of Brisbane and heated Northern Link (North Zubringer), has the aim of connecting the western motorway in Toowong with the surrounding road in Kelvin Grove (see map) at a length of 5 kilometres through tunnels. This is the largest measure of dust reduction on the streets of Brisbane.
The roadmap issued by the city administration foresees the award for summer 2010 and the start of construction work in December next year.
Although this toll line is already to be opened for traffic in the last months of 2014, it is assumed that construction works will continue until 2016.
The tunnel was designed in 2005.
It has two tracks in each direction, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The government of Queensland is involved in financing with 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros).
For high-depth Brisbane is ready for its big business.
Australia, which signed a treaty with the government of 154 million yesterday, is constantly forgiving considerable orders.
The ACP subcompany will improve the infrastructure of the domestic broadband network with glass fibre cable through its local subsidiary Leighton.
This improvement will create fast Internet access for 400,000 people and employ the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has received the King George Tower's construction project with 27 floors in the Australian city of Brisbane. The construction work has not yet begun and has received 129 million for it.
Also in the United Kingdom, in Manchester, it is competing with Laing O'Rourke for the construction and administration of two schools to 25 years.
The initial investment amounts to EUR 75 million.
FCC receives the order for a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC has achieved over its subsidiary Alpine, the construction of a tunnel over 2.1 kilometres long for a motorway in Slovenia over the sum of EUR 64.5 million.
The company received this contract only a few days after it had received the supplement for the construction work to extend the tunnel of Bosruck (Austria) over 130 million.
In this way Alpine strengthens its experience in tunnel construction.
The start of construction work is planned for the beginning of 2010 and its implementation will take over 32 months.
Sra. Rushmore receives advertisement from Renfe
Renfe has allocated advertising and marketing services for the next two years to the Agency Sra. Rushmore over a sum of about three million euros annually, the railway company informed.
In this contract there is also the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Sra. Rushmore was selected among 16 agencies that presented to this competition written by Renfe, of which 4 came to the final round, among them TBWA, who had been responsible for advertising in the last three years.
From now on, Sra Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
Penalty of over 63 million for France Télécom because of the distortion of competition.
France Télécom has imposed a penalty of more than EUR 63 million for anti-competitive behaviour in the Caribbean regions of the country.
According to the Authority, the telephone provider has limited competition in fixed networks and mobile phones by signing exclusive contracts, price plans and trust programmes for consumers at the edge of regulation.
Together with this penalty, the former French monopoly and still state company has collected more than EUR 560 million in penalties since 1994 for disability of its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday has even been increased because the authority that guards competition is of the opinion that France Télécom has committed similar infringements in the past and has therefore become reversible.
Application trade
On the other hand, the subsidiary of the French company has followed the example of other telephone providers and has opened an application page on the Internet to increase revenue from non-telephone transactions.
In principle, this Orange appointment website is active in France and the United Kingdom.
It is necessary to wait until 2010 until these seeds will also be available in other countries, such as Spain.
The game at the Champions League has introduced Madrid and Barça since the beginning of 476.4 million.
Since 1992, the Champions League has developed as a source of income for the football club.
So much that Real Madrid and Barcelona have since taken 476.4 million, which brings them the third and fifth place of the football clubs that have earned most money in the league.
Manchester United is the leader of this list.
Manchester United is the leader of this list.
The Champions League of the UEFA does not only bring glory. It is also one of the main sources of income from the large clubs.
According to UEFA, the League has distributed up to €5.362.5 million to 105 teams (of which 12 Spanish) who have participated in this event since its founding in the 1992 / 93 season.
Real Madrid and the F.C. Barcelona have benefited from this distribution.
The white club is located in the third place of Europe, which has earned most money through its participation and the only one who won the trophy three times next to the AC Milan.
The last winner of the former Europacup in 1992 is the official Catalan champion.
The list introduces Manchester United and Bavarian Munich, two teams who also took the most money through their participation in the previous Champoins League.
And that, even though they lost against Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only in the third place of the countries that could receive money through the champions, although it has more titles than everyone else (five, unlike four by Italy, three with England and two with Germany).
Distribution
This obvious contradiction is explained by the complicated money sharing procedure used by UEFA.
In this financial year, the organisation, whose chairman Michel Platini holds, expects an income of 1,090 million by the Champions League.
Of this money, UEFA provides 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 football clubs participating in the qualification curriculum (among them Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who struggled to participate received 3.8 million by their bloody presence, in addition to the EUR 550,000 for each game they fought.
There is also another bonus for winning (800,000 euros) and for an undecided (400,000 per team). The clubs that have come to the eighth final receive three million each; the four that have come to the quarter finals, 3.3 million each.
The last four get four million each.
The winner earns 9 million, unlike the second that receives 5.2 million.
Thus a football club receives at least 7.1 million and at most 31.2 million fixed revenues.
Barça again earned 2.5 million in August with his victory at the European Supercup.
However, there are still variable payments for which 337.8 million are planned.
This money is awarded proportionally to the value of each individual television market.
The Spanish is one of the first and has 4 seats allocated.
Last year's master receives 40% of the allocated money, 30% of the second, 20% of the third place and 10% for the fourth place.
The other part is distributed depending on the number of games they play in this year's edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million for 29.9% participation in Sos
The Nueva Rumasa group has sent details of the purchase offer of shares yesterday, with which it wants to acquire a ceiling between 25 and 29.9% of Sos's capital.
A percentage that does not force them to make a public tender (opa) due to the number of shares.
In concrete terms, Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 1.5025 per share paid to 10 years and with a rate of 1% annually due to this shift.
Yesterday, the Sos shares closed off with 1.85 euros, so Nueva Rumasa assessed the company 18% below the market value.
According to Nuevan Rumasa, the price of 1.50 Euro reflects the real evaluation of Sos.
The offer is associated with the appointment of eight of the 15 consultants.
The group from Jeréz gives shareholders a period of 15 days to inform them of their interest in the sale of their shares.
CNMV assured that it had not been informed of this offer, although the company Ruiz Mateos confirmed that it had come into contact with the Authority.
The deposit would be 611.7 million, while the value of Sos is 254.27 million.
In the meantime, Sos continues to restructure his management.
In attempting to remain on the edge of possible offers and the judicial crossings of his ex-managers, the brothers Jesus and Jaime Salazar announced the appointment of María Luisa Jordá as head of the internal audit.
A decision by which she becomes the first woman who has a high position in the food company.
It is a newly created post which is directly governed by the chairman of the group.
This is all but free from polemics because the company is involved in a judicial battle because of the suspicion of transmitting more than 230 million Sos to other societies of the Salazar family.
It cannot be ruled out that Sos will postpone further capital over the next few months.
With regard to Salazar's credit yesterday, the ex-consultants Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (CCM and Unicaja representatives) came before the National Assembly and confirmed that they had approved the postponement of 212 million without knowing their purpose.
CNMV approves the public Ausschlussausschreibung von Paternina submitted by the Investmentgesellschaft Mer
The National Stock Exchange Commission (CNMV) approved the public exclusion tender submitted by the Investmentgesellschaft Mer for Federico Paternina last 9 October.
The supervisory authority stated that it had approved this invitation to tender after it had been demonstrated that the conditions could be considered "sufficient 'to comply with the law and thus the content of the explanatory Supplement submitted, following the amendments made last 2 December.
CNMV has also announced that this offer aims at the acquisition of 550.008 shares by Federico Paternina at the price of 7.65 euros per share, which is in turn 8.95% of the capital of the company comprised of 6.142.786 euros in shares registered at the Madrid and Bilbao stock exchanges.
Moreover, it was also announced that 5.592.778 million shares were fixed, which could not in any way be transferred until the conclusion of the tender and whose price was fixed by Federico Paternina in accordance with the law.
New monitoring programmes for vehicles
In these days of weather and accidents not only deserve the KFZ workshops
Every day, thousands of vehicles involved in an accident will be dragged into the workshops where an expert has to assess the damage caused and the costs of repair.
No accident is the same and the calculation of costs for parts and hours of work can be a long and complicated task.
The calculation of repair costs of between EUR 20,000 and EUR 30,000 per hand, including parts and hours of work, may take up to two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the latest computer tools it is a matter of minutes
That is why almost 100% of the experts use this type of system.
Service and application providers for the assessment of accidents and repair shall collect the information they receive from manufacturers to process them thereafter and to offer them to their customers in the form of a useful programme.
In Spain, Audatex, part of the American Solera group, is the leader of the market; 80% of all opinions are produced with their products.
The two other companies that compete with the tool market for evaluation and preparation of a report are GtMotive and Eurotax.
The work with the data that the manufacturers make available is nothing but simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, sales manager of Audatex, 63 manufacturers and importers are working together, each of them making the information available in another format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed is becoming more and more large, up to the point that in the last five years more versions, variants and motorisations have come on the market than in the entire fifteen years before.
As soon as a new car comes on the market, the business begins.
It is a difficult task, because each individual of the Aberthousands of vehicle parts must be catagolized and its price entered.
In addition, each model produces a "intelligent" graphics image that allows you to "click" on different parts of the vehicle.
If this is a very sold model, work can be completed in one week if the procedure is progressing rapidly.
If this is a less common car, it can take up to three or four months. Currently, Audatex has 99.2% of the cars sold in Spain with full information.
Among the more exclusive models, for example, they have information about the Porsche models, but not about Ferrari or Lamborghini.
With regard to the road car park it is more than 99%.
For the purpose of carrying out the documentation work and the production of databases Audatex has eight centres distributed worldwide (Spain, France, Germany, the USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each of them has specialized in certain brands.
The national headquarters are in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There more than 100 technicians (usually mechanics specialists) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests €90 million each year in the development of these databases.
Every month they record 2.5 million data and their customers get the updates every second day.
The development of this enormous flow of information enables companies to use it in different ways and thus to offer different products.
The most common use is the use for repairs and repairs, but depending on the country there are also tools for the management of scrap parts or for calculating the error or residual value of a car.
The only company that informs a guide about the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer this offer in Spain, but in the United States.
When viewing the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get an overview of the type of support it provides to industry experts.
This company offers ten different tools, with the star of the products AudaPlus, a standard solution to monitor accidents for the evaluators.
It includes vehicles, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the costs of the parts, it shall contain the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the paint prices.
This tool is paid according to the purpose of use, i.e. for each opinion.
It will be the most expensive for customers who rarely use it to a maximum of ten times a month, namely 5.75 euros a month.
On the other hand, any insurance company that produces thousands of reports negotiates the price with Audatex.
With other products, such as AudaVIN, you can fully identify a vehicle and the equipment that it ran from the mounting band using the driver's seat number.
AudaGlass is dealing with the vehicle discs, and AudaSubastas is a service open to the specialist market on the Internet that can be offered for vehicles that have been declared to be a total damage.
Your statistical service is very useful in identifying trends, carrying out geodemographic analyses or for obtaining information on the variations by brand and model.
For example, it can be investigated how many models of a particular car brand had to be taken into the workshop because of pans or how many of them had been involved in a serious accident during a certain period of time.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of computer tools.
It distributes among other Gt estimates, which is also intended for experts and provides in the same way digital images, access to parts or prices and official working hours of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa group founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of damage, pans or maintenance of vehicles.
The GT leader for opinions is a reference product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Their business volume has increased by 20% per year over the last three years and sales amounted to 10.8 million euros in 2008.
At the beginning of last year they began to go on the international market with the opening of an office in Paris.
Audatex was founded in 1966 in Germany and founded in 1979 in Spain.

Since 2007 they have been on the New York Stock Exchange and part of the reference index Standard & Poor's.
Inauction of accident cars on the Internet
Last October, the Solera Autoonline group bought a platfom on the Internet for the sale of accident vehicles and motorcycles.
This purchase meant the payment of €59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could increase to the remaining 15% next year.
The purpose of this purchase was to offer its customers more services and value increase, with the possibility of accessing a huge international market.
This assessment and purchase service is exclusively addressed to industry professionals such as insurance companies, experts, car rental companies, workshops, scrap sites and car dealers who must be registered before their activities.
This platform was founded in Germany in 1996 and manages more than 650,000 operations throughout Europe, 500,000 of them alone in Germany.
Its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
Today, the website has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 experts.
Every day 3,000 ads are managed and 100 new ads are added to the Spanish market every day.
According to Spanish legislation, a vehicle whose driver's seat number has been logged off may no longer drive on the road, but certain undamaged parts may be used as spare parts.
In contrast, cars with historical value may be re-approved even if they have been logged out after difficult government walks.
Cost estimate of the workshop in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, Audatex ensures that the user receives a cost estimate in only four steps: identification of the vehicle, search for the spare part, making and making a cost estimate.
The easy handling of these systems is a prerequisite, especially to convince the elderly professionals who are usually more or less opposed to the use of these new computer techniques.
The database comprises 1,034 vehicles, 666 of which are passenger cars, 109 terrestrial cars, 137 motorcycles, 78 small vehicles and 44 trucks.
Of course you need a computer with Internet connection for use.
After the model to be repaired has been identified by the driver's position number, a graph of the model appears and the required spare part is then selected.
The user can include variables including the price of working hours, surcharges or discounts, and can then print the cost estimate and pass it on to his customers.
However, AudaTaller is not a tool for evaluation such as AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop-oriented does not include estimated working hours.
The cost of using this tool is EUR 350 per year, an amount which the customer can pay without delay.
At present the company Audatex is working to offer these images in three-dimensional format.
This is an innovation, waiting for automated mechanics for a long time, for example, because with it one can choose a door and then the picture can completely reverse to look at the inside.
