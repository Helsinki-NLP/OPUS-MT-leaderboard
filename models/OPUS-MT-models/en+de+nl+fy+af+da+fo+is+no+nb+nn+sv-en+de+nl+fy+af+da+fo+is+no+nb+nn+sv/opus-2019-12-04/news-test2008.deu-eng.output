Food debt to European inflation
The main reason for the increase in inflation measured in the euro area is the rapidly rising food prices.
In the 13 euro area countries, inflation was higher than expected in November - after 2.6 per cent in October, an annual inflation rate of 3.1 per cent was recorded, as reported by the EU Statistical Office in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts have been assumed of only 3 percent, reported Bloomberg.
Unlike the American, British, and Canadian central bank, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not reduced the central rate.
The ECB is striving to keep inflation below two percent, or at least close to the two percent mark.
According to an analyst, the ECB is in the twin mill: inflation has to be "settled" in order to exclude later action needs.
At 3.3 per cent, the inflation rate reached a 12-year record in Germany in November; in Spain the rate climbed from 3.6 to 4.1 per cent.
Responsible for the rise in inflation in the euro area are increased food and energy prices.
The MATIF wheat quotations increased by 88 percent, and the soybean price also reached a record level since 1973.
There was also a considerable deterioration in food oil and dairy products in 2007.
The world market price for crude oil rose by 52 per cent this year - last month the price per barrel of the black gold reached almost 100 US dollars.
According to the ECB, inflation will rise from 2.1% to 2.5% in 2008, but it is expected to fall to 1.9% in 2009.
For the next 3-4 months analysts are based on a 3% inflation rate, but the average annual rate is 2.1%.
For 2008, experts expect the ECB to reduce interest rates twice.
Gallup Resort Government Crisis
After long staggering, the number of Fidesz sympathizers has grown considerably by the beginning of December. For the first time since 2002, the party has had the largest base camp, while the approval for the socialists according to Gallup has reached a 13% depth that has never been reached.
With the party-loyal voters, the difference is clearly apparent thanks to the high determination of opposition supporters: more than two thirds (71 percent) are against one fifth (20 percent) approval for the MSZP.
According to the survey, MDF and SZDSZ are below the parliamentary entrance hurdle: they reach two percent in the total population.
The number of party voters has grown by one percent in both camps.
Compared to the last point of gravity, the general economic mood has further deteriorated - never before, the proportion of those who consider the country's economic situation to be "extremely bad" was so high (41 per cent), while another 46 per cent considers it "rather bad."
According to more hopeful prospects in spring and summer, the families see the change in their financial situation again more pessimistic.
For the next year, the majority of the population expects a further deterioration in the situation; only one tenth assumes an improvement.
A Gallup survey conducted in December showed that 71% of the respondents - a historical height - assessed the Prime Minister's work as "rather bad than right."
Thirteen percent of the respondents have great confidence or trust in Ferenc Gyurcsány in general, while the share of the advocates for Viktor Orbán represents 38 percent.
About 54% do not trust the head of government at all, compared with 27% mistrust against the party leader of the Fidesz.
One of the indicators of the political mood is the number of people who think that the dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister could be tackled even without a change of government.
After the disturbances last October, 35% of the government and the Heads of Government left, this proportion today amounts to only 20%, while the relative majority (33%) only sees the solution in new elections.
Asked for their interest in the referendum, 60 percent replied that they would "certainly" participate, and another 20% would make their vote "likely."
To compare: if the parliamentary elections were to take place this Sunday, only 55 percent would "safely" go to the clouds, another 15% consider their participation "likely." In view of these trends, the result of the referendum would be foreseeable.
74% would vote against the study fees, 79% against the practice fee, and 84% against the hospital daily allowance.
Converted to the group of participants in the referendum "with certainty" the shares of the opponents of study, practice and hospital fees would be 81, 84 or 89 per cent.
Auchan the most expensive, Tesco increased by almost a fifth
The hypermarkets in the Budaörs trading area also maintained this year the average price increase of 16% of last year, with the difference that there was no increase in VAT this year.
Articles from Napi Gazdaság
In the Budaörser Trade Triangle, the price of the usual Christmas orb of the "Napi" has also increased by 16 percent this year, but price increases of over 1,000 HUF were recorded in all hypermarkets.
Since prices in the food markets have been "galopped" last December, inflation has not fallen dramatically compared with the already high previous level of output.
However, it is certainly dissuasive for consumers that what they paid for last year was not even available for 10,000 HUF this year.
The price of the "Napi" shopping cart exceeded the magic 10,000-HUF limit by at least 91 HUF in the investigated markets.
The highest price was 10,573 HUF.
(In 6800 the price was 6800 HUF.)
Prices for Unicum and live fish remained close to previous year's level, whereas prices for Putenbrustfillets, nuts and monkey have increased sharply.
Prices for flour and bread correspond to the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, but there were 1kg of brooks for 139 forint in Auchan.
There was no competitive price collapse in the product below 200 forint.
Also surprising here was the price of a two litre of Coca-Cola Pfandflaska of less than 200 forint, so the drink including Pfand cost only 257 HUF.
However, this year in the "Napi" shopping cart comparison Auchan cut the most expensive, and Cora the cheapest.
Our calculations have shown that Cora has increased prices in the "Napi" shopping cart compared to Christmas prices last year by 15, while Tesco and Auchan each increased by 18 percent.
The difference between the cheapest shopping cart of the previous year and the most expensive of this year was 12%, while the increase between the cheapest shopping cart of the previous year and the most expensive of the current year was 21%.
The average price increase was HUF 1.480.00.
The average price increase in the previous year was 1.206.00 Forint, but the VAT increase was noticeable at the prices at last Christmas.
This is precisely the case where trade has aroused: it appears that the warehouses did not have the right to decide which price margin they should apply to each article, as the impact of the price increase on consumer behaviour was unforeseeable.
(If the dealer plans the speed of a product's circulation badly, it can fall for significant profits in the price margin based on traffic intensity.)
On the basis of VAT, the depreciation of the "Napi" shopping basket last year was so radical that the most expensive basket exceeded the value of 2006 by 1720 forint, whereas the price difference in the cheapest basket was only 844 forint.
This year such extremes were not observed as the most expensive basket cost 1,630,00 forint more than in the previous year, and even at the cheapest there was a price increase of 1,284,00 forint.
Compared to the last two Christmas seasons, a catastrophic price increase occurred, the price of daily consumer goods in hypermarkets rose by more than 30 per cent in less than 20 months.
(In turn, this does not necessarily confirm the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary: in some basic nutrients, the Statistical Office recorded an increase of more than 30% over the 12-month period.
In some cases beside flour also with eggs.)
However, if you take a look at the "Napi" shopping cart, this seems almost impossible at the latter, as the price level of the already expensive product in the previous year even in the worst case has increased by hardly more than 10 per cent.
Apparently, milestones are in a stronger position than the elephants - after all they were able to roll the dramatic price increase on the multis.
In the golden trade triangle, hypermarkets do not complain; it is constantly reported by good years.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three warehouses no longer look at the prices.
It is purchased from all the large quantities, sustainable food goes in pallets through the store.
Wednesday morning morning there were endless snakes in all three warehouses at the cashier, when suddenly the number of customers exploded.
However, a lower customer frequency is reported by the country, so many multis complain in opinion researchers that they could not even reach the planned turnover, not only in food but also in sustainable consumer goods.
Vielerort is saved on disinfectants
More than a thousand infections were recorded in hospitals due to inappropriate treatment of antibiotics.
The hygiene conditions in the hospitals, the overlay of the beds, the overload of the staff - all factors that are not exactly beneficial to the elimination of infections, according to the senior physician of the National Epidemiology Centre.
Many places are also saved in the disinfectants.
A MRSA infection has recently been diagnosed in the János Hospital Traumatology Department.
Bacterium resistant to antibiotics was found in a male patient who was introduced to the hospital after a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year, there was a similar infection here.
The injured of a serious car accident was released from the hospital, but a little later the man had to return with a MRSA infection. An important operation has not been carried out since then because of the bacterium that is still in the patient's body.
By 10 December this year, 1094 infections caused by multiresistant pathologies from hospitals have been reported to the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System, according to the senior physician of the National Epidemiology Centre, Karolina Böröcz.
So many infections caused by multi-resistant agents have been recorded in hospitals with certainty, but the dark figure is likely to be higher.
About two-thirds of the infections (683 cases) were triggered by MRSA, the Staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin oxacillin.
The Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria carries about a third of the people in their nose without causing a disease.
SA-related infections (such as throat inflammation, almond inflammation, skin inflammation or wounds) usually respond well to antibiotics, they are well healed.
However, if the agents are too high dosed or inappropriately used, the responsive bacteria are derived from antibiotic resistant substances which spread rapidly in hospitals under appropriate conditions.
In particular, in patients with weakened, or permanently ineffective immune system, but also in elderly, or in patients with low body weight, these bacteria may cause severe infections such as wound infection or blood poisoning, i.e. sepsis.
According to the medical director of the János Hospital, the MRSA infection is nothing special, such incidents are part of the hospital's everyday life.
You should not confuse the infection with the epidemic, Tibor Nyulasi - MRSA only did not exist where it is not wanted.
Resistant to antibiotics
"Such patients are isolated, the nursing staff wear rubber gloves and masks in the supply, and we have the antibiotics necessary for treatment" - says Tibor Nyulasi.
While patients are investigated for MRSA when they arrive at the hospital, infection cannot always be avoided.
Sampling too rare
The majority of infections caused by MRSA in hospitals would be avoidable, but the current conditions and circumstances would be unfavourable for the control of the emergence or spread of the multiresistant virus, says Karolina Böröcz.
As this infection predominantly occurs in hospitals and old-age homes, the Spitäler should investigate the patients who have received it and isolate immediately MRSA infected patients.
However, in Hungarian hospitals microbiological sampling is not practiced so often.
Not least because there are no subsidies from the State Sickness Fund for this investigation.
Most cases therefore come to the daylight only if the patient has a noticeable MRSA infection, according to the medical director of the epidemiology centre.
There are strict recommendations from the European Union on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine, but there are also guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and pathways in Hungary.
Antibiotic therapies should be targeted, that is, microbiological investigations are necessary in order not to be resistant to the medicine, but this directive is not always respected by hospitals.
Among the ambulants, or patients in basic care, microbiological sampling was even more rare, according to Karolina Böröcz.
The disinfectants are separated
Scientific evidence demonstrates that MRSA is transferred from one patient to another most frequently by nursing staff.
This is precisely why it is important to wash hands, or to wear gloves and masks, but there are also significant shortcomings in hospitals in this area.
MRSA is transmitted by dropping infection or contact, but in the domestic hospitals there is not always the possibility to isolate the infected patient.
The rooms are even often overfilled, the beds are very close to each other, although there should be a distance of at least 1.5 meters between them from a epidemiological point of view.
As Karolina Böröcz further points out, unfortunately, in the financially less well-placed hospitals it even happens that disinfectants are saved, there are few nurses, many patients - all factors that directly promote the emergence of infections.
Such infections are proven to be far less common there, or the further spread of the virus can be stopped where these protective measures are complied with, according to Karolina Böröcz.
Government programme against MRSA
To get MRSA infections under control causes the health insurance to cost enormous costs, so they are being fought everywhere.
In England, for example, the prevention of MRSA, or its limitation, was contained in the government programme.
According to first signs, the programme is successful - as published data demonstrate, the trend of MRSA infections in England has fallen.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) has declared the prevention of the emergence of multiresistant agents (including MRSA) and the prevention of infections in hospitals to be one of its priorities.
Death Lenker Chief wasn't drunk
In the case of a fatal car accident caused by the Chief of Police of the XXII District, the official opinion is now available.
The now resigned Chief of Police of the XXIIth District, who killed a pedestrian on Tuesday in a car accident, was neither alcoholized nor under drug influence, said Attila Morvai, the press spokesman of the Budapester Supreme Attorney General on Friday after the official opinion on the case was submitted.
The report confirmed the results of the first investigation, according to which the chief of police had not consumed alcohol before he was in charge.
The former chief of police with his own car in the XXIIth district into the Kossuth Lajos street and ran over a 55-year-old man who crossed the road in an unmarked place.
(According to StVO, however, this is not a mildering circumstance - the steering driver has, even though pedestrians do not cross the road on the Zebrastrap, backup.)
The pedestrian was injured after his arrival in the hospital.
According to police reports, the driver suffered a shock, then restored his functions and asked for retirement.
The Budapester Public Prosecutor has initiated her investigation into the incident.
In addition, Attila Morvai mentioned that the former chief of police had cooperated with the investigators from the beginning.
EUR 400 million further for infrastructure
Finance Minister János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) signed three loan agreements in Budapest on Friday, worth EUR 400 million. The money is to flow into education, transport and environmental infrastructure and energy economy.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a €300 million framework for the financing of transport and environmental projects implemented with grants from the Cohesion Fund. The loan agreement of €200 million was signed earlier, with the current agreement on the use of the EUR 200 million lent.
The sum of EUR 150 million agreed in the loan agreement will also be spent on the budgetary financing of educational projects.
The EIB has granted a total of EUR 300 million for this purpose to Hungary; the use of the remaining EUR 150 million will be decided later in the context of the extension of the loan contract.
In the field of innovation, the contractors have signed an agreement of EUR 50 million, which will mainly flow into research and development programmes at the University of Debrecen.
At the meeting also the U-Bahn Line 4 was discussed.
It was agreed that as soon as Hungary has clarified the details of metro financing with the EU, the original contract and any modifications will be discussed again.
According to János Veres, this would be possible in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed 113 projects totalling EUR 8.4 billion in Hungary.
The borrowings are committed to EURIBOR, the loan is made available by the EIB with a suspension of 8 years, without commission.
Bulgaria, the EU Real Estate Paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is fantastic - all over Europe looks closely at the previously rarely mentioned Balkan state.
What, where, and who still buys the cheapest market in the EU, but which becomes faster expensive?
An analysis of the Bulgarian Re / Max Division.
Bulgaria is undoubtedly currently the most desirable patch for real estate purchases in Eastern Europe, with cheap ski apartments and houses at the sea.
Between the mountains, the regions Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are among the most popular, at the sea are Albena, the "golden coast," the "sun coast," and the historical cities Sozopol and Nessebar the races, but properties around Kavarna and Balcik are increasingly needed.
According to Re / Max Analysts in Bulgaria, the interior of the country is also attracting investors, such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, and Triavna, and also the extremely favorable area of Russia record more buyers.
The capital Sofia also offers attractive offers - commercial and office surfaces offer the highest yields.
Bulgaria is on the best way to become one of the most attractive European golf paradise, thus attracting tourists next to the summer and winter season in the other two seasons.
Prospective investors therefore already buy in in a large style now, for example around Bansko.
According to analysts, people who purchase real estate in Bulgaria also seek to change their lives.
Most buyers are English, but there are also interested people from France, Belgium, Spain, and more and more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present, while there are mainly Russian buyers in the Black Sea and ski areas.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re / Max Bulgaria.
Those who want to settle down either buy revitalized properties by 50-100,000 euros, or down houses by 5-15,000 euros, which they renovate themselves.
Good connectivity and accessibility as well as communication opportunities are widely written, but also the proximity to a large city, shops and doctors are crucial for the buyers.
The second category includes those who are looking for a holiday home (Bulgaria was listed under the top ten holiday destinations of the Germans in December).
The third group consists of businessmen investing in medium to long-term value increases.
Real estate in the capital, however, is becoming increasingly expensive due to the growing demand.
In the EU, although real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria, there has been an increase of 21 per cent annually over the past five years.
The increase in real estate prices is far above the increase in salaries.
Fodor and the six Hungarian percentages
As Minister for the Environment Gábor Fodor announced, the expert meetings will end on Tuesday, and the debate on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue by ministers on Wednesday after the official opening.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries are consulting on the Bali Roadmap, setting emission reduction measures for the post-2012 period, i.e. after the end of the Kyoto Protocol.
There is currently a serious debate going on between industrialized and developing countries.
The US has already indicated that they do not want to negotiate concrete figures, but they would be willing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990.
The other major question of the conference is whether the industrialized countries are prepared to support both financial and technological development countries in addition to reducing emissions.
An agreement has also been reached on support for developing countries.
The Adaptation Fund under the Kyoto Protocol is to be managed by a 16-headed Council, expected at the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF), as can be seen in the Piac és Profit.
Hungarian Six Percent
Environment Minister Gábor Fodor, on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU's efforts to maintain its leading role in global climate protection measures and to achieve a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister stated that the EU would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020 (in terms of 1990 values), whether or not the "Agreement after 2012" will be achieved; the Union would even be willing to engage in a 30% reduction, as other major industrial countries in the world, or developing countries are also willing to fulfil their obligations in a strong and responsible way.
Gábor Fodor stressed that the objective of the countries which had joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 was only a 5.2% reduction, while the EU had already committed itself to a minus of 8% with its 15 Member States at the time.
The target for Hungary is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6% compared to 1985-87 - a target which the country will fulfil, as can be seen in the Ministry of the Environment Press Release.
The commitment is high on Bali - the long-term international climate policy agreement must be completed within two years, otherwise it would certainly not enter into force after 2012, and in this case the reduction projects set out in the Kyoto Protocol would not follow a new international emission reduction system, whose importance has also been highlighted by the IPCC, the UN's International Scientific Climate Change Committee, which is excellent with the Peace Nobel Prize, in its recent report.
This would delay the emission reduction and the increase in the average temperature of the earth by more than 2 ° C would be inevitable, which, according to scientists, would result in extremely serious and irreparable consequences.
British Army throws on YouTube
British army units have published recordings on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan to increase popularity on the video site.
First of all, the British Air Force (RAF) YouTube has discovered itself: Special Units stationed in Afghanistan are downloading videos of operations conducted against the Taliban since March 2006, reports the BBC.
The photographs of miniature cameras on helmets are checked at the Kandahar Air Force Basin and then sent to London where they are placed on the Internet.
Political message inevitable
Soldiers of the Air Force have already contributed 139 such recordings, their "channel" has been viewed more than 75,000 times.
The British Ministry of Defence was registered under "Defence Headquarters" in spring 2007 to publish videos of Iraqi and Afghan operations, but also the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Commonwealth Office) and the international peace forces (MNFI) stationed in Iraq have their own YouTube channels.
Operation in Afghanistan
Originally, the Air Force has published the videos with the aim of recruiting soldiers, and as the Ministry of Defence says, the contributions also serve the purpose of informing the people about the actual objectives of foreign operations.
Such a type of published propaganda is almost free of charge compared to conventional television advertising, according to defense experts Gordon Mackenzie to the BBC, but these videos always carry a certain degree of political embassy, as they confirm the existence of the military measures decided by the government in their own way.
Americans advertise with game
However, the army must also fight against amateurs, which, in addition to carefully processed, censored recordings, also create in the network - such as those that show the death of the soldiers: in the somewhat hypocritical, "official" propaganda films, the most talk is about the losses, but the bloody sides of the war are not shown.
By the way, many of the war scenes in Iraq and Afghanistan have already been uploaded to the platform, but this "genus" has only recently been discovered by the British.
However, the Americans advertise in the somewhat different way, namely with the free downloadable shooting game "America's Army," in which the player can slip into the soldier's skin in the context of a more or less vibrant simulation.
Christmas celebration with Tombola and Pogatsche in the ministries
Labour Minister Mónika Lamperth is nowhere curious: instead of a Christmas celebration, she organises a working conference in which her employees can switch coffee and pogatsche in 2007.
Some ministries celebrate with live music, other magic Christmas mood with Tombola or blow into the civil service hearts.
Party, Christmas mood, concerts and buffet - so the power celebrates.
Christmas fever has already captured the offices.
The largest Christmas celebration of a ministry will be held today in the defence resort, but the ministry staff are not expected to do so.
At the "Christmas celebration of the orphans," children are acknowledged by fallen soldiers, and at the "Mission celebration" family members are recruited by currently seconded soldiers abroad, but there is also a reception for the press.
The resort provides some 25 million for the celebrations.
Compared to other sites, the National Agency for Development (NFCs) and the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport are proposing the strands.
The 4.32 million forint-expensive Christmas celebration of the Ministry of Economic Affairs will be held in the House of the Future, about 350 of the 600 employees are expected.
The focus of the celebrations is on Christmas, but there will also be live acts and a tombola salvation.
The National Agency for Development (NFC) held its 4.7 million forint-expensive Christmas celebration on Wednesday at the House of the Country Council (OIT), with concerts and a feast.
The lease was 1 million forint and the rest was spent on the more than 400 invited guests.
According to our information, a NFC department is also invited to another Christmas celebration organised by the Hungarian Economic Development Centre (MAG Zrt) from EU funds.
For the celebration the building of the Lustspieltheater ("Vígszínház") was rented.
MAG Zrt has not confirmed this information because we have not reached the competent persons.
What's the suit for?
The OIT building was open not only to the NFCs' guests, but also to the Ministry of Justice and Police, which held the Lucia Ball there instead of a Christmas celebration on December 7.
They did not have to pay rent to the OIT for the use of the premises.
About 500 visitors came to the ball.
The celebrations were opened with a speech from the minister, after dinner there was live music to dance.
At the request of [origo], it was communicated: there was no ball dress or attraction obligation on the ball.
The ministries for health, work and self-government are preparing for puritan celebrations.
The Ministry of Health organizes the celebration for employees in their own four walls for about 400,000 forint.
Labour Minister Mónika Lamperth officially invites her employees not at all to a Christmas celebration, but to the annual conference.
One expects about 180 guests who - according to the press department - only receive coffee and pogatsche, the celebration will take place with 350,000 forint.
Self-administration Minister Gordon Bajnai will simply take up with his colleagues only in the ministry's Aula.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) organizes a Christmas celebration in its own festival room, to which 436 employees are expected.
The expenditure was measured at 2,500 forint per head - for this money there is a buffet reception with subsequent shooting.
Since the beginning of the term of office of János Veres, the PM staff celebrate every year in this way.
However, there will be no proper party mood - not only because of the official speech of the Minister, but also because the party was set up for the afternoon.
On 20 January the Ministry of Agriculture invites you to a New Year's reception, this time the ministry's Christmas celebration is off.
One invites the one hundred guests to the Vajdahunyad Castle in the city park ("Városliget"); according to the information of the resort the expenses are measured with 1,000 forint per guest.
As the press department reports, it will be a very simple reception to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be charged.
The receipts that are held every year traditionally begin with a brief speech by the Minister and sound out with restrained dirt.
As the relevant press offices report on [origo] request, there will be neither a Christmas celebration at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs nor at the Ministry of Education.
Asked at the cost of the Christmas celebration, no information could be given to the Ministry of the Environment Press Department.
In any case, more than 400 guests were invited to celebrate at the art industry museum.
More and more forces mobilised for giant strike
The League Trade Unions and the Hungarian Trade Union Federation form on Friday their Coordination Committee for the uncertain duration of the strike begun on Monday.
On Saturday a protest general meeting will be held, on Monday - on the day of the referendum on the health insurance law - the establishment of work starts.
Strike-related, significant obstacles to transport are expected, as rail transport is almost completely discontinued, and the Budapester public transport companies (BKV) also reach until 13 a.m.
Details of the strike on Monday will be announced jointly by the League Trade Unions and the Trade Union Federation on Friday afternoon.
A LIGA - MOSZ strike committee is also set up, which is responsible for coordinating the actions on Monday.
On Saturday, a protest general meeting will be held, and from Monday all the organisations that joined the strike will bring down the work for an indefinite time unless agreement is reached with the government.
In other words, the end of the strike starting on the day of the parliamentary vote on the health insurance law was not defined.
If the National Council does not adopt the Health Insurance Act, the trade unions immediately withdraw the call for strike.
However, if the law is adopted, the stakeholder committees will meet to discuss further action.
On the basis of the agenda of the National Council on Monday, it is even possible that the vote on the health insurance law will take place in the late evening or at midnight.
The strikes that begin on Monday will have to be expected to have significant traffic barriers: Railways will put down their work for an indefinite time, in the morning the majority of public transport and more than half of the Volán companies remain silent.
At the same time there will be many motorway blocks in a direction.
The call for strike has been followed by numerous trade unions and civil organisations - the list of participants is updated on the Liga website.
Some organisations announced strikes for an indefinite time, others plan temporary work settlements.
By Thursday afternoon, no agreement has been reached between the Hungarian Railway MÁV and the Free Trade Union of the Railways VDSZSZ, although just around Christmas holidays more and more people are on their way by the Railway.
According to previous reports, the BKV is streamed from start-up to 13: 00 a.m., at Budapest Airport between 7 and 9: 00 a.m., the LIGA trade unions for electricity and heat energy are putting down work for four hours, and the teachers' union, for example, called for 2 and 2-8 hours of strike.
The Hungarian Association of Doctors has an alternating nationwide range at different times, the EDDSZ, the Democratic Trade Union of Workers in Health and Social Affairs, a suborganisation of the SZEF, the Trade Union Cooperation Forum, holds a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four points demanded by the League is that the government withdraws the draft health insurance reform and submits a new concept for social discourse.
The second requirement concerns the gradual introduction of the new pension calculation model, which will be due from next year.
Request number three is that the eligible professional groups will be allowed access to early retirement before 2010.
The fourth point is that the VDSZSZ belonging to the League Trade Unions has not accepted the offer submitted by the Ministry of Transport on the side lines and now calls for a new approach.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard increases state risk
According to the Risk Analysing Division of Political Capital, the activities of the Hungarian Guard established in August with the support of the "Movement for a Better Hungary" increased the risk of Hungary and the region in several respects.
Among other things, the Institute's risk warning report states that, in connection with the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the highest political risk is the "tightening up of the existing ethnic tensions between the Gypsy and non-Gypsy population in Hungary, which could even lead to violent ethnic conflicts in the short term."
The main reason for this is the Hungarian Guard's strategy, which is likely to aim to provoke such a dispute, according to the Research Institute.
As reported, this is seen as a failure from the political leaders: "People of public life have left the discussion of the Roma question to representatives of radical political groups that have now built their political strategy on the Roma-Hungary contrast."
It is suspected that this would exacerbate the problem, make reasonable dialogue impossible, promote extremities, and increase the likelihood of violent conflicts.
The research institute also believes that the activities of the Hungarian Guard, not least thanks to the enormous attention of the domestic and foreign media, "have" seriously damaged the image of Hungary abroad, especially as regards confidence in stability and democratic maturity. "
We remember: Since autumn 2006, the reorganisation of radical and extreme right-wing groups in Hungary has been continuously recovering, so several "national self-defense associations" have been established since summer 2007.
"These groups are common that they each define themselves as a civilian organisation, while openly praying to prepare their members for defence tasks (civil protection, national defence, orderkeeping), with the call for the inconvenience of the police, the army, or the state itself."
And so on: all of this happens according to the method that attempts to tarnish various political aspirations, based on the political and party affliction of the population, as a civil initiative.
The emphasis on the civilian character and the form of association is therefore not only intended to circumvent legal obstacles which could arise in the course of registration in court - it is also a political strategy.
As can be seen from the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guard represent a risking factor for relations with neighbouring countries as well.
"In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been quoted as a potential source of danger in several neighbouring countries, so some ultranationalist politicians of certain neighbouring countries see in the creation of the Hungarian Guard the confirmation of their own anti-Hungary policy.
All of this has an impact on the political stability of the region, "he said.
From the point of view of the Institute of Research, the creation of the Hungarian Guard is not a single phenomenon in Central Eastern Europe, so the political risk for the whole region has grown.
As reported, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are comparable to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose foundation was announced by the Bulgarian National Union (BNU) in August 2007.
In the context of the development of the Bulgarian Guard, Roma mass exits took place in a district of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU has taken the incidents into account as a reason for the creation of the National Guard, arguing that the aim of the organisation of "national protection."
In their view, in the past 17 years, there has been a regular "gypsy terror" in Bulgaria, but the state remained untouched and indifferent - so political capital.
Furthermore, the initiative would have launched a vigorous debate in the Bulgarian public.
As I said, the increased risk of ethnic conflicts is also demonstrated by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organisations have announced to set up their own guards for resistance purposes.
Since the activities of the Hungarian Guard have so far shown many similarities with those of the Bulgarian National Guard, it is not excluded that the Hungarian Roma also react with organising their own protection to the threats, it is said in the Political Capital Risk Warning Report.
Attila Juhász, Research Director at Political Capital said at the request of the news office: the risk analysis is one of the activities of the Research Institute.
Each year risk analysis reports will be published and if risk-changing trends are detectable, public opinion will be informed, as in the case of the issue of the risk warning report.
Feast days are not everywhere holidays
In Hungary, holidays are legally regulated, so the practice of changing working days around holidays has now been established, but the next year will give us fewer such days.
In the EU and America too, something else is understood under "holidays."
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between public holidays and working-free days.
Working-free days are mostly church holidays, or are related to important historical events.
For example, we also celebrate New Year: both the last day of the old and the first day of the new year are working-free days - the latter alone so that the New Year celebrations can rest.
All year round we have fourteen holidays.
The state holidays are March 15, which remembers the revolution of 1848 and October 23, the day of the 1956 revolution.
On 20 August, the state foundation, on 1 May the work celebrated, we will remember our dead on 1 and 2 November.
There are also two holidays for Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
Since our state, national or religious holidays rarely fall for a weekend, the practice of "working day shift" has proven itself in cases where we would only work one day before or after the holiday day.
However, the price of the extended weekends is that we have to work very well on the Saturday before that, or go to school.
When this day, which falls before or after the holiday, is ultimately to be completed, the Minister of Labour has for long years been laid down in its own regulation.
The legislation applies equally to all employers and employees, public servants and civil servants.
Except for companies and facilities in which the operation is continued without interruption, that is to say on the holidays.
The rules of work are only somewhat confused by the holidays at the end of the year: from 24 December, life remains formal here, as most for the days between Christmas and New Year's Time Compensation, or the special vacation for which it has been cancelled.
Next year more holidays will fall into the middle of the week, or to the end of the week, so there will be fewer changes in the working days than this year.
The calendar will first be "put on the head" around the day of work, so that people can stay at home four days at a time.
Saturday April 26th will be a working day so that Friday May 2nd can be a rest day.
The second relocation is related to the holiday on October 23rd: on Saturday, October 18th you will have to finish Friday, October 24th in advance.
However, the end of the year will remain in the sign of holidays, after everything will lie and remain from 24 December, even if New Year falls to one Wednesday.
Six dissuasive little things to annoy colleagues
E-mails that we forget to send, language messages that we never get - harmless lies that no longer notice us: they bring "color" to everyday life at work.
The question is just whether to get used to these little inconveniences, or better face the challenge and try to avoid these misunderstandable, for other annoying situations consciously.
Tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you someone called from the marketing department" - says a colleague.
That it missed a meeting?
At least one regrets it and tries to make it right again by perhaps calling the marketing department and confessing again that one forgot to send the message (that is the less common method).
It's mostly done with an apology.
Before making embarrassed excuses, you should think about what can really create unpleasant moments for your colleagues and try to avoid these situations consciously.
Lent something that doesn't belong to yourself?
There's hardly anything more annoying than grabbing a document, office accessories, or the phone, but it's not there.
Yesterday the bookmaker was still on the desk - this morning it's gone?
Or is the lost bullet pen discovered on the desk of a colleague?
Without questions, we should not lend ourselves anything from colleagues, because they are rightly upset when they find that something has escaped.
So, no envelopes or post-it from the office in the pocket, because it could hit you yourself: none more if you need it urgently.
Crushing about colleagues' private life?
There is no effective means of stopping a shake that has already been put into the world.
Who did with who, what?
Where and why?
The information (or assumptions) about the personal life of colleagues should not be bound to everyone's nose if possible!
And if someone opens up and tells us his inner secret, we should not abuse this trust!
It is best to be silent as a tomb instead of directing those who are not present, even if others also know about the problems of the colleague.
For no reason reported sick?
If you call in the office to be sick, calling for tormented headaches, because you are feeling uncomfortable or just trying to rest, you should be aware of one thing: your own work, unstoppable achievements, projects with fixed dates must now be done by colleagues instead of yourself.
So don't play with the colleagues badly!
If you already know that you will not get to the office the next day or that something could come between you and me, why you have to stay at home, you should report it in time so that neither the colleagues nor the boss are unexpectedly confronted with the absence.
Summons, Gekicher, Telephones
You're deeply involved in your work, but are you suddenly disturbed by the loud guitar of the colleagues?
Unwanted to hear a phone call that you shouldn't have heard?
You should not annoy colleagues with sums, singing, loud conversations (which you lead over their heads), scratching, persistent chimp or nails.
This can all be very disturbing, even if they are not deepened in a task (writing, planning, organizing).
Is it always the other ones who blame you?
If a project is not completed in time, one has forgotten to send an important letter or an important message, one should not seek the fault of his own forgetfulness with others!
If possible, you should not talk about the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues!
It is best to admit its mistakes and apologize if others were affected!
The question of how to make up for the mistake or retrieve the failure is just too appropriate!
In the office - a feeling like at home?
Training pants and slaps: comfortable for home, but has not lost anything in the office!
Not even then should you dress up like that if it were actually allowed to work!
Just don't get too sloppy - you should respect both your colleagues and yourself so that you get dressed in the office properly - if you want, also pretty and elegant!
To make it right for everyone - or how to become uninteresting for others
Stop and go-traffic, the car in the middle of the morning.
From the radio, a strange melody: the sound of a violin, coupled with electronic effects.
I'm turning the volume higher.
The pace is changing, to the previous sounds comes the bass, and as a real sound bubble a female choir.
It is the song "Wings of Love" by Zagar, which explains on mr2.
The local music scene has not just spoiled us with a high-quality Electropop for a long time.
But now you even see the stock differently when you hear the new album of Zagar.
The appearance of Yonderboi, so some new and exciting production from the local digital underground scene slowly contributes to a change in the overall image, and even if the garagerock with its guitar quitch is "in," which proves domestic electrotropop: there are new things under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started in Pécs, musized himself in the band Yonderboi, before he - perhaps because a hostel can't tolerate two pipes - began to take his own path.
The breakthrough with his project (Zagar) and his music that melts elements from Jazz, Electronic, and Pop, however, did not succeed until the request to compose the soundtrack to a film had come to him (e.g.
"Szezon" by Ferenc Török).
The formation, which had originally occurred in smaller clubs, was only known to the wider audience when the magazine "w2" retired its first album from 2002 under the top 50 local albums and Zagar, along with Yonderboi, shortened to almost the only trend set that could be marketed in the West.
Without doubt, Zagar and his band were "trendy," but no one cared if they would like to wear this brand.
The band has responded as it should: with a new, even better album.
The new album now released with the title "Cannot Walk Fly Instead" could open new ways to them, but the title already expresses the desire for continuity with the Pécser years.
The expression came from the time when Balázs Zságer was still on the way with another band.
The airy, flying play would also be fine, but besides the essential character of music, the noisy guitar, the influence of Rock'n'Roll - the time spirit and the trends corresponding.
With these songs, György Ligeti, who lives in England and works with the band "The Puzzle," has introduced himself to the Millenáris premiere.
A song from the album even made it to the radio chasing camp - which has been sending mr2 Petőfi from early to late pop music to the auditors with the number "Wings of Love," which has been recorded with the participation of six domestic singers ("Underground Divas"), suczessive set the earworm.
So you're all right (?).
The hvg.hu asked at Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new hit raises the question: How far does your music remain reserved for a certain layer?
Balázs Zságer: The term "layer music" does not mean much to me.
In my opinion there are two boxes in pop music, not mainstream and underground, or alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even the so-called alternative or underground music can be silent and nonetheless, but they can also be produced only for the sale that makes them commercial music.
A good pop number can also come from an honest motive.
The readiness of the hearing also works according to this principle, independent of languages and national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audience of your music?
B. For example: In abroad, especially west of us, pop music has a larger tradition.
There are not only teenagers or thieves on concerts, but also the older audience.
They follow the trends in pop music that happen around them much more attentive, because they also consider them part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the audience play in your work?
Does it matter who, where, how many hear your music?
B. B.: Of course it is a good feeling to see that more and more come to our concerts.
But we've never compiled for the market.
With us, music is not created to serve a purpose, but for a particular reason.
The role of the audience is generally felt in the concerts, where there is already a mutual interaction, but that is in turn only in the untouchable changes in the moment.
Yet I noticed one thing: if you want to make it right to everyone, you're no longer interesting.
hvg.hu: How far do you want to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He is on his way as a soldier and has built his career in the West.
B. B.: We don't really go his way, apart from trying to interpret this again and again in our music.
We see ourselves more as a team player who trusts the musical presence of the other and let them develop.
At first, of course, comparison of our work with that of Yonderboi was inevitable, since several of us came out of his band and took another path.
hvg.hu: In the charts of mr2 Petőfi "Wings of Love" is the first place.
Many have only heard the name Zagar in connection with this number.
Was the opening deliberately inclined with a slightly more popular style towards a wider audience?
B. B.: We had no plans to write a hit that would then hold as a train horse for the album.
This song is about more.
It was meant to be the final of the album with which we wanted to solve the sound orgy and the somewhat more difficult issues.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why exactly her, what was the guiding principle?
B. B.: The basic idea was to make a gospel-like choir.
Then the idea came to assemble the choir from talented soloists of the local music scene.
So the six-headed choir - Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikő Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - was created, which we then baptized "Underground Divas."
hvg.hu: Did you want the song the same way, or did the girls take it?
B. B.: The number has been in the instrument version for a long time, but when the material for the album was finished, we thought that this number still needed "something."
The chord sequence formally asked for a voice.
I sang the melody that night, and later they learned the girls.
Everything came practically on hold and frightening spontaneously.
I remember when I was pretty electrified, but the Divas had to do it.
With my voice alone, the song would never have become so powerful.
hvg.hu: Both on the record and at the concert you had the impression that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo part (apart from the short solo of Judy Jay), they have no own role, are completely together and are not louder than music, so their song is not only accompanied by music.
They were also on stage in the back.
Is it intentional?
B.Zs.: The fact that they were standing in the back was so because of purely technical problems.
However, we deliberately did not want to give them any solo roles.
The number is also about forgetting your ego a little, forgetting who came from where and where we went, let us just let these certain wings, the wings of love raise us up.
I would like other people to feel this euphoric condition that we felt when the song was created.
hvg.hu: What was the most intense song?
B. B.: In the musical creativity work, there has been more difficult tasks in mixing.
For example, at "Dorian Gray's Dilemma," where I play on a concert piano, or at "Rock 'n' Roll Goes To The Girls," where the Groove no longer wanted to work, but gradually everything has collapsed like a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite number of the new album?
B. B.: This changes continuously with the concerts and even now that I have released the album.
It is currently "Prophet Is A Fool," "Escape From The Earth," and the number "Never The Same."
Fraudulent broker risk due to minority feelings billions
Groundless fraudulent
This is the name of his former employee Jerome Kerviel of the French Banking Riese Société Générale, owner of the Comerční banka.
It came by nearly five billion euros because of it.
But it seems rather that Kerviel was just a big player who wanted to do it at the same time, was certainly not incapable.
In contrast to all the large banking houses, he recognised the crisis in the American mortgage market in time.
"He is psychically rather weak," was heard from the mouth of his superiors who showed him to the police.
However, as demonstrated by Kerviel's statements, which the French media published, for example the daily newspaper Le Monde, he was a person who had gained a profit of 1.6 billion euros at the end of last year with his business.
Crisis not only in America
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he claims in his statement.
In the summer, he was able to earn half a billion euros just at the American crisis.
He had already delayed the opportunity to do so at the beginning of the year.
In February, there was first news that so-called sub-Prime mortgages, such as those given low-income customers or those who had previously had payment problems, would be in difficulty.
However, this crisis should not affect the whole economy.
Kerviel didn't believe it and kept it right.
At the end of the year, he had raised his profits up to 1.6 billion euros.
"Even when I earned the first half billion, I didn't know how to explain that," Kerviel admits and continues to say that he definitely didn't keep anything for himself.
During the whole interrogation, he admits that he has forged documents so that he can't get on the wrong side.
He even managed to lead his bosses behind the light, even though the Eurex stock exchange was gradually interested in his business.
Risk profit
Was he afraid to fly?
I don't think so.
"I thought she satisfied the simple fact that I earned 1.6 billion for the bank."
How did he take the courage to risk so much?
He had to develop his position gradually.
He joined the Société Générale in 2000, immediately after completing his studies at the University of Lyon.
= = References = = = = External links = =
After two years he was an assistant to a broker and in 2005 he became an independent broker with an annual salary of $90000.
Yet he knew he'd never earn as much as others.
"Already at my first conversation in 2005 I knew that I was being watched.
Because of my training and also because of my professional and personal development, "Kerviel explained to the investigators.
But soon after his arrival, the first great success came.
With the shares of the Alliance, he earned a lot by putting half a billion euros on the price losses of this title in the London bombing.
And that was the trigger - now he wanted more.
As long as you win, we'll let you
"This is like a snowball," he said to the police.
But the bosses allegedly knew about everything, or thought of it.
"As long as I earned money, the eyes were closed."
But then the big hit came at the beginning of this year.
One day he lost a billion euros.
On a weekend in the middle of January, he wanted to compensate for this.
When he came to work on Monday, he was no longer a member of the bank.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it lost five billion euros because of it.
And how did they get to him?
He was suspicious by a vacation.
"I only took four days from the previous year.
A broker who does not take a vacation is one who does not want to see him in the cards, "Kerviel concluded.
Czech Republic has the chance to get to 365 billion
Czech ministers and representatives of the European Commission signed nine development programmes yesterday, which will allow the Czech Republic to reach EUR 14 billion (about 365 billion) in the coming years.
This is about half the sum that the Czech Republic can receive from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
About 125 billion crowns come from seven regional development programmes.
Czech companies will be able to receive about 100 billion kroner from the "Enterprise and Innovation" programme.
Most money, about 150 billion, will flow into traffic expansion.
The transport programme is the largest development programme and covers up to 22% of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the Fund.
This money increases according to the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will have 90.8 billion next year.
The "Enterprise and Innovation" programme is intended to serve entrepreneurs and companies to gain funds for innovative entrepreneurs.
Firms will thus gain finance for the introduction of new technologies, for business research, but also for the introduction of more effective organisational methods.
In the case of EU funds, the Czech Republic is one of the least successful new acceding countries so far.
Nicaraguan court confirms twenty-year imprisonment for ex-presidents
On Thursday, a court of appeal in Nicaragua confirmed the twenty-year imprisonment for former President Arnold Alemán, to which he had been sentenced in 2003 for financial fraud of $100 million (almost $1.8 billion).
But later he had been released from prison and lived under house arrest on his Hazienda at the Nicaraguan Metropolis.
Whether the former head of the state (1997 to 2002) is back behind the grid of this Central American State, according to the news agency AP is currently unclear.
According to the Chairman of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Pérez, it will now depend on the detention officers whether they leave Alemán's sentence at home or whether he has to go to jail.
A court showed four years ago that Alemán had regularly postponed money from the government to foreign companies' accounts in Panama.
These companies were fictitious and the accounts really belonged to his relatives and closest followers.
Some of this money finally landed in a fund that Alemán had set up to finance his campaign in 2001.
The budget is
Yeah, it's done.
The government budget is approved.
What is special about this budget?
It is the first budget that this government has designed and which has been adopted by the coalition majority without the support of the opposition.
It was approved for the current year with the support of ČSSD (Social Democrats) because Minister Sobotka (of this party) had presented it, and the ČSSD was therefore unable to allow itself to reject it.
In contrast to the lively debate before the vote on the motion of censure against the government, nothing dramatic happened this time.
The House of Representatives approved this traditionally little-respected, yet extremely important law in all tranquility.
This is paradox.
Governance begins and ends with the individual chapters and items of the budget, whether or not you like it.
The budget is an integral part of politics, but is covered by the government and opposition power struggle.
This is a more grateful topic for the media, and therefore they pay more attention to it.
A dispute among politicians is much more interesting for the public than sober figures.
The government budgets suffered from three weaknesses in the past social-democratic governments, which cannot eliminate the 2008 budget at once:
The first is the high proportion of expenditure committed by law, which is not only about pensions but also about social expenditure which the "silent" coalition of ČSSD and KSČM (Communists) decided last year before the elections.
The second is the deficit budgetary policy as a result of the first weakness.
The third restriction is the deficit of public finances, i.e. the budgetary deficit of the municipalities.
However, the greatest risk is not the government deficit.
This budget is publicly and somewhat under control.
But a real time bomb is the government's budget deficit.
Many mayors, in order to explore other sources of investment other than income from taxes, taxes and bank credits, often issued unthought debt bonds which they owe to their county houses in excess.
In recent years, they managed to repay these debts through a massive sale of shares of the energy and other supply networks they had received from the State in the course of privatisation.
Now this source is already devastated.
As far as we are concerned only with official and verifiable facts, we note that:
our economy, like the rest of the world, has been going through a growth phase for a few years, the ČSSD has been roaming for no reason.
This was a unique opportunity for their governments to fix public finances.
Instead, these governments owed the State even more.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have managed much more sensible than our Republic.
This is a tremendous shame, which is mainly attributable to the former governments.
We are among the countries that are at least at global level threatened with poverty.
That is why there is no need for massive social programmes which have, unfortunately, been blown up overwhelmingly in recent years.
Although it has been possible to delete part of the insane populist expenditure adopted this year before the elections, it is clear that if it does not come to a postponement of the retirement age and pension reform in the near future, virtually any policy in this country will end, and no matter who is in power, nothing will be left to him but pure governance.
It is only slightly excessive to say that, then, ruling politicians will become officials who are mechanically dividing the majority of tax revenues on pensions and social expenditure.
That is why this year's budget cannot be a revolution, but only a delay in normal expenditure through compulsory expenditure can put an end to it.
The deficit of 70 billion kroner foreseen for 2008 would certainly be unnecessary if previous governments had not spent over the last 10 years, which could only be done.
If we do not really want to be purely administrative officers from ruling politicians, then we must be patient and this not too strong coalition government, which is aware that the state can spend as much as it can take on taxes and charges in order to want peace in preparing further reform laws.
Only these allow a gradual enforcement of a balanced government budget.

Banks want to deal with crisis
The US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Great Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight the crisis in the financial markets together.
This means that more than 100 billion dollars will come to the monetary markets through auctions.
At these auctions the banks auction interest rates to which they are willing to lend each other money.
For example, the US Fed sends $40 billion on auction, another 24 makes it loose for the European and Swiss Central Bank.
It is the first time, after the attacks of 11 September, that the central banks of each country agree on such a coordinated approach to defend or mitigate the consequences of a financial crisis.
"This step aims to eliminate the biggest difficulties of the economy, i.e. the growing shortage of freely available capital that banks can provide," Bernard Baumohl wrote in a report for his customers from the Economic Outlook Group.
"The coordinated operation of central banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the US from 65% to about 50%," added Baumhl in his report.
The banks have already lost $60 billion for non-serving loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect further billions of losses.
"The central banks must have been really afraid of what can still be done when they decided to do so," said ABN Amro, Kieran Davies.
"It looks like the situation is really bad," he continued.
Central banks fear that if banks themselves have difficult access to bonds, credit will also be more expensive for their customers.
This would reduce consumption and drop the American economy into a recession, possibly with an impact on economic growth worldwide.
The central banks have decided to reset the so-called LIBOR, the London Interbank Rate, which is used to lend money between banks.
This means that banks were constantly afraid to borrow each other's money, although the central banks of the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom had reduced their interest rates several times during the autumn.
"This will have the same effect as a further reduction of interest rates," said Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting of the Agency Reuters.
Some analysts believe that this step of central banks contributes to the warming of the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem, namely the case of the real estate market in the United States.
Klaus: debates of ecologists are incredible
Global climate change is allegedly the most damaging to developing countries.
President Václav Klaus once again spoke about the issue of global warming.
The criticism was now on the end of the UN International Conference on Climate Change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book "A blue, no green planet," he stated that the debates of the ecologists were incredible.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference unacceptable, which forms a strange mix of government representatives and those of non-governmental organisations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that it accompanies and reality.
"The debate there is unstructured, it is a word fire that is only replacement for a real solution to current problems," said Klaus.
The Czech President stressed in the presentation of his book that his subject was very important to him and that he therefore committed himself to it.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book appeared in German translation because "I often meet caricatures of my views."
Now interested people could read his attitude undistorted.
Klaus remembered that he was not a climate scientist, but he considered that he had sufficient conditions to write such a book.
Finally, he was academics, capable of understanding and assessing technical negotiations, had experience with statistics and was also economists.
As the main statement of the book, he described the theory that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are therefore normal, that there is no consistent opinion among the scientists that the consequences of the current changes are not too large and therefore no threat, and that efforts to influence the development of the climate are unnecessary, ineffective and unacceptable.
In addition, he considers it unacceptable as someone who has experience with totalitarian systems to impose on other unknown views, he considers this to be a dangerous restriction of freedom.
On questions from attendants, he repeatedly stated that he was not opposed to "reasonable environmental protection, but to militante eco-activists who did not take into account the relationship between effort and yield."
Klaus had spoken about the same subject in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600000 people failed to exchange their driving licence
600000 drivers missed the deadline to exchange their old driving licence, whose validity expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day where you can request the exchange so that the authorities can issue a new driving licence by the end of the year.
However, the Ministry does not fear that after New Year, hundreds of thousands of drivers go on the roads without a valid driving licence.
According to the authorities, most of them have not changed their driving licence, which will no longer drive.
While small places report a strong decline in interest in the exchange of information, the offices of the capital are overshadowed with requests, and the interest in exchange grew this week.
The city administration produces about 2,000 customers daily.
You have to stand up about half an hour.
In Prague, about 140000 drivers have not yet changed their driving licence.
The exhibition takes a new driving licence for 20 days.
But it is possible to apply for the exhibition with a shorter period of five days.
In this case, the driver must pay 500 kroner.
Drivers who do not create the required exchange until the end of the year and leave without a valid driving licence are threatened with a fine from January.
The sinner pays a maximum of 2,000 crowns.
But the police can also make it use of a reminder in the event of the transgression.
In the event of a violation, the penalty may rise to 2500 kroner.
According to previous information, the community can also impose a penalty which does not drive at all.
He could, it was called, threaten a punishment of even 30000 crowns.
The ministry has already called on the offices to keep mildness and to impose a penalty of a maximum of 1,000 crowns.
According to the speaker of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, no one threatens a thousand crowns of punishment.
The driving licence is a document in which everyone can decide whether or not to own it.
It is not a identity card that everyone must have, and it is a valid one.
People who don't want to drive anymore should give their license.
It is enough to bring him to the relevant municipal office or to send him there by registration.
At the end of the year, licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will be invalid.
However, the drivers must gradually exchange other types of driving licences.
People with driving licences from 1994 to 2000 still have three years to change.
The validity of licences issued in 2001 to 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, this is about 2.6 million more driving licences.
Court lowers penalties for detectives associated with Berdych
The former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Kořařík, who are accused of having done a joint case with the gang of David Berdych, received 13 and 10 years respectively.
This decided in a judgement of law the Prague Oberlandesgericht, which reduced its punishment by one or two years.
Originally threatened the detectives of the "Office for the Fight against Organised Crime" 14 and 12 years respectively.
There is no possibility of appeal against today's judgment, only revision at the Supreme Court is possible.
Berdych himself is also accused of this matter, but first of all the first instance judgment is before him.
In other processes, however, he had already received penalties of a total of 16 years.
He can't be convicted for more than that.
In January, a district court spoke 19 people guilty, mainly for participation in robbery, and today the Oberlandesgericht negotiated the appeal of 16 of them.
Most accused disputed the charges from the beginning with the reason that it was a constructed case.
According to the Central Bohemian District Court, police members, in consultation with Berdych criminals, provided information from sources of the police, covered various robberies and helped members of the gang to escape the prosecution.
The band left Opava and Kożařík 30 percent of the bust for this purpose.
The prosecution is about the crimes of the gangs from 1999 to 2001.
In particular, for robberies whose victims often suffered serious injuries, but also for official assault and illegal possession of weapons.
The police discovered illegal guns, ammunition with steel core, a laser TV tube and a machine gun.
According to the prosecution, the gang has enriched many millions of crowns due to their robbery.
Apart from nearly 20 men in this trial, Berdych courts and a number of others recognized legally guilty for further robbery.
Other men from Berdych's district must be responsible for another trial, other cases have not yet been brought before court.
The main negotiation has so far failed Tomáš Přta and Maroš Šulej, who are in Irish detention and waiting for the final decision on their extradition for prosecution in the Czech Republic.

For the exchange of children in a childcare clinic, the attorney of the injured parents, Igor Veleba, will claim 12 million kroner compensation plus court costs from the hospital in Třebíč.
For each of the mothers three million each, for the fathers two million each and for the children one million each.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent couple.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondřej Dostál, therefore totally disagrees with the Velebas proposal.
"We reject such a proposal, it is too high for many times," said Dostál after today's negotiation.
"However, in order to be able to give us an opinion on this counter-proposal, we need the opinion that the other side had to draw up.
We will find out whether it is worth saying at all.
However, we insist that this should be for all together in the hundreds of thousands of areas, "said Dostál.
According to him, the amount should move between 100,000 and 200,000 kroner for each of the four parents.
At the beginning, the family from Jabloňov wanted a million crowns for every month she had not raised her biological daughter.
For Veleba, the basis for compensation negotiations was an opinion prepared by the University Hospital in Prague Motol.
The parents of the children, in the opinion of professionals in the field of psychology and psychology, suffered mental damage and stress symptoms in different strengths and depth.
The men tolerated the stress situation better, even if they looked at accusations that they could have prevented the confusion of the newborn.
In turn, women are more affected by the consequences of the experienced trauma, as well as by what is happening right now, Veleba coincided with the content.
Veronika and Nikola exchanged nurses of the childbirth clinic in Třebíč on 9 December last year.
Last week the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Čermáks in Přibyslavice, and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová to Jabloňov.
At the end of October, the head of the district of Vysočina (Böhmisch-Mährische Höhe) transferred 100,000 kroner to each family as a substitute for expenses caused by the failure of the hospital in Třebíč under the district.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are insured by law due to liability.
In case of doubt, they have to reach a reserve fund, and only exceptionally can they apply for assistance from the institution.
The courts have so far allocated relatively low amounts of damages to those concerned, the amounts were determined by tables and moved in the area of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions.
Polívka came around his kingdom Walachei
Bolek Polívka lost the dispute about the brand "Kingdom of Walachei."
According to the Judge of the District Court in Ostrava, he used the name "Walachian King," but the project had built up a team around Tomáš Harabiš in cooperation with the actor for many years.
Polívka did not take part in the trial today.
According to his lawyer, the case is probably not finished, and his client is probably going to appeal.
"The dispute is that Mr Harabiš and his team want to participate in the popularity of Bolek Polívkas parasite," said after the trial of Polívka's lawyer.
All of them introduced themselves to this actor and comedian in the words "Walachian kingdom."
The same opinion is also made by Harabiš.
"We have a nearly ten-year-old job behind us.
Money acquisition and concepts of activities, "he said.
According to him, the cause is a fight for money.
"After years, they noticed that the project was successful and that they could also have some of it.
They want to win parasite in our work, "he continued.
Lucrative business
According to the court, Polívka used the name "Walachian King" for the first time in one of his television broadcasts.
In 1993 he was crowned by Radoslav Brzobohatý.
But that was not the case at that time with the intention of creating a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came to the idea of issuing walasian passports.
From an originally fun action, a business and an entrepreneurial activity was crystallized, which Harabiš then joined the company "Walaxis Kingdom."
In 1997, Polívka agreed to use his name and signature in the passports and even offered their owners reductions when visiting his farm and his theatre performances.
Who's gonna sit on the throne?
The Judge also said today that Harabiš only used the only idea that Polívka made public in the show "Manege" for his entrepreneurial intentions.
"The popularity of Polívkas has certainly helped the project of the Walloon Kingdom," the Judge said.
She added, however, that the soul of the Harabiš project was and his team, who had devoted himself intensely to it.
The cooperation of today's parties lasted until the year 2000 when Harabiš organized the official crown for Polívka in Vsetín.
Since then, however, Polívka and Harabiš began to multiply the disputes that were held in the suspension "King Boleslav I until the day of St. Nimmerleins."
The leadership then took advantage of Harabišs Jarmila Šuláková as a queen mother.
In 2002, Polívka brought an action against Harabiš and his company, which the court rejected today.
Clarification in the fight could bring the competition prepared by Harabiš around the throne and half the princess.
A new king should come out of it.
He didn't want to betray details and an appointment yet.
"We don't want to rush anything.
It should be like the king's move in the Walache.
The King should be elected for a certain time.
Also Mr Polívka can register quietly, "Harabiš added.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: Pre-section swings
To tell the truth, I was never a special fan of Peugeot 206.
Its capabilities were not much worth, the quality of the gangway circuit, steering and also processing could be described as rather underaverage.
But now his successor, the Peugeot 207, is on the market, and he is much better.
The combi with the name SW is a bit further, and I just have to revise my opinion.
When I had tested the classic Hatchback of 207, I had to complain about, for example, the too low headache on the rear seats.
These complaints no longer exist, because the combi's body is designed so that not even two-metre men will suffer.
Continue quickly
I'm just going through the interior equipment for a short time not to repeat myself too much.
It is a fairly successful design, where I have only objections because of the cowardly middle tunnel.
I would welcome a little more design, where the car otherwise makes such an elegant impression.
The seats are comfortable, and over are the times when we may complain about too short seats or head support.
The side content has also improved significantly compared to 206.
With regard to the space supply, you can also feel the enlarged dimensions of the body.
In the combi, the already mentioned shortage of headache has also been eliminated.
Suitcase in the trunk
But the main thing about this car is the loading room.
I have to call it very well loaded and space-saving (also because of the folding-up window).
The hollow rooms are equipped with a restraint that represents an ideal compromise.
They do not interfere, can be dissolved and also hold on to harder objects.
But let's talk about the load volume.
According to the table in the basic equipment, it is 428 litres, which is more than an average value compared to competition.
However, not compared to the most sold vehicle in the Czech Republic of this class, the Škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav, we note that the Peugeot remains clearly visible 52 litres.
This value is already critical for a foreign holiday or when a child's car is invited.
But in order to highlight the positives, I still have to mention the very flat loading space after the rear seat has been folded or the very low loading edge.
120 hp in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a four-cylinder petrol engine with a cylinder capacity of 1.6 litres and a power of 88 kWp.
And honestly, this should be a 1600 Kubik engine that drives a family hatchback.
He's quiet, he has low consumption and he's moving away well.
If I compare him with his counterpart at Škoda, which sometimes works as if his exhaust was stuck with a laptop, then I can only be enthusiastic about him.
The price list speaks volumes
The price of this car is not exactly popular.
But we must remember that we tested a well-equipped car with a spacious inside and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with the 1400s petrol engine of 329900 kroner is still available.
With our engine it costs from 410900 kroner, which is already quite a lot.
The equipment Premium of the test car beats again with 80000 kroner in addition to the book.
However, we had Kopfair bags, automatic air conditioning, automatic disc wiper solution, electric window lifts in the back and and...
This way the car costs a total of 531900 kroner.
This is a lot, but add up the additional equipment of a Fabia and you will arrive at a very similar sum.
So it's only the decision to choose which brand you want to choose.
Integration of Slovak pupils in British schools is not successful
In British schools, the number of children from Eastern Europe is increasing, causing local fears about the further development of local schools.
The integration of Eastern Europeans has so far encountered a number of obstacles.
British schools even identify cases where disputes between immigrants and the children of the original inhabitants increase in violence.
The problem of the integration of children from Eastern Europe into British schools illustrates the case of North Kent, where the disputes between local and Slovak immigrants are gradually increasing.
Discussion, harassment and robbery among pupils have transferred to relationships between parents.
The situation has evolved so far that the police in Chatham arrested a Slovak woman who had beaten a ten-year-old boy with an iron bar.
The accused defended himself by the boy offending her with racist humiliations.
The police also had to intervene on a Slovak immigrant after an attack on two minor girls.
The girls had allegedly made racial remarks to the man and thrown him with stones.
"When we went home, a boy climbed on a bus house and spit on us.
When I told him to stop, he threw us with apples and pears and then unfolded his mind, "a mother Slovak student of the newspaper The Times described another unpleasant incident.
Complaints come from both sides.
One of the locals even called the struggle with immigrants from Eastern Europe a struggle for survival.
The cases mentioned show that the atmosphere between locals and immigrants in British schools is becoming more and more tense.
In the United Kingdom, 70000 slowaken who came here for work search have been reported.
Thus, some 30000 Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba - most beautiful island of the Caribbean
For visitors it is really an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your vacation, it will come true if you choose the right one.
Golden and white beaches, high waves or a sea that is quiet as a pond.
Palms and All Inclusive with waiters offering pizza, ice cream and cocktails at the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the Caribbean islands you will find this in an abundant amount.
Only on one island you will find much more, and this island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spanish, Cuba was their bastion for the conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place that has ever seen a human eye.
Havanna once became a camp or transit camp of treasures that the Spaniards had robbed in America and then transported to Europe.
And then the American epoch came.
The Hotel Nacional was created at the end of the 20th century.
Build it one of the leaders of the American Mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was considered a crime in the USA (especially during the prohibition) was liked to be seen and supported in Cuba - drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were:
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havanna, high houses grew, over the broad boulevards drove cars that were among the cult symbols of the fifties of the last century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havannas, and in Cojímar he had his yacht.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio, Stars of the Showbusiness and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
What about today?
On the walls of the Bodeguita of Havanna you can also leave your autograph.
At the bar at Hotel Nacional you can mix cocktails as you wish.
And the cult cars of the Fifty are driving around in Havana until today, because the once imported schigulis and fiats in the salty and wet air have already fallen apart.
May Havanna, especially its oldest part, have come down sharply, nowhere in the area as many wonderful colonial sights as here.
Other places are being cleaned out, for example Trinidad.
In view of the urgent need for money from tourism, there was a green light for this development.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels have emerged not only in Havanna, but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín and also on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers another marot that is unique in the world and attracts especially railway lovers.
The sugar pipe from remote plantations brought steam and diesel-operated narrow tracks to the sugar factories.
Their driving park has not been renewed for decades, and so you can see pussy and fully functioning locomotives, whose elderly people have been in the museum somewhere else.
Exit objectives
The most important places do not leave the majority of Cuba's visitors.
So you don't have to write about Varadero or Havana in detail anymore.
It remains to mention that there is a museum in Hemingways already mentioned, whose visit should not be neglected by the person who likes this writer.
The Viñales valley in the west of the island is one of Cuba's most picturesque angles.
The lush vegetation grows on limestone soil.
The Mogotas, limestone hills and rocks, rising steep from the floor, gathered in their hollow rooms fruitful soil, which also covers weathened rock areas of dense growth.
This valley is where perhaps the best Cuban tobacco is grown.
In his final form you can meet him when you visit one of Havanna's cigars factories.
It may also seem interesting that there was the Chilean episode of the television series "Major Zeman."
Trinidad
A ancient town was founded shortly after the Spanish had colonized the island.
Glory and wealth brought her trade with slaves and sugar.
The wealth embodied in the jewelry of the small city.
The Spanish colonial architecture, strongly influenced by the later French settlers, has hardly changed for four hundred years.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray mountains, is such a remote place that there was no road connected to the rest of the country in the fifties of the last century.
This isolation helped to keep it unnoticed.
Nothing was built there, but that's why nothing was torn off, everyone was glad he had a roof over his head.
If you have more than one afternoon for Trinidad, it is worth looking at interesting places in the area, such as the beach Playa Ancón or the "valley of sugar factories."
In the evening you should go to the Casa de la Música, which lives after darkness, and where the music does not remain silent until the morning.
Baracoa
This town is called the most beautiful island in the east of Cuba.
This view is certainly also influenced by the way there.
Both roads leading to Guantánamo must overcome high and fragmented mountains and run through a landscape that is hardly affected by human intervention.
This eastern headquarters of Cuba was included in their world heritage directory by UNESCO thanks to its untouched nature.
There is the best chocolate produced, in the church you show the cross of Columbus (in reality it was created about a hundred years after the trips of Columbus), and from the hill where the former castle, the current Hotel El Castillo, stands, are several table mountains, of which El Yunque is the most famous.
About the coffee, the rum, the cigars, the Sierra Maestra mountains, the pig bay and the island of Isla de Pinos, about the tropicana cabaret, the sanctuary of the Cuban patron Caridad del Cobre, about the Santeria, an African religion to which the descendants of slaves confess, could be written many pages about all this.
But, as you say, look better with your own eyes.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, according to Americans.
According to the United States, too few soldiers and the lack of necessary equipment affect the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
NATO should, according to the words of Defence Minister Robert Gates, draw up a concrete plan for the next few years.
The mission in Afghanistan did not run according to its ideas; in Scottish Edinburgh, the representatives of the countries that have posted units in the south of the country agreed on this.
In addition to the growing resistance from the Taliban side, the eight participating States also discuss further coordination plans among the allies.
While the United States, through its secrecy minister Robert Gates, called NATO units for more activity, Britain sees the priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and in intensifying development aid.
"In Afghanistan progress is noticeable, but military power can only be part of the solution.
Another part is to allow residents to start even a further development of the economy and security, "says the British defeat minister Des Browne of the BBC.
Ninety percent
According to the U.S. Army, the activity of the Afghan rebels has reached the highest level for five years.
The number of violence interventions increased by 27 per cent compared to the previous year, even by 60 per cent in the southern province of Helmand.
The NATO countries have stationed around 40000 soldiers in Afghanistan, of which about a quarter in the southern territory.
According to the United States, however, allies have reached an absolute limit as to the organisation and equipment of the units.
They specifically call for further helicopters, soldiers and experts for the training of Afghan units.
"We will have to seriously consider the concrete objectives for the next time and the way we can achieve them," said Gates.
Similarly, the Secretary-General of NATO, Jaap de Hoop, spoke today.
"I am not pleased with what we have available in Afghanistan on land and in the air.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that is too little, "said De Hoop of the Reuters Agency to conclude three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who's passive
There has also been a dispute among the countries involved over the past few months about whether all the allies in Afghanistan are doing their best.
For example, Germany has been criticized for passivity.
"The Germans are represented relatively many in Afghanistan.
But they are stationed in areas where there is only a minimum of violence and the battle requirements for them are not as high as for us in the southern and eastern part of the country, "Gate said.
This week, the British Boulevardzeitung "Sun," called the German soldiers Faulpelze.
"Afghan non-students: The Germans make games while our boys fight," wrote the "Sun" in a post supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German picture newspaper went over to the counter attack and printed a picture of a British unit in a Rugby competition in the southern part of Afghanistan.
State debt will rise to a billion in 2009
Every Czechoslovakia has a government debt of 84,000 kroner.
The total debt increased to 842.7 billion kroner by the end of September.
The government had planned to pay 159.2 billion dollars this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion thanks to the better development of public budgetary policy.
The Czech Republic's government debt increased to 842.7 billion kroner by the end of September.
In the first nine months of this year, they increased by 40.2 billion.
Since June, however, they dropped by 13.4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance thus confirmed its state debt data from the beginning of October.
Every Czechoslovakia has a debt of 84,000 crowns.
Over the whole last year, the state owed over 111 billion kroner.
"Up to now, thanks to the lower deficit for the next year, we may not exceed the limit of one billion kroner until 2009.
Next year the debt should move between 900 billion and one billion kroner, "said David Marek, the analyst of Patria Finance, the server iHNed.cz.
Similarly, Vladimír Pikora, the analyst of the Next Finance, sees: "We could be able to cross a billion in 2009.
When exactly, depends on the next budget that we do not know yet.
If the situation on the political stage changes and politicians are ready to save more, this could take up until 2010.
But I do not assume such a change, "he noted.
Growth of debt
State debt is caused by government debt and is mainly due to the accumulation of government deficits.
State debt is financed by tax orders, government bonds, direct bonds or, for example, by loans from the European Investment Bank.
Domestic government debt now increased to 719.4 billion kroner this year.
The state's foreign debt has now increased by 1.7 billion kroner to 123.3 billion.
The so-called marketable government debt reached 803.3 billion kroner at the end of September and fell by 13.7 billion since June.
The average maturity of government debt increased to 6.5 years.
"The total debt increased by 13 percent over the year from the first to the third quarter, which is really much given how good the economy is.
It is interesting that growth is recorded especially in debt securities, where the increase is 20 percent.
It is bad for debt to rise, but, on the other hand, this shows that you can do something before the pension reform comes, "Pikora commented on the data.
Better than expected
The financing strategy and the handling of government debt for 2007 show that this year the government had planned to absorb 159.2 billion kroner.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion kroner thanks to the better development of public budgetary policy.
This amount is mainly due to the government deficit, which is apparently going to reach 76 billion kroner this year instead of the estimated 91.3 billion.
It is also a maximum planned funding for the consolidation agency of SEK 13.3 billion, a ten-billion reserve to pay pensions, the financing of public debt bonds for 43 billion, and a rate of borrowing at the European Investment Bank of 1.8 billion.
For giving a name to a Teddybear, she was brought to a court in Khartum today.
According to her attorney, the British teacher who was accused in Sudan of insulting Islam was sentenced on Thursday evening by a court in Khartum to 15 days in custody and subsequent expulsion.
The Britin was accused of having allowed six to seven-year-old students to give a Teddyar the name Mahomet, although any representation of the Islamic Prophet is prohibited.
She would have deserved to be pissed out.
After having complained several times to the Sudanese Ministry of Culture, the 54-year-old primary school teacher who worked at the Unity High School of Khartum was attacked at home on Sunday and accused, pursuant to Article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code, of the insult of Islam.
In fact, this matter takes its beginning in September when the teacher asks her six- to seven-year-old pupils to choose a name for the classenteddy.
The children propose eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed, report school leader Robert Boules.
Finally, when the class votes, 20 out of 23 children choose Mohammed as the favourite first names.
Certainly, Mohammed is the name of the Islamic prophet, but above all a very common first name in Sudan.
Then the children have created a book for the class, with the photo of the bear on it and the image signature My name is Mohammed.
The bear himself did not bear a sign with this name, but the problem is quite simple that the representation of the Islamic prophet is considered to be an insult of the Islamic.
One of the Muslim colleagues of Gillian Gibbons, who taught the same school in Sudan, said he knew her well, and she would never have done anything that could bring her to a religious belief, I just regret that she asked the children to vote in favour of a name, he believes that this is just an innocent mistake.
An opinion that shares numerous students of the teacher who describe them as very attentive to their students and as a person who never speaks of religion in class.
It is remembered that the first name Mohammed is also the second name given in the United Kingdom in the second most common name for which there are 14 different types of writing in English.
This first name, often chosen by Muslim families, is regarded as a kind of honour to the prophets (it is often given to the first-born of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this first name?
Can you give him a toy, for example?
This is, of course, a question of interpretation.
On Wednesday, at the last negotiating meeting in Vienna, no agreement was reached on the future status of the province.
At the end of the failure
The Serbs and Albanians from Kosovo ended a sixth and last discussion meeting on Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, without being able to overcome their doubts about the future status of the separatist province.
It is regrettable that the parties could not reach agreement on the status, the European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger said at a press conference in Vienna.
With the emphasis on the fact that peace is at stake in the region, his American counterpart Frank Wilsner Belgrade and Pristina urged to fulfil their commitments to preserve peace and to continue talks beyond the end of the negotiations.
No violence is expected in the immediate future, but we are at the beginning of a very difficult time, he added and indicated that there are quite clear tensions.
End of conciliation on 10 December
The Troika intermediaries, united by the European Union, the US and Russia, will meet one last time in Serbia and Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the 90% of Albanian-speaking province could be clarified if Ischinger, Wilsner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko submit their report to the UN Security Council by 10 December.
The talks of Baden, near Vienna, formed the sixth and last negotiating meeting since the Troika had received from the UN last August the mandate for a new mediation.
Americans and Europeans expect their conciliation mission to end on 10 December.
The Russians, who had already blocked the authorisation of Kosovo's independence to the Security Council, insisted on continuing negotiations beyond that deadline.
Russia was and remains the speaker of a negotiated solution, an agreement solution, said Botsane-Khartchenko.
One-sided declaration of independence?
After eight years of Kosovo has been under the administration of the UN, the Western countries consider independence under EU supervision to be the only solution with the future.
Pristina is ready to proclaim it unilaterally if the Security Council does not decide in favour of it.
Belgrade insists on greater autonomy
Unfortunately, no agreement could be reached, the President of the autonomous authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, announced at the hotel in Baden where these negotiations have been held the last chance since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former leader of the Kosovar Rebellion and future Prime Minister of the province shared his regret.
However, he added that the plan proposed by Belgrade was a member of the autonomy of a past that led to murders and deportations.
Domino Effect
The Serbian President Boris Tradic considered that a compromise should always be sought and warned the Albanian majority from Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence of the province.
Belgrade believes that it is particularly afraid of a "domino effect" in a region that is still so much weakened by the 1990s' independence wars.
For Serbia, this does not mean that a compromise would be impossible, he said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that any decision should be taken alone in the Security Council, where its Russian ally has a veto right.
The Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word
Only one decision of the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia, said Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
These negotiations took two years.
They must end as they started: in the Security Council.
The journalists replied to Mr Sejdiu that the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on status and added that any unilateral declaration of independence from the Albanian speaking population will run out in coordination with the Western countries.
Bush unlocks an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
At the opening of the international peace conference, which had gathered on Tuesday under his leadership in Annapolis, Maryland, President Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He also stated that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas agreed to start negotiations immediately to find a definitive settlement of the 60-year-old disputes between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men Bush promised that he would do everything he could to help them conclude a peace treaty before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, Palestinians must destroy terrorist infrastructures and Israel must cease its colonization work, said Bush, reminding the two parties of their commitments with regard to the roadmap for peace that they agreed to in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority under Abbas ultimately aim at a peace treaty to resolve all open issues without exception, including key issues.
This name covers the three serious problems which are mainly concerned with the disputes between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees who were displaced from their home in the 1948 conflict, which lies in the present state of Israel.
After the American President Abbas took the floor and insisted that the forthcoming negotiations should be conducted in full and thorough and provide a system for all points, including Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water and security.
When Olmert took the floor, he pledged that the forthcoming ceasefire negotiations would be conducted directly and without interruption and that he would endeavour to put an end to them before the end of 2008.
Bush has set the deadline for implementing his vision of two states, one Palestinian and one Israeli, which exists next to each other, by the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia has revealed that Bush has received a guarantee in this sense from Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a great success for Washington, has launched a plan adopted by all Arab countries that offers Israel peace, in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the war in 1967, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis represents a divorce in the history of the Middle East, especially because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central points of view, the Saudi Arab prince says in his interview with the Arabic daily newspaper financed by Saudi funds.
According to the prosecutor, the police are not responsible
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always with this type of local news, official versions and rumors are facing themselves.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the National Disciplinary Hearing of the Police (IGPN), on Sunday, shortly after 5: 00, a police car on the rue Louise-Michel headed Villiers-le-Bel.
He had no use, but was on stripes, and drove at 40-50 km / h, without blue light, explains a spokesman of the police.
A green motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, without approval, i.e. not released for public road transport (see below), came, controlled by two young people without helmet, driving at very high speed.
It struck the left side of the police car, after it had failed its advance from the right, a policeman continued to explain.
The alcohol control carried out on the passengers of the vehicle is very negative.
The condition of the wagon (impregnated coat wings, split windscreen, cut-off shock bar) shows the seriousness of the impact.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérèse de Givry, announced that she entrusted the IGPN with an inquiry into the "facts of the unvoluntary murder of persons and the lack of assistance to people in danger," in consultation with the main direction of public security of Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, at a press conference, the prosecutor declared that she excluded the IPCN investigation at this stage from the policeman's responsibility.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident, which were heard on Sunday evening, confirmed the police version, namely that this small force trail has arrived relatively quickly on their left side.
Yesterday, a kind of ribbon, certainly caused by the friction of the pedestrians on the ground, showed that the two vehicles had remained stuck together until the police managed to brake.
The vehicles have been seized and will be subject to a technical assessment.
The body names of the two victims were autopsy yesterday.
What happened after that?
Yesterday, in Villiers-le-Bel, a rumor made the round that the police had left the scene very quickly, and that without helping the two young people.
Although the IGPN remains very cautious, it would exclude this issue as regards any serious error.
According to a police source, this is a difficult aspect of the investigation that requires further investigations and which needs to be handled very carefully.
Libération has hit an eye witness of these few moments shortly after the accident.
From one of his windows, he had a direct view of the scene.
We went out with my cousin, the nurse in the hospital, right away to try to revive her, this witness tells us.
There was nothing to do.
Then he saw a completely disturbed policeman who went down.
Two more tried to revive one of the young people who called the fourth.
In view of the tensions that had arisen quickly and, as it seems, due to the certainty that the present people had about the unexpected situation of young people, the police were taken in the car by colleagues who arrived at the scene of the accident.
Still according to this testimony, the rescue forces arrived about 20 minutes after the police left.
They also used heart massages, but they were in vain.
I will not allow it to be claimed that the police would not have helped young people.
First aid has been given to these young people.
The fire department has arrived immediately.
Everything was done to try to save them, she stressed the prosecutor.
In Pakistan the tension rises
On Monday, the Pakistani police defeated the first demonstrations since two days before General Musharraf had called the emergency.
According to testimony, in the city of Lahore in the east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers who demonstrated against the measures taken in the framework of the emergency have been injured by the tear gas grenades used by the authorities there.
Then they threw stones to hurt the cops.
At least 350 lawyers were temporarily arrested.
Similar scenarios were found in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police attorneys attack and injured.
Several would have been temporarily arrested.
In Islamabad, the lawyers of the Supreme Court's attorney called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, as a result of a wave of about 500 arrests of opposition, opponents of human rights and lawyers during the weekend.
On Monday morning, the roads leading to the Supreme Court were blocked to prevent the assembly.
Further demonstrations would have taken place in Multan (middle) and Peshawar (north-east).
On Monday, the law movement received the support of the religious parties united in the Mighty Alliance of Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, whose President urged the people to send flowers to the judges who voted against the emergency, and to the waste that put an oath in front of Musharraf.
Musharraf's promise is no longer valid
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the special measure announced on Saturday evening.
In the following days he had to take a position on the legality of President Musharraf's re-election in a direct election on 6 October.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was dismissed and replaced by his office.
All that we represent is illegal, anti-institutional and contrary to the decisions of the Supreme Court, the Magistrate of the Newspaper The News explained.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to give the supreme command about the army and become a civilian president no longer applies since the call for emergency, declared on Monday of the Deputy Minister for Information Tariq Azeem.
It was expected that he would issue his military uniform by 15 November, the date on which his first term of office ended as President.
The Deputy Minister for Information has also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
In addition, the Pakistani government demented the rumours that persistent in the country, according to which President Musharraf had been assigned a residence by his deputy leader.
Still more than one third of pregnancy is not planned
This calculation takes into account the undesirable pregnancy (24%), as well as the unplanned or unforeseen births.
Even today, 40 years after the adoption of the New Wirth Act, which allowed contraception in France, one of three pregnancy groups (36%) is not planned, as a study by the National Institute for Demographic Studies (Ined) shows.
This calculation takes into account the undesirable pregnancy (24%), as well as the unplanned or unforeseen births.
Ined estimates that the various methods of contraception such as the pill or spirals still have a failure rate of 5-6%.
According to the Institute, which notes that the percentage of pills used by women between 20 and 40 years of age using the pill has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today, the liberalisation of contraception has nevertheless allowed better control of fertility.
Eight out of ten births are carefully planned these days.
For one in five couples even calculated exactly to the month, and, if possible, in spring, the season in which it seems most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair at the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his comrades from the crew of the International Space Station (ISS) will need more than seven hours in space to perform the spectacular repair of a defective solar collector which is indispensable for the continuation of scientific work at the station.
An armed exit, which has achieved several records due to its duration, the removal of habitable modules, the speed with which he was organized, and the tools used by the astronauts to perform the repair.
The problem occurred on Wednesday, when the astronauts had loaded the Harmony module from the spacecraft discovery, a large cylinder-shaped part that is soon to record the European and Japanese scientific laboratories.
This module is a kind of landing bridge for the module laboratories.
But you have to be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to implement a 17.5 tonnes heavy module for the generation of electricity via solar collectors that was already on the ISS to bring it into its final position.
After she had moved it, the crew went to the restructuring of the solar collectors of the module, whose range is 76 meters.
And it happened that one of the collectors that can be seen as a battery deone was damaged by a clamped cable on a length of about a metre
Restructuring has been stopped in order not to damage the collector any more.
The astronauts, who originally left the Discovery spacecraft for a control course and then had to repair another solar collector whose rotation system was incorrect, were forced to dedicate themselves to the damaged collector.
And Scott Parazynski was chosen to walk around at the end of the 30 meters long remote controlled arm of the space ferry that had been placed at the station to perform the repair.
He is one of the best spacewalkers in the NASA.
Large, resilient, very smart, he has a well-developed upper body and long arms.
So the 46-year-old educated doctor was chosen to operate the injured solar collector.
After having carefully checked the damage, he separated the defective cable and attached some kind of rail on the damaged site.
He was supported by a second spacewalker who remained near the lock, and, inside, by the other astronauts, among them Peggy Whitson, commander of the crew.
The tool he used, a mini-hockey bat, wrapped with isolator to prevent an electric blow on the solar collectors that produce several hundred volts, had the astronauts on board the station invented and bathed.
When the action was completed, Scott Parazynski waited until the collector was completely folded before he counted his tools and returned to the station.
Last afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed half a day of relaxation before today seven astronauts returned to the spacecraft Discovery to anticipate Wednesday's return to Earth.
The title EADS at the stock exchange punishes
After the Air and Defense Group has announced that it will have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to counteract the residues of the A400M, the EADS share is currently showing a significant decline on the Paris Stock Exchange.
EADS currently loses 4% to 21.96 euros on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was forced to re-examine its business forecasts for 2007 with reference to the residues caused by the slowly progressive development of the A400M engine which delay the flight of the aircraft.
The costs announced in October to compensate for the delay in delivering their military transport aircraft amount to between EUR 1.2 and 1.4 billion, of which more than one billion for Airbus, announced the parent companies of the European manufacturer EADS.
Due to these costs, EADS will be forced to announce new operational performance targets (EBIT) for 2007 in the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday, without further details.
The group also states that the assessment of the new costs is related to the six-month gap.
For the purpose of remembering, the business performance of EADS fell from 86% in 2006, due to the costs associated with the delay of another programme, the very large carrier A380.
The group originally planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French army for October 2009.
The Choice of Status Quo
On Sunday it will not be exciting to count the urns: the mass of the Russians will decide for President Putin's Party, United Russia.
After a very defeated campaign, she confirms her aspirations for stability, even for authoritarianism.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin is sending a message to the voters broadcast on public broadcasts, which has already been recorded, but whose content is kept secret.
He does this in his capacity as a top candidate of the United Russia, the Pro-Kreml Party, for which a overwhelming victory announces itself.
Yesterday, the President had nothing to look through when he received the foreign ambassadors, and satisfied himself with delivering a new point of attack against the Western powers accused of interference - his favorite theme during the campaign.
We know the price of true democracy and hope for honest elections, extremely transparent and open, elections without fraud, he added.
From the point of view of the opposition, they have lost their minds.
She's blaming a campaign of oppression.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says that there would never have been such dirty elections, not even in the time of Eltsin.
After suppressing the demonstrations last weekend, ex-chess chess champion Garry Kasparovder was sentenced to five days of imprisonment for illegal demonstration, according to his lawyer's ban on visiting.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of the homo Sovieticus
After these parliamentary elections, there are two much further questions:
Who will take Putin's succession as President?
The official newspaper announced yesterday the date of the first election of the presidential elections, 2 March 2008; the candidates have time to announce themselves until 23 December.
As he was elected in 2000 and was re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot join for a third mandate in succession.
And now there is no successor.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
President of the parliamentary majority and the Almighty Party of United Russia, will elect the government and the President?
Whatever it is going to be, in the parliamentary elections or in the presidential elections, the previous power will triumph.
That's tradition.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of the homo Sovieticus, they are not the master of their destiny, says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent center of Levada.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov from the State University of Sankt Petersburg is even more deteriorating: in this country, which has been christised five centuries to Europe, the famous communist spirit has delayed the development of individuality.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, Putin has once again linked to the model of a paternalist state, which has been fully accepted by the population, the more since this new paternalism did not follow terror, but a certain economic prosperity, Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation says.
Today, the Russians refrain from the personal responsibility they have placed for a short time after the collapse of the USSR.
What for a long time?
This phenomenon affects all company shifts, including the business world.
And the administrative elite understands keeping the status quo: 65 Governors (of 85 Russian government presidents) are leading the local electoral lists of the United Russia.
The new freedoms coming from the West are often equivalent to chaos, as in the 1990s.
The general community prefers stability.
In this sense, the Russians will not vote in favour of the extremist parties either.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, a 54-year-old professor: What for a long time?
Those who are in power are not so bad, why do they redeem?
A heavy memory
After being treated confidentially for more than 60 years, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which document the fate of 17,5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are now free to access.
The 47 million documents of the archive, which are housed at a total length of 27 km in Bad Arolsen, have not yet been seen, except with a humanitarian intention, i.e. individually and by name, that is to say to the question of a former victim or his family.
The eleven states responsible for their administration, including Germany, France, Israel and the United States, agreed in May 2006 to make them available to researchers and historians.
After the ratification process has been completed this decision, opening has been valid since yesterday.
Heikle Information
Historists' access to Bad Arolsen will enable them to conduct research, especially on the deportations of prisoners, the inmates of the concentration camps and the state of health of forced workers, says Reto Masters, head of this archive, managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (CICR).
Until recently, several states, including Germany, have been opposed to making these naming documents available to the public due to the delicate nature of certain information.
For example, the alleged homosexuality or the mental disability of some deportation victims.
The list of prisoners of the concentration camps or the warrant issued by Gestapo had been collected for a practical reason after the war: to find civilians who had been deported or forced to work, and to provide them with any evidence of their arrest in order to pave them the way to their compensation.
At Bad Arolsen today, more than 300 people are working on tens of thousands of personal questions.
Nevertheless, part of the scientific community shows only a limited interest in access to Bad Arolsen.
There is nothing new to be expected in these documents, Pr. Wolfgang Benz, head of the Research Centre for Antisemitism at the Technical University of Berlin, 2006.
The EU and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008.
At present, mutual trade between India and Europe is already reaching the EUR 60 billion per year.
The EU is India's main trading partner and represents 18% of its external trade.
European Trade Minister Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath stated that the European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008.
The EU's foreign ministers had given the European Commission a green light last April to open negotiations with a view to signing free trade agreements with India, South Korea and the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN).
The EU is the first trading partner in India and accounts for 18% of its external trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but according to the European Commission figures, India is only the ninth trading partner of the EU.
A free trade pact will make the two economic areas enormous advances, and India would improve its access to a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans, confirmed by Peter Mandelson.
Europe is the first or second market for the ten most exported products from India, said the European Commissioner. The Asian and European giants continue to exchange goods worth EUR 47 billion each year and services worth EUR 10 billion, this week Daniéle Smadja, President of the European Commission's deployment in New Delhi, and regrets that mutual trade has not yet exhausted its potential. The EU and India will meet on Friday at their eighth diplomatic meeting in New Delhi, with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barroso.

The Bank of England takes note of the concern and offers £10 billion for five weeks
On Thursday, the Bank of England expressed concern about reducing the current recurrent concern about the credit conditions, and announced an offer of ten billion pounds with a basic interest rate of 5.75% for five weeks, an offer of unusual duration.
In order to mitigate the fears that the conditions on the financial market will be particularly difficult at the end of the year and to give banks greater certainty about the way in which they are supposed to organise their liquidity positions at this time, the Bank intends to offer a significant part of its savings during the maintenance phase, which starts on 6 December, in the form of an open-market operation for five weeks, in a communication.
The Bank further explains that on December 6, at 12.15 GMT, 10 billion pounds (EUR 14 billion) will be put into circulation, at the basic rate and only until January 10.
This is apparently the first time that the BoE brings liquidity into circulation in an open market operation for five weeks.
This usually happens for a week.
In its communication, the BoE adds that it is prepared to take further measures to obtain the daily different interest rates on intermediate loans with its basic interest rate.
On Wednesday, the different interest rate between banks was 5.829% from day to day.
The three-month interest rate has been 6.6%, slightly higher since September 18th.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the amounts put into circulation by the Bank of England have been coupled with penalties which the banks had prevented from taking advantage of.
According to some rumors, reinforced by the development of the pound rate in contrast to the euro, many preferred to sign more advantageous interest rates and with more secure discretion for the amounts put into circulation by the European Central Bank
UMP and NC refuse to review PS proposals on purchasing power
On Thursday, the UMP and Nouveau Centre groups refused to discuss the articles of the Socialist legislative proposal on purchasing power, which is a rejection of the text.
The text produced by a socialist niche (meeting on the initiative of a parliamentary group) indicated about ten measures adopted by the PS National Committee on Wednesday, of which the majority was 50% for the employment allowance, for the reintroduction of the TIPP fleet, for a transport check or for the limitation of the rent.
After UMP and NC had voted against the examination of the articles (180 votes against 115), the meeting was dissolved after the main discussion, which led to some intense change of speech between majority and opposition, some hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's television contribution on purchasing power.
The leader of the PS Jean Marc Ayrault MEPs announced that his group would present the whole of its proposals as an amendment to the legislative proposal for correcting the financial situation, which had been examined by the Assamblee last week.
A new festival is born
As a result of numerous rumors about the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia by C3 Presents, the promoter / producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in cooperation with the Festival Republic of the British producer Melvin Benn.
It is an honor for our company to work with a person who, no more and not less, served as a model for the current festival movement in America, Charlie Jones informed C3 on Bilboard.com.
C3 hosts the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer holiday for camping.
The festival will take place from 8 to 10 August on a 500 acre large private farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The head of Festival Republic Melvin Benn, previously known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the most renowned festivals in the world.
In 1989 he took over the leadership of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts around 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added his portfolio to the Leeds Festival, and then, 2006, Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival in Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn has also been a co-owner of production, licensing concessions and organisational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3, who describes Glastonbury as the most inspiring event he has ever attended, says that his company and Melvin Benn work parallel to each other to offer the area a European-style festival event.
We have chosen Philadelphia as a market and work eagerly with the Fairmount Park Commission to create a festival in the city center of Philadelphia, says Charlie Jones.
We negotiated the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we stayed in political debates on current administration, Charlie Jones continues.
"Fortunately, we have been able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are preparing to create a great festival in an extraordinary place that will ultimately benefit the population."
C3 Presents revived the Lollapalooza Festival 2005 at Grand Park Chicago after profiling together with the Austin City Limits Music Festival in the world of festivals in 2002.
The two events were able to achieve $9.8 million and $11.8 million in gross tax revenues in 2007.
These two festivals take place in the urban environment.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a rural festival, while our people rather take place on the urban green areas," says Charlie Jones.
"The aim is to merge these two concepts in one way or another in order to simultaneously convey the impression of a rural festival on the European and a urban in the American way."
Vineland is halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The community of Vineland, including the mayor, takes the burden of this event with pleasure," says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, but he confirms that "they are sufficiently interesting to invest in such an event and to record a festival that hopefully will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says that the reception capacity of the festival is "very large," corresponding to the 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says the invitations have been sent to the groups, but that nothing could be confirmed when they were printed.
"Vineland will offer tasty rock, but music will be very diverse in the hope of attracting all kinds of spectators," says Charlie Jones.
His partners from C3, who received the top Independent Promoter Prize of the last Bollboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal meets the Terminator.
Not easy to get the main platform for Hollywoodfilms to Montreal if no less than the Terminator is opposed.
These locking attempts are one of the delegates' tasks.
A politically "delicate mandate" because the Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, pressures "Runaway Productions."
Is it difficult to negotiate with the governor?
"You have to be careful, because it is the industry that decides where it goes.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are favourable, she will go there.
Our role is to offer those who are considered the best, "he says.
Run to the festivals.
For Denis Turcotte, however, at the moment the premiere of the cinema there is the highest priority.
The hunt for the Oscars has begun.
At all the festivals on the west coast, although Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it will be about presenting the Quebec movies, evaluating them and ensuring that producers give interviews.
The dark age had a successful idea at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
He will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on the poster in Santa Monica and is presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four long and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Is the stock exchange ahead of an end-year rally? Disagreement among experts due to the US mortgage crisis
With nearly five weeks before the annual financial statements on the stock exchange, investors are already moving their hands with regard to the upcoming end-year rally.
However, experts cannot make safe forecasts in this respect.
Banif believes that purely statistically, the month of December on the stock exchange is usually associated with a positive market development
Nevertheless, it is not advisable to draw up forecasts in the short term and only on the basis of statistics. Especially when tensions to be taken seriously determine the current market occurrence.
Although other experts do not approve such a strong increase in the rate in the last weeks of the year, they note that the exchange rate is determined by the given liquidity of the market and the market participant, which, due to the lack of secure equity funds, are mainly invested in pension funds which are heavily affected by the upward trend towards profitable assets.
Consequently, these experts believe that the stock exchange will have a rather lateral trend, influenced by market fluctuations, especially because we are not yet able to estimate the extent of the possible fall in the interest rate of the US NCBs, an uncertainty which is mainly due to the increased crude oil price and the risk of rising inflation.
Javier Barrio, Chairman of the BPI sales division in Spain, agrees that it is a timely time to announce a forthcoming market rally.
The chances are not very good, the expert assures.
The Spanish stock index Ibex has lost a value of 4% since its maximum brand on November 8.
But not all experts share the same negative opinion.
According to Juan Solana, analyst at Intermoney, Ibex 35 could successfully complete the year with almost 16,000 points due to the restructuring of the investment funds and the traditional grant of the pension fund each year.
Nevertheless, the expert points out that this year things could develop somewhat differently, especially because of the end-year rally that already took place in the second week of December, and hence immediately after the Bridge Day on the Day of Constitution.
According to the analyst, price fluctuations would not affect market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, an analyst at the Bank Inversis, the previous market situation assessments are at an almost technical level, which could lead to a deviation from the index values which depend on the effects of the US mortgage market crisis.
The analyst trusts that they are positive.
The analysts agree on the selection of values that are intended to drive the Ibex to a new maximum.
Solana of Intermoney insists that this year's great values are on the line.
One of the value winners would be the two large banks and some real estate companies, as the electricity sector will be too expensive at the time.
In the meantime Federico Olucha is assured by the Bank Inversis that the increases will be associated with the banking and industrial sector.
If the Rally actually occurs, the real estate companies will benefit from it.
In recent months, the ACP has been at pick-up and we hope that other real estate companies such as Ferrovial and FCC will take the same path, according to the expert.
With regard to increased consumption behaviour during Christmas days, in the last half of the year the periodic consumption will determine the market.
On the other hand, the expert believes that the technologies will also achieve positive turnover results even if they are only in small numbers represented on the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
Over the last seven years, only two cases of decline have been recorded in December.
At the end of 2003, when the technology bubble broke, this led the stock exchange out of their crisis and initiated at the same time the last real end year rallye so far.
This year, when the Ibex 35 picked up by 28.17 percentage points, December had an increase of 6.68%.
Whether 2008 will be the fifth year in succession (the Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and also an end-year rally will be shown.
Popular will have opened its 200 credit institutions from Monday to Friday 12 hours a day.
Popular has decided to modernise a large part of its branches.
A total of 200 of them are located in the most economically strong regions of Spain.
For the Institute, which operates under the name Popular Max, these branches represent a milestone.
But also for the remaining Spanish institutions, since Popular is the first banking group, the leap dares to extend the opening hours of its branches weekly to 20.30h and to start Saturday from 10h to 20.30h.
The BBVA banking group, which has also repeatedly declined the extension of its opening hours in the branches, has not yet reached a definitive decision.
The negotiations currently under way with the trade unions seem to aim at an agreement with 75% of all branches closing on Saturday and opening for it on a weekday afternoon, if not for customers.
Whether other banks join the new initiative, which adapts to business opening times, will depend on the experience of the Popular Bank.
And that is precisely the intention that the popular is pursuing with their project.
The aim is to extend the opening hours of those branches, which, due to their situation, can cover the purchasing customer of independent, small and medium-sized enterprises, but also those of large stores.
The Bank wants to open the new 200 branches over the next 18 months, since it is not new but changed opening times.
For this purpose, the Bank will reshape the premises of those branches that are already located in business zones and at the same time align them with the individual customer profile of the different zones.
The extension of opening times is linked to a new space design of the branches, which is characterised by a more recent, colourful design.
The competent Banking Representative Ángel Rivera assures that the restructuring does not require major investments but involves increased recruitment of staff, as a branch now did not need more than six, but eight or nine employees.
The branches, which will even be equipped with additional premises for SMEs, will not sell financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested his concept at nine branches in Madrid.
And the experiences were positive, so Ángel Rivero.
The branches of the streets Bravo Murillo, O'Donell and Gran Vía have been selected for what seems to be a wise decision.
Popular currently runs about 2500 branches.
And another 60 who operate under the name Mundocredit. These are specialized in immigrants and also show extended opening times, even on Sundays and holidays.
In these branches of PopularMax the BBVA model is not used as most of them will offer a wide range of non-financial services for sale instead.
We do not want to represent competition for our customers, explains Rivero.
With Telefonica they have provisionally reached the agreement to sell mobile phones using external bank staff.
The Spanish private station Telecinco doubles its stock exchange value for the first time and thus overtakes its Rival Antena 3.
We did it.
With this sentence, the Managing Director of Telecinco, Paolo Vasile, announced his satisfaction at the end of the stock exchange. The station led by him had increased its value by twice his rival Antena 3.
One aspect, however, damped his joy: That is exactly what is hurt me; not that we have a higher growth, but that we have had lower losses, he noted.
He stressed that despite the weak market, they did not fall too deep.
Telecinco ended the day yesterday with a plus of 2.54%.
This profit reduces its previous losses to 15.66% this year.
According to Bloomberg, the company value now reaches 4.488.88 million euros, with Mediaset controlling the main share of capital (52%), and Vocento is only 13% involved.
The Rivale Antena 3 lost 1.52 percentage points yesterday and has reported a total loss of 40.5% since January, so its market value is 2.193.46 million to half.
On the other hand, the market value of other listed communications companies rises; in the case of Sogecable to 3.571 million, at Prisa (editor of the magazine Cinco Días) to 2.518.53 million and at Vocento to to 1.779 million.
The comparison with Antena 3 can be derived from the fact that it is two similar companies, according to Vasile.
Uncertain still seems to be the question of the extent to which we can actually act on the stock exchange, at what price and how we can make it lucrative at the customer level.
Telecinco explained a week ago that he was planning to increase the first television station this year with more than 1000 million gross profits from advertising revenues. This assured Guiseppe Tringali, Managing Director of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the advertising company of the group.
If the project was to be implemented, the station would increase its advertising revenues by 3.6% compared to the 965.4 million in the previous year.
In the case of Antena 3, net sales rose by 1.6% in the first nine months of the stock exchange (up to 734.4 million), while net receipts from the television business could only increase by 0.7% (630.4 million).
The main factor for the better exchange rate of Telecinco compared is that the analysts see the high payout ratio that the company could have until now: in 2006, the company managed by Alejandro Echevarría created a 100% dividend distribution.
However, Vasile assures that after the purchase of 33% of the shares of Endemol, with Mediaset as a parent company, the ratio could still vary even though it is too early for official notice.
We are committed to the official compromise to pay at least 50% of the shares, even if we have always stated much more so far.
I hope that we will be able to satisfy our shareholders this year, whose share values we could already increase by buying 33% of the Endemol shares.
According to the analysts, the market is currently experiencing certain losses.
Lehmann Brothers only recently reduced its profit calculation at Telecinco by 4% for this year and by 7% for 2009.
This is the result of the reduction in the expected growth rate, which will decrease from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
This has also reduced the projected profit calculation of Antena 3 by 4.5% for 2008 and by 7.5% for 2009.
3 options.
1.
Ibersecurities: focuses on its high efficiency and sustainable potential and therefore recommends the purchase of both shares.
2.
Caja Madrid: Measures Telecinco (buy) as a result of the multiple incentives and the prosperous market a more favourable position than Antena 3 (keep).
3.
JPMorgan: recommends reducing expectations in both cases in view of similar threats (saturated market and worse economic climate)
The Congress agrees with the MIFID Directive, which entered into force on 1 November.
In parallel with the parliamentary drafting which today ended with the Senate Congress decision on the supplementary / amendments to the project, the government published the provisions of the new law with the aim of allowing the entry into force of both regulations by the end of the year.
The representatives of the various companies commended unanimously the efforts of the Congress and Senate members who had pursued the aim of their negotiations and votes to establish the best possible regime to ensure the security of investors and regulate the individual business activities in order to guarantee a general efficient market.
In addition to the modernisation of financial markets, the MIFID, which redefines the Securities Services Regulation, is pursuing an improvement in investor protection, the increase in the level of control of the Spanish Securities Commission (CNMV) and the promotion of cooperation between the various control authorities of the European Union.
The new Directive allows both specialised companies and natural or legal persons to provide financial advice and also contributes to the creation of new financial services companies (ESIS), the consultancy companies that are associated with investment and intermediary companies of securities.
In addition, it expands the number of systems for the execution of financial transactions so that regulated circulation markets are added to the multilateral securities trading systems and the internationalisation systems of commercial contracts, which would ultimately compete with the current economic operators.
The law obliges investment firms to inform the focus of their business profile, the confrontation and the forms of dealing with risks on the market and to register all projects carried out in order to facilitate the CNMV's control task.
The Economic Commission of the Congress subsequently provided for further changes, with the decision that the debt bond provided with titles must now be considered as a complex financial resource due to its high risk for the investor, confirmed by the US mortgage and banking crisis. (US mortgage crisis)
In addition, the entry into force of the Directive on the legal restriction of the working areas of diplomated economists was used; 30 years after 1977 the regulation was adopted which restricted the working areas reserved for economists.
The Senate, on the one hand, identified new positions in the financial sector, such as the economic mediator working on foreign invoices does not require authorization from the CNMV and can offer its services for the commercialization of products and for customer acquisition at the same time to several investment companies.
The harmonised consumer price index (ICP) increased by five tenth in November and is now 4.1%.
The indicator used by Eurostat to assess inflation rates within the European Union provides the average price evolution in Spain in November.
Its publication is in line with the principles of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB), which, by disclosing the data, aim to compare locality and quality with US products.
The forecast for the indicator can be drawn up in advance by using the same approach as the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, but at the same time using various other statistical modelling methods to estimate the information not available at the time of calculation.
However, the Spanish Statistical Office (INE) pointed out that the previously identified indicator should only serve as a benchmark and therefore not be consistent with the final result announced on 14 December.
The Consumer Price Index (ICP) will remain at a relatively high level
According to the Deputy Head of Government and the Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs Pedro Solbes, the increase in the ICP in November was a temporary development, while ensuring that the price index would remain relatively high in the coming months.
Nevertheless, Solbes found in the halls of the Congress building that even if the current figure is not good, Spain's inflation difference with the other members of the monetary union remained more or less the same in recent years.
He also stated that there were fewer surprises in November than in the previous month where the government did not expect such a high increase.
We expected a value of about 4%, announced to the Minister for Economic Affairs and Finance with regard to the forecast published today.
Virgin expects Northern Rock revenues of over 42 billion euros in the next three years
Northern Rock's assets have fallen by more than half after the bank had asked the British Notenbank for an emergency loan in mid-September last year, and they now amount to only £12.000 million (corresponding to €16.800 million).
At that time, the Bank's assets amounted to £25,000 million in record, a sum that fell significantly within two and a half months due to customer confidence loss and, despite the government's 100% guarantee that the money is safe, will continue to fall until the end of the crisis.
The company Virgin, which would continue the group after the acquisition under the brand name Virgin Money, has to invest about a quarter of the revenues of the British banks that will be made up there from the plants of the next three years to acquire exactly those 18 billion pounds that are still needed to achieve their target of 30 billion.
The group of multimillionaire Richard Branson, known by its noticeable advertising campaigns in the United Kingdom, intends to send £50,000 million (equivalent to about €70 million) to advertising and marketing campaigns annually to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock named this week the Virgin Group, in which three other companies are involved, as his preferred tenderer to lead it out of bankruptcy.
The Mayor of Totana arrested for suspicion of participation in urban corruption
This morning, the Spanish police arrested the current mayor of the village of Totano (Partido Popular) belonging to the Municipality of Murcia, due to the urgent suspicion of urban corruption that was discovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the municipal council and the chief of the municipal police were arrested.
José Martínez Andreo represented Juan Morales last May, currently a member of the Partido Popular and at that time chairman of the Municipal Council of Totana, and could, according to information from the radio broadcast Cadena SER, be the original wire drawer of the complement.
Officials continue to search the business documents of the municipality and the Ministry of Urban Planning and do not exclude further arrests in the next few hours.
In addition, the attorney of Juan Morales was accused of the main suspect in the case of urban corruption discovered at the beginning of this week.
According to information from Cadena SER, the lawyer of the popular and therefore privileged member Juan Morales was arrested when leaving his client's place of residence due to important burdensome documents to be related to the complement.
In addition, other sources of information report of Morales's alleged order payments to a Galisian construction company which provided for the conclusion of a urban construction contract in which the construction of a 200 hectares large area was decided.
At the moment, eight people are in custody.
Bono agreed to accept the PSOE candidate in Toledo and, in the event of a election victory, in the Congress.
The former Minister of Defence José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and Secretary-General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, and will therefore present the list of PSOE candidates at the forthcoming general elections in Toledo and, in the event of a victory of the Socialists, take over the office of the Congress President.
Thus, José Blanco, PSOE's organizational secretary, and Bono announced at the press conference after a meeting with Zapatero took place today at the party's headquarters.
The Heads of Government believe that the offer to the former Minister is justified, as it is important in politics to count on the best and Bono is among the best.
In addition, in the event of a victory for the Socialists, the Mancha politician would appear to be the chairman of the Congress of the Party in the forthcoming elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Martín as Congressman, who announced last 15 November that he would no longer join the next general elections, terminate his career in public policy and instead engage in the field of climate change.
The former minister had to admit that since his resignation two years ago, the President of the Government had constantly pressed for his return to political events.
He also pointed out that, as in the appointment of the Vice-President for Economic Affairs, the party did not wish to prevent citizens from taking over the position of the President of the Congress in the event of a victory, and called this an act of transparency.
If he should actually take over the office, he hopes to convert the chamber into a house of respect and not to convert the insult or the void to make it more and more similar to the citizens.
Unfortunately, from time to time, the impression is that the only place where you can't talk quietly and let talk in Madrid is the Congress; so the President of the Government of the Senate was interrupted once up to 26 times.
At the same time, he praised the current President Manuel Martín and his good work and pointed out that he did not seem to have taken over the office, as otherwise his political opponents would call this arrogance.
Climate Paganda
Since the climate debate criticizes both the sceptics of climate change and those who put a social and political debate at the forefront of this issue, the movement as a whole must put strong cohesion on the ground.
Especially when it is a leader of the movement who, as in the case of President Zapatero, considers the fight against climate change to be more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even proposes to conclude a new treaty with the planet.
However, this proposal puts it in an emergency of explanation regarding the action or non-action of its government, which has contributed decisively to Spain's position within the EU at the forefront of the countries that have least met the requirements of the Kioto Protocol.
Who are the responsible for failing to comply with the requirements on which sectors this is due, and why did his government, who had proposed the Treaty with the planet, not stop this development?
In addition, it is now forced to explain to Spanish citizens the measures it intends to take to combat climate change without circumventing.
What companies will be affected by the changes to the behaviour of citizens, the individual and collective savings measures and the economic consequences of them.
More specifically, who has to sacrifice himself and will pay for the rescue of the planet.
However, there will and will not be any such statements in the future.
Just because it's about sacrifice and pay.
Because the measures that can be put into real action against climate change are unpopular.
They are costly, uncomfortable and threatening to the accounts of companies and citizens.
Even the petrol cent proposed by the PSOE seemed to be so dangerous that Zapatero was forced to withdraw the proposal.
Accordingly, it is now necessary to save the planet with nothing, i.e. with pure propaganda and empty speeches without any real consequences.
With impressive statements, Commission, committees, protocols and new offices.
With its contracts with the planet, the otherwise appropriate politicians for electoral campaigns do not have to speak, nor to charge, nor to demand, but instead to follow the demanding issue, to decorate the meetings and to enthusiasm others with its gentle courage and goodness.
However, this can only happen if the Treaty does not deviate from its virtual nature and therefore does not pretend that the bicycle will become the only means of moving in the future, or if we can only refreshen ourselves with one compartment.
The Mayor and Chief of Police of Totana due to an alleged settlement into a city-building corruption.
The Guardia Civil has arrested the mayor of the town of Totana, the popular politician José Martínez Andreo. Furthermore, the local police chief, the secretary of the mayor's office and a hotel entrepreneur were arrested today because of the suspected suspicion of city-building violations.
The council was arrested at his residence, from where he was taken to the Municipal Office and in whose premises he is located until now, surrounded by numerous agents who had also arrived at the municipal administration and the municipal construction line Suelo Industrial y Vivienda.
The three arrests are related to the flags already taken last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, which showed that more than 2 million hectares of unlocked building for urban projects should be redesigned under the direction of the Galisian construction firm Nuaria. This should be built on the property 4000 apartments after the local administration has been given it illegal commissions during the last legislature period.
In addition, although two other persons were not arrested directly, they were subject to an investigation procedure initiated and carried out by the first court of Totonas.
The first six arrests have been brought before the judge today.
According to investigative circles, the former mayor of Totana and current independent PP member Juan Morales are also identified.
His ex-wife, owner of a real estate company registered in Totana, as well as his current friend residing in Murcia, are under suspicion.
The chairman and owner of the Nuaria group, the lawyer and entrepreneur from Vigo Manuel N.A., was arrested in the village of Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as the Managing Director of Suelo de Inmonuar Pablo José M.G., whose company should have been a subgroup of Nuaria and received the lubricants.
The investigations are carried out by the Municipal Authority against urban crime under the supervision of the Central Unit of Guardia Civil, whose representatives carried out eleven further investigations in addition to the arrests, most of them in companies directly related to the arrests held in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
At that time only one person was arrested in Totana: the owner of a regional-known poultry breeding industry, who should have acted as a middle man.
The Nuaria group was commissioned to build the largest residential complex of the town of Murcia, which should include more than 5000 apartments, one golf course and two spa hotels.
The company acquired over 2.2 million square kilometres of area in Totana to rebuild. The aim was to achieve a construction project that would raise the population of the municipality to 25.000 inhabitants.
The group Nuaria includes other companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar that promote the sale of real estate; Conyase, which in Vigo occupies the parking spaces of the streets Coruña, Venezuela and Plaza Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, whose activity is limited to the sector of direct marketing and Preconiza, specializing in the promotion, sale and installation of construction elements.
Things that can happen
1.
If you agree, we will turn away from the term book of the month and instead try to invent a price name other names with appropriate competences.
I already have a proposal.
People, life means change.
Of course you are warmly invited to make your proposals.

Our Finnish correspondent explains the comment published yesterday in the most important Finnish newspaper, the Helsingin Sanomat, (Finland is also at the top of the PISA study), which refers to the note published in the same newspaper on November 18th; incidentally on the day the issue contained criticism of the book Blackburns.
The content of philosophy has become the public debate after the tragedy of the school of Jokela.
Responsible for the cruel murders is a Abiturian who quoted in his news the works of Platons and Nietzsche.
In an interview of the Helsingin Sanomat daily newspaper, Pekka Elo, the chairman of the Education Council for the Factory Philosophy asked teachers to take a more critical position on Platon and proposed to delete the Teaching Platons from the sub-stage curriculum for the Factory Philosophy of Gymnasia.

A colleague informs about the inclusion of illegal internet downloads in the Criminal Code:
A. The download of a song would be a breach of law, which would be subject to six months of imprisonment.
However, once again, if you rob a music business below a value of 400 euros, this is only considered a simple infringement (Article 623.1).
B. If you rob the business up to a value of 1000 euros, the theft is classified as a crime, but the penalty is less than a download (Article 234 Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and give it back forty hours later, then the penalty is still lower than at a download (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than in an exchange of music data.
To be involved in a rebellious dispute, a prison penalty of three to 12 months (Article 154 Criminal Code) takes place, while the exchange of data results in a withdrawal of six months to two years.
(Article 270 Criminal Code).
E. According to Article 184.2 of the Criminal Code, sexual harassment at work is considered less bad than downloading a DVD movie from the Internet.
F. Trade in copyright-protected films, whose authorization by the author has not taken place, is subject to a higher penalty than the distribution of pornographic film material to minors (Article 186).
Well, if my colleague is right, then someone has really screwed up his demands.

My doctor gives me one of his long, strange research articles entitled: money leads to activation of certain brain areas, especially if the others get more of it.
So the emotions resulting from the monthly pay depend on the salary of colleagues.
The study was produced by a tomographic-magnetic reference analysis at the University of Bonn and the results were published in the last edition of the Science Journal.
According to Bernd Webers, author of the study and director of the Bonner brain research center Life & Brain, activation was the strongest when the participant gave the right answers and his player failed.
The researchers realized that brain activity was always very moderate when both participants were right with their response and therefore also received the same salary; but if one of them received the double, there was also greater brain activity.
I am not quite sure whether it really takes so much scientific effort to achieve such a result.
The prosecutor from the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been inevitable after the crimes of the Balkans wars for eight years. Her office is in the prosecutor's office of the Criminal Court of the former Yugoslavia, established in La Haya.
Her mandate will expire at the end of the year and Carla will leave her office with a weeping and laughing eye, as the main leaders of the Srebrenica massacre - with the eight thousand Bosnian Muslims killed - namely the ex-General Ratko Mladic and former Serbia-Bosnian leader Radovan Karadzic remain on free foot.
Their names are listed on the list of the director Marcel Schüpbach from Switzerland as a presentation for the title of his documentary films La List de Carla (2006, in Spain not yet started); a film that, with the speed of a Polit-Thriller, follows the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York in their project to track the detected criminals and put pressure on the respective governments so that they can speed up their networks.
What insurance is best suited to me?
The KFZ insurance covering a possible injury caused by the driver includes a high cost burden, the amount of which is again dependent on different factors, including age, sex, time of drawing up the driver's licence, family status, type of car to be insured and its use, etc.
To own a car is just the beginning.
Because it is even more difficult to find the appropriate KFZ insurance than the right vehicle model.
First of all, one must be clear what we have to do here.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and an insurance holder.
This agreement shall be signed in writing by means of an insurance contract which stipulates that the company receives the agreed insurance premium and, in return, is obliged to present the corresponding amount of recoveries in the event of an injury.
The insurance premium is the price of an insurance scheme composed of several factors, including age, sex, time of drawing up the driving licence, family status, type of vehicle to be insured or its use.
Insurance companies shall determine their prices according to the statistics so that higher contributions will also be payable in the event of a higher risk of accident.
For this reason, both 25-year-olds and women need to make less contributions because statistics show that these groups have a lower accident rate thanks to their caution.
The same is true for married persons, as they tend to be less accidents than single persons according to statistical values and therefore also to the firm's conviction.
The benefits of the vehicle affect the frequency of driving and thus the likelihood of an accident.
The more frequent the use, the more likely the damage.
When setting up the premium, insurance must take into account a number of points.
For this reason, the driver also needs to study the situation thoroughly in order to select exactly the car insurance that meets his personal needs.
We are now listing up the most important points that should be considered when choosing insurance in order not only to make a performance but also to make a price-oriented choice.
The younger 25-year-olds face numerous obstacles in choosing a low-cost insurance, such as low driving practice and the young driving licence.
Even if it would be best for an ideal insurance protection to complete a full cashier insurance, there are still more affordable alternatives.
Careful drivers can choose a full cashroom with self-participation, so that the services of a full cashroom insurance cover, but are offered at a low price.
This type of contract implies that the customer must pay a part of the amount caused by the damage itself.
The amount is fixed before the conclusion of the contract and on the basis of the amount of the insurance premium. This is higher the amount to be paid, explains Luis Noguera, Spanish principal representative of First Europe, a online insurance intermediary.
Another option is the extended insurance that guarantees customers against external accident damage, but not damage caused by their own car.
In addition, this kind of insurance would cover theft, fire and vehicle loss.
Here's a advice.
When you are under 25 years old, it is in your hand to reduce insurance costs; so your credit increases by trying to drive carefully and avoid accidents.
A credit is a reduction in the base rate of the respective insurance company.
On the contrary, a penalty payment involves an increase in the said tariffs.
The amount of credits and penalties depends on society and their revenues.
If the company has a profitable year behind it, it may allow to increase the bonus payments, Noguera explains.
As soon as the 25-year brand is exceeded, it is easier for drivers to conclude a contract. Therefore, the fact is that with increasing driving practice the accident rate decreases.
Thus it is most useful to choose a full cash insurance with self-participation.
Usually, young people cannot benefit from their experience, both in the event of an accident and at the time of driving, explains the Spanish leader of the European company, and adds that the majority of accidents occur in the second year of practice after the fear of the beginners has been settled.
Nevertheless, it is more advisable for a married customer who does not have children to complete full-cargo insurance; of course only if it permits the financial situation of the person concerned.
Since the insurers, spouses with children are regarded as the customers with the lowest accident rate, and therefore their contributions are also low.
In this case, full cash insurance with self-participation (with a sum of 300 euros) would be the best option. In the event of a high credit, an extended insurance is recommended, which is only used for the third year of the vehicle.
They drive more relaxed and have a larger purchasing power that allows them to make a higher contribution payment, Luis Noguera determines.
For pensioners, it is possible to complete a full cashier insurance with self-participation (at an amount of EUR 150), or an extended insurance that only applies to a sufficiently high credit.
Finally, it must be noted that car insurance is something very important, not only because it protects the driver against possible accident damage, but also because it has high costs that require a thorough selection that corresponds to our personal situation.
Celtic Glasgow hopes in Milan at the point for the eighth final
The FC Milan and Celtic Glasgow will fight on Tuesday in San Siro for the point that they lack to achieve their respective goals before the Championship's first round. Italians need the point to get to the top of their group while they decide on their participation in Scotland.
The Italian team already has five points and has already confirmed its participation in the fifth round with an undecided in Portugal, while Celtic Glasgow with nine points needs another one to make sure that FC Shakhtar with six points does not collect the Befica Lisbon with four points.
The two games of Group D will take place one week before the end of the sixth round, as the FC Milan has to join the FIFA Club World Championship in Japan, where he will fight for the first entry to the final on the 16th in the 13th semifinals.
So this group will be closed before all others and the undecided in the Guiseppe Meazza stadium to the expected result, even if both teams will try to win. The Italians will not want to speculate at home the Celtic Glasgow, which they would know in the event of a victory group prize and thus have a better starting position in the eighth final.
The team of Gordon Strachan could even suffice a defeat to qualify at a slope of FC Shakhtar. Nevertheless, he should not rely too much on such circumstances, because at nine points equation is to the Ukrainians; they had lost last week in Glasgow (2-1) but could win at the second game (2-0).
So the Milan countries will try to rent the shoots the evening. They again hope to reach the eighth final of the reformed championship for the second time in a row, after they were defeated in exactly the same round by a gate of cake in the aftermath time (1-0) and by a zero to zero undecided on the replay.
While Shakhtar is waiting for the Rossoneri victory, the team will have to focus on its own game, as both the accomplishment of the eighth final and its membership of the UEFA depend on its victory and a defeat of Celtic Glasgow.
In spite of its lower table position and without the prospect of continuing to participate in the largest European championship, Benfica Lisbon could win the third place and thus participate in the UEFA.
20,000 people visit the first concert of the Spice Girls Tour in Vancouver.
The Spice Girls gave the start shot in the Canadian Vancouver in front of 20,000 spectators for their first tour after the dissolution of the band in 2000.
'Posh Spice '(Victoria Beckham),' Scary Spice '(Melanie Brown),' Baby Spice '(Emma Bunton),' Sporty Spice '(Melanie Chisholm) y' Ginger Spice '(Geri Halliwell) explained shortly before the start of their concert at the GM Place de Vancouver stadium that the mood in the reunited band was excellent.
Around the 20,000 people were able to experience the concert in the sold out stadium, in which a video was shown on the history of the band, which had taken care of Furore at the end of the 1990s.
The reunification and the world tour overlap with the publication of a new album, which includes its largest hits and two more new songs, headlines and voodoo, and which appears in Spain under EMI's label.
The five members of the Spice Girls wore gold bracelets on the stage, which the husband of Posh Spice, the English footballer David Beckham, had previously given them.
The athlete was among the footprints in the audience that led the GM Palace to glow, although the nerves of his spouse Victoria had forbidden him in the previous days.
While preparing for the shoe, Victoria Beckham assumed that the British star didn't get our wardrobe on the face a single time, and that's why I'm really excited about what he's going to keep from the show.
Sporty Spice, whose departure from the group in 1998 resulted two years later in the dissolution of the group due to internal differences, expressed her nervousness two hours before the concert at a press conference.
I was shocked.
I was nervous, but I saw that the attitude of the world public had changed, that the feelings of the Spice Girls had changed.
And that is why I thought why not; so I am glad to have made this decision, Chisholm spoke about the separation of the band that she had initiated nine years ago.
The singer also said that the disputes have been resolved and now everyone is very happy again.
Nevertheless, many things have changed since the last joint appearance of the Spice Girls in 1998.
The group first arrived, according to the report of the TV broadcast CTV, in a special machine of Virgin Airlines in Vancouver.
When they arrived at the airport, the band was received by a army of children's girls.
The five have seven children together.
After the concert in Vancouver, the band will be next in California, San José (on December 4th) and Los Angeles (on December 5th and 7th).
In Madrid they will enter the stage on December 23rd.
New fears about natural gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
A new price dispute between Ukraine and Russia increases the risk of Russian exports of fuel to Western Europe.
The majority of Russian gas exports to the European Union (EU) are led by Ukraine and every dispute between the two nations is very closely monitored.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price it has to pay for natural gas, it will charge higher transit charges by Russia.
A previous conflict between the two states last year reduced deliveries to the EU countries.
The recent dispute between Kiev and Moscow takes place at a time when the Ukrainian government and the Russian state gas monopoly Gazprom are trying to reach an agreement on how much Ukraine has to pay for Russian natural gas in 2008.
According to Gazprom, Ukraine needs to be calculated more as the group has agreed to pay up to 50% extra for natural gas from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say that this could mean that Ukraine has to pay 40% more for Gazprom imports.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states in conversations," said the economic minister of Ukraine Anatoli Kinakh of the news agency Reuters.
"The changing gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the level of transit charges [to Western Europe] via Ukraine."
In the last major natural gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006, Gazprom's deliveries to Ukraine were reduced.
This resulted in a fall in exports to Western Europe, which led to a dramatic rise in prices.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the European Union's supply.
Russia has the world's largest gas reserves, but many of them remain underdeveloped.
The result is that Gazprom complements its own supplies of gas from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian former Soviet nations.
NHS "must control foreign workers"
The Scottish State Health Service has to improve the checks on the pre-criminal registers for workers from outside Europe, said a member of the control body.
The recommendation of the principal financial controller Robert Black came after a foreign doctor in Scotland was brought together with the attack on Glasgow Airport in June.
Black also expressed concerns that the Scottish State Health Service has no precise ideas regarding the number of foreign employees.
However, his report pointed out that other important checks on a sample of five health authorities were carried out correctly.
The main financial controller investigated personnel recruited outside the European Economic Area countries as a result of the attack on Glasgow Airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after a land car was driven through the doors of the main airport terminal.
He was one of three doctors who appeared in the Old Bailey in October in a video transmission and was charged in connection with the alleged car bomb attack in Great Britain.
It is expected that the State Health Service will carry out checks prior to the recruitment of foreign employees to ensure that they have the necessary qualifications, experience and authorizations to work in the United Kingdom.
Although the health authorities use Disclosure Scotland to review pre-criminal registers, the Agency does not have the competence to obtain this information outside the UK.
The main auditor's report now states, in addition to other recommendations, that the board should address guidelines on criminal justice, which help employers in controls in different countries.
"Although we found evidence of these checks in some staff documents, they were not routinely carried out."
Black said that the Scottish health authorities would follow their investigative guidelines in advance of recruitment to a great extent, but added: "Our report identifies areas in which the system can be improved to ensure that accurate information on the number of foreign healthcare workers is available."
BMA Scotland Chairman Dr. Peter Terry said it was "extremely unlikely" that investigations prior to the recruitment of potential NHS employees would identify people who could commit future terrorist attacks.
"The report states that current pre-employment tests of the NHS Scotland work well and it is not clear what added value the recommendations will provide," he said.
The Scottish health authorities say that they currently have 1,161 foreign employees, the vast majority of them doctors and nurses.
However, the financial controller warned that the number was likely to be higher, also because the board had problems identifying those employees who were admitted for an indefinite period.
The investigation continued to establish that established control procedures by NHS authorities in Ayrshire, Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian have been largely complied with.
These include passport, work permits, and qualification checks.
The Scottish Government is currently reviewing its policy and guidelines on pre-recruitment controls for foreign personnel in the NHS.
The Secretary for Health Nicola Sturgeon said: "It was my concern to carry out this work in view of the terrorist attack at Glasgow Airport."
It added that the Scottish Government, in conjunction with the health authorities, would take into account the recommendations of the report and ensure that the best practices would be reflected in updated guidelines on control investigations prior to the recruitment of all employees - including those from abroad - whose publication is planned next month.
Joy Division dominates film prize award
Control, the film biography about the late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis has inaugurated five prizes at the British Independent Film Festival, among other things for the best movie.
Awards were also awarded to Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse before he was cast for the role of Curtis, director Anton Corbijn, and nephew manufacturer Toby Kebbell.
Dame Judi Dench was awarded as the best major actress for the Thriller Notes on a Scandal.
And Bond actress Daniel Craig won the Variety Award for putting the British movie into the world public.
The prices were passed in a ceremony at the London Roundhouse.
Control follows Curtis's rise to glory with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 with 23 years.
The black-and-white film - on whose Soundtrack The Killers, David Bowie and New Order are to be found - was played for just 3 million British pounds.
Nevertheless, he has introduced two prizes to the Dutch photographer Corbijn, which has been most famous for the cult cover of the U2 album Joshua Tree - as the best director and the best director debut.
Rockmusic was the focus of another prize winner at the ceremony - when Julian Temple's film about the Clash singer Joe Strummer got the prize for the best documentary film.
The prize for the best actor went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as a driver of a Russian Mafiabosse in David Cronenberg in London playing Thriller Easter Promises.
Ray Winstone, who is in the reputation of playing tough guys, picked up the Richard Harris Prize for his outstanding contribution to the British movie.
The 50-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nil by Mouth and Sexy Biest, is currently filming the Indiana Jones Continuation The Kingdom of the Chrystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud to get the prize named to honor the Camelot and Harry Potter Stars Harris who died in 2002.
"There were people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors for people like me," he said.
"I was lucky to meet Richard Harris a few times.
He is my type of man, a great actor of his time, I am truly honored. "
The independent film prices, known as bifas, are selected by a group of filmmakers, actors and festival organisers.
Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
208 arrested in Saudi Arabia for a terrorist settlement
Saudi Arabia discovered yesterday that it arrested 208 militants because of their belonging to cells that had planned a forthcoming attack on an oil situation as well as on mental and security forces.
The state television of the world's largest oil exporter said that one of the cells was planning to smuggle missiles.
Sympathisants of Al-Qaida have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been an ally of the United States since 2003, following the invasion into Iraq.
A cell of eight militants, led by a foreign citizen, planned an attack on an oil system in the eastern province, according to the television report.
Saudi Arabia has formed a 35,000 man strong rapid intervention force to protect plants after a failed Al Quaida attack on the world's largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report, referring to an internal ministerial statement, says that 18 of the arrests belonged to a cell led by a "missile expert" who illegally immigrated into the country.
He reported that the militants had planned to smuggle eight projectiles into the kingdom.
Another 22 of the detainees had the report's intention to kill mental and security forces.
The government has warned humanists to do more to stop Saudis striving for Iraq to cooperate with Al Qaida militias, who want to fight the Allied Armed Forces and the US-supported Shiitic Muslim Government, which are considered to be kettle by the Hardliners under the Sunni Saudi Arabia.
Al Qaida militias consider many spiritual people in Saudi Arabia to be in cooperation with the authorities in support of the policy of the royal family that dominates the government.
The militias - accompanied by calls from Osama bin Laden, the Al Qaida leader born in Saudi Arabia, to target it on the prowestern Saudi government - are looking for foreign residential areas, government buildings and installations of the energy sector.
"This was a very great effort of the security forces over the last five months," a spokesman of the Ministry of the Interior informed state television.
The arrests also concerned a "media cell" of 16 from Medina, which aimed to advertise the "Takfiri thinking" - the ideology of radical sunnitic Muslims supporting violence against Muslims that are burned as unbelievers and desecrated.
Among the arrested were also 32 people accused of providing financial support to the militia.
The climate on the Venus could show a view of the future of the earth
The Venus was perhaps once a pleasant place to live, scientists said yesterday.
Data from a European spaceship on a runway show that the planet is even more similar to a deflected twin of the earth than has been aware so far.
The Venus is the nearest planetary neighbor of the earth.
The two worlds have about the same size and have similar planets, but the Venus of the Sun is a little closer.
Billions of years ago, on Venus conditions that would have been very similar to those on earth and could even have been habitable, scientists believe today.
But because of the unbraked carbon dioxide greenhouse effect, the erosion of the atmosphere through sunlight and a slower rotational rate, the Venus took a completely different development course.
Today the planet is robbed by water and has a surface temperature that is hot enough to melt lead and is devastated by hurricane-strong winds and lighthouses.
The knowledge of the Venus Express spatial probe of the European Space Agency, which has examined the plants for a year, gives a breathtaking look at how the Earth could develop in view of the disastrous climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor from the Department of Physics at the University of Oxford, one of the heads of the Venus Express Mission, said: "It becomes clear why the climate on the Venus is so different from that of the earth, while the planets are otherwise fairly similar."
"Our new data enables us to construct a scenario in which Venus has begun billions of years like Earth, possibly with a living environment."
"Enriched uranium" seized by the police
A kilo of radioactive material, according to reports enriched uranium, was seized yesterday by Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police officer said that three people were arrested and that the material is being checked.
He did not confirm whether it was enriched uranium, but said that it could have been sold for a million dollars (480,000 pounds).
All still open
Mitt Romey said he doesn't consider it worthy of a presidential candidate to be questioned by a snowman.
Nevertheless, the Republican candidate for the Presidency finally agreed to hold a debate on YouTube, in which normal voters take up and submit questions on video to send them to the candidate.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday evening, 28 November, were as ridiculous as the Snowman, the Democrats questioned about global warming in the YouTube debate of the other party.
But the questions, and the answers, this time exactly reflected the state of the Republican party that breaks up in the elections next year.
It is not known, just as the producers of CNN who supported the debate with the YouTube Clips to show the upcoming candidates.
However, in the first half-hour of the debate, which was the longest dedicated to a single subject, immigration was at the heart of the debate.
The theme is one of the most powerful issues for Republicans.
The CNN asked a group of undetermined voters to use a selection disc when they heard things they liked: the TV station noticed the peak of the consent when the candidates spoke strictly across the borders.
The sharpest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national leader, and Romney, who moved forward in the decisive surveys in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani is trying to shake off the reputation that he had been deliberate about illegal immigration when he was Mayor of New York.
He attacked Romney in accusing the former Governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants for work at his house.
The two were particularly fierce as questioners asked whether one of the candidates would support a "amnesty" (the illegal people give a regular status and the possibility of citizenship).
Insignificant candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California Congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado Congressman, succeeded in hitting this topic.
None of the two men have serious chances of nomination, but they both remain in the race, perhaps because they have struck the immigration passage earlier and harder than others.
At least in the area of immigration, candidates generally share the same views: tighter borders, intolerance to illegal migrants.
This topic, along with fears about toxic toys from China or other concerns about the rest of the world, helps Republicans forget or minimize the differences between liberal and Christian conservatives.
But the debate was clearly problematic when other issues were raised.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he had supported arms restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney discussed whether simulated drowning should be considered torture.
One of the questioners asked whether the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
This led to Giuliani's position that although the Bible was his favorite book, he may not literally believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another questioner asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now against all expectations in the first place in a recent survey in Iowa thanks to his long Christian Conservativism - said that the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When he was pressed for whether Jesus would support them, he laughed about it and said Jesus was too intelligent to apply for a political office.
The race remains exceptionally wide open.
Huckabee's rise in Iowa is together with Ron Paul's recent donations and his applause storms in the debate of Wednesday.
These two have been shot up out of nowhere because the two wings of the party have not yet been able to agree on one of the more famous and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate united the party from the beginning and convincingly united with a victorious message about the size of America and a trigger to both the parties' wings.
This time the party is split and the result is far from clear.
Pain of the Labour Party
Gordon Brown has discovered another pit to fall into; his way out of this remains the same.
For British scandals, this is not very sloppy.
No noble title appears to have been sold, no politician paid Paris hotel bills, no extramarital toes have been licked.
But the discovery that a rich businessman has hid donations to the British Government Labour Party over £650,000 ($1.3 million) over four years under the name of other people, and that the party has failed to report this, is something without which the contested Gordon Brown would have passed well.
When two months ago the Prime Minister had withdrawn the demand for a election, in a stupid way insulting the British intelligence by claiming that opinion surveys had not influenced this decision, there was hope that he would offer a robust, efficient government.
Instead, as Vince Cable, who is increasingly sharp chairman of the Liberal Democrats, expressed it, the once-feared Brown of Stalin has developed to Mr. Bean.
The unforgettable rescue of Northern Rock, a hit bank, showed regulatory weakness and poor judgment under fire.
Poorly thought-out proposals to amend tax laws have brought company associations against the government.
The loss of personal data by the tax authorities of 25 million people showed unthinkable administrative piracy.
A trio of generals in retirement started a rebellion in the upper house from protest against reductions in military expenditure: to be Minister of the Armed Forces, they claimed to be a part-time job.
Now there are the numerous donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Secretary-General of Labours (and her former leader of performance) has already resigned.
None of this means that Brown will return irrevocably in the direction of resignation.
However, governments can reach a turning point after which they feel it is impossible to rule.
Neither do people like nor trust politicians, but they usually withhold their scepticism when a new troop takes the office.
Once it is clear that it is unlikely that a Prime Minister will improve the situation, and he will not even be there for a long time, this delay is over: public service is starting to become undeniable; cabinet ministers are starting to talk; the press is looking for bad news; and the government is becoming defensive and dodless.
In a way, Brown's position is particularly difficult because, unlike other political leaders, he cannot claim to be a new beast.
As much as he would deny Tony Blair, he was his lieutenant.
The problems with Northern Rock and the tax records, for example, are linked to decisions taken by Brown as the Chancellor of the Ministry of Finance.
And even if it was not directly involved in Blair's misfortune - like the long "money for noble titles" investigation of political party funding - the voters might assume that it was him.
Nevertheless, Brown's location is not as bad as it looks
The mistakes are not as horrible as the Conservatives describe them.
As with Mr. Bean, no one died or was completely cheated.
And the antidote, painful as it may be, is to deliver what Browns, of course, always promised stalinist tendencies: a reliable, solid and slightly brutal government.
The new ability to give political donations is a good example.
The Garboese Abrahams, who compares his donations with his non-profit gifts, says he does not wish for public recognition for his well-being.
That may be the case, but the decision was not to him.
The laws against anonymity for large political contributors are clear and they exist for a clear reason: the public has the right to know who can buy access to those who govern the country.
Watt, who says he knew about Abraham's agreement, but not that it is illegal, will of course have to ask some questions; just like Jon Mendlesohn, the main financial driver of the lab, who was told about the strange donations in October.
But so far Brown is not involved: there is nothing that suggests that he knew about these confusion, even though most of the payments were made after his take-over in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half the work.
He quickly condemned the violation of the laws by his party, but he watered this determination through the grip according to a well-known instrument, an investigation committee on the subject - in order to complete the measure, by a bishop in retirement and a judge.
In this case, the "lessons to be learned" are not very complicated.
If the law was broken, it's a matter for the police.
Apart from that, there are other things that Mr Brown has to do, like finding something permanent chairman of the independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, which has been unoccupied for six months, and moving forward with a thorough reform of political party funding.
This would require the hardliners of the Labour to cooperate with the Conservatives and possibly to abandon the special financial relationship with the trade unions - bitter pills for a party owner like Mr Brown.
But he should be aware of some party facts.
The Conservatives now have a clear leadership in the opinion surveys; he has to win back two years for voters; and the only way he can achieve a victory is through incontrovertible righteousness and solid competence.
Map shark
Does the credit crisis start America's credit card market?
If blood is in the water, it's only natural that back flushing around.
Now that America's real estate market is crooked, the predators have the country's credit card market in sight.
Analysts from Goldman Sachs expect that credit card losses could reach $99 billion if the risk of the sticking of underfunded loans spreads to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in both the borrowings and the rate of collateral which measure the proportion of loans that are not recoverable or are more than 30 days late.
The HSBC announced last month that it has taken a $1.4 billion fee collection from its American consumer financing, partly due to the weakness of credit card holders.
It's still too early to panic.
Losses and sawmills are still low.
According to the Moody rating agency, the third-quarter säumnis rate of 3.89% was almost a full percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in rates can be partly explained by technical factors.
A change in US private insolvency law in 2005 resulted in a sudden case of bankruptcy claims, which in turn represent a large part of the loss of credit card; the number of declarations (and thus säumnisation fees) would increase again whether the general conditions for borrowers deteriorate or not.
Industry also reports on sound payment rates that show how much of their debts consumers pay off every month
and confidence in credit card-based securities is quite strong, despite the standstill in other corners of structured financing.
Dennis Moroney from the TowerGroup, a research company, expects that spending volumes for 2007 will ultimately be 25% higher than last year.
There are certainly direct infections between the real estate credit crisis and the credit card market: it is more likely that consumers receive credit card debts now that home credit is wiped out.
However, the card exhibitors look at the cash flow instead of capital values, so falling house prices do not necessarily solve a change in the credit dignity of the borrower.
You can even be of benefit to the card exhibitors.
The incentives for consumers to continue to pay mortgage rates fall if the real estate is less than the value of the loan; as a result, card debts become more important under the repayment priorities.
Map exhibitors can also respond much faster and more flexible than creditors to the more stormy conditions by changing interest rates or credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of a rapid revaluation of assets.
"We will not wake up one day and reassess the loans completely," says Gary Perlin, Capital One's principal financial rapporteur.
Even if a sudden undercover crisis in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of sustainable degradation are significantly more real.
If lower domestic prices and a credit reduction push America into the recession, industry will undoubtedly face a more grim future.
Keep looking for these sharks.
British benches confess guilty in the case of Enron
Three British bankers who should be brought to court for their role in the fraudulent system with the former head of finance of Enron, Andrew Fastow, changed their requests in guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew initially pleaded innocent for seven cases of fraud using telecommunications for the alleged conspiracy with Fastow in a secret financial fraud in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of their employer.
The procedure had been initiated on January.
But during a hearing in court in the U.S. district judge Ewing Werlein Junior, everyone pleaded guilty of fraud using telecommunications.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, were known in Britain during extradition procedures that lasted two years.
In the United States, their case is a loose end of an investigation started after Enron's collapse in 2001.
The accusations originally filed against them in 2002 pointed out that Fastow was the aim of an investigation by the government in relation to Enron's defeat.
The prosecution against the banks - called "NatWest Three" - claims that they had come to Houston in 2000 to cover a fraudulent plot with Fastow and his former top counselor Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of Enron, which was controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of countless fraudulent enron companies that contributed to ripping the company into the bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the Bank had estimated the value of its participation in the subsidiary at zero, but the three British men knew that it was actually significant.
A company under Kopper's control acquired the Bank's shares in the subsidiary for a million dollars.
The banks paid copper $250,000 for a participation in this company.
According to the charges, Fastow incorrectly represented Enron that the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But in fact, the $20 million went to the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The banks received 7.3 million dollars, while fastow, copper and others saw about 12.3 million dollars, according to the charges.
In January 2004, Fastow was guilty of conspiracy in two charges for his role in the Enron's plea.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow has a six-year-old prison sentence in Louisiana's federal prison.
Kopper has a penalty of three years and a month in a facility in Texarkana.
Each of the three men was on a free foot due to a $1 million deposit that made it necessary for them to live in the United States in anticipation of the trial.
Enron, once the seventh largest company of the nation, broke into bankruptcy in December 2001, after years of accounting tricks could no longer conceal billions of debts or make weakening businesses appear profitable.
The collapse destroyed thousands of jobs, more than 60 billion market values and more than two billion dollars of pension plans.
The Enron founder Kenneth Lay and the former Chairman of the Board of Directors Jeffrey Skilling were sentenced last year for their roles in connection with the Enron collapse.
Skilling has a penalty of more than 24 years.
Lays convictions for conspiracy, fraud and other charges were void after he died last year for heart disease.
Not quite down in Moscow
The price of a plane of the Gulfstream G550 brand, equipped with a Rolls Royce engine and enough reach to fly non-stop from Moscow to Los Angeles, is at least 54 million dollars.
But that's small money for some of the rich Russians.
"It offers room for up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
"But none of you ask for so many seats because it's for a private family or a company president."
Firer was at the Gulf Stream last Friday at the Millionaire Exhibition, a four-day orgy of a conceived consumption, which was held in a shattered exhibition centre on the edge of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury providers had built exhibitions, hoping to interest new Russians in everything, from mahagoni-captured yachts to diamond-coated car barbecue that would be appropriate for 50 cents.
Firer carefully took a shiny orange Porsche at the nearest exhibition stand in sight.
"This is a nice car, but it's small money compared to us," he said.
"According to the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft."
Heated by an oil tree, the Russian capital seems to flood with money like Dallas to its glorious times.
"We went through the same phase in the 1890s, when some Americans came to huge wealth and went to scarce Europe where they were considered materialistic," said Marshall Goldman, a scientist at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudi Arab crowds of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians appear as the most visible freely-donors in the world.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share in the golden rush.
Otherwise in Moscow, this week a conference of the luxury industry Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the chairman of LVMH, attracted to exchange ideas on how to sell high-priced goods on markets like Russia.
(The conference is organised by The International Herald Tribune, which belongs to the New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billionaires, which have a total of 282 billion dollars, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, 103,000 Russian millionaires belong to the second class, worth 670 billion dollars together, according to a study on the development of private assets in the former Soviet Union, written by economic experts from the Centre for Economic and Financial Research, an expert body here.
(The World Bank says that in 2005 15.8 percent of the Russians lived below the minimum of existence.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative of David Morris, a London jewelry.
She had visited the fair for the first time together with the Russian trader of the brand, the Soho Jewelry Group.
"The women are all well-cared and the men are all worth a fortune."
While they go through the halls on Sunday night, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, call themselves and their clients millionaires.
"I have looked for the cars and I try to choose between the infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche," said Mrs Yumatova, who delivered the designer's clothes she wore, like a red carpet veteran with Joan Rivers.
The trade fair seemed to aim primarily at the newly rich, the type of brand-conscious Russian buyers who would be willing to stand in the stool for several hours to visit an adjacent warehouse, which sophisticated Cadillac Escalades, pocket knives from platinum, Furvenpick ice cream, tailored billiard tables, apartments in Dubai and Gund Teddyars next to each other.
The public could buy tickets for 30 euros (44.57 dollars).
"The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and best," said Mr. Gijrath, who sat patriotically at a fair stand of the Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft in front of a wall-sized imitation of a Rembrandt image made of handpainted blue mosaic stones.
"Of course, Russians are more interested in clipper clippers."
In fact, the dealers here say that the Russians with old money (10 to 15 years old according to Russian standards) have already moved from large-scale logos to the kind of sober brands with limited numbers that would not be marketed at a trade show.
Yet several thousand people, whether millionaires, messengers of millionaires or simply tourists, pushed through the halls every day.
And some of them bought.
On the first night of the show last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the general manager of King Koil beds here said he had sold two $70,000 mattress sets made of silk, cashmir and cotton, with sewn gold thread.
Also in the first night Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales manager for A1 Moto, a company equipped high-end cars with high-end alarm systems that his company sold the cruel orange Porsche for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
Until Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, the president of L.A. Connection, a company that adapts luxury cars to customer wishes, said he had sold three car cooler grill for a Rolls-Royce Phantom, which is similar to the interconnected chain armbands, for $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter an autopsy designed for a Russian casino owner, with memories he had covered with colored Swarovski crystals, so it looked like a rouletterad.
The cost is $22.000 for a four-rate replacement.
"The Russian millionaire, the strawberry wheels or a picture of his wife's face from Cuban zirconium will not necessarily drive on these wheels," said Karapetian.
"He'll keep it in his 30 or 40 car garage."
Although many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr Karapetian said that the phrase "Russian Millionaries" would not express much exclusivity at the moment, given the rise of local real estate prices.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, they are probably already millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash," he said.
"There are more of them than you believe."
Those who were not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich at a level operated by Alliance Continental, a Russian asset management company.
The company had set up four red phone cells according to British model, which had been completely stopped with mountains of false millions of dollars.
Azad Karryev, the marketing director of the company, said his employees had printed 500,000 false banknotes for the millionaire fair.
Passengers stopped to throw around the money bunks, mobile phone photos while they reject themselves in the middle of the spare wealth, to let friends cut off, or simply to put in a few million.
"See, in Moscow everyone can feel like a millionaire," said Mr Karryev.
Fucked-up operation suspected of death in New Jersey
It was the day before the Erntedankfest when Ronald Livingston saw through the large glass window of Just a Little Healthier restaurants here and watched an ambulance on the white Cape Cod holding two doors further down on West Scott Avenue.
Soon there was a police car there.
And then there was another one.
"Then I saw the cassette car arriving from the medical coroner," said Livingston, a supervisor of the restaurant, on Wednesday.
"That was the point when I knew someone had died."
The authorities learned that the dead Mrs. Olga Arroyo, 41, was an assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
Now the investigators are trying to find out if she died because of a process carried out by an unauthorized cosmetic surgeon that the police did not identify, and who worked at the house at West Scott Avenue 212.
The authorities have not yet discovered what caused Mrs Arroyo's death, and are hopeful that toxicological investigations, whose results could not be available for weeks, will help clarify a mysterious death that has sent a grief through the leadership of the Newark police.
Ms. Arroyo has been an assistant to the police director Garry F. McCarthy since September 2006 and her voice has been known to many in the department.
"She was loyal, hard-working and stubborn," Mr McCarthy said about Mrs Arroyo in a telephonic interview on Wednesday.
"She was my pitbull.
She protected me. "
McCarthy said that Mrs. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer working for the alcohol control committee, and she leaves two sons, 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokesperson for Union County prosecutor, Theodore J. Romankow, said that investigators would try to determine whether Arroyo died as a result of an unauthorised surgical treatment.
"This is one of the possibilities," said Mrs Walsh.
"It's an ongoing investigation."
The authorities said they arrived at the house at about 3: 00 in the afternoon in November.
And they found Mrs. Arroyo on a sofa.
She was declared dead on site.
More than a week has passed and the authorities have reported little about their investigation or about the owner of the house, which is listed as Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh didn't want to say if Mrs Castro was questioned by the authorities.
The investigators are trying to determine whether part of the house has been used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Mrs. Castros' house, where a welded rosemary stands in the narrow front yard and a Dalmatiner bells behind the house.
A blue barrel written with "Ethyl vanillin" - used as a substitute for vanilla in foods and parfums - sat in the parking lot next to a door that led to the underfloor.
Two mountain bikes were hanging from hooks on one side.
McCarthy said that when he first arrived in Newark, after spending 25 years with the New York Police Department, Ms. Arroyo was of unappreciable value and helped him find himself in the provincial and hard political culture in his new city.
"She said, 'You have to watch this or that', he said.
"She was always here when I got here and she was always here when I left.
It was embarrassing. "
Hope that the central bank will reduce interest rates will lead to an increase in world markets
The shares sprang on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday, after market openings that the central bank will try to calm the credit markets by further interest reductions, were strengthened by modesty comments by the Vice-President of the US Central Bank.
The stock markets rose in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kahn, the number 2 of Ben Bernanke, the president of the Central Bank, said that policy had to respond "flexibly and pragmatically" to the persistent pressure on financial markets.
In a clear effort to calm down devastating markets, given signs of rising credit tensions, Kohn said the recent turbulence had "partly reversed some of the improvements in market functions from late September and October."
If the increased turbulence would remain, it would increase the possibility of further tightening up the financial conditions for consumers and businesses, he said.
The comments were taken by investors as a signal that the Central Bank is willing to intervene and to stabilise credit conditions with new capital injections into the US markets and possible further interest reductions.
The statements also helped the Wall Street to calm down, given further bad news from the US economy, now that sales of US real estate reached a new record depth in October.
The consequences of financial turbulence were highlighted by the announcement by Bear Stearns, the investment bank, that it would eliminate 650 jobs, or 4% of its worldwide workers, in a cost reduction measure to compensate for serious losses from their lost bets in the US mortgage credit sector.
It is expected that only 20 of these posts will disappear in London where the Bank employs 1,500 employees.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Index jumped by 331 points, or 2.55 percent to close at 13.289.40, while the wider S & P 500 index increased by 2.65 percent.
In London, the FTSE 100 index increased by 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent to close at 6.306.2, which added more than 39 billion pounds to the value of British standard values.
Germany's index Dax increased by 2.6 per cent and France's CAC40 increased by 2.3 per cent.
Prior to this, the re-emergence of credit pressure on the markets had been underlined after strong demand for an auction of three-month guarantee funds from the European Central Bank granted to the European Commercial Banks has been awarded significantly 4.7 per cent, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England, the US Central Bank and the European Central Bank to follow and to feed further capital into the London monetary markets increased when the credit tensions were seen to increase the three-month Libor rates for borrowing between UK banks by 6.59 percent to their peak since late September, following a continuous increase since 21 November.
England confronted with decision on the statements of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here two dilemmas, each almost as difficult as the other.
Who's supposed to be number six for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, not less relevant in a wider context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who is to make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the electoral chairman, is here, at least under this special title, to help Chief Coach Peter Moores and Captain Michael Vaughan to decide, and because the table of High Morries, the English Managing Director, is gradually filled with applications for national electoral offices, if not even for those in part-time.
Whoever does not get the sixth battle position will be unhappy, but life is often unfair and sport is undoubtedly.
It is never easy to straighten out exactly what makes it possible for a person to reach the top of his professions, while someone else never gets over the lowest rank, sometimes because of lack of happiness instead of ability.
It is not only in cricket where selection is difficult, where judgments are required that are always subjective at the end.
Is it the right time for Bopara to get up?
Is it fair to Shah if he does?
The same may also be asked in another area, for example, whether John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both intelligent young managers with good qualifications that know the business, should be promoted.
Who can say what the right class is for a cricket player unless he is given the opportunity to swim or undergo.
Of course, figures have a great influence on decisions, but opportunities have this too.
Within a team, a cricket player has to catch the captain's eye at the right time when he can take a wicket and a hit has to get regular chances on order if he wants to make an impression as a single day cricket player.
Catching the eyes of the voters is more complicated.
There were many who were better in the last season than, for example, when James Anderson was, who apparently will play in the first test, even if Stephen Harmison declares himself healthy and how the wind tickles into the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets with 33 runs each to earn a position in this tour.
Chris Tremlett only took 29 with the same modest average, but both had their shine points and hoped for even more.
Whether Shah or Bopara are playing at the Asgiriya Stadium can only be a question of vision.
The choice could decide the careers of both men, or it might make little difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka Gareth Batty played in every test and was successful in the first, with five wickets and 40 useful runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, still fighting to consolidate at that time, which created the breakthrough to a significant test cricket player and who, although pointing a double hundred against Australia in Australia, may still be underestimated.
It is likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores will follow their conservative instincts and abdominal feeling for Shah's greater experience of Bopara's youth enthusiasm after another discussion in the course of today's network meeting at the Asgiriya Stadium.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah, his sparkling and valuable 88 test debut innings in Bombay, 43 first-class hundreds and only six by Bopara, who is seven years younger at 22 years old, and an excellent balance against turned bullets.
But Shah only made ten runs in his two innings in May against West Indies in the test in Lord, his home arena as a player from Middlesex, and this, in addition to his immediate rejection from the electors as Vaughan was healthy to withdraw his position for the next game, seems to have taken the swing from his beat that was still obvious in Bombay.
On the other hand, the allone woman from Essex is delighted to live.
He was impressed by nothing in a cricket square and his attitude beyond it was brought to the point when he had recently crossed a vehicle with four-wheel drive in an exhibition for England's sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was to pick up his vodafone (of course also sponsor) and call his team colleagues Alastair Cook, who had seen this from the distance, and say with enthusiasm, "Have you seen that?"
Bopara is a much better field player, he tickles his middle pace with some effect here on the playing fields, which seems to fit him and beats with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, the right time to choose another.
Maybe this is the real art of selection.
I tend to give Bopara his chance now, which does not mean that Shah may not be well if, as the Ceylon tea kit suggests, he is the one who will play here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to fight Al-Quaida
The first bus loads of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, with a stream of displaced persons whose money or visas have expired, and others who hoped that the city would return to normality.
Some had even come back to fight the rebels they had displaced from their houses.
At Mansour bus station, before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen buses, the terminal was operating with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned to private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after they had killed many doctors in Baghdad," said Sabah Al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today because of what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspaper about what happened in Baghdad, and how it would be safe now."
They say that the Mahdi army has stopped killing people, "he said, in relation to the shite militias of the militante clerk Moqtada Al-Sadr, who has ordered to restore his forces at this time.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shian teacher from the overwhelming sunnical part of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he could not renew his Syrian visa and because the regime does not allow Iraqi to work.
His Shiite neighbours in Amariyah called him to tell him that a local militia supported by the United States has helped to relocate Al-Qaida from their bastion in the west of the capital, and forced him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan was the leader of a Sunni and Shiite tribe who had been driven out of his house in Sleikh in northern Baghdad by an attack with hand grenades after he had asked his fellow citizens to fight Al-Qaidas.
He was coming back to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they started one of the anti-Al-Qaida militia in Sleikh and that they needed my support and those of my boys.
That's why I returned today, "said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many reported that they had been relieved by the increasing tranquility in the capital since the U.S. army elevation and the growth of local "groups affected" citizens who armed and defended their city districts in cooperation with the American military.
But more spoke of being forced home by visa problems and devastating funds in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis had fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old three-year-old, expressed the general suspicion among the exilants that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shian Prime Minister, had asked the Syrian Government to impose visa restrictions on refugees to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people have probably fled from the sectarian death squadrons in the country.
"We went well until al-Maliki visited Syria and the government urged Iraqi not to give any more visas to force them to return to Iraq," said the Sunni retired.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned down my house after I left."
Part of the reason for the decline of violence is that sunnies were displaced from Shiite residential areas and vice versa, which led to the creation of many places where tensions have left behind.
There are fears that a sudden influx of refugees will restore secular tensions and conflict will occur.
Small Saarland, good education
The smallest federal country is leading vocational training and even shines with the international orientation of its universities.
Only in one field of education do the Saarländer express the same deficit as the rest of the country.
"I told a non-seasonal country yesterday that we are not French" - this slogan placates the smallest country selfstironic to his 50th birthday.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Saarland education system, which lies in the Education Monitor of the Institute of the German Economy Cologne (IW) at place five.
In this way, universities are already working closely with neighbouring countries from tradition.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
Up to today, students can complete their studies with a double or even triple degree.
Consequently, the proportion of foreign students is 15.6 per cent.
But the country children also bring the Saarland to an overaverage number of universities - many of them without graduation at the gymnasium.
"In Saarland, the vocational education system is used," says Axel Plünnecke, training experts at the IW.
More than every fifth young person acquires his right to study at a vocational school, so the Saarland is more than seven percentage points above the federal average.
The combined possibilities of vocational and academic training are also relatively widened.
Measured by the population is the second best equipment in Germany with dual courses.
Despite practical training and increasing demand, however, the number of engineer solvents has declined by one third in recent years.
This is why the Ministry of Education has now committed universities to a marketing campaign for engineering subjects.
"After the first Pisa study, we have started a number of reforms at the general schools," says a spokeswoman from the Ministry of Education.
Thus, the government introduced country-wide comparative tests.
In order to start learning early, the last Kita year is free of charge - a model that now also copies other Länder.
Whether the pupils' achievements improve on a sustainable basis will only show future comparative studies.
In Pisa 2003, the share of risk coolers fell from 29 to 20 per cent.
Overall, however, the Saarland did not increase as much as other Länder.
The Bavarians are counting better.
And as a result of the distortion of the Saarländer, foreign language knowledge is not measured at Pisa - in this area could be pointed out otherwise.
For the language of the neighbours is a duty to gymnasia - even though the Saarländer are not French.
Chávez turns the watches
In Venezuela, the watches will soon be different from the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chávez returned the time knives in the South American country by half an hour.
In Spain, Chávez becomes a joke figure.
According to the Official Journal of Venezuela, a new law sets the watches for the world period minus four and a half hours.
This gives the South American state a time zone that is not available in any other country in the world.
The US hostile Chávez founded his decision, among other things, that the United States would have imposed full hours on the world to classify in time zones.
In addition, Chávez announced that on Wednesday (local time) for a hostage affair the interruption of relations with neighbouring Colombia.
The Left Nationalist said that as long as the Conservative Alvaro Uribe President of Colombia remains, he will not have relations with either the Head of State or the Colombian Government.
"I cannot do this alone because of my dignity," said Chávez, who pushes forward a constitutional reform that the citizens of the oil country have to vote on on Sunday in a referendum.
With the reform, he would significantly expand his power in the country.
Uribes decided to withdraw Chávez from negotiations with Marxist rebels in Colombia about the release of hostages.
Uribe had Venezuela with his decision "spit in the face," Chávez criticized on Sunday.
Chávez is also in all its mouth in Spain.
A new phone ringtone provides Furore in the country: "Por qué no te callas" (Why don't you keep your mouth shut) is the sentence that has already downloaded more than half a million people from the Internet.
He was spoken by King Juan Carlos, who was nervous at the recent Iberia summit of the constant intercept of the left spopulist and had driven him over his mouth.
German threatens 2007 wage minus
In spite of the strong economic recession, German workers are in danger of a real loss this year.
Experts mentioned a whole set of reasons for their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a calculation of the Hans-Böckler Foundation, employees could actually expect less in the salary account in 2007 than in the previous year.
"Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economic Research of the" Picture "newspaper said that this is due to the modest wage development, the increase in VAT and the price of food and energy.
New charges could also be borne by workers in the case of unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück said the "New Osnabrücker newspaper" that the planned reduction of unemployment insurance to 3.3 per cent for the annual change was right and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the Federal Agency for Labour should not again be embarrassed to ask for loans or grants at the Confederation, the SPD politician has been quoted.
On Tuesday, it had become known that the price explosion in food and petroleum products has driven the inflation rate to the highest level for 13 years.
Total prices increased by 3.0 per cent per year.
Venus is the holy twin of the earth
Despite its life-hostile atmosphere on Earth, Venus Express has discovered lightning in the atmosphere and wind wiring on Poland, as they appear on the earth in winter.
For almost three decades, scientists suspect it's flashing on the Venus.
Now the European probe "Venus Express" has provided evidence - it felt electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere: The lightning on the Venus shoots at a height of about 56 kilometres from cloud to cloud, Christopher Russel reports from the University of California in Los Angeles in the science magazine "Nature."
According to the famous "Ursoup theory," lightning has created life on earth: Thunderstorms should have stimulated reactions in the ocean that led to the formation of amino acids, the building stones of life.
Not like that on Venus: "If there was ever life there, it must have been in the very early history," explains Sean Solomon from the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today there should be hardly anything alive on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is about a hundred times closer than on earth, there are sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees.
"The Venus may be the devil twin of the earth, but it is a twin," said Russell.
Why the Venus, which is so similar to the earth in mass and size, has so completely different development, is the basic question of the Esa mission.
The start of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone for Venus research, since since the beginning of the 1990s no longer has been a probe specifically on the way to explore this planet.
According to researchers, the latest research results now presented in several "Nature" articles highlight not only the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system.
"They also show that the community of our neighbour planet is greater than first assumed," the Esa announces.
In addition to the already known whirlwind on the North Pole, the researchers also found a cloud strudel on the South Pole, which turns even faster.
The phenomenon reminds us of air flows on the earthly winter hemisphere, writes a research team around Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second inner planet of the solar system has almost the same mass as the earth and is almost the same size with a diameter of 12.100 kilometres.
The planet also known as morning or evening stars is circling around the sun in almost 225 days.
But it is much slower about itself: a Venustag lasts 243 days on earth.
Although the Venus with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar hardly remembers the Earth, scientists assume that both planets have emerged under very similar conditions.
On both, water was gathered which remained on the earth in oceans, on which Venus was lost in space.
And while carbon dioxide is fixed on earth in carbon stones, it makes the most of the atmosphere on the Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler demands an end to the party dispute for the reception of Dalai Lama in the Chancellor Office.
He criticized the SPD indirectly for their attacks on the Chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about the reputation of Germany and has asked the great coalition to end the fight for the reception of the Dalai Lama.
"We should not present a split nation to the outside world on this issue," said Kohler to the trade paper.
At the same time, Kohler signalled understanding of the reception of the Dalai Lama by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"Human rights have universal validity for me, even though I respect the diversity of cultures," said Kohler.
Everyone knows that Germany needs to maintain sensitive balances in foreign policy, the Federal President stressed, but Merkel was protecting from the accusation that it was pursuing a new China policy.
"The Federal Chancellor has not distanced traditional one-China policy.
China also knows that, "said Kohler.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) had indirectly revealed indignation about the reception of Dalai Lama and had therefore been attacked from the Union's ranks.
Steinmeier had, among other things, complained of the Union's "shooting window" policy in foreign policy.
After the reception of the Dalai Lamas in the Chancellor Office, there were severe irritations in the German-Chinese relationship.
Thus, the Chinese leadership has not only invited the German Minister for Finance, Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but, according to information from SPIEGEL, also frozen the so-called Strategic Dialogue of the Foreign Ministers of both countries.
China's head of government Wen Jiabao has now asked Chancellor Angela Merkel to admit the reception of Dalai Lamas as as a mistake.
China rejects it when European politicians receive the religious leader of the Tibetans in official function, Wen Jiabao confirmed the Chinese position.
The actions and words of Dalai Lamas showed that he tried to divide Tibet and the other Tibetan region, which also includes other provinces today, from China.
Schäuble warns against crawls like in France
Road battles with police, shots, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against crawls like in France.
The Federal Minister called for everything to be done to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not become a force on the road.
Barricades burned, Randalierer shot the police with shotguns: After the severe youth crawls in France, Federal Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears similar developments in Germany.
"We must ensure that we do not build up social explosives and unleash in violence.
We must take this seriously, "he said to the" New Press "that appeared in Hannover.
Not every young person can cope with the rapid change in social reality.
Bund, countries and municipalities have already worked strongly to reduce problems, said Schäuble.
This is not just about the integration of migrants.
"From the integration summit to the Islamic Conference, this already shows the first success."
However, it is too early to warn.
Schäuble also pointed out that there are no urban and sociological problems in German suburbs as in France.
In the northern suburbs of Paris, young people had delivered heavy road battles with the police over the last few nights.
Also in Toulouse, cars and public buildings were burned.
Greater integration efforts by the federal government, however, demanded the chairman of the Turkish municipality in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In view of the crawl in France, Kolat warned against "imitation effects."
The situation in Germany is not as burdensome as in France.
However, action needs to be taken.
Kolat pointed out that the unemployment rate was "above average" in young people under 25 years of age.
In particular, more training places should be provided.
Mr Kolat stressed: "We must give young people a perspective."
However, the chairman of the Turkish community added that in Germany more than in France "social control in the families takes place."
Moreover, many young people with migration background did not want to destroy what their parents built here.
Kolat said, "But yet we have to be careful."
It is necessary to give young people the opportunity to participate quickly in work and training.
In the meantime it remained largely quiet in the Paris suburb Villiers-le-Bel at night.
Hundreds of police were in operation, a helicopter flew over the area with headlights.
The competent authorities reported three arrests as well as a few burning garbage and cars.
Since the day before, an offer of about 1000 security forces has ensured peace.
The police will go through as long as it is necessary, announced Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie after a visit to the suburb.
The night on Tuesday at Krawallen in Villiers-le-Bel about 80 cops were injured.
In the aftermath, the unrest overtook Toulouse.
The crawls were inflamed by a traffic accident where two young people had died on Sunday.
According to the first findings of the Public Prosecutor, the police are not responsible for the death of young people.
In the Kingdom of Angela Wolke
The unrealistic appearance of the Chancellor documented that the coalition is at the end - and that there is nothing to expect from her herself.
Which country does this Chancellor actually live in?
After their uncomforted appearance in the Federal Day's general debate, which was rooty and intuitive, one has to say: not here - not in the country that it should finally be ruled by.
Angela Merkel rejected the accusation that she was too focused on foreign policy with an angry superior sentence.
That was provincial, she said and first showed that she did not want to understand what the critics are about.
In the Bundestag, she has documented for everyone how much their accusation applies.
There was neither a specific interest nor a feeling of feeling for the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela Wolke presented himself: a dismissed politician who flees into foreign policy and remains in the perimeter even there.
For example, climate protection: it praises itself unhindered for the decisions of Heiligendamm, but does not say how to achieve the climate objectives in this country.
Overall, the self-praise - so much humility the CDU boss had failed two years ago.
Now she's clinging to the floods that the recovery comes to humans.
In this way, she damages her image as a pragmatic who solves problems instead of speaking the world beautifully.
But in the kingdom of Angela Wolke, internal political problems are an appearance.
Child poverty and the troubles of the low-earners?
She's got a few extra sets left for it.
It is noteworthy how often it promises itself when it comes to the child supplement.
Three moves need Merkel there to bring out a half-straight sentence.
She stumbles like on foreign terrain when it gets concrete.
Attack Division
In the YouTube debate of the Republican presidential candidates, the two favourites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney deliver a hard exchange of battles - and now have to fear an outsider candidate.
The tensions of the candidates are already resolved on the first topic.
He has made New York a "place of refuge for illegal immigrants," Mitt Romney puts forward his counterpart Rudy Giuliani.
He talks with serious accusations: "I would say that his own house was a port for illegals," he replied to Giuliani and accused the former Governor of Massachusetts of having employed private immigrants without papers.
The candidates are blowing to attack: because the republican base continues to have no clear favorites, the eight presidential candidates use the debate on CNN especially to discredit their opponents.
The self-routed 30-second videos that Internet users have sent via YouTube are hardly more than keywords.
"With this kind of isolationism we have led Hitler to power," John McCain submits to his counterpart Ron Paul, who, as the only one in the round, calls for an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney is also strongly read by the Vietnamese veterans when he refuses to condemn the so-called "Waterboarding," an interrogation method simulating drowning as torture.
However, that the important topics of the campaign are now beyond Iraq's war and torture debates, the reactions of the Saal audience in St. Petersburg in Floridas show.
Whenever conservative values are priced and future tax increases are rejected, the auditorium is applauding.
Once again, the weaknesses of the two favourites are shown.
"I was mistaken at that time," explains Romney crushed and prefers before the base and television audience that he was still one of the abortion supporters in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, comes to the slingers when he is asked for his opinion on the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf reigns for the first time in civilian
One day after his resignation as chief of the army, the Pakistani Machthaber Musharraf was appointed President.
This will end eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan's President, Pervez Musharraf, has been authorised for another five-year term of office on Thursday.
The Pakistani television broadcast live the ceremony in the presidential palace of Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to respect the Constitution and to act for the good of the nation.
On Wednesday, he had handed over his post as Chief of Army to his trustee Ashfaq Kiyani, thereby bending international pressure especially from the United States.
Eight years after his assassination of power in an unbloody military puddle, the former general now reigns for the first time as a civilian head of state.
With his resignation as Commander of the Armed Forces, Musharraf had fulfilled a core demand of the opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is an end to the exceptional state imposed by Musharraf on 3 November.
Soon after his insult, Musharraf will, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, lift the state of emergency and thus fulfil a further request from the West.
The Supreme Court of the Land, which had occupied Musharraf after the suspension of the state of emergency with him at the beginning of November, had rejected all objections against the controversial re-election of the Head of State on 6 October last week.
Meanwhile, in the northern tribe of North Waziristan, five soldiers were killed in an attack on a military convoy and four more injured.
According to an army preacher, the bomb exploded on a road near the border with Afghanistan.
The fathers of the Krautrock return
Germany's Supergroup of the Seventy is again musical: Harmonia's three band members resumed their consoles at a concert in Berlin.
The Revival appears a cut from its great time "Live 1974."
They were already much more famous abroad.
The famous sensation then occurs in shape of three gentleman set at the evening table.
Everyone has his box ahead, his cables and, above all, his buttons.
Dieter Moebius thront in the blossom white shirt with 63 years in the middle.
Left flanked by Michael Rother, 57 years young and owned by laptop and guitar.
On the right hand, seen from the auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, is crushed on the console.
Everyone contributes sounds, sometimes even a beat.
And sometimes it accidentally adds to a traditional piece of music.
That doesn't seem to disturb the gentlemen themselves.
That the band Harmonia music again has made some excitement among Krautrock lovers.
What is to be revealed here: Targeted questions revealed that although the name was swarming through collective puppet memory, it has not been so sustainable in any way to miss this band painfully for 32 years.
But why should the German not also be allowed to celebrate his living legends from the 1970s?
For example, what misleading Krautrock is called, in England and America, was always considered more than in their own country.
When the music industry awarded the eco-prize for life work to the survivors of the Cologne Group Can in 2003, it was seen in the Chamber in asking German peasants.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked themselves at the Laudatio at the Bands La Düsseldorf and New!, the surprise knew no boundaries.
Michael Rother later joined the Red Hot Chili Peppers on the stage as an old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and the explanation in the stranger is one.
The memory is already exaggerated with Harmonia, because the trio existed only two years and in this time also had a much lower power of action than was subsequently assigned to them by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already played with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name cluster.
= = References = = = = External links = = * Official website
After that in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons for a record label maintained by the Church.
Rother had recently recovered at the power station and then became a guitarist at the new!, who then may have been the most radical German group.
In 1973, Rother followed the cluster musicians to Forst in the Weserbergland.
There, in the Old Weserhof, a ruin from the 16th century, they lived as city-fleeing communaries.
Less ideological than in the municipality I, where Roedelius was still allowed to plague herself as a child girl.
More of a great artist in there.
It was claimed that there was also a wimpel of Harmonia Ottenstein's singing association and a name for art.
Some of them held Harmonia on to it.
The first album was called "Music of Harmonia" and the following "De Luxe."
Because so let and modest the music sounded, the band suffered material distress.
The travel collection did not serve the self-finding alone.
The now released CD "Live 1974" was cut at a concert in Griessem, in front of a nearly 50-head record scene, as someone believes to be remembered.
From Rother then the desire came to force Harmonia and to practice occasionally.
For Roedelius and Moebius an impartial demand.
= = References = = = = External links = =
Rother landed in the esoteric spheres and secured his existence with albums like "Flaming Hearts."
Cluster was revived in the eighties and has been more successful since it was Harmonia.
The Griessemer live album is thanks to Herbert Grönemeyer.
Its record company Greenland has set itself the goal of maintaining the Krautrock as an ureigen German contribution to living music.
New! has already been buried out like Roedelius solo work.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place in the Berlin House of Cultures of the World.
Public subsidised, in the context of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is here, the British, Altpunk and author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler."
There's also the loveparade inventor Dr. Motte.
Womit the entire bandwidth of the influences of the Krautrock on the following pop music would be crushed.
Harmonia will fill out the space of the supergroup.
The phrase of Brian Eno is floating with the most extraordinary sounds in the room: "The only true music, you belong to the future."
There are pictures that show the producers with Harmonia in the farm.
Legend formation is used for projections of other black-and-white photographs of wirr-linked devices.
Before that, the three veterans are again engaged in improvisation.
Not anymore by adding microphones to the organ and drum to unheard tones to the instruments using self-based power devices.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three into a technical deeper.
The choir of the house doesn't change anything.
Under the line Barbara Morgensterns is coughed and whispered under sound clouds and sung in a beautiful place with emphasis "Aaaaaaah!".
Krautrock was always a very English term.
It was never about rock.
The roots were searched less in blues than in music high schools (Can), technologies (power plant) or on the run from artistic and social conventions (clusters).
Whoever here calls "'68!" is not quite wrong, and Harmonia is not allowed to get out of it now.
Even the most obvious is being thoroughly reviewed on stage.
Where does music start and when does it stop?
This can rob the nerves or give you fleeting moments of great happiness.
Richard Gere is simply not cynical enough
The "Hunting Party" and "Murderous Peace" are again dealing with two movies of the Balkans War.
But both do not convince.
Either the concepts put too much on action and blower or they are too touching.
Richard Gere can't help at the Hunting Party.
The good news first: although the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but especially there, in the darkest backland of the Bosnia war, the actor Richard Gere has now been rediscovered.
We had recently lost sight of the most beautiful man in the 1980s, because too many nicely-important roles in prosperous films for women and too many press conferences on Buddhism triggered you the desire to look.
Now Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to look at "The Hunting Party - If the hunter becomes hunted" (Why do film titles really always have to be as long and twisted as Lokführer collective agreements?).
He delivers a wonderful cornerstone of eyes: basically, his war reporter Simon Hunt is what could have become from Gere if fate and the film industry were not so merciful: a man who has been behind his very best times for a long time, but even as a ruin-like monument of his defeat still preserved considerable remains of the first charm.
But despite this trumpet "The Hunting Party" along with the German production "Murderous Peace," which also starts this week, only the endless series of failed Balkans War movies continue.
With "Murderous Peace," you can make a short trial: the film deals with two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who save a Serbian from Kosovo's hedge protectors, which one of them is also in love with.
Although it is welcome that the Serbs are not once represented as the sole root of all the evil, the television-flat film loses too quickly in balls and action.
It remains a kind of "Alarm for Cobra 11" without a highway but for it with war.
On the other hand, "The Hunting Party" can be explored in an exemplary way why there has never been a really good Balkans war film.
The story of three US war reporters who open up to track down the Serbian Supreme War Crime "the Fuchs," could have become a new "Apocalypse Now" with another director and another screenwriter (both in Human Rights Union Richard Shepard) at another time.
Because the stories are very similar: both times small teams go into the woods to do something that the military can't do and both times it will be a journey into madness.
One of the reasons why "The Hunting Party" failed is that Simon Hunt is not simply being the descended cynician with heart as he is presented to us at the beginning.
No, the script has to offer him a romantic affair with a later murdered Muslim Bosnian.
Finally, "The Hunting Party" goes down the stream when the reporters succeed within the last five minutes of the time-rape process what NATO, CIA and all the world's head-money hunters have failed in five years: catching the war criminals and leaving the Muslim Bosnians for fair revenge.
This is so bad that they want to call the International Court of Justice in The Hague for crimes against cinology.
The film has a deeply human concern.
He wants to argue that Karadzic and Mladic are still running freely, and he suspects the Americans and the French (here they should exceptionally agree) not to pursue the persecution too intensely on the basis of secret political agreements.
But the good community and evil are sometimes so similar that a famous Brecht poem comes into mind.
It says about the wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet's working table: "I see the swollen forenails compassionately, indicating how hard it is to be evil."
Films such as "The Hunting Party" have exactly those swellheads, but they suggest how hard it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the genre of the Balkans War film.
Recently, in this newspaper, it was reported that all Iraq movies were big flops of Hollywoods.
One can add: there has never been a good South Africa movie.
Almost always applies: If a star drives around on the world's crises or minefields, something like "Rangoon" comes out with Patricia Arquette, "beyond all borders" with Angelina Jolie or "blood diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Perhaps all the conflicts are still too close in time.
After all, decades had to pass before Hollywood was able to make a good film about the Holocaust with "Schindler's list."
Some film is still going to be mature - the now classic Vietnam works "The Deer Hunter," "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" have not been celebrated in any way unholy as masterpieces at that time.
But maybe today we know where every mass murder in real time comes on equal two screens at home, too simply too much about the world's conflicts.
And that robs the scriptures the insinuation it takes to tell good stories.
After all, "being or not" or "the great dictator" has become so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how bad the Nazi regime really was.
Maybe you don't want to be good if you want to make good movies.
Maybe you have to have the sarcastically distant artist's view of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When he was questioned about parallels between his historical novel "Lemprières dictionary" and the Balkans War, he said, "That's only because some things never change.
Big cities will always be horribly dangerous, people will always be murdered in a horrible way and war will always reign in Yugoslavia. "
From Beust harvested criticism for Olympia rejection
The dismantling of the mayor of Hamburg's application for Olympic Summer Games has led to severe criticism in politics and economy.
Many want to continue fighting for the games on the water.
However, from Beust, realism is urging the chances to be assessed.
On Wednesday, the head of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, declared a waiver "not good for the business site."
No other project has recently developed as large motivation forces in the city as the Olympic idea.
"Without this objective, the momentum of sport policy could not be maintained in the same way."
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new long-term approach to "starting from a change in time."
On Wednesday, Mayor Ole von Beust remained with previous statements that the Olympic ambitions of Hamburg were unrealistic at least by 2028.
"Not Hamburg decides on an Olympic application, but the German Olympic Sports Federation," said Beust WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the sports association expected for the beginning of December on an application for Munich for the winter games 2018.
"This preference means for us that we will not have any realistic chances in the period until 2028 that we have so far thought about."
Nevertheless, the dream was not dreamed forever, said by Beust.
The Hamburger Sportbund (HSB) regretted the statements of Beusts.
This makes the impression that Hamburg will no longer apply for Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It is too early to build a chance by buried the plans at that time," said HSB President Günter Ploß on Wednesday.
A waiver of the application is also in contradiction with the statement of the Senate Head at the time of a reception for the General Assembly of the General German Higher Sports Association.
There, by Beust, Hamburg's application for the 2015 Universiade was "not a substitute" for Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The university sports association had only nominated Hamburg as a candidate town last week.
The SPD bourgeoisie fraction presumed the Senate not to have used valuable time for housing construction in Hamburg.
"The development of the small grass brook has been delayed by the Senate for years because it has put on the map Olympia and has clammed the housing building," SPD MEPs Carola Veit and Jan Quast said.
While the SPD for the small Grasbrook has always demanded integrated planning for Olympia and a later use of housing, the CDU has unilaterally put on the "event factor."
The application for the 2012 Summer Olympics in Hamburg had caused a great enthusiasm.
However, Hamburg failed at Leipzig.
These aren't Warhol's boxes.
Those who connect the terms of Sweden and wooden box think of Ikea, but not Andy Warhol.
Right?
Currently produced wood boxes in Sweden throw dark shadows on Warhol's workbook.
A large part of the 21 glasses listed there from the "Stockholm type" are counterfeiting.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expresses" had doubts about the authenticity of Andy Warhols Brillo-Boxes of 1968, internal investigations at the Modern Museum in Stockholm now come to a fruitful result: the six "Brillo-Boxes" which the former Museums Director Pontus Hultén gave to the Modern Museum in 1995 are copies - and probably most of the hundreds of other Brillo Boxes of the "Type Stockholm" that are in circulation on the international art market.
The history is disguised, a confusing chain of artistic and curatory productions.
In 1964 Warhol created his first "Brillo Boxes," painted wooden boxes based on the red-blue-white design of the paperboard of the soap powder "Brillo."
An exhibition of his work at the Modern Museum 1968 - with Warhol's consent - exhibited hundreds of Brillo boxes from cardboard: these were (for cost reasons) not from Warhol but were delivered directly from the Brillo cardboard factory.
It was not about works of art, it was their models, it was just exhibitions.
At the same time Warhol has probably granted permission in 1968 to produce a few brillo wooden boxes in Sweden, which were not issued in the Modern Museum.
Time witnesses now speak of about fifteen boxes that were then approved as original Andy Warhol Brillo boxes called "type Stockholm" rightly entered the art and auction history.
Some of them have achieved more than $100,000 at auctions.
The problem now is that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén later mistakenly claimed that it had been produced and issued in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol had then left to him.
In fact, Hulténs 105 boxes were only produced in 1990 in Malmö for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
At that time Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, Chief Conservator at the Modern Museum, has also examined three of the Swedish private ownership museums, of which two were made in Stockholm in 1968: their press panels were first founded and swirled, then white oil color was applied with a brush.
The structure of the 1990 copies, on the other hand, tells us that the colour was applied directly to the press panel with a painter roll without foundation - and it is not an oil, but an acrylic color.
"These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhols Brillo boxes," the Director of the Modern Museum, Lars Nittve, says: "If the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board in New York does not come to a different conclusion, the Modern Museum will classify the six boxes in its collection as copies / exhibition material."
As early as July, the Authentication Board announced that it would follow the "serious accusations" which are collected in the case of the soap powder boxes.
But since then, they have been sheltered there in unforgettable silence.

Manila's financial district was already the main scene of the attempted mutation of around 200 military members against Arroyo in 2003.
The rebellion failed after almost 24 hours of the army's refusal to join.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven coup attempts against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
