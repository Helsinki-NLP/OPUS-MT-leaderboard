A Republican strategy to counter the re-election of Obama
The leaders of the Republicans justify their policy with the need to fight the electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter to be a myth by reaffirming that the election fraud in the US is more rare than the number of people killed by lightning.
The lawyers of the Republicans have, by the way, recorded only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in 10 years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voting participation.
In this sense, these measures partially undermine the democratic system of the United States.
Unlike Canada, the US states are responsible for conducting elections in each country.
In this sense, the majority of American governments have announced new laws since 2009 that make the registration or immoral procedure difficult.
This phenomenon has gained importance after the November 2010 elections, where 675 new Republican representatives could be recorded in 26 states.
As a result, 180 draft laws were introduced alone in 2011, which restrict the exercise of electoral rights in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require voters to present a photo card and evidence of US citizenship.
In addition, these laws also reduce the time limits for the premature vote, declare the right to register as voters on the election day invalid, and govern the right to vote for citizens for which a court act is available.
Before the 2006 elections, no US state asked the voters to present a photo card.
Indiana was the first state to make such a claim.
In 2008, the Supreme Court of the United States confirmed the constitutionality of the Indiana Act.
The Republican authorities hasten to extend this practice to other states.
Over the last two years, they have supported draft laws in 34 states which force voters to present a photo card.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, US citizens do not have a universal ID card such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of US citizens, i.e. 21 million voters, do not have a photograph card issued by a government authority of their state.
In addition, five million new voters do not have such an ID in 2012.
However, more than a hundred dollars are often payable to obtain the necessary ID.
The new restrictions are disproportionately affected by young people, minorities and low-income people.
Indeed, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people with an income of less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over 65 and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years do not have the necessary photo card.
This is still enough.
Students who are regarded as voters who increase their voice for democratic candidates are not allowed to use their photo card issued by their institution in several countries.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of fishing or hunting associations who choose more for the Republican side to use the cards issued by these associations for elections.
Before 2004, no state for electing asked for evidence of citizenship.
Arizona was the first state to introduce such a claim.
Since 2011, a dozen states have adopted laws requiring voters to prove their US citizenship.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the Hispanic votes.
It is obvious that two out of three Hispanic voters prefer the democratic party.
In addition, Republican legislators have promoted law in eight states in 2011 to abolish the registration of voters on the election day.
In addition, you have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to the voters who want to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, the campaign to register voters in the 2004 general elections helped to register about 10 million citizens.
Indeed, the measures adopted since 2009 have reduced the share of the registration of new voters in 2010 by 17% compared to 2006.
In addition, the Republican legislators have adopted laws in five other states aimed at shortening the period for the early vote.
For example, at the 2008 general elections in Florida, 33% of the voters who voted in advance were African Americans, although they represent only 13% of the voters of the state.
The same applies to the Hispanic population.
The latter represented only 11% of the voters, but 24% of the citizens who voted in advance.
On the other hand, the white people representing 76% of the voters accounted for only 46% of the voters selected in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters have strongly opposed the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters.
Several draft laws were blocked by the veto of the democratic governors.
The U.S. Attorney General has intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They could partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have adopted laws requiring the display of a photo card.
However, the newly introduced rules in 2012 will undoubtedly make the exercise of electoral rights difficult.
The democratic critics denounce the party political nature of the laws adopted and see them as a clear objective of influencing the results in the countries that decide for 2012.
A 2011 Brennan Centre report shows that those States that have adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes required by the electoral board to win the Presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these changes to the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential elections in 2012.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voting participation.
In this sense, these measures partially undermine the democratic system of the United States.
Prostate cancer early detection: should the test be done or not?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes shows incorrect results, with false negative or false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
This leads to a stronger hesitation of the men who have already been unresolved for the implementation of early detection tests.
Should the test be done or not?
We have received the opinion of two specialists.
In the USA studies, there were numerous disturbances between the control groups, so it is difficult to interpret these data and to give clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, came to the conclusion that there is a difference in the mortality of patients with and without early detection.
This study has also shown that after 12 years of follow-up, the probability of metastases formation is 30 to 40% higher if no early detection has been performed.
That is why I recommend the test from the age of 50 or 40 years when you have a direct relative who was already sick of prostate cancer.
There is also a higher risk for men of African-American origin.
The most important thing is to make the right decision as soon as a cancer is detected.
There are types of cancer that are aggressive and others that are indolent.
The patient needs to be really understandable about the risk of his cancer by demonstrating the possible options in which prostate cancer can remain untreated if it does not affect the quality of life in the long term, and in these cases it is more likely to be active monitoring of the disease.
Today, many men in whom cancer has been detected are not treated as their cancer is not aggressive and is not a threat to their lives.
They are proposed to have active monitoring and are offered treatment when the disease progresses.
The criteria for deciding who should be treated and who should not be determined with increasing accuracy.
That is why I recommend that the test be carried out.
However, it is most important to talk to his doctor to determine whether or not it should be performed.
In cooperation with the International Society for Urology, Movember has developed an instrument to assess the advantages and disadvantages of the PSA test.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress made in research, the adoption of a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk.
It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if everyone eats well and moves sufficiently.
"If there were no more smokers, this value would increase at least to 50%," stressed André Beaulieu, speaker of the Canadian cancer company.
However, approximately 10% of cancer is expected to be caused by inheritance.
Several remain completely unclear.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against tobacco dependence remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of the cases of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for several other types of cancer.
It seriously damages human health.
"Today there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," regrets the spokesman André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after the absence of the cigarette, the risk of cancer dying is reduced by half.
Weight
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, overweight and adipositas also promote the outbreak of the disease.
They seem to increase the risk of breast, grim, mastintestinal, edible, abdominal and cervical cancer.
"Research shows that regular physical activity protects from grim intestinal cancer throughout life," he adds.
Nutrition
The organisation also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
It increases the risk of suffering from grim or fatal cancer in too high a quantity.
Sausage should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salt can lead to the formation of carcinogenic agents.
"The latter can damage the body cells and lead to the development of cancer," he explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the relationship between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, their investigations are not conclusive at the moment.
After the Canadian Cancer Society, the studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While one study found the reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, another was more likely to increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not been clearly demonstrated.
In addition, Mr Beaulieu stresses the importance of talking to his doctor about his concerns and his family constraints.
"The execution of an early detection test does not lead to cancer."
The Higgs-Boson analyzes
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs Boson has raised some attention last summer, and this for good reason.
Indeed, one believes that this Boson is involved in nothing less than the mechanism responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
And finally, it is the last particle whose existence has been predicted by the standard model - our best or "least false" statement of nature and the behavior of matter - but has not yet been empirically observed.
But for physicists, it is not completely certain that it is really Higgs.
We know without the shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particle and that it is very similar to the Higgs Boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, this seems to be confirmed by new data presented this week at a major physics congress in Kyoto, but there are still no data to be completely safe about it.
Still, let's assume that this is actually the Higgs, because apparently there's only a small risk of cheating, and let's look at what it is about.
There is an indispensable law in this world, which means that two objects cannot be present at the same place at the same time.
It is not possible to violate this rule - and don't try too hard as you will hurt yourself.
For even if particle physics is a really strange world, it turns out that it also applies to such a law: the Pauli's principle of exclusion, which means that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time when they are in the same "quantum state," which in large and whole consists of some of their properties.
From that point of view, physicists divided the particles into two categories.
In a corner are the good citizens who are called Fermione and are politically obedient to the Pauli principle.
And in the other, the bosons move, a bad gang of anarchists who are nothing sacred - in any case not this principle, which means that they can actually be in the same place at the same time.
These Bosons are divided into two groups according to the website The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley laboratories (which, by the way, is absolutely amazing): the Mesons that we will not treat here and the "power particles" which spread the great forces of nature and with which the Higgs-Boson would somehow be related.
However, it must be emphasised here that these Bosons are not all such exotic creatures as one might think.
If you are able to read this chronic, then only thanks to a Boson of extraordinary banality: the photon or the "light particle," which is the "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
If a particle accelerates with an electric charge or changes the direction, the electromagnetic field is "disturbed" exactly at this place, in about like a pebble stone that has been thrown into a pond.
This "disturbance" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon and thus one of the Bosons "carriers of power."
Stable field
The same applies to the Higgs Boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs field, must be "disturbed" so that this Boson shows itself.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the pathogen must achieve very high energies, a little comparable to a frozen pond whose surface could only be scattered by a very large rock.
Therefore a huge particle accelerator such as CERN is required - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring of 27 km! - to achieve such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is once again helpful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, it is not all particles and not all materials that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do this, but others do not - for example, a sheet of paper would never keep itself at the refrigerator.
And not all particles interact equally with the Higgs field: those who do it possess a mass, while the others (like the photon) do not possess a mass.
For what can all of these research now be "good," Mrs Plamondon asks?
For science, they are used to verify the standard model (SM), and they also allow physicists to investigate all disparities between the observations and the forecasts of the SM.
By the way, there are many physicists who are most hoping that such deviations will be found, as the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and put some holes of the model.
One has to say that the latter still has major shortcomings as it does not provide an explanation for the gravity (ups!) and the dark matter, which forms about 80% of the matter of the universe (again up!).
However, such derogations have not yet been found in CERN.
Impact
The impact of these research on the general population is more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there was no.
By the way, in the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in the Bell laboratories did not suspect that their work would trigger such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the deceased physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in the 1960s, and who developed the first permanent laser (the first were pulled) in 1962 - has already said that the laser was at the beginning rather considered a "laboratory game."
Imagine...
In addition, applications can also come from all the instruments surrounding research.
For example, Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor during his work in the optics in 1969.
Although it was not the original purpose, this sensor today serves all digital cameras worldwide as an "eye" and introduced him the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2009.
Of course this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will necessarily change our lives, but it means that you really can never know...
Palliative care - the best way to die...
Quebec has recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life with her committee for "Death in Valence."
The debate must be resumed shortly, although a draft law is being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this important area.
Le Devoir has tried to look at this more closely.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer who ate him had left him a period of two years.
"They gave me five years to live, I made seven years," he said half-hearty, lying in his bed at the home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he arrived the day before.
"However, it is always a shock, you cannot be prepared for it," he says.
The disease makes its work: an immense weakness prevents him from going alone to the toilet and even eating himself.
Sitting at the table in front of a delicious lunch, he wills resign to let himself help with food.
Brave even succeeds in smiling and talking to the strangers who are busy around him, bringing him his medication, and offering him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is to heal my diarrhoea, as this is humiliating," he tells us.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil.
"In the course of our lives, we learn that a man pissing in the standing," says Pierre Brodeur, psychologist at home Victor-Gadbois.
Returning to the childhood phase is an unacceptable humiliation for certain people.
"This depends on the ability of the person to take a step back," he notes.
For in the opinion of several people working in the palliative care, major events are taking place in the middle of these retreat steps.
The patients who are recruited to the home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois are all suffering from cancer.
You have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage they are no longer overtaken by the doctors and nurses who take care of them with so-called "healing" care.
For Ms. A., 89 years, the worst fear is to die "consciously and by suffocating."
But because of the disease, I really met my children.
"I have good children," add them.
"I don't have any more wishes in life," she says before she accepts putting on a mask to help her breathe.
She still expects a last visit to her son from Italy in the next few days.
In the home Victor-Gadbois you offer a group of volunteers to provide help with food.
The palliative care will be used when there are no other options.
To make dying more pleasant.
In Quebec there is a bed for the palliative care of 11.700 inhabitants.
This is very little when we are taken into account that one day we will all die.
Here life is continued under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home.
Both at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
One gives the dying a oral care with brandy or pepsi as desired.
Diabetics don't have to control their blood sugar levels anymore.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night, we served Mr. X a beer that died during the night.
This morning, his son is going to drink the beer to the dead's feet.
"We help families and patients alike," reports nursing director Nathalie Savard.
There's no day in Victor-Gadbois's home like the other one.
In addition to an old man of 93 years old, who enjoys the last family reunion in the courtyard and is well supported by his cushions, while one encounters his honour, a young man of 36 years, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two little children, dies in a tragic way after trying to survive everything.
"For six months, three to five beds have always been occupied with cancer patients less than 45 years old," Dr. Christiane Martel is worried.
53% of the patients dedicated to Victor-Gadbois's home come from their place of residence, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, i.e. to care to ease the suffering of patients when the latter have reached the final stage of their life, both at home, in hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organisations, such as the home of Victor-Gadbois and the company for domestic palliative care in the Montreal area, are more or less specialized exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
This great inadequacy in the care of Quebecs ensures that several specialists specializing in the care of palliative care face with concern the adoption of a law to regulate death aid and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto has been in circulation, signed by prominent personalities of palliative care such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe to express their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebecs health system is not capable enough to ensure that all the right to a high-quality palliative care has before it is accepted to pass to death aid.
Recently, she says, I've seen a patient who was 14 days with great pain in the emergency, without taking measures to alleviate them.
I fear that patients only want to die because they do not receive adequate health care.
And at the same time, several oncologists treat their patients bitter despite the worst forecasts until the last day.
The survival chances of Hélène Richard were already minimal when she interrupted a difficult chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I'm going to stop the treatment, she answered me that she regretted that I quit the fight, she told me.
But she told me I was at the end!
No omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients who have asked to die thank the nursing staff that this desire has not been accepted after their pain has been relieved by a team of palliative care.
However, it must be made clear that palliative care is not omnipotent in pain treatment.
According to Elsie Monereau, head of the palliative care of the home palliative care of the large area of Montreal, 8% of patients do not respond to pain treatment.
Thus, at the end of life, doctors often rely on the terminal sedation, which means that the patient should be interrupted either sporadically or permanently until the time of his death.
We can no longer pretend to perceive this side of suffering.
Patients without pain relief will increasingly have the possibility to rely on this terminal sedation.
Patients whose pain is not relieved say the same phrase: "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean, "I want you to hurt me," but "I want my pain to be reduced."
The implementation of this report was possible due to a journalist scholarship of Canadian health research institutes.
Real estate companies in Quebec
Officials of the Road Building Office, companies of the main construction industry, purchasers of political parties and specialists of the Italian Mafia tell each day what they know about a great "system" in which construction industries, civil servants, politicians, trade unions and mafioso are enchanted.
A "industry" which was very expensive for the taxpayer Quebec, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It is strange how the system has disrupted since drastic measures were taken," jokes Jacques Duchesneau, member of Quebec and former head of the Montreal police.
The scandal was discovered by him on the basis of an in-depth investigation of confusion related to the contracts on road construction in Quebec, which the former Prime Minister had only refused to accept.
The Duchesneau report established a direct link between industry, secret financing of parties and bribery of officials.
"Since the start of the investigation in 2010," he emphasises, "the Ministry of Transport alone had saved a billion dollars in the contracts," because some of them are doing their instincts to get their share!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought two mayors to trial," he adds, in the hope that it will succeed in "showing the tactics behind individuals."
A permanent anti-corruption unit launched in 2011
The permanent anti-corruption unit, launched in 2011, is also making great efforts with its troops to audit auditors, investigators and analysts from the government.
In addition, the police of the "Marteau Force," which has led since 2009 to the "canalisation cartel" of Montreal proceeding more restraint in the artificially uplifting of the treaties...
In the last few weeks, she has carried out a series of house searches and accused of fraud and corruption against municipal officers such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a suburb.
The next one on the list is Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his office as Mayor of Laval, the third largest city of Quebecs.
It is suspected to have received lubricants repeatedly in exchange for public contracts.
By the way, engineers of the Montreal Road Office, as well as entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito, were strongly accused.
The latter has led to supervision by declaring to the Commission the functioning of the "system" for the receipt of public contracts.
He himself paid 3% of the value of the contracts received in Montreal for several years to an intermediary associated with the Mafia who transferred the money to the Montreal Union, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
In the 2000s, Mr Zambito had his hand all over the game by giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (approximately 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially the liberals who were at the time of power.
He also confessed to have organised an illegal funding for former Liberal Vice-President Nathalie Normandeau.
Canalisation contracts whose costs were artificially charged by him
In Montreal the "system" of corruption worked smoothly.
The former engineer Gilles Surprenant described this in detail before the Commission: in ten years he received gifts from the construction company, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey games, as well as bribery money of 736,000 dollars in return for canalisation contracts which he artificially charged.
Other officials of the Road Building Office have admitted that they were allowed to smuggle by artificially blowing up the bills with incorrect additional services by 30-40%.
In addition, an organizer of the Mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr Tremblay of deliberately looking beyond a shadow household that filled his cash with black money.
As a result of these disclosures, Mr Tremblay resigned at the beginning of November, which led Montreal to a serious crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first MEPs in Montreal who hit the alarm.
As Mayor of the Rivière-des-Prairies district, in the east of the island, she refused from 2010 onwards to sell a municipal property that was purchased for 5 million dollars and sold for 1.6 million to builders in the booming real estate market.
70% black money in election campaigns
From the investigation, which is ultimately carried out, she says that "it draws at a thread that allows to understand the functioning of the system that has been submerged by ants to stop evil and challenge the guilty."
She says the procedure is "painful but positive."
We are in the process of cleansing the wound, but we need an investigative unit for Montreal only, as well as supervision to prevent the return of questionable practices.
How to clean up.
Regular.
Jacques Duchesneau, on the one hand, notes that "officials have stolen several hundred million dollars," but is particularly concerned about the role of "mandates who are about tactics in the image," if they were not involved in fraud!
On the basis of 70% of black money in the financing of the election campaigns in Quebec, he laughs: "I was told that this was only a weak slip of reality."
The Quebecs government proposes to limit the donations to parties to 100 dollars, which would not change the situation: "As long as the campaign spending is not strictly limited, black money will be in circulation in politics."
It recommends a complete revision of the public procurement system and the financing of the parties: "We cannot fall deeper; by going to the ground with courage, we can rebuild the House on a more solid basis with more controls and laws."
If this story damages the international reputation of Quebecs and that of Montreal, Mr Duchesneau calls on those who laugh to take a look into their own backyard...
"PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
In this season you have assumed a new scale with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
It can be explained by personal insight, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have come.
I make every day progress on her side.
The technical staff has also given me a lot.
These elements encourage me to improve my level of play every day.
And in a game this is even easier.
It's all going very fast in football.
But I don't break out in enthusiasm.
Since my beginning in the centre of the preparatory training of INF Clairefontaine until my playtime at Saint-Etienne, I have always made gradual progress.
They thus make use of the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
The new access of this summer is used to performing games very high levels.
You also know that every training unit is crucial.
This leads to a player like me who has to offer his forehead and wants to do his best.
By the way, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot about my play position.
He is supported by co-trainers like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the right person for the job?
Of course.
Ancelotti gives all the technicians respect.
There is currently no comparable person in Ligue 1, and it is one of the best trainers in Europe.
He looks back on a rich experience and has won many titles with respected associations.
He was in contact with big players.
I think he's gonna win more titles in Paris.
In January I had an encouraging conversation with him.
I was just recovering from an injury series back then.
The confidence he has put in me is also an explanation for my achievements.
What do you think of the first part of the PSG season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took the place of the top rider.
But we're in ambush.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: in this way we have qualified ourselves for the eighth final.
What is the aim of the association in this competition?
We will try to get as far as possible.
From now on, everything is possible.
However, we will have our word to speak against very good European teams.
First, we want to become the first of our group in front of Porto so that we can take the back of the eighth final as a home game.
Can the PSG become a major European association in the short term?
He already has the budget for this...
In order to become a large European association, Paris must win title and make a long-term name.
This is not the case today.
In financial terms, the PSG gives itself the resources so that this project can take concrete forms.
Would it be a great failure not to win the title in Ligue 1, as was the case in the last season?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year it is really our heart to reconcile this title.
Last season we were close.
In May we were disappointed because we were strong enough to lead the victory.
We finished the season with a very strong performance.
We finished with 79 points.
Usually you should be master with 79 points...
But another team, those of Montpellier, has achieved an even better season.
I think this year is the right one.
Even though the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux ring around the title, I think we have the stuff to win him.
Do you think the media is expecting too much from the PSG?
Given what has been invested and the players we have, it is normal that much is expected of us.
We accept this completely.
But if we win at a home game against Troyes 4-0, and you still find something you can blame us for, that is certainly a little frustrating.
They wonder what people are expecting.
We could never win every weekend with 4-0.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set up a game concept.
A team is building up with time.
In the Champions League, we have proven strength.
Look at Manchester City, a club that has not been able to qualify for the eighth final for two seasons, and has also made huge expenses!
With regard to the invested sums, you were believed to play break with 15 points advance!
That meant that our opponents and the French championship would be ignored.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not good in the last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we will be the smiling winner and tell us that, despite all the difficulties, we have finally won them.
The PSG seems to be entirely dependent on the performance of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
It's so much better to talk about a "Zlatan dependence."
That means Ibrahimovic is powerful and shoots a lot of gates.
That's why he came and proves he's the star of Ligue 1.
Everywhere he played, he realized that he was a great player and a world star.
Within the team we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects the people who surround him.
What he did is really extraordinary.
This encourages others to improve their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone else to make progress.
How did you experience the EM 2012 with the French national team?
Like a disappointment.
It was my heart to take part in this EM.
Unfortunately, my injuries have prevented me from taking out some playtime.
I've seen things that I've emerged from strengthened.
Today I succeed in achieving good games in the national team.
This has been my hope since my baptism with the "Bleus."
From what has happened in Ukraine, we have drawn our teachings and today we have to lay down a model of behaviour.
What do you think about the first months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the "Bleus"?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the qualification group for the World Cup.
The National Coach is strict, is close to the players and encourages the victory.
Like it was Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
Blanc had reached his goal by qualifying us for the EM.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the "Bleus" to Brazil.
Is the undecided (1: 1), forced on 16 October in Spain, a recording game?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone's been working for everyone else.
Before this meeting in Spain, I have never experienced a similar game in my career.
With Bitcoin it is possible to pay and sell without bank
The opposite of the current monetary exchange based on central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between the parties.
Moreover, as often in these technologies, a political vision is tangible: the belief that the current monetary system, designed by bank monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, the Bitcoin invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) is both a virtual currency (but convertible in dollars, euro etc.) and a protocol for the safe exchange like BitTorrent that allows direct exchange of files.
About 200,000 transactions have already been recorded with 15.000 computers in the network.
Some thousand websites accept bitcoin as donation or as means of payment.
After the Bitcoin course reached a maximum of 30 dollars (23 Euro) in June 2011, he fell to 2 dollars five months later before he recovered to around 10 dollars today (the courses are listed on the bitcoincharts.com website).
Nothing particularly impressive compared to world trade in real currencies or financial products.
Nevertheless, in a report on virtual currencies published in October, the European Central Bank (ECB) showed interest in this.
It describes Bitcoin as "the virtual currency with the greatest success," "in competition with the dollar or the euro," and "similar to the traditional currencies."
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies such as the "credits," which are used to move forward in a video game that you can win or buy (and sometimes exchange back).
The social network Facebook has also developed such a system.
However, trade is monitored and processed every time by a central authority.
With Bitcoin, all network buttons are simultaneously depositors of the book, auditors, money issuers as well as buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users takes place in reality between two e-mail addresses in the form of an e-mail.
With the difference that the user can choose a different address for each payment, which ensures anonymity.
A number of data related to this transaction is signed electronically by a double encryption system.
In this way, the network can verify the authenticity of the transaction.
With the help of the contents of the file it is also possible to ensure that the traded bitcoins are available in the public accounts accounting book throughout the network.
The decisive step is to include this new transaction in this book.
This is done through a mathematical task that is started on the computers, with the winner who is a kind of provisional central bank who has the privilege to add this additional line.
It is a fragmentation of the file, i.e. the conversion of a large file into a shorter and clear electronic fingerprint.
The computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before the whole is "hacked."
The goal is to find the number that gives a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
If this number is found, the other nodes can easily check if it is the right one.
The transaction is thus permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If one user wants to pay twice very fast (less than 10 minutes) with the same money, only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other would remain without connection, since both have different fingerprints.
The computer that solved the task receives 50 bitcoins.
In order to prevent inflation, this reward will be halved regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The bitcoins in circulation are thus limited to 21 million, but can be shared up to a hundred million, which leaves a certain margin...
In addition, the difficulty of the task is increased with any improvement in the calculation performance.
The life of the network has already had heights and depths.
The websites that provide services for Bitcoin have been attacked and the Bitcoin deposits stolen.
"The weakness used does not concern the actual protocol," assures Pierre Noizat, who has just introduced Paymium, which is a company for payment with real money and uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reports on the possibilities of money laundering using this anonymous service.
However, cash also shows these shortcomings.
Important actors such as Wikipedia refuse to donate these kinds
They are accepted by others like the blog platform WordPress.
Recently Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the book and showed that almost 80% of the bitcoins are not in circulation.
In November, a "Mega final sale" was launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," Jon Holmquist, who works for the company Coinabul, is happy to convert the bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a book on this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
His Paytunia system corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or a contact-free payment with a mobile phone, but uses bitcoin to validate the transactions that are thus cheaper.
In addition, the holder manages his identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system can be easily implemented with the dealers, and the latter do not need to install new terminals or computer programs.
You simply need to specify an address that can be "photographed and recognized" by a phone, "Pierre Noizat indicates that he has thousands of users.
There is a general trend to review hierarchical systems in favour of more horizontal systems.
"It will take some time to enforce Bitcoin, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicted.
The ECB, by the way, provides in its report for a re-assessment of the various risks considered today as high in the event of a success of this currency.
We left Afghanistan.
And after that?
French troops have left their responsibilities in Afghanistan (Capisa and Surobi).
NATO and the US are expected to follow by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take back the possession of its territory and the Afghan people to decide their future without expecting everything from us.
We have punished Afghan farmers in particular by considering them as terrorists.
And ourselves with our 88 soldiers killed, as well as the injured and the injured.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former leaders who have escaped to Pakistan, but often also of farmers who refuse armed foreign presence, as at the time of the Soviet Union.
They want to defend their centuries of old and archaic traditions, even though jihadists, Pakistani, Arabs, Uzbeken and Tajiks have joined them.
Tolerated, sometimes supported by local rebels, the latter will no longer be there when the Western countries become more discreet.
The withdrawal of the French troops from the base in Nijrab, which I have observed from a hill planted with almond trees financed by French loans, was done properly.
The cargo and tank convoys overrun by helicopters have reached Kabul without being attacked.
As of the end of 2014, there will be no more Taliban influences in Kabul.
The conditions have changed since their irreversible premarch from 1994 to 1996.
At that time, Kabul was empty and the country was deprived of war due to the struggles of the various ancestral groups.
Their acquisition of power was then considered to be a kind of liberation and return to security.
The Afghan women have paid the price for obscurantism of the farmers overwhelmed by the organization Al-Qaida, but their situation has not improved so far.
Former Mudschaheddin, the Afghan government and current Taliban have the common desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The most important personalities of the anti-Soviet war came back to power in 2001.
They have turned into a businessman by seizing land from the government to sell them to refugees from Iran and Pakistan as a building country and thus benefiting from the massive US subcontracting.
And most of them were not themselves involved in the fighting.
As I heard in the campaigns, people want a government that does not consist of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, like those who could make use of American subsidies: capital escape is considerable.
The young people are tired of war and his ideologies.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they had contact with the modern world and enjoyed their benefits.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years old; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, which is a fifth of the total population.
In the cities, state schools are full of girls like boys.
These young people, who do not want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of certain leaders, will have to provide jobs.
All, including the armed parties, are obsessed with mobile phones; television with its Turkish series, which represent a modern world, is viewed everywhere.
There is an army now.
Are the authorities under whose command it will be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already endeavouring to restore the militia in the province which will withdraw from the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, the country of the mountains with strong local identities should have benefited from some decentralisation of the Western nations' example, but by abolishing the office of the Prime Minister, which existed since the Constitution of 1964, the United States wanted to make it a centralised state with strong presidential power.
President Karzaï does not want foreign controls, in particular in the event of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and a long time ago.
Industries have not been rebuilt, there are no functional dust plants and important irrigation systems have not been repaired.
Everything is imported; apart from fruit and vegetables, nothing is produced.
Priority is given to the private initiative.
In a country which was undermined by 30 years of war, it would have been necessary to control the infrastructure by state.
The rumor has been spread that Afghanistan possesses immense land resources.
This further increases the impression that the Western countries were only on the ground to empower themselves.
Without energy to process the iron or copper ore on the ground, or without means of transport for an export over the mountains, mining is not possible.
The Chinese have already almost abandoned the copper mines of Mes Aynak, the international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) in the huge Buddhist site have made their excavations and remain the main employers of the province.
One day it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are largely dependent on imports and exports, to restore normal relations.
The withdrawal of the French fighting forces was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional assistance: girls' and youth gymnasians, Institute for French at universities, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, a civil-military service of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was suspended in 2012, has carried out numerous non-profit work and measures for the rehabilitation of agriculture in dozens of mountain villages and has been carried out by a small French non-governmental organisation to try to achieve the "hearts and spirits" and the impossible task of achieving the compatibility of aid and offensive actions.
This work, for which a large number of local workers were required, has helped to suppress the uprising: irrigation, fountains, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increase in agricultural utilities.
What souvenir do we leave after military spending of two billion euros?
A much more modest budget will help improve local living conditions, which are very hard in these valleys often at a height of more than 2000 metres.
In the Embassy, dozens of written requests for small agricultural projects were received by municipalities of the province of Kapisa.
In order to free farmers from the rebellion led by foreign groups, what they wish, according to their own expressions, would require the continuation of civil aid which is directly related to them.
A Constitution with the Break Stave in Egypt
It is a new poker game by President Mohammed Mursi.
While Egypt remains divided more than ever with regard to the Constitutional Declaration, which temporarily gives it unlimited power of power, he has decided to put everything on a map.
To surprise everyone, he announced on Wednesday that the Constitutional Assembly would adopt its final version on the next day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State had granted this House two additional months for the completion of its work.
Egypt has now been based on a provisional text, which has been amended several times for almost two years, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal confusion.
This new initiative has only led to an even greater division of the country.
For his opponents, the president persists in his "autocratic delirium" by continuing "breaking his word" and "treating right with feet."
On behalf of his supporters, it is assured that it is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and to speed up the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
A very short period that forces the brothers to refrain from their project to explain to the Egyptians the text section to section.
For the President, it is also a way of refinding its public and democratic legitimacy while the protest is doomed throughout the country.
After confirmation in an interview with the American Week Time, Mohammed Mursi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote well.
As for the Egyptian people, with this retreat to an excessive vote, an ultimatum will be set: "Either you vote for my draft or I retain the unlimited power," the latter should probably end after the adoption of the Constitution.
85 mostly Islamic members of this constituent assembly adopted the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of the Liberals did not comply with the request.
Shortly before the constitutional declaration in mid-November, they turned away because they believe that they have not been able to put their views into effect.
Representatives of human rights organisations, religious minorities or civil society have acted equally.
In order to achieve the decision-making capability, 11 people, alternate members, were added in a hurry yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim brothers.
It is not surprising that the articles were generally adopted unanimously.
By the way, the commentators found it amusing that the only difference of opinion of the day has been expressed in the time of prayer, as some members of the board considered that the penalty of the constituent assembly did not go exactly.
The text, which was adopted last night, consists of 234 articles.
Finally, Article 2, which drew all attention, remains identical to that of the 1971 Constitution and states that "the principles of shearia are the main source of justice."
The Salafist parties, for which the establishment of Islamic law is an important requirement, had the hope to replace "the principles" with "the rules," which would have made a more stringent application possible.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed is proof of their good will and respect for the other members of the Egyptian society.
The Liberals, who see this as a propaganda attack, revert to "hypocrisy."
Because according to them, the Islamisation of the Constitution takes place on other articles.
In particular, they are looking at Article 220, which recognises an advisory function to the University of Al-Azhar, in particular with regard to the verification of compliance with the laws of the Sharia.
According to the Egyptian specialist Sophie Pommier, this is worrying, because "the people who are asked for an opinion have not been elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
Here you can see the first signs of a theocracy. "
The fears of the Liberals are also eaten by the fact that the next rector of this university is likely to be far less moderate than the present one.
"At present there is no specific religious commitment.
With this constitution we remain within the framework of the bourgeois state.
Most lawyers who have worked on this text are not Ulema, but academics who have been partly trained in the French system, "complains Alexis Blouet, who writes a doctoral work on the Egyptian Constitutional Transition.
He acknowledges, however, that, as regards Article 220, there may be ambiguity, since the terms used are deprived of the religious vocabulary.
It refers in particular to the "Fiqh" [Islamic case law, Anm.d. Red.].
And in the future, the question could be raised to what extent civil judges are competent to decide on it. "
In addition to his religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is strongly criticized by the extensive powers it gives to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim brothers argue that they are significantly reduced compared to the former regime.
Another point of dispute: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the military's wish, the examination of the defence budget is not presented to Parliament but to a national Defence Council.
Similarly, there will be no prohibition of civil proceedings in military courts, as the associations have demanded to defend human rights.
The latter also share their concerns about the text they consider to be a threat to freedom.
The reality of blasphemy is maintained and insults are now forbidden, which could have serious consequences for the right to freedom of expression, especially for the press.
In addition, no article relates to the protection of women, Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch emphasises.
They believe that the only positive point is the ban on torture by Article 36.
This word was not included in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian President had to express himself on television last night, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
The supporters of the Heads of State will march on Saturday.
In Israel Ukrainian tourists expect sacred places, the navel of the world and a sea of Sole
The promised country unites in itself the glory of biblical truths, modern comfort and an untouched nature.
AIF gives you the five main reasons for visiting Israel.
Bend before the holy places
Visit the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that all who bathe in this river receive God's blessing.
Galilee is the place where Jesus fulfilled his miracles: the transformation of water into wine at a wedding celebration, the walking on the water, the cessation of the sea storm and the fishing.
Ever here Jesus appeared his disciples after the resurrection.
However, most sanctuaries can be found in Jerusalem.
Believers here commit the path of suffering or the cross of Jesus Christ (in Latin: Via Dolorosa).
The path begins at the Roman fortress Antonia, Pretorium, where the court was, and leads through the streets of the old city to the Grabeskirche on the mountain of Golgotha, where the crucifixion, the anointing stone and the grave of Jesus is located.
Here is, in the Christian view, the navel of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of humanity.
The monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem stands at the place where a Christian legend says the tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem is also the holy place of the Jews - the plaintiff, the remnants of a temple destroyed by the Romans in the year 70 n. Chr..
Traditionally, people from different religions leave notes with desires that then go into fulfilment.
Make a journey to the height
The ruins of the fortress Massada form the remnants of the secret hiding from enemies, which made Herod of the Great in the year 25 n. Chr. for his family.
They are located on a rock wall in the mountains at 450 meters above sea level.
Only mountain climbers can reach the ruins of their own power.
Everyone else brings an airline to this historic summit.
In the north of the country in 1600 to 2040 meters altitude is the famous ski resort Hermon, which attracts countless tourists in the winter months.
From the foot of the mountain you can reach there with a shuttle bus.
The ski slopes have a total length of 45 kilometers.
According to an old legend, pagan gods lived on the mountain summit.
Visit unique museums
There are almost 300 museums in this country.
Not all of them can be visited on one journey.
But at least the five most interesting of them should be visited.
Among them is once the Israel Museum near the Knesset (Parliament).
There are old Qumran handwriting or scripts from the dead sea found in field halls in the Jewish desert, as well as about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is also worth a visit.
There is the collection of works of impressionists and expressionists Monet, Pissaro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso.
In Akko you can visit the museum in Bad Al Basha, which houses several sallets of old Turkish baths with sculptures of visitors and bathtubs.
In Caesarea you should visit the unique private Ralli Museum where you can admire sculptures of Dali and Rodin.
There are neither museum guides nor souvenir shops.
Entry is free and donations are rejected in principle.
The Fifth Museum, namely the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, tells of one of the most shocking chapters of history.
The most striking department is the monument for the children built to remember the 1.5 million children destroyed in the concentration camps and gas chambers.
In entering the room there is complete darkness.
Stars are rolling.
And it proclaims the names of the Jewish children and the countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Do something for health
The three main recovery areas of Israel are on the banks of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of the three places there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphin and ocean.
Surprisingly, in the Red Sea, the water temperature is not below 21 ° C and the air is warming up to 23 ° C.
The dead sea is even warmer and there is bathing all year round.
By the way, this unusual sea with a position of 417 meters below sea level is the deepest sea in the world.
His turquoise blue water has a high salt content and thus even carry non-swimmers easily on the surface.
The surrounding landscape is inconceivable beautiful.
Visitors come here for treatments using salt water (natural salt sole) and saline sludge as well as for the treatment of skin inflammation, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and to calm strained nerves.
The secrets of the age touch
These secrets lie in the old town of Tel Aviv, the city of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through this city the famous sea road, Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia were connected.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to deliveries, Noah just built his ark here, and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda with which he had a long and happy life in this place.
Tourists like to sneak through the narrow streets named after star signs.
Fortuna is supposed to be the legend for all who touch the walls in the alley with their star sign.
In Jaffa you can arrive newly married couples from all over Israel and even other countries at photo mines.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can streak through the Roman theatre and conquer the fortress of the Crusades.
In the Roman era, Caesarea was the most important city of Judaea and residence of the Roman state holders, including Pontius Pilatus.
The carefully restored theatre presents evening concerts and operas these days.
Track list for tourists
If you go to Israel, don't worry about your bad English knowledge: about 30% of Israelis speak Russian.
The money in the journey is preferred not to be taken into euros, but to dollars, which can simply be changed into shekels (current exchange rate: 1 dollar to 3.8 shekels).
In the city you are mostly on the bus, but in Jerusalem there is also a fast track and in Haifa the only metro line of the country with six stations connecting the subcity to the upper city.
In fact, it's a subterrestrial roadway.
A journey within the city costs 6 shekels, regardless of the means of transport, which is sufficient for a journey of up to 1.5 hours.
According to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath will be committed in Israel on Saturday.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday, markets and shops are closed, and public transport is resting.
And on Sunday morning, the week of work begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and restaurants, only cosher food is served, which excludes pork, marine products, fish without shovel and food containing both milk and meat products.
Instead, you have the choice between different dishes with hammer and beef, soup and desserts (prepared with coconut milk), traditional Jewish humus paste, different sauces, fried balls made of purified beans and peas (falafel) as well as fruit and vegetables.
In the streets of Israeli cities there are no streaming dogs.
For this there are many well-nourished cats that streamed comfortably and unsanitary through the streets.
In the evening you see them even sleeping on the roofs parking cars.
The cats like lively places and don't say no to delicious.
A rental car costs between 37 dollars per day (Hyundai Getz) and 188 dollars (Audi A6, Volvo S80) depending on the brand.
The insurance costs another $15 a day.
And bicycle rental costs 15 shekels a day.
Tickets for museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
In figures
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most adventurers and recreation seekers came from Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, the USA and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, 118,8 thousand Ukrainian tourists entered the promised country, which corresponds to an increase of 51% compared to the comparison period in 2010, before the abolition of visa obligation on 9 February 2011.
"The Great and Mighty" leads to Moscow: Migrants save money for language
While Members and Citizens' Rights are discussing the benefits of the law on binding language tests for migrants, criminals are already dealing with counterfeit certificates
Every year 13 million guest workers arrive in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
Most of them are the citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Her only goal is to earn money for the maintenance of families left in the home.
On 1 December, a law entered into force which requires every migrant to take a test that certifies the knowledge of the Russian language.
To date, this scheme only applies to migrants who wish to work in the services sector, in the local housing sector and in the retail trade.
However, the tests with time, according to the Federal Migration Authority, will become a duty for all host workers in the future.
It is not only language tests that need to be carried out, but also tests into Russian history and the foundations of legislation.
Language skills must be demonstrated for both the receipt and extension of the work permit.
Exceptions only apply to citizens of countries where Russian is official.
This law also excludes persons who have received their training certificates and diplomas prior to the destruction of the USSR in 1991.
meaning, problem and protection of rights
The entire audit bodies will be under the aegis of the Puschkin Institute for Russian Language, the Russian University of Peacekeeping, the Moscow State University, the St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
Migrants can take the tests in all cities; more than 160 corresponding centres have already been opened in Russia.
The initiative to launch the tests was supported by the members of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Authority.
Citizens' Rights, on the other hand, asked the following question several times before the entry into force of the law in the press: what does this actually mean?
What changes does the requirement to show language skills mean, both for the Russians and for the host workers?
In particular, spokesmen of the Migration Authority, it is about reducing the number of forced workers.
"Many are now talking about the protection of labour migrants' rights," says the Head of Representation of the Federal Migration Authority in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelev.
However, their rights must be protected before their departure.
Only organized recruitment will solve the problems of foreign workers at 90%.
Immigrants face problems without work, education, language skills and medical evaluation.
Sebelev is convinced that a future migrant without language knowledge will necessarily meet people with evil intentions who put him under the pretext of help into a dark, tight barrack, where he will hesitate with dozens of the same months without food and documents and create 12 to 14 hours a day.
We have many complaints from our migrants.
"In the home you will be promised a promise, and when you arrive you will be cheated, their passports will be taken away and will not receive the promised wage," confirms the Head of the Labour Migration Administration of the Tajik Migration Authority, Tolib Schwaripow.
Don't freak out, boss!
Nevertheless, many citizens of the Central Asian Republics who want to make their money in Russia admit that they can hardly express themselves in writing in their own language, not only the language of the country of destination.
Of course, this is not so much their fault, but rather the evil: only a few Turkmenen, Uzbeken and Tadschiken can afford a sensible primary education.
For in their families there is not even money to feed the children, let alone to buy them decent clothes, shoes and school things.
As a teenager, these children will immediately take the first opportunity to earn money.
"It is difficult without language knowledge," they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
Citizens' Rights emphasise the following important aspect of the law.
Only migrants with legal status need to take the test.
If you do not have this status, there is no examination and therefore no official work.
Meanwhile, most of the host workers remain illegally in Russia.
"Welcome" or "Access for Unauthorised"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to obtain official status in Russia.
The reason is bureaucratic hurdles and, of course, linguistic difficulties.
In addition, legalisation costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
Fake registration can be made quickly and only for one and a half thousand.
The Russian police staff know that our documents are mostly fake and we are not registered, and that is why there are cases of blackmail.
"You want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea," says Umed Huschkadamow to journalists.
"Just no cost for false papers shouting"
Already on the day the law entered into force, it turned out that not only the registration documents of migrants can be counterfeit.
Some fake certificates certifying the graduation of the language test have already been seized by staff of the Federal Migration Authority.
The counterfeit papers were printed with a regular color printer.
Of course, the new owners did not receive it for free: every migrant who hoped to save himself the tests paid seven thousand rubles for the document.
This is more than twice as much as the cost of the official test: it costs a job migrant three thousand rubles.
On the fact that the main direct task is to protect the system from corruption so that certificates cannot be easily purchased, both officials and civil servants agree.
For the moment, the authorities can only promise hosts who fall through the test for the first time that they will have time for a basic language course.
In addition, newcomers without language knowledge are offered jobs in areas where no active understanding with people is necessary.
Ministry of the Interior ignores illegal arms market
Percentage of legal weapons in criminal offences extremely low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior plans to strengthen the arms law for private weapons owners.
In this way, the authorities respond to the recent events: injured in shooting on weddings and seven dead in the moscow judicature Dmitri Winogradow.
The police want to ban the carrying of non-deadly weapons in the public and raise the age for the possession of firearms from 18 to 21 years.
The proposal was supported by the chairman of the Duma Committee on Security and Corruption, Irina Jarowaja, and promised that the amendments to the arms law will be presented shortly to the Duma.
Not all of us are satisfied that the Russian authorities want to fight the problems by "attracting screws."
An open letter was published on the Internet, whose author - representatives of various arms associations - calls for the authorities to refrain from "pointless tightening up".
The percentage of crimes with registered weapons is very low, the criminal judge, Wasilij Lesnikov, the Russian service of the BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, 142 crimes were committed using registered weapons during six months in 2012, while a total of 1,168 thousand offences were recorded for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that tightening the law for private arms owners will not prevent criminals from operating on the black market.
At present, the authors in Moscow can find every possible weapon for little money.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior underlines that the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from the factories to the officers
The weapons reach the Black Market via several channels.
There are five such main channels, tells a former Colonel Viktor Baranez, who worked for ten years in the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of a website that accepts weapons orders
The first channel is the army or military, i.e. weapons stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by both the Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves," says Baranez.
On the second channel come illegal weapons that are stolen by criminals.
Baranez explains that these include weapons stolen from both police chambers and directly from law enforcement officers.
Other weapons sold illegally come from military weapons camps.
In many military warehouses, explosions often occurred.
"There is evidence that some cases were arson-based in order to cover the lack of weapons," the former military member says.
According to Baranez, a contribution to the black market will also be made by the arms manufacturers.
"Nowadays there are countless private arms factories that do not withstand international competition and therefore squeeze the weapons under hand on the black market, such as in Moscow," the expert reports.
Another channel of the black market is smuggling.
Especially many guns and guns come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is a separate, sometimes craft production as well as a mafia that organizes the smuggling," the former military member explains.
Where did the weapons come from?
Experts calculated the share of each of the five channels in the supply of the black market with illegal weapons.
A report was prepared by the Centre for Problemanalysis and Government Administration in 2011.
The experts analysed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and the Federal Department of State Statistics, Criminal Literature and Public Data on Weapons Portals.
According to the investigators, the majority of the illegal weapons are from the army and the law enforcement authorities.
Half of all arms on the black market were there by "the blame of those responsible for their work with weapons," says the report.
According to researchers, 17% of weapons come from conflict areas, 14% fall in theft in arms production and 5% in illegal excavations.
A sales advisor of a weapons store that does not want to be named, assures that weapons found in the event of illegal excavations have long been purchased by no one since they are obsolete.
According to him, it is more frequent that dealers get the deposit in a weapons camp.
A gun, for example a type TT gun, is bought by an enemy.
The weapon is issued and passed through the fence.
"The dealer brings the gun to the city and sells it there for 900 euros per piece with two magazines," he says
"The police know of everything, of course, and therefore, if they cannot comply with the plan for detection of crimes, the sales advisor adds to periodic control purchases of dealers offering illegal weapons."
"Like in the luxury store"
Buyers and sellers find the most common about acquaintances.
I had looked at websites and blogs when someone became aware of me and proposed to me to come to the station "Begowaja," where a person would wait for me to bring me to a certain place where we could then negotiate the price.
The price for the gun I only learned there
Military Commentator Viktor Baranez
"To get a gun, I need a acquaintance who has contacts," says the sales consultant. "I have such a acquaintance, but I don't trust him."
There are dealers on the markets, but there you have to go and deal with a code like "by Iwan Ivanovich, who lets the daughter pass a tooth."
At the moment, I even get to some battles about a friend I trust.
He gives me the battlestraps because he knows I'm not giving him up.
Neulings are looking for weapons in different ways.
The former military member Viktor Baranez tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he wrote an article on this subject.
According to him, the plans have not changed.
He received a photo album in which "everything possible" was taken.
"I felt like I was in the luxury store," the military member remembers.
According to Baranez, the buyer does not get the cat in the bag, but can try everything.
As a potential customer, I'm not just buying, but I'm driving the seller into the woods, and we're setting up a target.
"I can then shoot there, and if I am convinced that the weapon has a good shot, we'll negotiate with each other," the expert describes the action.
Buy from the sofa
Internet search machines show search results on websites and groups in "Vkontakte," where weapons are offered "for different purposes."
No papers are needed or there are personal meetings.
"You only need the appropriate amount of money," says the advertisement on the website "Buy combat guns or guns."
There users give up your orders and ask questions.
Is it sold to minors?
"Of course without license," user asks "Iwan."
"Buy a TT. Moscow," is the laconian request of "Fedorenkow."
The Federal Security Service recently switched on countless web pages, and buyers who want to acquire weapons go to the service to the network.
People come like hungry fish at feeding and then land in Siberia and get to shovel coal
Military commentator and former military member Viktor Baranez
I have heard of the following scheme: The website is usually registered abroad, and Russian laws do not apply.
The controllers accept the orders.
The buyer transfers the money through a bank machine.
"In response, he receives a photo and a description of the hiding of the weapon," the press spokesman of the non-profit organization "Pravo na oryzhie" Dmitrij Kislow reports.
Viktor Baranez emphasises that you can finally go out empty and come behind bars when you place an inquiry on a website.
The Federal Security Service recently switched on countless web pages, and buyers who want to acquire weapons go to the service to the network.
"People come as hungry fish when they feed and then land in the Siberian labour camp and are allowed to shovel coal," he says.
A Makarov for 100 US dollars
According to experts, when buying illegal firearms, prices from 100 to 900 US dollars are expected.
According to Dmitrij Kislow from the organisation "Pravo na oryzhie" you can buy a macarob gun for 100 to 300 dollars.
You have to wait up to a month and a half.
The weapon is spent in military arms warehouses by supervisors of middle ranks.
According to official statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, the number of illicit weapons offences in Russia throughout the period January to October 2011 decreased by 7% to 22.9 thousand, while the number of detected cases of theft and blackmail related to weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosives decreased by 7.8%.
Fast food and supermarket workers strike in the USA
Every fourth American youth is sometime sitting behind Mc Donald's cash.
Over the past few days there have been massive protests across the US against low wages in branches of Walmart and restaurants of popular fast food chains such as Mc Donald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
No one can predict yet whether the protests are going to swell further or whether they are coming out of the air soon.
The protests are supported by trade unions and several left-wing non-profit organisations.
In addition to increasing the modest wages of simple walnut and fast food workers, the organisers of the protests are pursuing the goal of establishing trade unions.
To date, this sector of the economy has hardly been organised in a trade union manner.
46 cents a year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, on so-called Black Friday, where sales took place in the USA, attracting millions of customers, which sometimes led to hand mixtures.
On that day, some Walmart employees, of which there are 2.2 million worldwide, laid down their work and strived together with trade unions and left activists branches of the chain, whose target group of persons is low and medium income.
Walmart sells all products, from diapers to hunt rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The product in the Walmart branches is on average between 8% and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
Therefore, many of the low paid Walmart employees only buy in their own workplace.
The prices and the product range made Walmart one of the largest companies in the USA.
According to critics, Walmart can often sell the product only because the employees are poorly paid.
The latter also complain about severe working conditions, for example missing forklift or hand scanners.
The participants in the "Black Friday" protests demanded wage increases and expressed their concern that the contribution for the company's own health insurance had increased from 30 to 100 dollars a month.
A typical Walmart employee who earns $9.5 an hour could not afford this increase, they said.
Researchers from the California University in Berkeley show that if the company increases the average wage to 12 dollars per hour, it would cost Walmart 3.2 billion dollars.
That's about 1.1% more than they are now donating for wages.
If Walmart were to complete the wage increases to customers, every purchase would cost them only 46 cents more in the future.
Each year, this would be for them compared to today's extra expenditure of only 12.39 dollars.
The advocates of Walmart note satisfactorily that there were only protests in nine states and that they did not cause any losses to the company.
The Black Friday took the next day in his shop from 8: 00 in the evening on Thursday to midnight, and during this period Walmart sold about 5000 items per second.
In total, the Walmart Cases carried out almost 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
The spokesperson of the company, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview on the website of the left-facing Huffington Post that "less than five" Walmart employees had laid down the work and the protest action was only "another PR trick" of the union that organised the protests.
"Free box!"
The protests continued this week in New York, but their goal was not Walmart branches (which are not desired in this advanced city and are therefore inexistent so far), but McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says the company is selling billions of portions, and yet you are not given a day of sickness, and you are not paid for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, member of the New York City Council
At present, the minimum wage according to federal and New York legislation is 7.25 dollars per hour.
In fast food restaurants, the minimum wage is gradually increased, but not too strong, and on average their simple employees in New York get $8.90 an hour.
Less than she deserves nobody in this expensive city.
How it's possible to get out of New York with so little money is incomprehensible to me.
There was once a time when almost a quarter of all US young people were behind McDonald's theater after school, but the young people still lived with their parents.
There was hardly one who saw the main source of income or planned to stay there longer.
Now, interviews with McDonald's employees keep meeting people who complain that they can handle this reward and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, there is a comment in the Wall Street Journal Forum whose author notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how to feed them.
The participants of the protests that began on Thursday at 6: 30 in the morning before McDonald's in 40th Street and Madison Avenue demanded that the cashier and cooks of fast food restaurants receive a minimum wage of 15 US dollars per hour, which is more than doubling the current minimum wage.
They continued to demand the formation of trade unions in the fast food sector.
The US law forbids corporate management to stand in the way of this goal and to reject or dismiss trade union members.
On the other hand, management does not make it easy for them.
However, the establishment of trade unions in the fast food sector is also difficult for objective reasons.
The main reason is the high level of human resources fluctuation.
Unsatisfied
There were loud protests that day also before many other fast food restaurants in Manhattan.
The highlight of the protests was a meeting in front of McDonald's at Times Square, where some local Democrats spoke, including city council member Jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald's says it sells billions of portions, and yet you are not given a sick day, and you are not paid for your honest work!"
The demonstrators were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, mayor candidate Bill De Blasio, who said that "we should jointly support the fast food staff so that they can obtain a fair wage and achieve the economic prosperity that any New Yorker deserves!"
According to the New York Times, this was the largest action of their kind in the history of the American fast food industry.
However, only a few hundred people were on site, not all of whom are employed in the fast food sector, where tens of thousands work in New York.
It is not yet possible to see if the spark of these protests will mobilise all the masses.
"The brain can be overlistened only moderately so far"
The theme of the enlarged reality that is popular with modern technology followers has recently been perceived by the lens of a special glasses.
First Google presented a functional model at its annual conference in the summer, and then in November it became known that Microsoft had also applied for a patent.
In conversation with the head of the group for interactive 3D technologies in the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, it becomes clear that the glasses were only a transit station for the scientists of the company.
It enriches the possibility to manipulate virtual objects in the air with bare hands and create virtual outdoor surfaces.
- Please describe briefly what research your group is doing.
- We are dealing with the interaction of man and machine, but we want to extend the limits of this interaction.
So far, humanity has remained largely stuck in the phase in which pixels are worked on flat screens, which are sometimes also touched.
However, we want to anticipate 5-10 years and anticipate the radical changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect sensors are a progress, and nowadays no Xbox will be sold without Kinect as everyone is interested in movement control.
- What else do we expect in the future?
- Although Kinect has brought the interaction to a physical level, much still plays on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the system receives more data) has been improved, the output has not yet been decisive.
We try to change this, work on real three-dimensional representation systems based on different technologies, including projections.
We have to release the computer world into our physical world and make it more understandable.
However, it is necessary to recognise not only the user, but also its environment.
Then we could complement the real world much easier by virtual objects.
And first of all, we should get rid of these stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think of language control?
She's popular, but isn't she overrated?
- It is certainly not the solution to the general objective, because it raises privacy issues, because it does not always want to inform all the circumstants about its actions and intentions.
In fact, any kind of interaction with computers is good, but every one in their specific niches.
For example, we worked in the field of the management of objects in public places at a project where we experimented with short and narrow, instead of with loaded gestures.
The gestures were recorded not by the object camera, but by a bracelet that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is still relatively large, but could theoretically be reduced to the size of a bracelet watch.
But the whole future, however, belongs to mixed types of control, such as gestures and language.
- How's that?
- We would ask you, for example, to give you this splash dose?
They say it and point to it at the same time.
- Normally, I'm just saying it.
- Oh, that would be very hard to see.
- Does that mean you want the user to adapt to what a machine can afford at the time and what can't?
Not necessarily, but this is about a mutual approach.
I think that in the next few days we will have to work primarily on the development of new sensor types that will allow people to get more precise responses.
For example, these can be laser sensors, as they offer a good resolution in the depth, which is very important.
- What are your demands based on your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors on modern cameras?
Is there a lack of resolution, depth or anything else?
- The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 fps would not be bad.
But the main thing is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
In this way, all current technologies are not good enough for us, as the developers of algorithms have more work.
It must be taken into account not only the resolution along the X and Y, but also along the Z axis.
The speed and number of images per second are also important.
The movements of man are extremely dynamic and openly spoken, the current 30 fps are not enough especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes developed in our laboratory in Redmond a contact sensor with a adjustable processing delay between 1 and 100 milliseconds, with today's commercial sensors closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction of man and machine.
For my work, I needed a device like this, just without touch control and with more pictures per second.
- Don't you have to increase the number of cameras?
- Kinect is currently working with three "cameras," one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other is a receiver for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually a regular RGB camera.
It does not serve to calculate the depth of the object.
More cameras might solve the problem...
Or strengthen the problem as more calculations would be necessary.
It would be nice to have a flexible, kinect-like system in which we could play with different camera applications to determine how this helps us to identify a position in three-dimensional terms.
- If I remember correctly, Microsoft did not present his glasses to the public unlike Google.
Don't you think that with regard to the application of the technology of extended reality in everyday life the glasses have the best prospects?
- Of course it is not pleasant to keep a smartphone on the way in the raised hand, but I think the following: the most amazing variant would be a "changing" extended reality in which we could switch over a cloud from the glasses to the smartphone,
The glasses are a personal gadget and there lies their strength (private can only see you), but at the same time their weakness, because an extended reality by glasses prevents you from working with others on virtual objects.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air is accessible not only to Tony Stark from Iron Man but also to normal mortals.
There is a problem that the critic of this idea often points to: there is no sensible reaction!
Hands don't feel anything!
What answers will your group give to this objection?
- In my lectures, I often speak of the fact that the enlarged reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth breakthrough could be the integration of tactile perception.
An interesting method is currently the use of the second hand as something unusual projection document.
She's taking great pressure!
However, there are also technologies that are actually aimed at giving the "images in the air" something handy, for example, the interference of some directed ultrasonic beams at a particular point where the finger is located, a feeling that is still so weak at the moment as someone puked over the hand balls.
There are also tapes for the wrist that affect the nerve endings in the fingers, even this is a potential direction.
- Have you tried to overlist the brain?
It makes thinking that it feels what it should feel when it sees something right now?
- That's a good idea, so we haven't tried yet.
Here there is another task to hide, which we will have to fight for a long time, namely to let a person physically located in a closed room think he is in an open, practically infinite space instead; here we are working on concepts with treadmills (other than in gym), moving platforms and large bullets.
So far, the brain can only be overlistened moderately, and we still have many working years ahead.
That is precisely what makes the work in the field of virtual reality so attractive for a researcher: in many topics we are only at the beginning.
Own taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project "Petersburg Avantgarde," which is dedicated to urban residents who form the Avantgarde of Art and Culture.
On the experienced list, high-level representatives of the Petersburg art scene, whose successes go beyond the city's borders and who often find recognition in Europe, without being known in the rest of Russia.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, the bearded bearded in red, which is sometimes addressed at the Russian Museum, at the summer garden, at scene meetings or on vernishes.
Wherever the pictures of Kirill Miller are exhibited, they attract great human masses.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg social-philosophical artists who create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant personality of the Petersburg Avantgarde at the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s.
He is also a man of the city and, through his presence on the street, spells a smile in the face of his fellow citizens and gives them a good mood.
Recently, he grabbed a swirl and became a Petersburg shrink player, as he finally felt ready for this difficult role in terms of his artist, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you always in red and not in yellow or Turkish in town?
I have chosen the color red as a fashion designer that deals with the optics and the image.
In this world, red is the compromise between artists, image consultants and society.
In society, everything that differs from the graunorm calls for aggression and bad behavior.
But I want to talk to people through my provocations.
Each of my previous provocations was an invitation to talk.
When did you know you had to be a painter?
- At an exhibition at the Cultural Palace Newskij, where my work was exhibited.
I realized I had to go this way.
Then the time of the old free but not officially recognized painters ended then, and new and free painters like me were incomprehensible.
I was friends with the painters of the new generation, that is, with the representatives of the "Gazonewschina," which was the result of "Puschkinskaja 10," and then it was over.
It attracts me to the theater, to fashion, to music, to everything but literature.
And all this united in your art clinic... it was important to me to be at the centre of the Petersburg culture where the best creative artists should gather.
In 1995 I occupied a room in the Puschkinskaja 10, and there was a musical-artistic club for the Boheme, the house of the Petersburg Boheme until the renovation work.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I also remember how Schnur came there with his project "Ucho Van Goga."
Schnur and his friends sang simple songs to play back, wore tight tricks and belonged to them also to the composer Igor Wdowin, who was promised today.
When the group started playing live, it became "Leningrad."
Trachtenberg moderated many programs before the time of "Halli-Galli."
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it began his great career, but he learned the foundations with us.
The gallery "D 137" or the club "Griboedov" also originate in the Art Clinic.
That's where our staff and tribal guests went.
I am a hero of the last century when culture meant something.
In 2000, there was a survey in the press about the award of "personalities of our city."
I won in the category "Artists of the Year," and so I had reached the highlight.
It is not easy in new times to work according to old rules; I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In today's time it is easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: one can be famous without thereby making a cultural contribution.
- Your work has an inexplicable style.
- Many of my pictures are real beads and clearly express the actuality and sharpness of thoughts.
I will have an exhibition on "The Russian Museum as Clowns."
Clowns are timeless.
I used to be social, but now it hurts and fears to be like that.
In a clown, it wipes it all and loses its tragedy.
I love the groteske, and I have groteske ideas.
For example, let's save the world by prescribing that everyone has to dress up completely.
Now everyone looks after the clothes and focuses on the outside and not on the inside of man.
But maybe you can't give a man the hand, but you should spit him in the face.
The deception disappears by dressing.
We just saw you in the role of the city roller.
Who if I don't?
- Can commercial art be nice too?
- Nowadays commercial art must be careful, cautious and flattering.
We see the destruction of cultures.
The people used to form large groups: the Bohemian loved the one and the simple people the other.
Now there are microcommunities, and it's hard to like everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar note that everyone likes.
Now you have to think about who you're gonna like.
Now every cult star has about 100 followers.
- But to the performances of Stas Michailov come several thousand!
- To get to him abandoned women, there the sexual-social sphere plays a role.
For cultural reasons, 300 people arrive and not 10 thousand, so there is less management, money, and everything goes down.
I have followers, and the most important thing is not to cheat on them and not to destroy the accomplishment.
In my youth I painted such images that were even in a series with the works of Falk and Larionow at a collector.
I started with pictures that usually only come at the end of my career.
Nowadays there are often misunderstandings.
It is called: spiritual culture and consumer culture.
Consumption has no culture at all, that's something completely different.
I am a man of past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and refused money to paint.
This is the culture I support.
Kirill, what's missing Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
They say: Servant of culture.
But not every one of them can deal with culture.
It was different for the real Zars, because the Zars may not understand much of culture, but they understood that real experts are needed.
There are currently good advisors in Moscow.
In Petersburg we have those who could be experts, but they are being blocked the way, because there is a need for higher-ranking experts who properly evaluate the first ones and free them.
Now only your own taste counts.
The same applies to the Erarta, but with the difference that they honestly say that they do not accept all contemporary art and therefore some painters have to look for other museums.
- What's for you, Petersburg?
- Petersburg is not the Capital of Culture; in Moscow there is much more culture and a similar nutritional soil.
On our rocks, art can only grow hard.
We need a cultural nutrition floor, for for example, we now have more writers than readers, and that is not right.
In Europe there are many curious people who visit exhibitions or concerts.
It's much less for us.
Art must be modern again, as at the beginning of the last century.
The project is financed from the subsidies of the city of Sankt Petersburg
Birth in space
Earth in danger.
Earth warming or confusion with killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with earthquake on board are looking for a replacement planet.
In order to save humanity, the important question arises how we can reproduce ourselves in gravity or on the replacement planet?
I do not think there are many choices.
In fact, there are only two real planets that we could at least inhabit hypothetically.
"Namely Mars and Venus," says the scientific staff of the Astronomical Sternberg Institute Vladimir Surdin.
However, while the conditions on Mars are comparatively life-friendly, there is a temperature of 500 degrees on the surface of the Venus.
Life would only be possible at a large height or in the Venus runway, i.e. in space.
The question of reproduction in space was first dealt with by researchers with regard to the flora.
A half-century before that, experiments were carried out with plants.
The fourth generation of peas bred in the orbit did not differ in the least from the earthly species.
It followed the breeding of insects, more precisely of small fruit flies (drosophila), in the orbit.
In 1979 guards were sent to space to explore the impact of gravity on the development of embryos.
It develops a normal chicken.
But then the problem starts.
"The problem is that the chicken must find stop; it must be able to stand on his legs and begin to move," explains the laboratory leader of the Institute for Medical-Biological Problems RAN, Vladimir Sychev.
Without a solid underground, the chicks crossed wild.
Ten hours later, the instincts of the newborns completely jumped.
The chicks did not respond to light and sound.
Four days later, they just died.
"Two times we let chicks slip and then set it up, because it is simply impossible to work with them there," says Vladimir Sychev for the failed experiment with the chicks in space.
The last cage with animals flew into the orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in spring 2013.
However, only generic species will be found on the biosatellite "Bion."
There was an experiment with rats that were already sent to space fruitful.
In principle, nothing was found to be special.
"This was just with the biosatellites, but once again it was just a single experiment, and the research needs to be continued," noted Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the space rats were born.
The problem of reproduction directly in space has not yet been resolved.
The task is difficult.
Animals that are torn out of their natural habitat cannot simply follow their reproductive activity.
Unlike animals, human beings could do that in principle.
The homo sapiens is capable of abstract thinking and can create a similar emotional background.
Such experiments are not carried out from ethical considerations.
But women have been flying to space for 50 years.
The greatest risk was with Tereschkowa.
The most valuable thing that mankind possesses is the female organism.
Our Möwe flew away, and no one on Earth could have answered the following question: does she survive the space flight?
Will she be able to bring a child to life after this flight?
"Finally no one answered this question," says space veteran Wachtang Watschnadse.
In June 1964, just a year after her space flight, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereschkowa, was born a daughter.
The father of the child, Andrijan Nikolajev, was also Kosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman in space, Swetlana Sawizkaja, who was twice in orbit and even worked outside the spacecraft, was born a son.
Still, there's still a risk.
We only have very few cosmonauts, where everything went well after long flights and they got healthy young people.
"The more, the more dangerous it is even for flights into the orbit," concludes Kosmonaut Waleri Poljakov, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of the Russian Federation.
Yet humanity must seek new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection and artificial gravity.
The hydrolaboratory at the preparation centre of the cosmonauts is a mandatory station during the flight preparation.
Here in a state of floating the cosmonauts win routine for work in the open space.
The water is the gravity.
Even if adults feel water as pleasant, it is a strange environment, but infants feel water as a natural element.
It's like the little Ichtyander's testimony that life on the land escaped from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a child is in the mother's belly for about 9 months and that it can then get better used to water.
In principle, it makes sense, since from birth to first swimming just passes once two weeks.
"This is too little time to forget something," says baby swimmer Marina Aksenowa.
While for a newborn child gravity is a much more natural condition, the woman does not come out without gravity.
In the state of gravity, the abdominal and pelvic muscles are rapidly reduced and thus also decreases the ability to squeeze the child out.
All right, let's deal with this through birth-inducing tools.
For example, the birth could also take place in a special chamber to push the child out.
"But what happens then?" is the non-negligible question of Waleri Poljakov.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling the education, the organism cannot train the skeleton and the muscles.
A newborn child cannot be put into a load suit in the orbit as an adult for training.
He will simply miss what is essential for his life.
"This experiment, which we are doing together, namely the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead us to bring to the world a handicapped, a completely unfit person," says the head of the Bioethics Commission of the Institute for Medical-Biological Problems RAN, Igor Pestow.
So far, the birth of children in space is just a theory.
At some point, however, it will become reality when the earthquake in their spaceships break up to a distant planet that will be home for their descendants in space.
Head of the NKK: Control of the black system fails due to debts of politics
In the case of public contracts, the Czech Republic has good control bodies and adequate laws, but its application is reversed.
In the discussion for Aktuálně.cz, the Vice-President of the Supreme Control Office (Nejvyší kontrolní úřad, NKő), Miloslav Kala, said this.
"A law is never perfect, but it needs to be applied correctly - and I do not think that is the case with us," Kala commented on the current situation.
A similar result appears to be a joint control by Czech and German auditors.
As a negative example of practice, he introduces the position of Prime Minister Petr Nečas to the so-called "Black System."
Recently the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not harass entrepreneurs with controls - is the system now prohibited or allowed?
"A law must have its validity, and if something is forbidden by law, then it cannot simply come to the President of the Government and impede the Office, whose duty is to control compliance with the law," Kala states.
At the meeting of the Control Committee of the Chamber of Representatives, you discussed a joint Czech-German project in which the laws of both countries on public contracts were compared.
What was it about in concrete terms?
This is a parallel examination that we started about two years ago.
Simply speaking, it is a question of the European legislature defining how public contracts are to be handled, building on national legislation, and finally there is the actual practical application.
We have compared all of this, and although the examination is not yet completed, we have found extremely interesting differences. Generally speaking, the laws are perhaps even more "stricter and more perfect," but the actual application in Germany is better in some parameters.
This confirms that it is not enough to draw up new and more precise rules again and again. It is also necessary to deal with the actual application of the law.
How can the project help you? What results from this project?
It is precisely such a joint control that could help us stop constantly trying to achieve the perfection of laws and to reduce and eliminate thresholds if this does not seem to have a particularly positive effect.
Economic efficiency means buying one thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) and excluding unlawful enrichment or even criminal acts.
But the reduction of thresholds for contracts does not guarantee that we will also achieve this objective.
Perhaps it is even so that in this way we only burden the system with excessive "paperwork," and those looking for gaps in the system have it much easier to use the system than if the thresholds remained higher.
They are talking about the problems with the practical implementation of the Czech procurement law.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there a similar authority here as our NK, or does the system work differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, the German pendant is the NKI of the Federal Accounting Court, which is similar to that of us and also has a college that is only slightly different, but basically both authorities work similar.
Competences are also to a certain extent comparable, but Germany is a state, that is to say that these Court of Auditors also exist in the individual Länder - in which the German system differs from ours.
The BRH can only control federal funds that correspond to our state resources.
Public funds managed by the districts and municipalities are subject to the control of the National Accounting Boards.
As far as German legislation is concerned, is it simpler than ours?
In general, I would not like to compare this without concrete details. However, Germany is often referred to as a model in some respects, but one can certainly not say that Germany is better in everything.
Is that because the auditors are better there?
I don't think so, but, as I said, I don't like such comparisons very much.
To this end, it should be noted that those countries that are a model for us also have problems.
Otherwise, they wouldn't have any cooperation with our authority, would they?
As far as Czech legislation is concerned, what was the importance of the modernisation of the contract law for your authority, do you feel any effects?
Given that this novelle is only in effect for a short time, it has not yet been effective in our tests.
Since our controls are carried out retrospectively, some delays have to be expected here.
If we are to date more aware of the impact of the preparatory phase of future controls - so we have introduced the new control instrument "Detection of risks of ineconomicity" and examined and analysed with these nearly 14.000 public contracts - the changes will of course have an impact here as the thresholds change, the conditions for certain types of tenders have been modified, including:
Do you see the adoption of this law rather positive, or is the system being burdened by further bureaucracy?
I believe that this law is certainly a step in the right direction and I hope that this adoption will be confirmed.
However, the problem may arise that the rules will become more stringent and cannot be complied with anymore.
Already under the previous rules, persons subject to an examination of the institution (for example, in the case of an operational programme of regional policy, the Regional Council) are accountable to ensure that any non-compliance with the contract law is equivalent to an infringement of budgetary discipline.
But is it useful to make the law even more straightforward?
I do not think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system and not punish those who have committed a form error that does not affect the actual decision-making process.
Such a system only puts even more pressure on bureaucracy.
Where's the way out of here?
First of all, let us say which path is not the direction.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS would not enlighten entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called "black system" - what exactly does that mean?
Is the black system now prohibited or allowed?
A law must have its validity, and if something is legally forbidden, then it cannot simply come to the President of the Government and impede the Office, whose duty is to control compliance with the law.
He can say, "We change the law and allow it to happen," but he can't say that we act like nothing.
The procurement law contains relatively strict rules on the formal execution of certain transactions - and that is also right for the protection of public competition.
On the other hand, it is also tragic to exclude the tenderer with the best offer solely because of malformations.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be properly applied - and that is what I believe is missing from us.
On the streets there is unified ice glazing, but mostly dry.
On the streets of the Czech Republic there is partly snow and ice glasses.
However, most of the roads are well accessible, sometimes increased caution is needed.
Karlsbad
In the district of Karlsbad the streets were well accessible this morning, united snow and ice glasses prevailed.
Temperatures fall to -5 to -10 ° C, it should be a little warmer during the day.
In the region it is no longer snowing, and in the lower heights there is only a thin snow blanket.
On the combs of the Archdiocese, however, there is about 30 cm of snow.
According to the District Road Guard, there was a limited vision due to Nebels.
The R6 highway and the road route of the first road class in the region are currently fully accessible.
However, attention should be paid, for example, to bridges on which the trails are sometimes required and smooth.
All road routes of the second and third categories, including mountain roads, are also available.
On these streets, however, there is a partial requirement or an exit of shuttle.
In particular, attention should therefore be paid to the higher levels.
Pardubice and Hradec Králové districts
On some streets of East Bohemia there is a danger for ice glazing, in higher layers and in the mountains there is sometimes an outgoing snow layer on the streets, the road and motorway directorate communicates on their websites.
The road champions warn drivers of ice glasses, which may occur especially in higher layers in the district of Pardubice.
Ice glasses can be found in the districts of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy and Vysoké Mýto.
The streets I / 43 and I / 34 at Svitavy are chemically treated.
Snow lies in particular on the streets of the giant mountains and in the mountains of Orlické hory.
A snowy layer is located on the streets of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In East Bohemia today it is mostly sunny or hotter, and it remains largely defeat-free.
Temperatures move between -3 and + 1 ° C, it wears a weak wind.
Pilsen District
The roads in the district of Pilsen are now well accessible, but more attention is needed locally, and the driving method should be adapted to the weather.
This is chilled in the morning, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below the freezing point.
Since it has snowed before and the temperatures then fell, it can come on the streets to ice glasses.
Local fog is also expected, but the vision will improve in the course of the day.
This information comes from the district street champions.
The D5 motorway is practically fully accessible, but increased attention is recommended by the road champions between the 80th and 131km.
The first road tracks are mostly dry but frozen.
In the south of the districts of Pilsen and Tachov, however, there can be secluded ice glasses.
The road tracks of the second and third categories are wet and therefore the reference to possible required sections applies here.
Drivers should be particularly careful mainly on the less frequent roads in the Böhmerwald area.
Olomouc district
Snowmatth has to be expected today for drivers on the way towards the heights of the district of Olomouc.
After the use of scratch vehicles, snow maths remain on the passport Červenohorské sedlo and on the road towards Videlský kříž.
The road champions were forced to use the night snowfall, in the district of Šumperk, according to the road administration, about 3 cm new snow fell.
In the other areas of the district, the trails are usually fully accessible.
"In the Kreis Šumperk still remains the nightest in the heights.
On the Červenohorské sedlo passport, drivers in the direction of Jeseník have to expect snowmat, "said a staff of the street administration Šumperk today to the agency ČTK.
Also her colleagues in the circle of Jeseník had to get out at night, according to their information, the streets are free and wet to the elevations after chemical treatment.
In the district of Olomouc the streets are fully accessible, but in the district of Šternberk the drivers must drive gently in the woods, as the tracks are still wet.
Ústí nad Labem District, Liberec District
In northern Bohemia, the road champions report a number of badly accessible road sections.
In addition to several places with snow or ice glasses, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice is blocked in the district of Ústí n.K. according to traffic police.
Temperatures also remain in deeper layers below zero, so snow and ice will stay on the streets. From the depths, especially southeast of the Bohemian Middle Mountains, no problems have been reported, and the streets are usually dry there.
No traffic disturbances have been reported so far.
Ice glatte is reported in particular from the district of Štětí.
According to meteorologists there were ideal conditions for this in the night - during the day rain and melting snow, in the night cloudy sky and frost.
From the main routes and road I / 13 at the border of the districts Ústí n.L. and Liberec, bad traffic conditions are reported.
The barrier of the road between Telnice and Knínice was necessary due to branches pushed from the snowload to the track.
Šimon Ornest: On our concerts we want to collect positive energy
What do you think that is supposed to take place in less than a month of world defeat?
This is one of the catastrophic reports on which we are so happy to jump on people.
With our band The Tap Tap we make fun of it and say that we are the only band in the world that can collect enough positive energy to stop or prevent the world's fall.
In December you will also realize a unique project with three concerts against the world's defeat.
Can you introduce the project to our readers?
This is a country-wide benefit event, which we have been planning for two years.
For this we want to use the marketing potential of the Maya calendar, whose end is forecast for December 21st at 11: 10 in the morning.
On the day before, i.e. on December 20th, three concerts will be held at the same time from 21: 00 in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
The end of the concerts should be in about the time at which the Mayan calendar ends on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which is in a 12-hour time zone ahead of us.
Who's this idea from?
Originally, I guess, then we designed the idea together with our graphic Honza Augusta.
We do not just want to collect enough positive energy to prevent the world's fall, but we also want to think together with the public about the state in which we once give this world to our children.
At the end of the Maya calendar we have also developed a unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, pockets and key folders against the world's downward, with which people can also support us via www.e-tap.cz.
The band The Tap Tap, together with other interpreters, also recorded the so-called hymne against the world's defeat with the title "World Defeat falls out."
Already today the hymn on YouTube is very popular. Will it also be declared on the Benefizconcerts?
Of course, at the end of the day, provided that everything works and that the world is not going down...
The hymne is to be sung simultaneously by all interpreters at all three concerts.
In addition, the hymns are broadcast live in a direct circuit from the Czech television.
The text of the hymne comes from Tomáš Hanák, who also plays the main figure of Jesus in the video clip, also Xindl X sings with...
How did you get to cooperate with both?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, which is related to the fact that we are implementing many benefit events and concerts...
We strive to involve these people in our projects intensively.
It has shown that most people are interested in cooperation with us and have fun with it.
What is the purpose of winning the concerts against the world's defeat?
For the establishment of the barrier-free education centre Studeo, where we have been working with the club Tap at the Jedlička Institute for six years.
The students of the Jedlička Institute are regularly supervised by lecturers who help them with different leisure activities.
Since the students themselves do not have the means to visit the lecturers, we would like to help them in this way.
In the context of the completion of the Jedlička Institute, a separate building is to be created in which we then move in with this project.
At each concert several groups and interpreters appear.
What criteria have you chosen?
We wanted to set up a program that addresses all generations including children.
In Prague, for example, Chinaski, Support Lesbian, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý appear.
Find out more on the website www.kpks.cz.
Are similar "big events" planned for the future?
In May we will play for the first time at Prague Spring, and we will also prepare an interesting program with interesting guests for this concert.
Next year we would also like to appear in the Czech House in New York, and I personally - if we are in the United States - would like to link this to performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not very small, so far you have appeared in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap, however, is a group composed of people with disabilities.
How do you manage these journeys logistically and organisatorically?
It's not as bad as it appears at first sight.
Five of our members are wheelchair drivers, i.e. wheelchairs must be transported in the luggage room. Furthermore, of course, we have to carry many instrument bags and other luggage...
Nevertheless, it has always worked without problems so far, ČSA and British Airways were always very well prepared for us that sometimes I have wondered.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
Through your trips abroad you have a comparison of how it looks in the individual countries with accessibility, how to deal with people with disabilities, etc.
How have you experienced these things so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities where everything works better than ours, we were witnessing in Russia that in the east everything is still in its beginnings.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is absolutely not handicapped. There it is still unusual if someone in the wheelchair is on the way alone in the city center.
It is not even clear there that a wheelchair driver should be introduced in the elevator, for example.
Fortunately, there are also associations trying to highlight the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what way do we have to pick up the further developed countries?
There's still a lot of things we're hanging out in...
However, it should be noted that an improvement in the situation is always dependent on the efforts of those concerned.
In London and Madrid it is absolutely common that people with severe disabilities can also move independently in public space, go to the museum, use toilets etc.
But it is not exactly common that a larger group of people with disabilities are actively involved in social events there, in which we are a little ahead of the West with the band The Tap Tap!
Respect in the public and accessibility is one thing, but only when important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers come out of our series, things will really begin to change.
So far, these are only individual cases of particularly willful personalities.
The Tap Tap is currently very popular. But if we go back a few years: What motivated you to create a band in 1998?
At that time, I started as a guardian at the Jedlička Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in dealing with something intense.
And since I am a musician myself and play Saxofon among others, I founded a music AG together with a colleague.
Well, and with time, that, like our moderator, Láňa Angelovič, pleases to say, something is getting out of control (laughs).
But the band was only known in the last few years, or am I wrong?
It is true that cooperation with well-known singers has helped us; and we have also begun to advertise actively for us.
We have become aware that if you do something and you do not see it outside, your own performance does not exist in a certain sense.
Thanks to EU funding, we can also afford good lecturers, high-quality equipment and so on.
Was it your goal to bring it this far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I've felt the potential that things can be handled differently.
In the show business today, one often copies the other.
This is logical in its way, as everything new is looked with caution and is only accepted after a longer period of time.
There are only a few really unique things, and I dare say that Tap Tap belongs to it.
The first impression the viewer usually has is, of course, compassion; this is only natural...
But this pity is absolutely unnecessary because people with disabilities are not lonely and abandoned beings that we should regret.
It is people who can live a full life and develop, provided they have the necessary means to do so.
I always say that if people with disabilities succeed, this is not only a progress for them themselves, but for the whole society.
Was it also helpful for this success that you are a tough boss, as you hear from many people?
If you want to do something right, you cannot compromise in many things and you must also ask for some discipline.
However, I believe that this is completely normal.
Some come to us with romantic ideas, and when they find out that they have a sample twice a week, have to complete preparatory phases and spend a lot of time on concert trips, the enthusiasm of many quickly dies.
But this is how it works everywhere, in every band that wants to work seriously and achieve something.
Currently The Tap Tap has twenty members.
How many were there from the beginning, that is, since 1998?
Only one: Láňa Angelovič.
We're an open group, people come and go, you can't stop it.
Whoever has the will and wants to participate is always welcome to us.
Arrivals take place on the day before the projected world defeat, Thursday, 20.12.2012 at 21 a.m.
Events are: Incheba-Arena / Prague, Fléda / Brno and Plynojem / Ostrava; 12 Czech bands and other musicians
Finally, all three events are connected by live circuit and it declares a common interpretation of the hymne "World Doom falls from" the band The Tap Tap.
The purpose of the concert is to mobilise funds for the provision of a multifunctional disability-oriented educational centre to be created under the name STUDEO at the Jedlička Institute in Prague. Cost point: CZK 25 million
Entry costs 400 CZK, children up to 12 years free of charge, tickets are available in advance at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and space.
Last week, Poland was admitted to a ministerial meeting of the members of the European Space Agency ESA as the twentieth member of this Space Authority. Poland is thus the second member of the former East Block (after the Czech Republic, who became ESA member on 12 November 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and participated in several ESA projects in the following years.
The path of Poland to space began much earlier.
Even before the Second World War, Polish cosmos was concerned with space, not always understanding.
For example, I recall the presentation by A. Šternfeld of 6 December 1933 at the Warsaw Observatory, in which the author presented thoughts from his pioneering work "entrance to cosmonautics."
However, the ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) made the listeners cold, and after years Šternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
Šternfeld won the Prix REP Hirsch, founded by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch in 1934.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became an important advocate of astronomy and space.
In Polish magazines he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski's recognised contribution to the development of space was appreciated, among other things, by the name of one of the crater on the Earth side of the Moon after him.
In 1925 a railway draisine was built in Poland for which a rocket drive was planned.
Unfortunately, the author of the draft and the details of this project remained unknown.
It is not even clear whether the rocket should be used to start or to brake the wire.
The information on this is exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933, the Polish infantry began to deal with missile-operated shots.
The research carried out by the Institute Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in cooperation with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
It is clear from the documents provided that research has been advanced to the stage of practical tests.
The research was then interrupted by the invasion of the German army.
In 1937, in the specialist press, the design of a photoelectric hunt draket from Ing. Rohoziński appeared, and in the following year the work "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" of the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky appeared.
Both projects dealt with the military use of the rocket drive.
Shortly before the war, all projects for military use of rocket technology were coordinated by the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komit Doradczo-Naukowy).
The Committee was set up in 1937, but after two years of work his work was completed from the beginning of the war.
Further articles on space travel appeared after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Space Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne) in the Polish press.
The first mention of this society takes place in 1954 in the November edition of the magazine Problemy, in which four extensive articles of space are dedicated.
The article of Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal for the establishment of a space company.
At the time there were already the first projects on satellite technology, and it was expected that the exploration of space would have the future.
In its early 1956, the Polish Space Company PTA tried to join the International Federation for Space, founded in 1951, and in fact the PTA became a regular member in the autumn of 1956.
In the following year, the first PTA president, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became Deputy Chairman of the International Federation for Space.
He had this office until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA has played a major role in the development of the extremely successful meteorological missile (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish missile for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first start took place on October 10, 1958.
The rocket with a maximum flight height of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and weighs not entirely 5 kg.
Later an improved version, the RM-1A, was built, and in 1959 began in the Błędów desert flight tests with the two-stage raket RM-2.
The rocket was 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another stage of development should already be able to do real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should reach a flight height of up to 14,5 km and be used for the observation of highwind.
However, further development was stopped in 1962.
The first RM missile was developed in 1962 to 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage raket, its total length was 510 cm and its starting weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types of rocket were developed (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which differ from one another in the size of the transport space for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a transport space of 0.4 litres, Meteor-1B of 0.34 litres and Meteor-1C of 0.62 litres.
The maximum flight height for all three types was 37 km.
In the years 1965 to 1968, the Meteor 2 missile was developed at the aerospace Institute, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a starting weight of 380 kg and was able to transport a utility load of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
After that, the versions Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built.
It is also worth mentioning Poland's accession to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, which followed two years later the creation of a national COSPAR committee.
Poland also participated in space research with Soviet satellites under the Intercosmos programme, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second Intercosmonaut after the Czechoslovakia Vladimír Remek.
The abolition of the law on non-profit work is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court suspended the law on nonprofit work.
This decision led to a lively discussion in the public.
It is certainly interesting to consider the problem from a broader perspective.
Liberally oriented economic systems in the EU and globalised world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In the end, this means that the individual economies are in a permanent conflict.
The reason for this is the principle of free trade and the free, unlimited movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with tireless financial speculation.
Because of the large differences in the value of work (wages), price tensions occur.
This term means a condition in which the manufacturer tries to maintain favourable products in economic competition by "undercutting" competition in order to rip a greater market share in itself and increase its profits.
On a large scale, this means for most companies to move their production abroad or buy it cheaply there, or to abandon their business. The result is high unemployment in countries with comparable labour costs.
Since private capital does not bear any social responsibility and therefore no responsibility for the unemployment it causes, government expenditure is necessarily increasing.
This situation is further reinforced by the fact that the gentlemen are totally unwilling to pay their taxes and thus replace the overall economic and social damage caused by them.
This situation is widely known, so that concrete statistics in this area are unnecessary.
The reckless practice of private capital creates a situation in the individual economies in which governments are forced to compete in order to artificially reduce the social level of their own population and thereby attract foreign capital into the country.
In other words, governments deliver private capital to their own population without taking account of the social consequences.
This is expressed in particular in amendments to existing laws.
The aim of these measures is to force its own population to accept the dictate of private capital, particularly in the wage sector.
This is done on the one hand through economic constraints in long-term unemployment, on the other hand by cutting workers' rights.
The result is growing poverty, as well as increasing differences between the poor and the rich.
In Germany, for some years, there have been public food suppliers for poor people who are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work.
The number of people involved is already going into the millions.
As a result of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, there are regular cases where workers receive such low wages that the state needs to increase their income up to the minimum level of existence.
Such a scandal was also discovered in the case of auxiliaries employed in the German Bundestag.
The savings measures practically all EU-Southern countries will undoubtedly run into the same state where people are forced to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century) under the pressure of a catastrophic crash of their social level, or for a hunger salary on the edge of society, hoping that at some point private investment capital will flow into the country.
Here, of course, is the question of where this capital comes from?
If it comes from another EU country, only poverty migrates from one country to another; or capital remains the same, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt or Africa, employees are at all working for a fraction of European wages.
This concerns all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and media claim to be excessive that the state should not be involved with capital in its own economy and that the planning economy leads to economic disasters.
Private capital stresses its concern that the State should not intervene in a direction of economic activity.
But then you have to ask yourself whether private capital does not influence politics and thus even steer the whole state in its own selfish sense.
Here's the clear answer: yes.
The proof of this is the existence of a virtually all-powerful and all-present lobby in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, mutual conviction, legislation in which practically everything is controversial, but nothing is punishable.
In Germany, the situation is such that a government ministry has a lack of finance for private legal companies closely linked to industry to drafting legislative proposals.
These draft laws will then be adopted in the Bundestag.
All violence is no longer going on from the people, as the Western Constitutions proclaim, but from strong financial groups that prefer their own interests.
Apparently, liberal democracies are currently rapidly getting into a situation as they describe Appian in its work on the crisis of the Roman Republic at times of Caesar and Pompeius': "The state has long been devastated and the offices have been occupied by force.
Against lubricants, by unlawful simplification of benefits or with stone and sword.
Corruption grew unhindered, and the people went to the election with already purchased voices... "" People with character did not turn to office, so that the state had no consumer for eight months as a result of this defeat... "" They really began to talk about the only medicine in this difficult situation being a single rule, and that a strong man had to be elected... "Appian thought of Pompeius, but the strong man was finally Caesar, who permanently replaced democracy by the sole rule.
As it turns out, today's society, as in the antique, is based on the ruthless preference of its own advantage, without paying attention to collective interests.
Private capital is not able to recognise and enforce the benefit for the whole society from its nature.
The result, today as at the time, is an unprecedented decadence of the elites, which do not attempt to achieve far-reaching reforms.
We must therefore seek the cause of fascism and communism in the unprecedented liberalisation of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
From today's point of view, the defeat of these regimes in favour of liberal democracies can be seen as a certain pause in which the next round is already taking off.
It is particularly catastrophic that today's elites are faced with the potential losses of hundreds of thousands of human lives, the humanitarian and social disasters that we are witnessing today and the crimes against humanity, as we know them from the older and newer history, in complete ignorance.
The abolition of the law on non-profit work is not a solution here, at least not a permanent one.
Under the pressure of global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to push down the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The only solution is targeted political and social reforms that increase the state's participation in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly of private capital in society in favour of the state.
Israel: Labor of Chaos.
... "that nothing is caused by violence, or could ever arise," sings Sting in the song Fragile, whose most important verse in the reflection is, "so that we don't forget how fragile we are."
"If my sons didn't want a war, there would be no war," says the dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in 1849
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there were, as always, a number of reactions.
They stand behind Israel and argue with their right to self-defense while they call the Palestinians terrorists; others support the Palestinians, argue with the racism of the Israeli state, with the genocide committed to the Palestinian Arabs and call the State of Israel a terrorist.
I do not want to write about who is in this ever-recurring wave of killing guilty and who is the victim; ultimately, today's inhabitants of Israel, including the self-administration areas, have been born into the current political situation and have not experienced the beginning of violence itself.
It is my concern to open the eyes to readers behind the scenes, to see who the 95 years of tension (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in the small spot country in the Middle East are most useful.
My thoughts are partly based on accessible historical facts, others are derived from them and are based on my own understanding of who or which group of people significantly influences the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is primarily a history of the struggle for power.
In every epoch we can make an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is less apparent is the question whether it was really these personalities themselves who determined their steps independently, or whether behind their throne someone who led their actions to a certain goal.
We must admit that we live in a time in which the wealth of the world is concentrated in the hands of fewer individuals and that this concentration of money and power resulting from it has not arisen within the livelihood of a generation.
Among these astronomically rich families there is a particular one that could be called the head of the crack (I don't know if anyone else is above them, but I do not exclude this) - the red shield.
Much is not written about them.
Understandably.
The first press agency (Reuters) was purchased by the Red Shields in the 1990s to prevent the connection of their name with highly criminal acts, in which the background was always the consolidation of their power, the increase of their wealth or both.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all the central banks of the world, and against the countries in which they are not involved in the central banks, they are conducting wars or resting on them (before the attack on Afghanistan, there were seven countries, after the robbery on Iraq, there were five countries, after the collapse of Ghaddafis remained only four, with Russia being subjected to its central bank of the Russian Government in the meantime).
Whoever tried to resist this family had to pay with life for it.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of Rothschilds Bank of America as a central bank, began to issue his own banknotes during the Civil War and was murdered in a theater in 1865.
J.F. Kennedy began to issue his own banknotes and wanted to abolish the FED - he was murdered in 1963; the Deputy Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the FED for the triggering of the World Economic Crisis in 1929.
The global power vows of the Red Shield led in the years 1859 - 1871 to the formulation of a plan for the dismantling of three world wars by Albert Pik, a free maurer of the 33rd and thus the highest degree of knowledge.
The first war was aimed at eliminating the great monarchist stateship of Europe, the second war should in particular break the colonial rule of Britain, and the third war is to reduce the world population to about 0.5 - 1 billion people (such a number would provide their conveniences and luxury and would not consume so much resources), create a universal religion (eccumenism is here nothing more than the foreground) and ultimately lead to the taking of absolute power.
The method by which the group of the richest families works with the Red Shields at the top is the triggering of a crisis and the subsequent offer of a solution (order ab chao - order out of chaos).
These solutions are, however, wrong and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see FED's foundation so that crises like those they caused in 1907 do not repeat themselves).
After they succeeded in triggering the First World War by the murder of the Habsburg Thronfolder Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the Russian Zarenreich by the revolution of the Bolsheviks.
The First World War ended with the sudden, military and economically unfounded surrender of Germany (for the destruction of the Russian Zarenreich the war was no longer necessary), and then the dissolution of the Central European Great Power Austria-Hungary.
In order to make the Second World War easier to dismantle, the bankers created a latent conflict situation through politics by inviting Germany with gigantic war repairs; thereby creating the prerequisite for poor masses, so that they only had to cheer the Germans a sufficiently strong leader who offered the guilty and simple solutions; another factor was the creation of the multi-country Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority that should take the function of a fifth column and also took in to remove the war fire.
At the end of the 19th century, the Red Shield initiated the formation of the Zionist movement, in which a branch sought to establish a Jewish state, in the historic area of Judaea with Jerusalem as a capital (return to Zion) as possible.
The Balfour Declaration, which has already been mentioned, created the prerequisite for mass immigration from Jews to Palestine; there were first collisions with the native Arab population.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, and whether Hitler was free from the chain on which the international bankers had held it initially, or whether everything went according to plan, is difficult to estimate, in any case, the suffering of the European Jews in the concentration camps created the prerequisite for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was founded in 1948, and just as the war repairs against Germany prepared the ground for the Second World War, the proclamation of the State of Israel represents the creation of the focal point for the Third World War.
If the international bankers succeed in unlocking this war, the Jewish people will be sacrificed in the forefront of World War II, this time together with the Arab and Muslim people of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of dispute and chaos, not only in the country itself, but also internationally (one only thinks how sharp people share themselves in the followers and opponents of Israel).
Who is the guilty and who is the victim of the conflict between Palestinians and Israelites, where wrongdoing only trigger injustice in an endless spiral of violence, with at the beginning the greed of individuals and their aspirations for global power?
We need to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their leadership, but the international bankers in Israel, as with us, the people, have only their own candidates for election.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, the Falke Netanjahu, is a typical example of a fascist-sensitive politician who is loyal to the international bankers, who is doing everything in its power to defeat a war with Iran, which, given Iran's membership in the Shanghai Association for Cooperation (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), could quickly expand a global conflict and, because of Iran's control over the only 2 miles wide road of Hormus, which runs over 20% of world oil supplies, could destroy the world economy.
In what light are the words David Rockefellers from 1994: "The only thing we need is a crisis that is all-encompassing, and people will welcome the new world order."
In its imagination, the new world order is a world of gentlemen and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the human population serves a small group of financial aristocrates.
A world in which every newborn is implanted a chip at birth to undermine this being of total control.
"And it makes that the little ones and the big ones, the rich and the poor, the free and the servants all give themselves a paint sign to their right hand or to their forehead that no one can buy or sell, but he has the paint sign, namely the name of the animal or the number of his name.
This is wisdom! Whoever has understanding, he will consider the number of the animal.
For it is a man's number, and his number is six hundred and sixty-six. "
The movie Argo: If it's worse to call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of demonstrating Islamic students occupied the American Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
For their release, they demanded the extradition of the fallen shame of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who fled to the United States after the revolution, who had held the patronate over his regime for decades.
For the American government there was no positive way out of this situation - it could not afford to throw the shadow over board, as this would have severely damaged the trust of their allies in other countries.
At the same time, it was unable to enforce the release of hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime.
It was a serious blow to the reputation of the united states, and the subsequent fiasco in the violent attempt to release hostages made everything even worse.
The diplomats captured were finally released after 444 days after negotiations had been conducted by the Algerian Government.
The fate of hostages at home highlighted a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian mood.
The debakel in Iran contributed significantly to the defeat of Jimmy Carters against Ronald Reagan at the presidential elections in 1980.
The film Argo of the director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this story that gave the United States a small partial victory.
Immediately before the embassy was occupied, six ambassadors managed to escape.
This ended after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
In cooperation with the Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to bring refugees from Iran, helping them with an extravagant story to discover their true identity - they traveled with Canadian passports as members of a film staff who allegedly visited Drehorte in the country for a science fiction film.
Combination of genres
The plan developed by the expert for "Exfiltration," Tony Mendez, also required cooperation with Hollywoods.
For the coverage to be credible, articles on this film project appeared in journals, press conferences were held, and the fictional production company had a real office.
The details of this operation have been kept secret for a long time. The film is based on Tony Mendez's memories.
Affleck's film is a special combination of several film genres.
On the one hand, he is a realistic politthriller, but at the same time also a so-called Caper Movie, i.e. the history of a successful house piece such as the film Ocean's Eleven.
This changes the mood levels in the film - on the one hand the documentary scenes of Tehran (iconic contemporary photographs are shown in the title sequence and there are no major differences in the film version of the same situations).
On the other hand, the loose passageways from Hollywood, which are ironically and slightly overspicy therefore come.
And then there are the scenes from the CIA Central and other institutions - men in suits at the meeting table, on the official flares, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has succeeded in making this film a remarkable restart of his career.
A humiliated actor has become a respectable director, and as an actor he is no longer the goal of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third film after Crimea No children's game (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and Thriller City without mercy (2010).
At the same time, it is Affleck's first film that does not play in the home Boston of the director.
The sense of the atmosphere of the place was one of the characteristics that removed the previous films of this director from the Standard Hollywoods.
Affleck, however, also proves this sense in Argo, where Tehran from Canada is "played."
The best scenes of the film play in the streets and show the reconstruction of events that have really taken place - the entry sequence of the first storming of the message is very impressive in its clarity, and nevertheless gives the feeling of confusion and unpredictability that occurs when the story moves somewhere.
A similar effect achieves affleck with his team also in fictitious scenes (the wrong film stick on a Basar in Tehran).
Too much action in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that history does not actually offer many exciting scenes in the cinema sense.
However, he works fairly successfully with the weenie, sometimes helping the reality - which does not always seem so elegant (the scenes in which the threatening crisis at the airport in Tehran is turned away from a telephone call in America, or even the pursuit hunt on the runway, seem somewhat dismissed).
The weakness of Argo is its far too broad scatter, which is due to the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their roles as Hollywood employees, but their figures would have earned more space, and so they are far from alone in the film.
Affleck's film thus loses a bit of traction. It is a film that can be followed with some interest, while gouting the design and the retro-style that reminds a thriller from the 70s.
However, he is very enthusiastic.
However, as a reminder of a piece of history which is still alive, and as a proof of how overlooked the ideas are from the Almighty and Knowing Secret Services, it is sufficient.
Guidelines for the blow-up of balloons, bananas and the circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which annually invites a survey of the most absurd bank charges, has decided this year to organise the competition "Absurdest regulation or idea from the EU workshop."
"On this idea, the recently presented plan of the EU to introduce a 40% female rate in the management of large European companies," said Patrik Nacher, who cares about the organisation of this survey, compared to the Právo newspaper.
Among the nominated absurdities, for example, is the European Court of Justice's judgment on the unification of insurance tariffs for men and women.
Until then, women benefited from life insurance because they are objectively a lower risk to insurance companies.
"Other unbelievable injuries from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The actual vote will then take place until the end of February 2013, "Nacher announced.
The controversial EU regulations include, inter alia, the binding mixture of bioethanol into fuels which are consequently natural, the prohibition of reliable mercury thermometers only because they contain a relatively small amount of this hazardous substance, or the directive on the size of chicken cages, which this year became much more expensive.
In the past, criticism also harvested the actual ban on the use of the term "butter peak" or also the ban on the sale of conventional bulbs.
Bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU apparatus often decides under the pressure of this or that lobby from trade and industry, whose demands are usually represented in Brussels by one or more Member States (for example, the Czech Republic is currently trying to enforce Czech banks' claims with veto threat).
Lobby interests were also behind the fact that bananas of the highest trading class in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and must not have a "crumbling anomaly."
The European Commission defended itself with the argument that they would only harmonise the uneven national standards that would hinder trade.
The standards on fruit and vegetables have already been devastated by the EU against the resistance of some countries, indicating that the previous directives would lead to the waste of food.
A candidate for victory in this survey may be the last year's EU regulation, which, according to balloons, must be provided with the indication that children under eight years of age are not allowed to blow up the balloon without the supervision of an adult.
The EU was referring to an American study which, according to balloons, is the leading cause of child suffocation.
A similar restriction already applies to children under 14 years of age when using annual market flows.
Curiosis Incidents are also at home
Relatively absurd is also a directive which affects European officials themselves - anyone who occupies an official function in the EU must not use the name Macedonia because of the sensitivity of the issue to Greece and must say FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) instead.
The Bankovnípoplatky.com server nominated, in cooperation with the Association of Liberal Economists Laissez Faire, alongside the abovementioned absurdities, the EU Regulation on the scope of food supplies in the territory of a Member State.
The EU thus established the maximum quantity of food stocks that could be found in the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the fixed volume for mushrooms, which threatened us with a high penalty.
The organisers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money for not having a sea, or the idea of providing funding for applications for funding.
These ideas were not from Brussels but from Prague.
"We are disadvantaged by the fact that we have no sea.
We will apply for reimbursement to the EU, "said the Minister for Agriculture, Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD), in autumn 2004.
As an argument, he argued that the cereals harvested had been very high and that the state stocks had been overfilled as a result of the so-called intervention purchases.
As the Czech Republic has another way to sea ports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros according to Palas.
Finally, the European Commission was so opposed to the Czech Republic that it organised an invitation to tender on the purchase of cereals from countries that have no access to the sea.
Support funds for applications for funding offered to the municipalities the Ministry of Regional Development, under the direction of Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), should be specific funding for setting up aid applications to Brussels.
EU: Bizarre Regulations are the exception
However, although regulations in the Member States are becoming an easy target of criticism, the EU's efforts to regulate and thus also to ensure the effectiveness and development of the European Union as a whole, some experts believe that it deserves more recognition.
In the opinion of these experts, a serious problem is rather the EU funding for projects which have nothing in common with deepening European integration, but which have been forced by individual Member States in budgetary negotiations.
Emotions also highlight the fact that the Czech Republic, like other Member States in Brussels, has to fight for the right to use specific names of traditional products and does not always win this fight.
Although the Czech Republic was able to defend the name "Olomoucké tvaržky" after a six-year-old struggle with Germany and Austria, our producers had to rename the domestic room (Tuzemský rum), whose tradition is going back to the 19th century.
The name "rum 'may only be used for products of sugar cane distillate, not for products of sugar beet.
The official list of products registered in the EU shows up in the society of world-famous cheeses Feta and Gorgonzola, the Lübecker Marzipans or the parachute mink also the Karlsbader onion back, carpets from Pohořelice and Třebo, or also the Saazer hops.
With an EU brand, the Pardubicer live cakes or the Hořicer rolls can brush themselves.
"People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur," says Okamura.
Mr. Senator, how do you find the idea of applying for the President's office?
It's not about being senator or president.
If everything in our country would work without problems, I wouldn't go anywhere.
But I can no longer see how the Republic has been plundered for 20 years, how thieves walk freely, while people are increasing taxes and retirement age.
I had no ambition to become a politician.
But if I see something that I do not like, then I am trying to propose a solution to change this.
And since I'm over 40, and independent and partially, I have no other way of influencing things but to apply for the office of a senator or president.
In the Senate, you made it and then you went straight to the castle.
Doesn't that turn your voters back?
I've been telling myself all the time that I will take up the fight for the castle after the outcome of the Senate elections.
Later, I have clarified this and said that I will apply for the office of President, provided I am elected Senator.
But my goal is not the function. The function is an instrument with which I can realise my visions.
I need as much influence as possible and a strong mandate as possible.
The difficulty is, however, not only that we as a people go into the bar and in front of the television, but that we turn down everyone who wants to change something.
In addition, the media who want to rob you the honour and confuse the freedom of the word with freedom.
For example, over me, it was claimed that I would bribe journalists or that I was a consultant of Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your visions.
The fight for the castle has taken place with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians as well as with retroactive asset declarations over 20 million kroner.
You have to change laws to that.
As President, you have no powers in this respect, and only the Senate as a whole can make legislative proposals.
How do you intend to solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I have been working to ensure that the guide remains a free trade and that this could be enforced.
The problem is the small-scale policy - if someone comes from the right or from the left with a good proposal, it is deliberately rejected, and that is the only way to stop the people.
As an independent party, I have a much greater potential to gain support from all the parties represented in Parliament.
My advantage is that I can take what is best for our country without drawers and party dogmas from each party.
Do you see yourself as a person in politics rather right or left?
From a Czech point of view, people seem to see me on the left.
For me, however, this right-left thinking is completely unimportant.
For me, it's important that we move on.
It is not my concern whether someone belongs to the left or to the right camp; I want to combine people.
Instead, I publicly support every good approach, even if it comes from the KSČM or the ODS, and I will also turn against bad ideas.
You don't know if someone calls you a populist.
But don't you confirm that by what you just said?
If you draw up a business plan in a company, then you also have an ideal goal and a vision.
And you want to approach this one.
You can call this populism for me, but all the proposals I have spoken of are already working in the world, or they have been discussed by important experts.
But without support in Parliament, you will only remain a keyword.
And you can't get far in politics in the long term.
Or do you think that if you talk to people for a long time, you will succeed, for example, in enforcing material and criminal liability?
I have no other way.
To convince politicians, journalists and the public and to try to bring them to our side in order to achieve these objectives.
As President, it would be no problem for me to call on the chairmen of the parliamentary parties live on television to legalize the material and criminal liability of politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And the speakers would have to say, if necessary, why they refuse to do so.
A strong personality that points to misconduct can put pressure on the political scene.
Just take the direct choice of the President, which was a merit of public pressure.
I say quite clearly that I am an amateur; I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies for my views and visions.
I have just begun with politics and I am trying to find the support of the majority for my programme.
I always try to assess things myself; and if it doesn't work, I will return to the private sector in six years.
That sounds a little like Okamura was supposed to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know I can't reach anything alone, so I talked to several well-known personalities about whether they want to join the Senate too.
For example, I spoke to Radim Jančura, but he refused to do so because of overload.
I also supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová who discovered fraud in the trade in light fuel oil.
I started my candidature with the condition that people are deeply unhappy, but now I'm not sure anymore.
Sixty percent of the voters did not go to the elections at all, and those who went have mostly chosen representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate, we're only two independent.
People have chosen such a senate composition that changes will be very difficult to implement.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions, for example, for the direct election of mayors and district heads.
Are you thinking about the creation of your own party?
I have not yet thought about this because I have no time to review the past of every potential party member, and I have not even the money for it.
I do not even have money for the presidential campaign; on my transparent account there are only 20,000 CZK.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about asset statements, what do you look like?
I estimate my private assets to about 60 million CZK.
In Prague, I have a property worth 25 million, an apartment for about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection worth about 10 million, as well as an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Škodu superb worth about one million. And then I have a few million more on the account.
By the way, the Aston Martin was a child's dream - James Bond always liked me as he drove in the car, was galant to women and at the same time fought against evil.
You drive an Aston Martin, have a fortune of 60 million and don't have any money for your campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you don't want to invest your own money in it.
That's not exactly convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Do you want me to make debts?
I've already put 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have sponsors shows that my program probably doesn't raise too much interest.
And I am not obliged to fight the campaign by my own means.
The cost of the campaign is basically covered by my salary as a senator.
But I could not live alone from the senator's salary; so I could not finance my son for example the English school that costs 30,000 a month.
If I only wanted to make money, I wouldn't be in charge of anything.
So are you going to continue working as an entrepreneur to get you out?
Didn't you say you were going to return these activities?
But this is not related to the height of the salary.
As promised, I partially drove my activities back.
For example, my deputy will be the managing director of the travel agency in spring.
People want to see me as a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I have to live from something, too.
What monthly income were you used to as an entrepreneur?
About 200,000 to 400,000, and that is still the case.
However, as President, I would completely cancel my business.
The full conversation can be found on Saturday's edition of Právo.
The MVRDV architects prove that the true adventures are not only in the head - as an example of Spijkenisse and the recently created bookerberg - 2 photos
"I find the building funny, it looks futuristic, and finally there's something interesting to see again," says Lisette Verhaig, a passant on the edge of the street.
And Stefan Spermon, IT engineer in a nearby large company, says, "Well, it's nice, the house."
But I wonder why we need a library today.
Everyone has Internet, iPad and E-Books.
No man is going to one of those old-style libraries today, right?
Spijkenisse, a rarely visited sleeping town in front of the gates of Rotterdam, is a strange record holder.
The 80,000 inhabitants municipality has the lowest educational rate in the Netherlands as a whole.
In order to counteract this stupid situation, a few years ago, it was decided to contribute to general education and to rebuild the seven fictitious bridges presented on the Eurosticks as nicely pinched steel concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And so the city fathers realized that there was only one way to become the master of statistics: a library had to come here!
Winy Maas from the Rotterdam architecture office MVRDV, master of the cool bar diagrams and producer of funny, often cynical buildings, took the case with usual ease and appeared to the competition hearing anno 2003 with five books under the arm and a grinsen in the face.
And while the jury was still diluting around and sucking with the axles, the naughty Maas stacked his experienced mitbringsel of size to a pyramid and ended his actionist supported speech with the words: "Dear City community!"
So this is my proposal for the Bücherberg von Spijkenisse, for the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million euros expensive mountain was thrown up.
It is part of a revitalisation project, which includes underground garage, supermarket, post and a few adjacent residential and series houses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the Bücherberg was awarded the second award "Best Library of NL 2012."
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
This means that the faceless small town tower, which had no more to offer to date than a post-modern pedestrian zone and a tremendous ugly town house, behind which white facades would be inclined to suspect a dairy factory to make a piece of contemporary architecture richer.
In particular, however, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural construction in the history of its existence.
The long way to the book
The first impression: Bookereldorado under cheese locks.
Although there is a lift that leads through the mountain massively, the true space and reading freedoms come to an end in the climbing of topography.
The round-glazed interior is bright and overlooking, the burned clinker floor and the elegant street laterns speak the language of a public city square.
The urban ambience is perfect.
You are already looking for parking bank, dog and football playing boys and girls.
And everywhere books, books, books.
"Usually the book shelves are along the facade, and in the middle lies a large, dark room, which is mostly uncomfortable and inpersonal," says Winy Maas.
We put the classic room configuration on the head and stumbled the reading area from inside to outside.
The inside of the book mountain is well used: in the middle are offices, Internet library, chess club, environmental centre and house engineering centre.
A special joy are the black bookshelves, which are sometimes wall clothing, sometimes breastfeeding, sometimes sticks.
Optics, haptics and smell are strange.
Even embedded architects and construction engineers shake the head of the unknown building material.
"We wanted to work here with recycling materials," explains Joop Trouborst, Project Manager at the Municipality of Spijkenisse, on request of the standard.
And so, one day, in a freshly-based farm drive, we encountered a suitable product of waste from agriculture.
For many years in the Netherlands, a millimetre thin plastic sheet has been used as root material in greenhouses and fields.
This is cheap and time-efficient.
The thin textile holds one, two seasons, then it is ripe for the lock waste.
For the library the flat - for the first time in these quantities - was pressed to four centimeters of thick plates.
Under heat influence and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) is coloured into a dark, homogeneous, loadable material that smells a bit for new cars and a bit for sports shoes.
After 105 steps you have reached the summit.
At the end of the almost 500 meters long hiking, you will be rewarded in the literature café not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquets and fenced fish trees.
They provide atmosphere, but above all the right humidity in the literature mountains.
Donations for the new soul
"You wouldn't believe it, but this house, despite the many glass surfaces, is a preview project in terms of ecology," says Trouborst.
Heated and cooled with earth heat.
Although the Bücherberg is under a glass crash, the sun itself appears only a short time inside on sunny days.
The wide wooden imitation binders, which are located across the glass facade, serve as a shadow and capture a large part of the sunlight.
The space climate is very pleasant.
The rest will do full-automatic rolls.
Stefan Spermon, the initial scepticist from the IT industry, already waved the way to the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was there too.
And also the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who even calls the Boekenberg the Spijkenisse "long-standing soul."
The reason: For opening a few weeks ago, every resident was invited to donate a book from his personal stock.
This is intended to fill the optical gaps in the library that has not yet been fully assembled - currently 70,000 pieces - for the first time.
The concept has come to an end.
The shelves are filled up to the top.
"Nothing is worse than a half-life library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think, thanks to our invitation, each residents now have a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And if it's just for the tree.
Thus MVRDV has succeeded in the royal discipline called the Jargon Identity Foundation.
Spijkenisse wrote literature history.
As young and uneducated as she may be.
This is a starting point for identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a greater role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the inclusion of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert for US-European relations, Berlin thus balances on a narrow diplomatic level.
German wave: At the beginning of the week Germany had signalled that it would vote against the request for an observer status of the Palestinians in the United Nations.
But then Berlin retained itself.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
Now, however, Germany must be careful due to its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I believe that it does not support the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without being too critical of Israel.
During the insurrection in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it was about setting up an aircraft ban zone.
This was finally enforced by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on important international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
This is because it is just transforming its foreign policy away from a policy that has been managed by the United States to a German foreign policy.
It is also worrying that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
So the Germans find themselves between the fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I believe that they are still working on their role, but they are on their way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy such as France or the United Kingdom.
What does a "normal" foreign policy mean from a German point of view?
It demonstrates the willingness to take positions in national interests which are independent of those of the US or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, i.e. by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are to a certain extent different from those of the other major powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests had an impact on the position in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
Firstly, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf States.
It must therefore be cautious not to face the public, but also the elites, in the Arab countries.
It certainly matters.
But I wouldn't want to weigh too much, that's not a completely unilateral relationship.
But it certainly plays an important role in German considerations.
Has Germany damaged its relations with the United States by abstaining in important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I believe that in Europe and even in the United States there is a great understanding of the German position.
That is why I do not believe that this was such a dramatic breakdown as in the Libyan question.
Perhaps Germany will take a certain amount of respect with this.
Because it signals that it is being taken seriously as an international player and that its interests need to be considered.
There are various views in Europe on the Palestinian initiative.
On the other hand, the United States has clearly expressed its support for a veto.
Are there differences between the United States and many European nations?
Because of American internal policy, these differences have always existed.
I believe that the government under Obama has, in secret, quite a great deal of understanding for the European position.
But because of the political situation here, the government cannot, of course, represent this position publicly.
I believe that the real differences of opinion are not as large as they always appear.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanjahu, Obama is not very enthusiastic about Netanjahus policy.
Is it difficult for Germany to agree on its close relations with Israel and the US on the one hand and on the position of the main partners in the EU on the other?
I think that's what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and uniform European policy, which is not currently the case.
So they can't be part of a wider line and instead need to drive things out of their own position.
That's what they're doing with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will play a leading role in pushing Europe to a European position.
This is, of course, not easy for Germany, because of the relationship with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive issue.
But I believe that the Germans are clear that they need to play a more independent role.
Does Germany see itself in the role of important international players - does Germany want to take a leading role at all?
Or does Germany still have a difficult leadership role?
Germany is not used to it, it is still unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for the country to play a greater role.
For example, when we look at the euro crisis, every time Germany takes a greater role, various anti-German feelings will be free.
That doesn't make it easy for the Germans.
This is actually the old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
In this way, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the USA.
It must be susceptible to various neighbours and opinions, and that is not easy.
Now the US's influence on European policy is constantly decreasing, but the EU is not filling this vacuum at the moment, who else is there?
The Germans will simply have to play a greater role.
Even if they don't like it, it's unpleasant for them and makes them much more unpopular - c'est la vie!

"Trademark Protection" in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-known brand, and Polo Ralph Lauren.
But what is Armani Polo?
This is where a name officially registered in China is hidden, but it has nothing to do with the companies of origin.
However, it enjoys protection as long as the actual namesavers do not complain.
And even then it is not clear whether they are right.
"It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their trademarks in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer in Taylor Wessing, who specializes in violations of protection in the Far East.
Every week, a new case ends up on my desk.
The emperors already have a few additional letters to allow them to register their trademarks.
So from Gucci simply becomes Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada you have Prada-Kny registered.
German companies are also legally copied in this way, such as the Sports Product Manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a folder with entries from the trade mark office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company protected the trade mark Zegna DF Puma, an art name that also served at the Mode House Ermenegildo Zegna.
The Chinese world champions are known to be copying and injured intellectual property.
In the large cities there are several stores that sell almost exclusively counterfeiting.
However, Pattloch's cases are different: on behalf of his clients, he argues that Chinese companies are officially given the right to use a name that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai," a passenger brand.
The word is based on "Bang Dakuan."
That means women fishing rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt
"This is business damaging, you have to fight it," Pattloch calls.
"The brand is watered, the sole setting disappears, the image damaged is enormous."
The financial failures and process costs of the sectors concerned go into the millions, especially in the case of expensive preview products.
According to the market research company CLSA, China is the third largest and fastest growing market for luxury products with a volume of EUR 15 billion per year.
But deletions of dubious entries in the trademark register are difficult to reach and go into money.
Up to nine years, the procedure can take place, with uncertain outcome.
Pattloch reports of cases in which the court rejected actions because after the long duration of the contested name had become "market reality."
If the plaintiff has a bad luck, he even had to pay the plagiator money because he hurt his brand in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes the law of the jungle prevails here.
Famous cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a dispute with the construction machine manufacturer Sany, the company that recently took over the German concrete pump builder Putzmeister.
The Chinese are therefore allowed to use a emblem that is similar to the Mercedes star so far.
The Volvo Buyer Geely originally used a blue-white logo that reminded BMW; the fight was sliced, Geely had to change it.
The fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China against emperors from Hong Kong and Singapore, who made the famous crocodile look the other way.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
While CTMO in Beijing admits that there had been bottlenecks there in 2010 because of too low staff and space equipment.
Last year, however, one had returned from the "emergency situation in the course of work to normality."
Thus, unprocessed opposition procedures had fallen by 22 per cent.
Almost 57,000 such cases have been completed, 75 per cent more than in the previous year.
However, there are still 81,500 objections in the office to the execution.
Against this, there is a great deal to do
As often in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year CTMO received more than 1.4 million applications for trade mark protection, almost one third more than 2010.
This is a record and means that for the tenth time in a row, China will apply the list of new applications around the world, the Authority shall inform the Authority.
This also applies to the stock of all valid trademarks, a total of 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1.8 billion Yuan had been charged.
Simplified means that each application costs an average of 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
Against this, the case of the German family company Freudenberg shows a number of times.
For more than seven years, the group has been fighting a Chinese plagiator.
While the Germans were able to achieve that its illegal manufacturing of imitated motor vehicle parts was increased.
But the emperor continued to secure the Chinese rights at the Freudenberg brand.
It has been missed, as family names could not be protected in Germany, says Hanno Wentzler, the chairman of the management of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The trade mark office CTMO rejected the objection of the Münchner.
In the next two instances, Freudenberg was right, but the opponent of the trial continues to fight until today.
You have to be careful.
Now the matter is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident to bring the matter to a good conclusion, and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "The process is extremely costly and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs could hardly be quantified, the company archive had even had to look through a hundred years old files to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the opposite a "high six-digit euro amount" for settlement.
"You can see how much this is worth us," says Wentzler.
The dangers in the Far East are even threatening to swing back to Europe.
After all, when imitators secure unprotected trademarks there.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
This business field has long been abandoned by the group, yet it has been able to reverse registration.
"You have to be careful," says Wentzler.
Both he and the lawyer Pattloch advise German companies to be very careful in business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trade mark rights, rather, as Wentzler says, the foreigners should "register everything that is somehow protective, also in China."
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than registration.
In fact: If Freudenberg is subject to the last act of his market framework, then you must probably pay the opposite side license fees for your own name, explains Wentzler.
Or we are being pushed out of the market in the segment in question.
World Day: Stamping, singing, helping
In Heidelberg the Chor Imbongi tastes - and in Swaziland Aids are happy about it.
The history of a connection that overcomes far more than 8733 kilometres.
First there is the stamping: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, lady pump and master lipper looking for the handle on the parquet floor, find it quickly.
One-two-three-four.
Then the voices of the singers slowly swab - old, bass, tenor and soprano - pressing, beating and pursuing themselves.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, almost lifts it out of his fabric shoes when he brings them together with his gentle wild gestures.
It is Monday evening, in the musical room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the Chor Imbongi tastes a new song.
The fifty singers have come between 23 and 69 years old, from the human genetics woman to the houseman.
"Om 'Obani" is not a simple piece, each chorus vote has another text and it is also in a very foreign language: Zulu, which is spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and and in parts of Swaziland.
Aid for self-help
There are around 34 million HIV infected around the world, which estimates Unaids, the United Nations Anti-Aids Programme.
23.5 million people live in South Africa.
In Swaziland there are 245,000 AIDS orphans.
More than 40% of the population are now HIV-positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitjeni, the association has found Voices for Africa Paten in Germany.
70 of them attend a further school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month, you can take a patentship.
It guarantees the child school money, school uniform and a warm meal daily at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means history counters on Zulu or praise winners.
There is no one who can speak the language of bantures in this room, but sing.
For almost ten years, the choir has practised songs in this foreign soft language and brings them back and forth to where they originally come from: in the south of Africa.
For 8 733 kilometres from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village of Esitjeni, which depends on the voting power of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected
About 2,000 people live there, some still in simple clay and straw huts, most of them are children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents because they are infected with the HI virus.
In Esitjeni, the small one, where all of Swaziland is ill, shows the highest HIV infection rate, the lowest life expectancy worldwide according to Unicef.
Cutting the male foreskin, which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half, is hardly accepted by the population.
More than forty percent of people in Swaziland carry the immune weakness virus, dying at the middle of thirty is not a rare one.
On a common Africa trip in spring 2005, the choir discovered the village, but above all the Imbongis saw many children on the streets, which were not only lacking in parental care, but simply everything: food, clothing, education.
If you don't finish school, you don't have a chance in a poor country.
At first it was private commitment individuals to send a child to school for a few euros a year and to allow him a warm meal a day.
But a year later, the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa," which since then has almost professionally taken care of the AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts on sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important sexually transferable diseases?
The bacterial STI include syphilis, chlamydia and tripper (gonorrhea).
Common viral STI are HIV, human papilomavirs, herpes genitalis or hepatitis.
Filzläuse and scraps are part of the parasite STI.
Who are the main groups affected?
Syphilis and Tripper occur especially in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute assumes that at least four out of five of all syphilis cases reported in Germany are transmitted by sexual contacts between men.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydia infections, tricotomonads, candidose (fungi), tripper and human papilomavirs are common sexually transferable diseases.
The spread of HIV is relatively low among heterosexual adults in this country - nevertheless: approximately 20% of HIV new infections account for this group.
Chlamydiene infections are much more frequent in adolescents than in other populations.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people between 15 and 25 years of age.
Human pappilomavirs are also common in young people.
How has the number of infections developed?
Not all sexually transferable diseases are subject to reporting.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has more than doubled from 1697 diseases in 2001 to 3698 diseases in 2011.
The number of HIV new infections has fallen since 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2700 cases.
This is about a tenth less than the previous year.
What symptoms indicate a gender disease?
Infection disorders may cause genital ulcers, urinary disorders, abdominal pain, bladder or warts.
However, they often do not cause pain or other symptoms and therefore remain unnoticed.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not provide a hundred percent protection.
Because, in part, pathogens of sexually transferable diseases can also be passed on through lubrication infections and close body contact.
Therefore, experts are recommending regular investigations, especially in the case of often changing sex partners.
Early diagnosed, most STI can be healed and delays avoided.
Through patents, donations, and not least the streaks that the choir sends around Germany, a lot comes together.
"In total, we have already sent about 200 000 euros to Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, Chairman of the Association.
In the village itself Zodwa Dlamini, a self-conscious and enforceable woman, manages the money from Germany.
She also cares for the orphans to stay well with one of the grandmothers.
The Gogos, as they call the old women on Zulu, are the supporters of the village.
Some of them have received up to 14 orphans, give them a roof above their head and make sure that the children appear in their uniforms every day on time for school lessons.
Whoever no longer has comes to the safe house at Khanyisile, a single woman who is paid just as much by the association as the two cookers who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" has created a sewing school, built two chicken houses and organized together with the American Health Organisation PSI that many in the village have made a HIV test.
This is not obvious, because, as obvious, the disease throughout the country is, they are preferred to be dead.
A king with 14 wives
"Aids is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
Actually, strange in a country where the king officially holds 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Schwarzafrikas, King Mswati III, is known for his exzessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
Among other things, this state-sanctioned form of life is also due to the rapid spread of the HI virus in recent decades.
But also the many migrant workers carrying the virus through the country.
Free condoms would be at every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but they are hardly used.
The culture is another - flesh to flesh. "
In order to promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels together every two, three years through South Africa and sings songs full of wealthy, fighter spirit, confidence and black self-consciousness, which many still know from times of apartheid on the southern side of the black continent.
A bus full of white people singing songs in a black language - so much appreciation does not just bring mood and joy, but has already ripped off some ugly border soldiers a few tears.
The journey always leads to Esitjeni, where the singers visit their paternity children.
Even though you can hardly find the small village on maps, in the valley of the Ezulweni River it is more than known.
"Go to Esitjeni, there's the light." People say there.
And when you return the 8733 kilometers air line to Heidelberg, to the stamping singers in the test room on the mountain hall road, you see it also shine there.
Messenger: NASA discovered ice cream on the Merkur
The probe Messenger has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Merkur.
The ice cover may be up to 20 meters thick.
The U.S. Space Agency NASA has demonstrated the existence of ice on the planet Merkur.
Although he is the closest to the sun, there is also frozen water there, as it emerges from three studies published on Thursday in the specialized magazine "Science."
The Sonde Messenger found evidence that there is an ice cover in the permanent shadow region of the planet.
This should be at least 30 centimeters and possibly even up to 20 meters thick.
The water probably came from comets or possibly also asteroids that were struck on the mercury.
But no one links the fund of ice with the existence of life on the planet, said the chief scientist of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on the mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help to clarify how water and other building stones of life have reached other areas of the solar system.
Unnoticed by the Earth citizens are songs, telescopes and small robots such as Phoenix exploring the depths of the world.
From time to time they send pictures to Earth: Little watchholes in infinite ways.
The picture comes from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, also the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, who circles behind Neptun around the sun, Ceres is not a "planet" according to the new definition of the International Astronomical Union of 2006.
This portrait of an infrared recording of the top telescope shows a "family portrait" of uncounted star generations: The oldest stars are to be identified as blue points, harder to identify the pink "newborn" in the star circle hall.
This star-shaping region - by scientists called unromantic W5 - has discovered the telescope Spitzer in the star image of Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6500 light years.
This melting glut of a dying star has absorbed the top telescope of the Nasa.
The donut-shaped ring consists of material that the star flashed out in the death process.
In the huge Trifid fog, 5400 light years away from the earth, new stars are created from gas and dust.
The Nasa's Spitzer Telescope shot this photo of the galactic birth room.
The Plejaden Star Hook, also called "The Seven Sisters," can be seen at night with the bare eye.
With the telescope, however, the colours are better applied.
Like a red age, the Helix fog looks forward to the viewer on this infrared photo.
It is located 700 light years away in the Aquarius star image.
His similarity with an earthly continent introduced this fog the title of North America.
A combination of normal and infrared photo ensures spectacular coloring.
This baby star could only be absorbed in its full beauty by the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and his rings: How these have emerged is one of the great puzzles of astronomy.
They may be the remains of a Saturn moon that disappeared without a trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the biggest and sharpest recordings of the Hubble telescope: The whirlpool galaxy
Depending on colour, images of spiritual galaxies become true works of art.
The recording published by the European South Star Watch shows the several thousand light years away Trifid fog in the star image shooter.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (three divided, three divided), since dark dust stripes tripartite the glowing heart of the star birthplace.
Astronomers have photographed the precursors of a cosmic carambolage in the star image of snake carriers: 400 million light years away from the earth, the core of two melting galaxies will collapse inevitably.
This star birth recorded the Hubble telescope in the M83 Spiral Galaxy.
If there are no technical abbreviations, they may be called Southern fire wheel by their nickname.
The photo of the space telescope Hubble shows a cut from the Irisnebel in the Kepheus star image.
The 1400 light-year fog consists of dust grains, which are ten to a hundred times smaller than ordinary house dust.
This image was combined from optical and X-ray recordings of various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, 430 million light years away from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, recorded the space telescope Hubble for the Nasa.
The larger spiritual galaxy calls scientists UGC 1810.
In this star fog is the brightest group of young stars of our milk road.
Starwaves always produce new youngsters.
Also these stars cloud, connected with the rosette fog, constantly brings forth new baby stars - 5000 light years away from Earth.
In this bright, radiating galaxy with a small black hole there is no dust yet, but only gas.
Researchers suspect that he was only born shortly after the earthquake when hydrogen was found predominantly in the universe.
Our insights into space: The most important telescopes
The telescope should have been invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey - even before Galileo Galilei used it for star observation one year later.
Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescopes have been increasing - and the insights they provide are getting deeper and deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale Telescope was the largest remote tube in the world in the Palomar Observatory near San Diego.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, the Large Binocular Telescope stands.
It allows eyes in space to be equal to two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The inner life of the Gran Telescopio Canarias on the Canary Island of La Palma is huge - the mirror alone comes to 10.4 meters in diameter.
The Southern African Large Telescope mirror in South Africa is segmented - to save costs.
However, it reaches a diameter of about 11 meters.
Disadvantage of the favourable design: The telescope is stuck in its height angle - and thus limited in its mobility.
The Hobby Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed in the height angle.
His specificity: the high gathering power.
In fact, despite relatively low mirror diameter, this is sufficient to the world's largest mirror telescopes.
With the help of a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico), researchers are listening to alien signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
With the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI), each computer owner can help by providing account performance.
View of the European Star Guard Observatory (ESO) in the Andes of Chile.
Here is the very Large Telescope - which honors his name.
With its four mirrors, the remote tube can also illuminate the medium infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned at the Chilean ESO Observatory.
Its main mirror is to cover 42 meters - and are composed of almost 1000 mirrors.
Pictures are expected at the earliest 2018.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were the largest in the world.
They offer equal two mirrors with an average of 10 meters each.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna-Kea Observatory, which is still looking in the sky next to them with the Subaru telescopes and the IRTTF.
Also on the Mauna Kea is to create a new, huge telescope - with a mirror average of 30 meters.
Here it is to be amazed at an illustration.
However, the main impressions of space supply the space telescope Hubble.
Since April 24, 1990, it has already provided images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the space telescope Kepler has been looking for extrasolary planets - mainly for those who are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, Nasa announced that 1235 planetary candidates have been identified since the start of the mission.
In the picture are documented the last launch preparations at the space telescope Kepler.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be shot on board an Ariane5 rocket in space at the earliest time in 2018.
The primary level of the space freezer telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope: It should look for light from the first stars and galaxies for the earthquake.
Scientists assume that the Mercury ice also exists on the South Pole.
However, there are no reliable data for this, as the Messenger is much closer to the North Pole around the planet.
Radar bracelets have been indicating for decades that there is ice on the Merkur.
Through the Messenger probe, which started in 2004 - the first to circle around the Merkur - the scientists now have certainty.
Drinking butter daily - and 168 years old
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach a biblically high age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A trace search in the country where 97-year-olds are still comparatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach a biblically high age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A trace search in the country where 97-year-olds are still comparatively young.
The journey through the Talysch mountain is called wildromantic.
The small bus rolls over the curve-rich road, past densely wooded hills, tearing rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and juicy, you might think you're in the Black Forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is just a few kilometres away.
This is where the Caucasian People's Group of the Talyans lives, which is not very well known except that it speaks perfectly Persian as well as Azerbaijan and is very long-lasting.
The end station is Lerik.
The small town protends with too intensely rooted architecture from Soviet times, which does not want to fit into the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe hardly come here, too difficult is the arrival of Azerbaijan capital Baku.
For the 323 kilometres you need eight hours because the road is only spiky.
The magnificent wealth that the country owes to its oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived here in the province.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has the stuff to attract tourists.
"Baku became famous with the Eurovision Song Festival in May - and next year we have a festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulayeva.
She's the director of the museum for longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here is the Vita of about eight dozen Talyschen from the area documented that is older than 100. Fatulayeva shows on a black-and-white photo.
This is my grandfather. He was 120 years old.
A child born at the age of 136
However, controversial star of the museum is the sheep shepherd, which is supposed to be 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And in view of the oldest documented person who was 122 years old, the age of Müslümov seems extremely doubtful.
"In 1805 he was born here in the region, he died in 1973," explains Fatulayeva.
The man had been married three times and had had 23 children; at the age of 136 he should have born another daughter.
So, did it settle at his age for a few decades?
But Rembrandt Scholz, age researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard of the high-ranks in Central Asia.
"There are also many high-aged people in some areas of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "even in Sardinia, there are extremely many very old men."
However, due to the lack of documentation, there was no scientific evidence of age, as there was no record of the status of persons.
Smelted butter every day
The fact is, however, that the people of the region around Lerik often reach a biblical age.
There are currently 20 people who are over 100 years of age.
So why live here in the south so many high beds?
The Azerbaijan travel guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the Talyzans.
Museumsdirektor Fatulayeva believes, however, that it is a matter of nutrition.
But that the calorie-rich cost of the talysis should be so healthy that the meat, bread and especially milk products love and many of which drink a glass of melted butter daily do not seem exactly plausible from a nutritional point of view.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? Rubaba Mirzayeva lives in Cengemiran, a small settlement near the city of Lerik.
With her 97 years she is still relatively young for these widens.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house that is typical for the whole Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor with a butter barrel that rolls her down and out tirelessly.
Eight people live here under a roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and a daughter, both are long-standing grandparents.
Two little kids are also jumping around.
In the kitchen you can prepare the guests tea, which is served in the typical armadu glasses.
Mirzayeva's white teeth are perfectly standing in row and joint, under her head cloth she hides long, dark blonde cups that reveal her son proud of us.
I always washed my hair with milk, so they never went out and kept their color.
"I never used shampoo," said Mirzayeva.
Monthly pension is enough to live
She has always eaten only what came from her own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
All my life, I haven't bought food a single time in the supermarket.
Then she tells me about her husband who was in the army.
It was the worst in the time after World War II.
But everything became better when the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyew took over the rudder.
The propaganda sounds strange from an old woman's mouth.
But the cult driven around the nation's father figure, who ruled his country like a dictator, hardly knows boundaries in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, and later his son Ilham took over the rudder.
After all, there is no need under Azerbaijan's old age.
230 Manat (about the same sum in euro), Mirzayeva receives a monthly pension, a sum of which you can live well for local conditions.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's son has already been cruel: "The old people enjoy respect in our culture."
They live in the midst of the great family, are loved, cared for and are happy.
If that's no reason to stay alive as long as possible
The word "human rights" lacks in the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rivaling Clients in Cairo reveal the deep division of the country.
The future Constitution with the Sharia as a base is heavily controversial.
The Egyptian president did not save with Pathos.
We have to make the transition.
"And that he succeeds lies in my responsibility, in front of the people and in front of God," he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to the whole people, but most importantly to the Christian kopts, the Liberals, informed Muslims and seculars.
For they are all afraid, so far, hopelessly scattered in a confusion opposition.
Fear of a divine state on the Nile of Mercies of the Mighty Muslim Brotherhood.
He, as Mohammed Mursi said, almost apologizing, temporarily cut the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded its competences "to save the revolution."
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who has a PhD from the American University of Southern California really wants to save, about which the Egyptians are themselves, the world is not fully aware.
Are you going to dismiss the Judicative?
In fact, the 234 articles, which the Islamic-dominated 100-headed constitutional assembly has pissed through in a night, 15-hour parforcerite, are sometimes worrying.
As in previous constitutions, it is stated in the draft that case law is based on the "principles of Islamic law."
But what do "principles" mean?
This was and is a matter of interpretation and it is to be feared that the Islamists will use the fluffy wording and the resulting legal margin for a more stringent interpretation of the sharia.
This suggests at least a newly added article: in all the matters relating to the Sharia, the Al-Ashar University must be drawn back, the most important Islamic institution of the country with great radiation throughout the sunny Islam.
It does not have to, but it may mean that the mind supervises legislation, which in fact would result in the dismissal of the judiciary.
Much in the draft constitution is interpretative
Also problematic: civil military justice should continue to be maintained.
These courts served during Mubarak's reign to suppress opposition.
After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were in military custody.
The state should also, as it says in the draft, "protect the true being of the Egyptian family" and promote its moral and its values. "
This is legally so rude that, using this article, government institutions could even control the content of film art and literature.
Clearly, that means nothing but censorship.
No article, by the way, explicitly defines equality between men and women.
For this, another forbids the Prophet Mohammed and his messengers to insult or humiliate.
But what is an insult and how it is to be presumed remains unclear.
Also dubios suggests that the "insult of people" is forbidden.
Is there enough caricature from the President or a joke at the expense of a legal teacher?
Explanatory matter, as so much in the draft that Mursi is available for signature and will, according to his words "very soon" be presented to the Egyptians for referendum.
"The revolution has returned"
The opposition has been fighting the Islamist force for weeks.
Ten thousand gathered in unusual entrance on Friday night at the Tahrir Square in Cairo and promised to bring the Charter down before it can enter into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, third-place presidential election.
Peace noble prize winners and ex-head of the International Atomic Energy Authority Mohamed El-Baradei declared that the draft Constitution belonged to "the Müllberg of History."
Through Twitter's short news service, he commissioned the followers of Mursis to lead a "Putsch gegen Demokratie."
"When he calls out the referendum, we will go to his palace and crash it," said the opposition Jasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet sealed," the Egyptian media quoted the opposition politician Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced that they would not want to monitor the referendum, which would make it invalid.
"The Qur'an is our Constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, on the one hand, became a counter-demonstration, but not in the Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other Nilufer before the University of Cairoe.
Many hidden women and supporters of the Salafists took part in it and cried: "The people demand the application of God's law."
They demanded from Mursi: "Clean the land!" and warned: "The Qur'an is our Constitution."
A struggle for the Highness over the symbol-drained Tahrir Square, at which everything began, would have provoked civil war-like conditions.
Mursis's followers obviously didn't want to risk that.
The Muslim brothers stated that both the opponents of the draft Constitution and the supporters had expressed themselves loud and clearly.
Now is the time to let the people at the election tower decide what direction the country should go.
A majority for the draft Islamists is considered safe.
"The word human rights does not even occur"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry about this forceful constitutional process, which should have gone until February and involve all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Human Rights Organisation (EOHR) defended the Muslim brothers when they were in prison or in court under Mubarak.
Not because he would share their view of the world, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
He was beaten, convicted, imprisoned for that.
"And now the word human rights is not even in the new Constitution," he complains in conversation with the "world on Sunday."
Mursi's power expansion to all three forces in the state allowed the lawyer to resign.
These measures are unprecedented violations of democratic rules of play and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the President discourages them de facto," Saeda complains.
But without civil society organisations, democracy could not work.
Saeda feels left alone, also by the international community, which looks at the ideological direction struggle on the Nil with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could be revenge.
A demonstrant on the Tahrir warns: "You bear a monster that you can't control anymore."
Rakfish from Norway: Is this the most horrible fish in the world?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living - not only in Europe, but throughout the world.
Could the country's secret of success have something to do with the local appetite for pretty ugly fish?
You take a selection of overripe cheese varieties.
You place them in the middle of a bunch of dirty, wet sports clothes.
And leave her there for a week.
So you have to imagine the nasal smelling smell of rocket fish, one of the great delicacies of Norway.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours away from Oslo.
There are snow, spectacular landscapes here - and this persistent smell in the air that just doesn't want to disappear.
Rakfisk is a salt-stripped forel which - depending on how smelling you would like its fish - is fermented into water for up to a year.
When in Norway the darkness comes across the country and the weather gets colder, Norwegians flow to a feast here in Fagernes, which is dedicated to this, now, really very fragile specialty.
"You eat it raw and then rinse it down with a glass of Aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, who actually works in the local fire guard, but as a so-called "Rakfish-General" also organizes the festival.
Around us people eat small fish cubes and take large amounts of alcohol to them.
"Some people like the aquavit more than the rocket fish," says Havard.
The spirits can distract the smell.
I'm gonna get a couple of bucks.
If you avoid bringing the rocket fish close to the nose, it is not bad - like Sushi, which has a pretty long bus ride behind you.
Rakfisk is the product of a completely different, far poorer Norwegian era, when there were no refrigerations and fish were drunk in airtight salt water vessels in autumn.
In the deepest winter it was then removed after long fermentation and consumed - undoubtedly by means of alcohol-damaged senses -.
A generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country and migrated mainly to the United States.
Today the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a flourishing labour market, high wages and comprehensive health care.
Even from Sweden, the old rival, which was not far more rich than Norway, flows immigrants.
Rakfish is considered to be something important - a essential, though strictly smelling part of Norwegian history.
He's one of the more expensive dishes you can buy here.
But actually everything here is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs pride 10 euros.
Norway does not often get into the world press, and most people do not seem to bother it.
Here you still hate to call Anders Breivik by name - those racist right-wing extremists who shot 77 men, women and children last year.
Instead, it only refers to the "incident of 22 July."
Norwegians are hard to accept that someone in their peace-loving country is capable of such brutal murders.
The main responsibility for today's wealth of Norway has been the growth of one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world since the early 1970s.
"But oil is not the only reason why we are doing so well," says Anna, our waitress, the round tablets distributed with ripe rocket fish and embodied the Nordic ideal with her long blonde hair and the shining blue eyes.
We are - as they say - a cautious people.
Your English is just like most people here.
We're not very anxious, we don't like spells.
Norway has handled its oil wealth very carefully - a large part of the sector's income is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When in the years up to the world economy crisis, all of the money they didn't own was thrown around, Norway kept its wallet closed.
"As long as we can ski in winter and walk in summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And, of course, eat rocket fish," she adds with uncompromised laughter.
I'm in the snow and I'm in another court - I've had enough of rackfish.
I'm sure that an elch burger like that is something else.
But in the evening the stink fish is on the food plan again.
The hotel in which I am staying is one of several events that organize a rockfish dinner where guests can vote for the best - or perhaps the most challenging - fish.
There is a live TV circuit to a show master dressed with fly, surrounded by plates with rocket fish.
The spectacle is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score do you have up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?"
"Here are our points, Havard."
You climb and laugh.
A man falls from his chair, possibly overwhelmed by the aquavit.
But maybe it's the rigour of the whole fish.
Mexicos Enrique Pena Nieto is facing difficult start
While Mexico's future president Enrique Pena Nieto is preparing for his appointment, Will Grant from the BBC analyzes the challenges he faces and the mixed feelings of his people.
At present, traffic in Mexico city is particularly bad.
Even on better days, this is a city that is always blocked, but on Monday a ring of steel was built, which blocks several important routes into the capital and ensures chaos on the streets.
However, the aim was not to disturb Pendler on the way to work, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching Parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new President Enrique Pena Nieto will receive the presidential bonds and take over the leadership of the nation.
He's facing a complex task.
Under Felipe Calderons's departing government, Mexico has been able to retain its economic value, but the country is under control of a drug war that has already cost 60,000 lives over the last six years.
"My government is strongly committed to reducing violence," said Pena Nieto at the Oval Office at the beginning of this week to US President Barack Obama.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this objective.
Pena Nieto was the governor of his home state in Mexico before joining the U.S. President.
In this densely populated, far-reaching part of the country surrounding the capital, opinions are shared about the new head of state.
A direct man
In the remote small town of Valle del Bravo, for example, one likes to remember him.
Residents of the holiday place are entrusted to him with the development of tourism and the construction of infrastructure.
In order to reach the city, one can drive on one of the motorways that Pena Nieto built and which represent a great improvement in relation to the fragile, wooden roads that once existed here.
Placets with his name also hang outside a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum for climate change.
"We expect real and persistent changes from him," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who works as a congressman for the Pena Nietos Party, the PRI.
In particular, as regards security and the economy, we hope for an interesting and real change that our country needs so urgently.
After 81 years of power, the PRI was replaced by Vicente Fox in 2000.
The Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside Los Pinos' presidential palace, the party has great expectations of Enrique Pena Nieto.
The opposition's accusations, the new president's lack of substance, he rejects.
He is a very direct man, very engaged and has great plans for the country.
He is an excellent statesman, but especially he is also someone who can listen.
But on the other hand, not many people share this view about their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast to the planted streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
The place is hidden under motorway transfers and is in many respects a suburb of Mexico city itself.
And the problems in the community are of crucial urban nature.
At the beginning of this year, the military was turned on to combat the drug bands operating in the quarters, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
On a stain of Brachland near a large landfill, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been left alone in the last two years.
During the term of office of Governor Pena Nieto, more than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico - a statistics that even exceeds that of the city of Ciudad Juarez, which is regretted for their violence and the murders of innocent women.
The critics Pena Nietos believe that he has at least not dealt with the problem of women's murders adequately during his term of office.
But in the worst case, his government has closed its eyes to the problem.
In a concrete building, typically for the down quarter, Irinea Buendia fought with the tears when she showed me pictures of her late daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes that she was murdered by her life companion.
"When I arrived at her house, it seemed that her body was washed," Senora Buendia remembers.
There were signs that she was beaten, and the body stare had already been used.
While her mother tells her story, a picture of Mariana looks down on us from the wall. It is located next to a cross that has a single word: justice.
But exactly this, according to the family, has been denied her so far.
The authorities treated me like I was a weaker, a troublemaker, a nörglerin.
They want their judgment to be accepted and kept their mouth shut.
"But that is not possible if there were so many formality errors and failures," she says.
If President Pena Nieto receives the presidential bond on Saturday, he also takes a great responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families have suffered from violent crimes over the last six years and the new President has promised to take special care of this problem during his term of office.
"I hope as President he is as he was as governor," says the PRI Congressman Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
But the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza are most afraid of that.
The Prosecutor claims that Bradley Manning did not complain about abuse
The prosecutor contradicts Bradley Manning's accusations that he was assaulted in prison.
The hearing deals with Manning's time in the military prison in Quantico, Virginia
The defense seeks to reject the indictment due to harsh detention conditions
The United States Army's freedom is accused of having lost thousands of confidential documents
On Friday, the prosecutor tried to find out that Bradley Manning, the army-free, accused of the greatest disclosure of confidential information from American history, failed several occasions to complain about the alleged military abuse he suffered.
During a cross-interrogation of Mannings during a preliminary hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland explained to Maj. Ashden Fein that documents for weekly visits that the prison officers had made during Manning's nine-month imprisonment in Quantico, Virginia did not raise any complaints about his treatment.
One day before the interrogation, which was held following an application for the defence to reject the charges - Manning had already been sufficiently punished by the harsh detention period - Manning had stated that he had considered suicide in prison.
The US Army's secret service analysis, which was arrested in June 2010, is accused of having stolen thousands of confidential documents in Iraq during its service period.
The material was then published by WikiLeaks on the Internet.
WikiLeaks never confirmed Manning as a source of information.
In the hearing on Friday, Fein and Manning went through the forms that officials had completed after their meeting with Manning during his detention in the Quantico military prison, where he had been detained under enhanced detention conditions from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officials asked Manning questions and wrote his answers.
When Fein questioned him to the forms on Friday, Manning admitted that he had considered the treatment by his guards as "excellent" and the treatment by the facility as a whole as "very professional."
The forms, so fine, did not contain any complaints about abuse, although the officials Manning had consulted directly on his treatment.
Mr Manning replied that he expressed his concerns orally and the officials had discussed them with him and indicated that they would have been dealt with, but they had not been recorded.
"They wrote (after discussing the concerns)" No problems, "and that didn't necessarily mean I didn't say anything at all," said Manning.
The Judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment when he met in January 2011 with a committee to examine the suicide ideas he mentioned a few months earlier on a form.
Manning replied that his intention during this meeting was to reduce his observation status on "prevention of injuries."
The military said it had assigned to him this restrictive status - which is one stage at risk of suicide - to his and the protection of others.
"I wanted to convince employees that I was doing well, and get rid of the observation status for the prevention of injuries (...) in order to achieve a higher quality of life in my opinion," said Manning.
On Thursday, Manning announced his arrest and relocation to Kuwait, where he was arrested almost two months before he was transferred to the marines base Quantico in Virginia in July 2010.
He said that in Kuwait he considered suicide and once became unconscious because of the heat.
Not to know what happened to him or in the outside world had been burdensome.
"My world shrinked on Camp Arafjon, together on this cage," said Manning on Thursday.
I thought I'd die in this cage.
When he was moved to Quantico, Manning spent most of his days in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without society.
He was allowed only one mattress, a blanket, flip flops, clothes and his glasses.
Manning said he tried to stay in motion, because on the day it was forbidden to sleep or just lay down.
Instead, he had to sleep with light that penetrated from outside into his cell.
When he turned around at night and guards couldn't see his face again, they woke him up so he could turn back.
In January 2011, Manning's lawyer formally objected to the treatment of Mannings.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to the military prison of Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
On Friday, Judge Manning also questioned about an accusation he made in his statement on Thursday - so he slept naked in his cell in Quantico and had to stand naked in front of guards and other prisoners in the morning.
Manning had said he never had the opportunity to cover himself with his ceiling during this count.
At the hearing on Friday, Manning stated that he had closed from a warrant from his guard that he should have dropped the ceiling with which he could have covered himself. However, he admitted that no one had asked him to do so.
On Thursday, Manning had stated that he was forced to sleep naked the other night. He had tried to show an official before that he did not pose any danger to himself.
Manning told the official that he could have used the bond of his underpants or his flip flops to hurt himself, but did not do so.
That night, Manning said, his underpants, flip flops and glasses were removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account his detention experiences and drastically reduce his detention, should he be sentenced in his trial before the military court, which is scheduled for the beginning of next year.
The defense has indicated that Manning will confess less offences for guilty, while other charges that are considered too extreme are to be contested.
The hearing is continued for this weekend. The prosecutor is expected to justify the detention conditions.
The Pentagon remains in its position that Manning was held in accordance with the provisions applicable to all prisoners under the highest security arrangements in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include the promotion of the enemy, the unlawful publication of confidential information on the Internet, the transfer of national defence information and the theft of public ownership or documents.
If he is found guilty in all charges, he is threatened with a lifelong prison.
My Mexican-American identity crisis.
Many people are forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to accuse the immigrants - they call them heavy times in memory, he says
Navarrette believes that Mexican Americans are trapped between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and had arrived at the passport control when counseling spread within me.
Signs refer to two queues: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans"), another for "Extranjeros" ("foreigners").
I was standing there for a few seconds, uncertain to whom I should go.
I grew up in Central California and was called "Mexican" all my life.
An ethnic shortcut - just as my friends in Boston call themselves "Irish" or my friends in New York "Italian."
Later, I chose "Mexican-American."
But this was Mexico.
And in the home of my grandfather there was no need for pumps or bonded.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, at least good enough to claim myself in this language at both ends of an interview.
But I don't have the vocabulary of a mother speaker, and I'm not going to lose my American accent either.
So I took my American passport and put myself in the line for Extranjeros.
I was thinking about the moment this week when the future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet President Obama.
The agenda included all the issues that are expected when the heads of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also very interested in talking about the growth of the Mexican economy. It is a reason why Mexicans are staying in Mexico today with equal probability instead of emigrating to the United States.
He wants to join the United States and Canada and create a North American trade block as the European Union is an example.
And Pena Nieto swore to continue the war of Mexico against the drug cartels, even though he did not mention details about this.
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never waste a single thought about the fact that the United States entered Mexico in 1848 and forced the country's leadership under a held rifle to leave them more than half of their territory.
But for Mexicans who think in centuries and not in minutes, memories of this event cannot be ignored.
So as soon as an American government officer criticizes Mexico, it is heard - in the Mexican press and among the elites of the country - complaints about how the Americans oppress the sovereignty of their neighbours.
And the children of Montezumas go to the war path.
Yet the biggest challenge of Mexico is in fact the relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Would you like to talk about Ressentiments?
There's more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities, and others for whom it does not.
The only reason why so many people live Mexican origin in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at one point in our family tree a person - perhaps a parent or grandparent - was not offered a chance in Mexico and emigrated to the north.
And in most cases this person matched a profile - dark-headed, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our faithfulness shall apply to them.
Not Mexico.
And even though we may now have lived the American dream, visited good schools and received good jobs, we must never lose sight of the American dream that we live - not the Mexican.
Our identity may sometimes be dizzy, but as far as our loyalty is concerned, this is not the case.
This clearly applies to the United States.
Furthermore, we are aware that many members of the Mexican leadership do not like us.
This is based on reciprocity.
They see us as a reminder of humiliating defeat and look down at us because we are not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our gangs to Mexico will never be strong enough.
They believe that our existence is a symbol of failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have gone.
And then we wouldn't be caught behind the silk curtain now - with a pleasant life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally emigrated into the United States as a child, reminds me that there are tensions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are - and Mexican Americans take this bad.
While she is an American citizen, she sees herself as part of two countries.
But many Mexican Americans I know have the feeling that they are neither one nor another.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You enjoy the best of both worlds, but none of them is rooted.
In Mexico, we are seen as Americans.
And in the United States we are seen as Mexicans.
As I should learn during my journey, there is something that makes this relationship even more complicated: some Mexican leaders and parts of the educational community want to resume their connections to diaspora.
They want to use Mexican Americans as provisional "ambassadors" for Mexico who represent their interests in the United States.
We should tell our American colleagues how great a visit to this country is and press political leadership to intensify their ties with Mexico.
Well.
That's not gonna happen.
Too many injured feelings.
And in view of the unjust distribution of income, unbridled corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure whether this is really a great country.
I'm afraid you'll have to go through that alone, amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not yet prepared to forgive the United States for dealing with Mexico one and a half centuries ago, they also have to accept that some Mexican Americans have a grudge for how their family members have not been treated so long ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're "Mexican" than I thought.
Old fights, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could prove to be an unexpected pillar of peace
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem to suffocate such a hope in the germ.
In the midst of the usual debt allocations, numerous buildings were put in shock and ash, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed - and for the first time missiles from Gaza were attacked near the Israeli metropolis Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
However, although Israelis and Palestinians seem trapped in their historical conflict, the Middle East changes around them.
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they want it or not - Palestinians and Israelis have become part of these confusion.
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.
But there are reasons for assuming that the deadly disease situation could finally find its end.
A war that will neither be lost nor won
At first sight, optimism seems to be anything different than appropriate in view of the current situation.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on 21 November continues, this week's struggles have strengthened the hardship on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement, which has been controlling the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim to have pushed the Israelis back, although its grouping itself had to have suffered considerable losses.
Although several Hamas leaders are killed and the 1,7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip are arrested in one of the most desolate and densely populated corners of the planet, Israel has not yet managed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas wins in the West Bank, which is controlled by the rival, moderate Palestinian group Fatah.
And the Hamas leaders could come to the conclusion that they have the time on their side.
As Islamists in the Arab world have gained influence, Hamas has been able to draw powerful and rich friends on its side.
Turkey, a restoring regional power, once considered to be Israel's strongest Muslim ally, has taken place for the Hamas party - just like Katar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.
Jubilating Hamas followers believe that there is an Islamic half-moon around Israel - from Lebanon in the north, where the militante Hisbollah has power over Syria, where rebels of an increasingly Islamic impression could stand before the fall of Bashar Assads, to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And in particular the rise of Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt - the most residential and most important Arab country - on the southern flank of Israel has permanently changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the Laizist Despot, who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time left for Hamas.
On the other hand, the brotherhood with Hamas is weakened and its leaders are more dependent on people's faces.
In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas could prove to be an actor which cannot be pushed out by Israel and the United States.
On the other hand, the Israeli hardliner makes a contradictory conclusion.
In military terms, Hamas is no longer a danger.
The Israeli missile defense system, "Iron Dome," has been able to preserve itself and many of the Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
At least for a while, Israel will be able to sleep quieter.
From a diplomatic point of view, the United States holds its position unshakingly. Many European countries have made Hamas responsible for the latest violence scales.
Israel has done well in recent years, especially under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively free of suicide killers - not least thanks to the blocks that have entered the West Bank and hence into the main part of a possible Palestinian state, which protect the Jewish settlements, which have been declared illegal in international law, but are constantly expanded.
Netanyahu is good there. His Likud party joined Avigdor Lieberman in the run-up to the elections on 22 January with an even more fighting group.
Why are these disgusting Palestinians crushing and giving them their own state?
If they really had control over the West Bank, wouldn't they fire missiles like their fellow strikers in the Gaza Strip?
No, it's better to keep them behind the wall in chess and punish them if they dare raise their heads.
Perhaps the Hardliner will be able to enforce themselves, but the Arab Spring could make them a line through the bill.
Even if the Islamists who are now in power in Egypt and in other countries have little left for Israel, they will first focus on the difficulties in their own country.
The Israeli Defense Tate is greater than that of its four Arab neighbours together.
A war with local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments to restore their economy.
That the pragmatic President Mursi gathered with Barack Obama to reach a ceasefire could be a promising sign - and perhaps symbolize the beginning of a new era.
Israelis should also think more long-term.
While the rest of the Arab world is taking gentle steps towards democratisation, Palestinians are still being robbed by their right of self-determination - a powder barrel which will undoubtedly explode one day in the Israeli occupied areas, just as a bus exploded this week in Tel Aviv.
The oppression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population this situation will only exacerbate.
Bloody missions to push Hamas back in the Gaza Strip will increasingly demand their diplomatic tribute over the years.
Both sides need a start from the outside
The right answer is those represented by the more sensible representatives of both sides, the majority of the rest of the world and from this newspaper: two states where Israel leaves areas for security purposes.
The small hope - for the near future - is that the ceasefire will give foreign people more influence in enforcing this solution.
Egypt must now, together with Turkey and Katar, stop arms supplies in the Gaza Stripes and is better positioned than ever to convince Hamas of the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, supplemented by territorial exchange and a common Jerusalem.
External Arab nations should also encourage Hamas and Fatah to agree.
This would be done more for the creation of a Palestinian State than with the forthcoming request for UN observer status.
Obama also has to contribute its part to making Israel negotiate.
During his first term of office he failed to imagine his own peace plan.
Far away in the White House it seems that he is also inclined to participate.
But this is a regrettable, short-term perspective.
The United States has an essential interest in a stable Middle East.
And this includes a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian law on uniform cigarette packaging enters into force
Health warnings and sick body parts on neutral green packs that are the same for all tobacco brands
The world's first laws on uniform cigarette and tobacco packaging have entered into force in Australia. This will replace brand logos and colors with neutral, olive-green blankets, printed with drastic images, showing the sick parts of the body and cigarette smoke infected infants and children.
From Saturday onwards, apart from the various health warnings and images, there is the only difference between the packages in the brand names printed in identical, small writing.
This introduces the most stringent rules for tobacco packaging in the world.
The Australian Federal Government wants to remove young people from smoking by removing the glamorous image of tobacco consumption.
The government is based on studies that have shown that people who have not yet started smoking at 26 will no longer start with 99% probability even after that.
"You can already see in children of young ages that they understand the message that they try to apply the tobacco companies with their brand image," said Federal Minister for Health Tanya Plibersek. She quotes studies that have shown, for example, that children associate the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and the changes will only have a minor impact on the profits of multinational companies, other countries are already considering similar steps.
The tobacco lobby fought hard against the laws.
So it was said that the laws would favour the trade in the black market, which would lead to cheaper and more accessible cigarettes.
"The laws will lead to serious, unintended consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will offer much larger quantities of these products on the streets of Australia.
On the other hand, others say that the laws have crushed their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, notes that demand for cigarette etuis and silicone covers has increased enormously to cover the intolerable packaging since the British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco companies failed two months ago the highest Australian Court of Justice with their oppression of the laws.
Zico sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale shops and waited for new stocks.
This is a good business for us.
According to experts, the hook lies in the popularity of social media with exactly the population group to which the plan is addressed.
A number of Australian laws have banished tobacco companies from TV advertising, forbidden them to act as sporting sponsors and forced most dealers not to interpret cigarettes in shops anymore. Now tobacco advertising has changed to the Internet.
The Australian government has banned internet advertising by local companies and sites, but has no influence on international sites.
"Whoever markets tobacco and has only one small area left to apply its products does not come around the Internet," says Becky Freeman, a health research scientist at Sydney University.
In social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, Freeman has seen an increase in experience reports on brands written by "normal people."
You have to ask yourself: is this just a private person who finds such a big favor on Marlboro cigarettes that she even takes a video for it - or does a marketing agency have to do with it?
British American Tobacco Australia says that industry rather than marketing is concentrating on dealing with the new laws.
It has even gone so far to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to fight the new rules - those countries complain to the World Trade Organisation about unfair trade restrictions, although none of the countries is in charge of major trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected for mid-2013.
According to Plibersek, the government has had talks with other countries which consider similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to prescribe photographic warnings in 2001.
In the meantime, these have been extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
More stringent laws are being considered in Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers show themselves proud.
The pictures don't affect me.
I'm just ignoring her.
"You just take a kip and put the box away," says Victor El Hage when you buy a cigarette box, on which a photo is printed with a oral tumor.
Honestly, there's only one reason I'd stop, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, the operator of the "King of the Pack" tobacco trade in Sydney's downtown, says that the uniform packaging has made it difficult to fill up its shelves.
"I used to take an hour to sort a delivery, now I need four," says Yu.
"The government should simply have forbidden cigarettes completely - then we would have said to each other okay, that's it, we close," he obviously added.
In a constantly electrified world it is nice to be bored even once
This Thanksgiving I spent unexpectedly five hours at the airport when our plane fell out due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane.
So I had enough time to bore myself a few thoughts.
I don't want to lie.
Waiting half a day at the airport for a flight is quite nervous - even if books, magazines and iPhones (and of course tax-free shopping) are available.
But more and more academics and child development experts are boring as something positive.
If it goes after them, it's okay for us - and our children - to be bored sometimes.
This will force the brain to lose itself in interesting ways of thinking, which may potentially promote creativity.
And because most of us are almost constantly staring at one or other screen nowadays, the benefits of boring will no longer benefit us.
So should we welcome the boredom with open arms?
Yeah.
And no.
I will come back to that again.
As many people, I have always assumed that boredom is a relatively current phenomenon that has evolved with increasing leisure time.
However, Peter Toohey, Professor of Greek and Roman History at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of Boredom: A Lively History (Yale University Press, 2011) does not see that.
"In fact, the boredom has a very long story," he says.
The house walls of Pompejis decorate a Latin graffiti over boredom, which dates back to the first century.
And then there's the question of how we actually define boredom.
According to John D. Eastwood, an associated professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, the problem is that boring has been defined and discussed in many ways.
After a long reading of research literature and the presentation of the idea in front of a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the conclusion that boring as the experience of "trying to exercise a satisfactory activity, but not to be able to define it."
Late differs from apathy so that the person is not employed but wants to be.
On the other hand, there is no need to do anything about apathy.
The key experience of boredom, he says, exists in a "disturbance of the attention process, coupled with bad mood and the feeling that time is only passing slowly."
It's boring that can almost sound like depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes, even though these two conditions might be related, bored people see the problem in their surroundings or in the world, while depressed people see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we're boring, even though we're just having trouble concentrating.
In her study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention" - to German about: "The Inactive mind: The definition of boredom under the aspect of attention," published in September in the journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science," Professor Eastwood and his colleagues point to an earlier experiment in which the participants listened to a band on which a person read a magazine article.
Some groups heard a loud TV program from the neighbouring room, which had nothing to do with the content. Others heard it on low volume, so it was hardly visible, while the third group did not hear these sounds at all.
The people who heard the hardly hearing television indicated more boredom than the two other groups - they had problems concentrating, could find no reason for them and wrote their difficulties of boredom.
If you try to focus on a difficult or exhausting task, the disruption of attention can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, Associated Professor of Neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, if one exercises an unambiguous activity - "like looking for defective products on a factory promotion band, music can distract and help not to feel bored."
In fact, as he says, we now know that circling and crying, often interpreted as signs of boredom, can even fight them by keeping people more physically attentive.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to hamper around learn more and keep more information than those who are forced to sit still," said Professor Fenske.
We all get bored sometime - my late flight, a drunking speaker, a particularly tired movie.
But some people are more bored than others.
In order to measure these differences, researchers developed in the 1980s a "scale of long-term vulnerability."
On the scale there are statements like "Many things I have to do, repeat themselves and are monotone" and "I have so many interests that I don't have enough time for everything."
With the help of such scales, researchers have found that boys become more boring than girls, according to Stephen Vodanovich, Professor of Psychology at the University of Westflorida - especially as regards the need for more and a greater variety of external attractions.
But generally, teenagers are a pretty excited bunch.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted almost 400 teenagers and her parents seven to eight times a day with a pager.
He found that 32% of the growing people in school and in the performance of homework were bored, while 23% indicated that they were bored if they were not in school.
But only 3% of parents reported to feel bored.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he does not know whether the percentage of boredom has increased or decreased.
However, he is sure that "youth is felt particularly boring," mainly because children and teenagers do not have a major influence on their everyday life.
So back to my question of origin: Is boring healthy?
Sometimes not, because in extreme cases, it leads to people taking extreme physical risks and decay gambling or drugs to mitigate them - that has been shown in studies.
On the other hand, many philosopher and authors are investigating the relationship between boredom and creativity. This opinion is Professor Vodanovich who has been exploring the subject for more than two decades.
"With the boredom the brain wants to tell you that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, Professor of Psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain doesn't always know what to do right now.
If one is boring and you use this energy to play and cook guitar, you'll be happy.
However, television can make sense of happiness in the short term, but in the long term, they are revolving again.
Anyone who endures an iPad to his bored child can thus remove it from the boredom. However, it has not learnt to entertain or control himself, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds: "Self-control is transferring from one situation to another."
The child learns not only to talk, but also to gain more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should be boring.
Nor should we see them too critical.
Instead, our aim should be to feel well beyond constant activity and technology support.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"It sounds like we need to be bored more often. But boring is the tormented, inevitable desire to do something sensible," he says.
He believes that in truth, people are only looking for a way to turn off and relax.
"In an environment where we are constantly overstimulated, it is difficult to work once the noise is dizzy."
In Colorado there is no clear guideline for the new marijuana law
The 19-year-old Community College student and football player Anthony Orozco stands for a crime in the south-east of Colorados, which will soon be legal in this state: the possession of some less marijuana demolition and a pipe with which he smoked it.
According to Orozco, he and some friends were on their way on a September day by car in Lamar near the border to Kansas when they were stopped.
After the police officer had found marijuana in the car, Orozco was charged for possession of drugs and drugs utensils - cavalier offences, each with a penalty of 100 US dollars - and received a court appointment.
"We are treated like criminals," said Orozco.
But is he one too?
In the uncertain weeks following the government's decision to legalize small quantities of marijuana for self-use, the answer for hundreds of smaller drug offences depends less on the law than on the location.
Hundreds of irregularities in order to deal with marijuana are already dropped here and in the state of Washington, which approved similar measures.
The police are no longer persecuting adults over 21 years of age to a small extent. This is permitted by law as soon as the new laws enter into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in the conservative districts of Colorado have announced that they continue to pursue existing marijuana offences and still quote people in court.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denvers to the Western Mountains, agree to prevent new, state-licensed marijuana business from opening up their municipalities.
"This situation develops so quickly that I do not know what will happen next," says Daniel J. Oates, Chief of Police in Aurora, located east of Denver.
And also regulators in the state of Washington scratch in their heads.
They are waiting for a guide to establish a licensing system for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale of the drugs - and have a deadline in mind until 1 December 2013.
In Washington, it is believed that Colorado is in any case ahead of most states with regard to the regulation of marijuana. There the drug was only legalized for medical purposes and then for self-consumption.
"Colorado has a more regulated market. The state is therefore well suited to orientation," says Brian E. Smith, spokesman of the Supervisory Authority for Spirits in the State of Washington.
But Smith also admits that no place or system can do more than serve in the sense of a rough guide.
"We have no real precedent we can follow," he adds.
The Washington Act, called I-502, enters into force on 6 December and thus forms the end point of a grey zone in which the state licensing system does not yet exist, but the possession is legalized.
And unpleasant practical questions need to be resolved at this time - for example, how to agree on the state requirement for "adequate access" to licensed marijuana with the ban on cannabis business around 300 meters around schools, parks, playgrounds and childcare facilities.
"Nowhere will it be harder to find a location for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the urban area of Seattle," says Ben Livingston, spokesperson for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a recently formed research group.
On 21 November, Chief Oates sent his employees in Aurora an e-mail stating that the prosecutor would no longer pursue minor marijuana offences in persons over 21 years of age and that the police "from now on" would not seek any criminal evidence for these crimes.
Chief Oates added that the police will continue to enforce urban regulations for producers of medical marijuana and continue to persecute drug dealers.
In Weld County in North Colorados, District Attorney Ken Buck represents a stricter view.
After the vote, he stated that his authority would continue to pursue cases of marijuana ownership, mainly to encourage consumers to withdraw.
At present 119 people must be responsible for the possession of about 50 grams or less of marijuana in court, although many were also accused of other offences.
"Our authority has the duty to persecute infringements at the time of crime," said Buck in a statement.
The reactions are even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters refused the marijuana initiative, twitching.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city of the county, no longer show adults for the possession of smaller quantities.
Attorney-General Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to drop all outstanding property procedures.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time enforcing the right until it changes," he says.
Although 55% of the voters in Colorado supported the measure, it was clear from the outset that it would not be easy to agree on the personal consumption of marijuana with the complexity of government and legal system.
And the contradictory reactions throughout the state supported a deep duplication among local officials in view of the large green experiment.
In the case of district prosecutors, it is a "cultural barrier," says Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, who represents accused of marijuana offences in court and acts on the ground as a spokesman for the national organisation for the reform of marijuana laws.
"They have spent such a large part of their life persecuting people in criminal law that they still cannot accept legalisation," he believes.
As the first countries that treat smaller quantities of marijuana like alcohol, Colorado and Washington are traded as national patterns of legalisation of drugs.
While interlocutors and state officials are preparing for an age of legal sale, they are also waiting nervously for instructions from the federal government that will continue to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana at federal level as a crime.
Presidents of the legalisation movement hope that the Ministry of Justice will give up.
Despite several supervising arrests of consumers and sellers of medical marijuanas, the Federal Government has allowed the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states to be largely permitted.
Kevin A. Sabet, former drug policy consultant of the Obama government, believes that, although criminal officers are probably not going to enter doors to seize smaller quantities of drugs, they are likely to be fouled to tolerate legal, state-regulated marijuana business under the new legislation.
Several cities in Colorado are not even waiting for the federal authorities to act.
Even before the election day, some local municipalities approved moratoria for new marijuana business, although they could only open in about a year.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the West, decided a six-month ban which is probably being adopted next week.
"We do not want to get into a position where we license someone and then face a major problem at federal level," said Bob Nicholson, member of the City Council.
Our community has voted against this change of law.
We focus on what the community has chosen and not on what the state has chosen.
A lot of questions are still open.
Petronella Wyatt: I was mobbed from Oxford because I'm Tory
Not only university students from today are attacked for their views
Always had it been my greatest dream to have a place at the University of Oxford.
Both my father and my older brother had visited the university that I once thought was the greatest stamp of knowledge in the world, a modern Greek symposium that promoted the great pillars of civilization - free thinking and tolerance.
But within two weeks of my entry to Worscester College at the end of the eighties - there I had planned to study history - I had again packed my bags and thus brought the first scandal of my life.
My father broke into tears.
My friends were confused.
In the Evening Standard it was said that I had left because I had a problem with the fact that comrades had sex in the neighboring room.
The author A N Wilson explained shelmisch that I had left the university because I was forced to drink from damaged cups.
But the truth was less amusing.
I ran away.
Yeah, ran because I suffered from systematic mobbing and threats.
Not because of my rather unusual name, or because I came from a private school.
I was only harassed for one reason - a reason that seemed so creepy and cruel in this alleged cradle of enlightenment: My now deceased father Woodrow Wyatt was an important consultant Margaret Thatcher and I advocate the Conservative Party.
Why do I mention this right now?
Well, current reports say a new generation of students of moderate rights suffer from similar persecution.
The organised and rising hatred of Tory students in Oxford has now developed such dimensions that a group of them last week demanded the same protection of equal rights for gay people, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) at Corpus Christi College say that they are "often actively isolated, attacked personally and declared unwanted."
They ask for a seat in the Equal Opportunities Committee of their College to ensure that their opinions can be expressed freely.
Their situation was worsened by a recent documentary on political students at BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the right," which Tories represented as an excentrician and Neonazis.
It showed, among other things, a graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the Conservative Student Association of the University of Oxford, who drove in a Rolls Royce and provoked with silver-colored suit and silver-occupied straw.
At other universities, conservative students say they are regarded as "scapegoats for the introduction of higher tuition fees."
The 20-year-old Luke Black, Vice President of the Conservative Student Association of the University of Nottingham, said in a Sunday newspaper: "There is an increasing left-wing trend at universities.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without even getting to know us. "
Samuel Roberts, 21 and history student in Corpus Christi, who initiated the request for greater protection, believes that such a climate is "unpleasant." The 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, nominated President of the Conservative Student Association of Oxford, has observed an increasing rejection to students of moderate rights in JCR members.
"This represents a threat to the intellectual discourse and to the well-being of the members," she says.
In my first weeks in Oxford, I belonged to such a minority.
As an incredibly shy 18-year-old I arrived in September 1986.
The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its highlight.
Last year, the university had voted in favour of not giving honour to Margaret Thatcher - a former student - due to reductions in higher education.
The atmosphere would have even frightened Stalinists.
In the first days of the first semester week, where new students and the tutors met, I received a taste of the future events.
I made the experience that the tutors did not just tolerate the mood of Tory students, but even with pleasure.
Political issues such as mining, privatisation and the refusal of sanctions by the government against the apartheid regime of South Africa found their way into the wooden areas of the tutorium.
In my first of these events, I was supposed to translate French texts from the 18th century into English. I had not been drawn up on what was then to come.
"Miss Wyatt," said Tutor Harry Pitt (now died), "please translate the first paragraph."
I trampled with it.
Pitt was a little man with a face like a cake pie, and pretty ugly.
"If Thatcher followers refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked me.
The other students were snooping.
In my eyes, tears wound up.
"I suggest that you take a few French hours in your leisure - so if you're not too busy with your social activities," Pitt touched me.
I returned to my room with my head hanging back.
That night, I was sitting alone at college dinner when someone tipped me on my shoulder.
It was an English student from the second year named James who introduced himself as a member of the Conservative Student Association.
"I know who you are," he said friendly.
Unfortunately, it's the way it is.
Anyone who is suspected of being Tory is under persecution.
It's bad enough for me, but they know your father Margaret Thatcher is close, so it's gonna be worse for you.
Most Tory first semesters pretend to be supporters of the Labour Party.
In a local pub, I tried to change myself later.
I insisted that I did not agree with Mrs Thatcher on all points.
This trick should prove unsuccessful.
A student in the field of philosophy, politics and economy, who had ironically visited Eton College as a conservative, said to me, "You are the daughter of a fascist swine."
You're dirty.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was perverted and dirty.
"How's Tories having sex?" someone asked me.
They're beating each other, aren't they?
I felt the way homosexuals felt before the more liberal legislation of the United States.
Would I ever be able to live a normal life at Oxford University?
Would I be able to meet the same minds only after the Darkness broke in?
Should I turn to the Labour Party and suppress my natural tendencies?
The three years before me, in front of my spiritual eye, became a fever of marriage and isolation.
The only tutor that openly recognized itself as a Tory was Norman Stone, professor of contemporary history, who had his seat in my college.
He was hated not only to be a conservative, but also because he advised Thatcher on foreign policy and wrote speeches for them.
He was only rarely there.
He hated the place, found him provincially and small and rejected him for his marxist-determinist history perspective.
In 1997 he took a professorship at the University of Bilkent in Ankara in Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I began to pile between Oxford and my parents' house and found refuge with more open friends and family members in the city.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why I did it.
He seemed unbelievable.
During his time in the forties, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said little loud.
They would never do anything like that, not in my city of dreaming towers.
Even my communist friends always put good manners on the day.
His moist eyes clouded.
Give this whole thing a chance.
I'm sure they'll just nail you.
It would break my heart if you went.
Extended by my frequent travels to London, my emotional resistance became weaker.
One of my male friends, also Tory followers, had given up the pressure and rejected his beliefs.
During a tutorium in the following week, when another story teacher had seriously claimed that I was "an enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Although I was secretly shamed, I admitted that my parents had undergone a "brainwash" and called it "old fool."
The relief took only a short time.
It was my father who beat the last nail in the coffin of my Oxford career.
At that time he wrote two columns per week in the Murdoch press.
My door was locked.
I hid in my room, and after five minutes, my bunnies gave up.
When they left, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
You'd be happy to call me a weeping pussy.
But no 18-year-old should ever suffer from such intimidation and wickedness in a educational institution.
And even more tragic is that it was Oxford - a university that did not only produce 14 Tory Prime Minister, but hid itself to this day behind an undeserved reputation of equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers the elegance of celebrity"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino - Master of Couture," which was opened this week in London, ABC talks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian fashion maker.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital that is worthy of the accommodation of an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
This has been recognised by the designer at the opening of "Valentino - Master of Couture," a magnificent retrospective for which more than 130 dresses of the Haute Couture were assembled, created by his "Maison" in the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his distinguished clients.
Valentino has always felt fascination for the sticky and distant world of the noble.
In the first room of this exhibition, which will be seen until March 3, there will be a variety of private letters and photos with the signature of the most sensible Aristocracy, starting from Princess Salimah Aga Khan, through Princess Marie-Chantal from Greece and Margarita from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social ascension from the modest fashion maker in the city of Voghera in northern Italy to the idol of the international jet.
Being in love with the noble doesn't have to be a disadvantage.
"At least they don't put their chips on your magnificent carpet, as some beautiful celebrities from pop music do," Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza says.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the two lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, generous and elegant host.
"We all welcome when we were invited to his house in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, close friends with forgotten beauty such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance of celebrity.
And yet he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a dress of Valentino
Also the Argentine model Valeria Mazza does not forget the charisma of the fashion maker.
Many years ago we went to his house for dinner after a fashion show at the Piazza di Spagna in Rome.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
Every detail of his apartment, decoration, food and music recognized and felt its influence.
"All those involved felt important and loved," recalls the "top model," which began their career at the week of the Haute Couture 1995 in Paris.
"He never comes out of fashion because his designs are art works" she concludes.
Mode view of origin
The life of Garavani is not a history of mind, rather of mutual love.
He likes people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House has been transformed into a glorious and 60-meter-long runway step, which suggests a roll exchange: the user takes the place of the model and goes along the runway to admire a traumatic "audience" that carries the masterpieces of Valentino, such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristóteles Onassis, the costumes that Monica Vitti wore in "La Notte," or a coat of wool and leather that belonged to the Emperor Farah Diba.
In this audience of fashion dolls, names like Sibilla de Luxemburgo, Gloria von Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofía von Habsburg shine.
Naty Abascal and the fashion maker, 2006
Many of these customers say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "unforgettable."
I still remember perfectly.
It was a pants, a shirt, a vest type "Gillette" and a jacket from the autumn / winter collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift from him," says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's muses.
"I draw him to everyone else because of his great love for women and because he highlights our beauty," adds the ex-Duchess of Feria.
I like the colors he uses very much; they have a lot of light and emphasize the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and the leader of the fashion Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg cannot forget the first time she wore a Valentino.
When I was a teenager in Italy, I dreamed of finally having the age and the opportunity to wear one of his nightdresses...
At the end of the 1990s, it finally happened.
I bought my first Valentino dress for a party in my father's castle, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with flying skirt and a draped top with a decolleté that honors his name.
"It was a true dream," says the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino does not depend on fashion, his obsession is timeless," explains this Italian Aristocratic who lives between París, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg retains her evening clothes of the fashion maker "with absolute care," because a dress is not only a dress but also the memories associated with it. "
The "King" of Fashion
The great final of the exhibition in Somerset House is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress for her wedding with Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "Ragazze" (as the fashion maker called his neighbours) were necessary to make this ivory-coloured silk dress with pearls, twelve different embroidery and a four and a half meter long silk.
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, the top authority of the specialist press, this dress was a milestone in the Haute Couture at the end of the 20th century, "the return to the customers of the supreme society."
Valentino is now her best specimen for years with the "savoir-être" of the elite.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest award in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, excellent with the honorary legion, accumulates Garavani as many honors as any of the husbands of his customers.
"I have always noticed his refinement, his tranquility, his custom and perfect outer," D'Arenberg admits.
I saw him last time a month ago at a gala dinner at the Museum de Orsay.
He sat at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of mine.
"He was magical; time leaves no traces on him."
And this is what a princess says...
The most difficult profession in the world: the human working animals of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano are putting their lives and their health at risk when they carry 70 kilos of sulfur over the steep, stone paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others work literally in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who deserve their lives by getting sulphur from the Vulcan Kawah Ijen in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, he has to get down on the floor of his crater every day, where the fluid-resistant gas emitting the earth is mounted in contact with the air.
After breaking out large sulphur stones, which can weigh up to 70 kilo in total, he transports them in two bamboo caves on his shoulders over the abominable paths of stone.
Although it is only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises up to a height of 2386 meters, the exhausted carriers need more than 40 minutes for the rise in the turtle tempo, keeping the balance and taking their steps with caution so that they do not slip out and crash.
They know that every step can cost their lives, as it happened to a French tourist who crashed at the Kawah Ijen slopes years ago.
The miners in Kawah earn 5 eurocent for each kilo of sulphur they deplete.
Coming upstairs, they walk the way between the tourists, which they photograph like circus monkeys and run with the tired heavy baskets three kilometers to the scale that a mining company has set up a little further down at a height of 1850 meters
The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi, who has been using the events in the volcano since 1960 and (never better) its workers, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 Eurocent) for each kilo of sulphur.
This then sells it to the petrochemical industry for every 10,000 rupees (83 Eurocent), because this mineral is widely used in everyday life and is used for the manufacture of carrots, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for bleaching of sugar.
"As we usually wear 70 kg, we get about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each road," explains Anto, who usually makes three routes a day.
For each route he takes three hours to make it completely possible, but at the end of the day he has 138,000 rupees (11,5 Euro) together.
What looks like a disgusting reward for such an inhuman effort is the triple of what he would earn with the field work.
"The daily wage of the miners here, where 15.000 rupees (1.2 euros) are paid during the coffee harvest and the average monthly income is two million rupees (167 euros) is very high," explains the carrier who previously worked as a murer on the tourist island of Bali.
There he earned 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto and his family returned to Banyuwangi, a village nearby, for a reason that is as important as the sulphur in Indonesia: "I married a girl from Bali, where they are Hinduists, and I brought them to Java to convert them to Islam."
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughing often and his eyes are irritated because of the toxic gases.
The 27-year-old Anto has been risking his life at Kawah Ijen for three years, whose sulphur has already left the first traces on him, even though he covers his face with a mask and special glasses.
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughing often and his eyes are irritated because of the toxic gases from the volcano.
This is the price he has to pay for achieving his dream.
"I will still work here for two years because I want to open a store or learn Spanish or French," he promises in one more than just acceptable English.
This sympathetic and intelligent young man, but punished by life, could work as a tourist guide, waiter or at the reception of a hotel, but instead he carries out the work of a carriage.
He divides a dirty wooden hut with other carriers and rises every morning at two o'clock, because the sulphur also flows out at night where its characteristic yellow color shines blossom in darkness.
By challenging the shadows, he rises into the crater in the light of a small headlamp on his helmet that he bought from his own money.
Approximately 400 carriers charge the basket with sulphur on their shoulders on the crater floor.
Despite its large profits, the mining company has not mechanised the sulphur reduction to save costs, and supplies no equipment to the carriers who work on their own account and are paid by weight.
You will also not receive a share of the 30.000 rupees (2.5 euros) supplement per photographic device that the guardians of this natural park together with the entry money of 15.000 rupees (1.2 euros) require from the tourists who come to photograph the volcano and the human tragesel.
"This work is for animals and not for humans" protests Madrusin, a vocal, 42-year-old carrier who has been working three decades since leaving school at Kawah Island.
He is able to carry up to 110 kg and assures that he continues "as long as he can," because he needs the money to raise his three children between 10 and 18 years old.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano was my whole life.
Even if the sulphur burns the throat and the eyes itch, when the wind turns suddenly and the miners are stuck in the thick columns that rise from the crater, the men are so hard that no one complains about serious diseases... of course except the usual respiratory problems, arthrosis, pain in the knees and bladder on the shoulders that have deformed from the weight of the body.
With the basket on his back, Unainik with his 53 years is more able to wear 50 kg.
Every day he and his companions break 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, which are transported by three trucks through a goat path between the bush to the camp in Tamansari in 18 kilometres distance.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano was my whole life" explains Unainik, where he opens his mouth far, in which some teeth are missing.
Of his five children, the oldest also works as a sulphur carrier with his 30 years.
Time goes away, but armies keep generation on generation in one of the toughest professions in the world: those who work as a human burden on the Kawah Islands.
Singapore needs babies to save the economy
The Singapore people blame for having no children, for their career, for the stress and cost of the property and for the children's education.
"The population of Singapore must grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife: We fulfill our civil duty and create lives!
It seems incredible that the verses are part of an advertising for minzbonbons, but yet - or precisely because of that - they became a viral video on YouTube at the beginning of this year in Singapore.
The sentences are part of a rapper song, the local speeches such as "pushing a" bao "(Laib) into the oven to make fun of the low birth rate in Singapore.
The advertisement company BBH, who drew the video, trusts the hope that the advertisement spot reaches the fun way to draw attention to the problem.
Your creative director Douglas Hamilton says he wanted to use the power of music to get people to fulfil their "national duty."
This is just something for the Internet, so we had to make it funny and funny.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
In reproduction we are the worst in the world, so we noticed that this is a matter we had to deal with.
We knew that the government had tried a lot, such as the marketing of perfume with phenomones or the organisation of speed dating evenings (fast flirts).
Possibly many of these ideas were creative, but they did not necessarily lead to success.
That is why we thought: why don't we do something as creative as possible to tackle this problem, such as composing a rap?
1.2 Children
Those who do not take this issue easily are the Government of Singapore.
Every year, it spends $1,300 for policy measures to encourage citizens to have more children.
A package by the government for couples and parents provides up to $15.000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But everything has not been successful so far.
Singapore is a rich high-tech city state in Southeast Asia, which is also known for the conservatism of its governors and its strict social controls.
According to his national population authority, the birth rate is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time this rate was over 2 - which is known as a replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why don't the Singapore kids get any more?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage and Family Policy of the National Population Authority, says that this is due to "better education" and "greater career mechanisms."
"This has enabled people to have much more options in terms of life objectives and to set priorities, except to marry and to form a family." she explains.
These changes in social conditions have contributed to the increase in the number of single persons and the delays in marriage and birth, the result of which is the reduction in birth rates in Singapore.
In the meantime, an immigration policy aimed at a dramatic increase in immigration in order to counteract the reduction of the population has led to an impact on the local population.
In Singapore there are websites where the barely cascade xenophobia blossoms against many new immigrants, especially the Chinese who are criticized for keeping wages low and not integrating themselves.
The increase in immigration is also considered to be one of the reasons why the Government Party achieved its worst electoral result since independence last year in Singapore.
Since the elections, an attempt has been made to correct the problem of higher contributions and charges for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the falling birth rate has the well-known impact on the economic growth of a nation, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policy, the example of Singapore also shows unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to achieve that not so many small apartments are built.
It already has an impact on the housing market.
The Urban Development Authority has begun to control the number of small apartments known as "shoe boxes" and to be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living area of 46 square meters and show a large sales success.
However, there is concern that they can promote the lifestyle of the single person and that they deter the construction companies from building large homes for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, Director General of the real estate company EL Developers, says that his "shoe boxes" can be sold much faster than larger residential units.
They are so popular, and the units are sold out by days and even weeks faster than the larger residential units.
This leads them to be much better for our cash flow.
However, it admits that the new standards give more clear guidance to developers who were previously put in place obstacles if they wanted to build too many small housing units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city state.
Even if these new rules could pave the way for an increase in national birth rates, talks with the Singapore people working in the financial district will show that they will not have a major impact.
"People are strongly stressed, the apartments and also the education are expensive, so it is being postponed by many" says a young manager.
The kids can get others.
"For me it is important to have my own money and time" says another, about twenty years old man.
Men and women lead their careers, the stress and the costs of ownership and education as reasons why they cannot have children.
That is why Singapore has the last word when it comes to having children - the government can still do so much.
The offline private offline is online private
Privacy
According to the dictionary, this is the property of private or "the area of private life where you are entitled to protection from any kind of interference."
What is private for someone under 16 years old?
How is this definition applied to its everyday life and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he poses when he announces situations on the Internet that he would not share in real life?
El Periódico interviewed five young people aged between 10 and 15 who are often on the net.
In four of the cases they linked the term to "something very personal" at personal level and "to the password and user" when they applied it to the social networks.
"My deepest secrets I wouldn't announce in a post" says the 10-year-old Jorge trying to explain the meaning of "private" in websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger where he has been holding accounts for two years.
"These are very confidential secrets, my mother may know them, but not the whole world," he confirms.
On FB I upload beautiful pictures or pictures of games.
I also spend my time with acquaintances.
"I wouldn't share a photo that's not mine, or someone who makes the fool" he says.
The boy is aware that it is wrong to publish obscene photos, of naked, of crimes, or to write offensive or violent comments.
Jorge assures to know 35 friends he has in FB and nine followers in Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
Including the mother who has the password to one of the accounts.
I joined Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if anyone will answer me, I'll just upload them" he adds.
"The social networks are entertaining, I can speak quickly with relatives in the distance or with friends" he says.
Asked he replies that he would never accept an invitation from an unknown.
Even if someone liked him a stranger, he would ignore this.
The case of the 14-year-old José is different.
The teenager has user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask. In Ask he admits to 20 of the people he has added to his friend's list.
"That doesn't scare me because we have something in common, for example music," he says.
According to the boy, no one has made any comments or asked him for his address or phone number.
"If someone pressures me or asks for it from me, I'll just remove it from my user account" he admits.
José came to Ask after reading a recommendation in Twitter.
The boy's experience is not unknown, which is known today as cyberbullying.
A friend's acquaintance was blackmailed in a social network.
They threatened him and asked for money.
"He never knew who it was," he assures.
According to José, the victim didn't close the user account.
"He only did it privately."
Then he explains a number of steps to configure a user account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yeah, I'd do that if he wasn't sympathetic to me or I'd like to wipe one out of him.
"But I know this is cyberbullying" he explains.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, teacher of English with university degree in education and learning, believes that in order to orient children and young people, it must be understood that it is the purpose of social networks to inform.
"The Internet was created as a medium for searching for information; with the appearance of these pages the game rules have changed," she says.
Porras explained that the academic Marc Prensky, owner of a master title in pedagogy at the University of Yale and author of the work "Digital Natives and Immigrants."
The digital natives are they, the children and young people who have grown up with this technology.
"We are the digital immigrants to teach them where we are still learning" he says.
He explains that this is a complex issue, "because we ask them to have a defined criterion on what may be spread, published or said, at an age where the maturity is not sufficient."
"They should also be electoral if it is most important for them to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach children and young people what privacy is to ask them questions that make them think.
"To tell you not to do it doesn't work," he says.
Porras then calls some possibilities: there are things you wouldn't tell a stranger. Then why do you do it on the Internet?
Or: Would you like to publish a photo of you like that you published by a friend?
Do you know what the others are publishing about you?
Have you asked the other people for permission before you have labelled photos of celebrations?
And one more question: Does everyone have to know what you're doing at any moment?
Another point is to give them to understand that they have to act online as they do offline.
It's the same rules.
"Someone outside the Internet is acting with respect, silence and other principles, and the same must apply to social networks," he explains.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary school teachers and educational counsellors, commented that it is essential that parents read the guidelines of social networks carefully.
If they understand all sections, they have solid foundations to talk to their children about the importance of opening one user account on the Internet.
"For example, the age, or what you can share or publish" he explains.
According to Guardia, the children must be reminded of the lesson "You should not speak to strangers."
Completion of the UNASURA Summit without publication of the Lima Declaration
The sixth summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (UNASURS) ended today in Peru without publication of the Lima Declaration, which was announced before and should theoretically be signed by the seven present governments.
Efe repeatedly tried to obtain access to the signed document at the VI. Ordinary meeting of the Heads of State and Government of the Unasur. Sources in the State and Presidential Chancellor initially informed that they would pass it on after the clause, but then stated that it would be published on the website of the Peruvian Government at some time.
On questions relating to the text, they indicated that the content was presented to the press by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, in brief statements.
Journalists' access to information on the summit was limited at any time.
During the day in the press room only the image of the presidential meeting was transferred without sound with the message "private session, limited audio."
The few information circulated among journalists was received by the press speakers of some of the unasure governments present at the meeting, but not by the Peruvian press speaker.
The only document published during the day was the list of participating presidents, which caused discomfort among the hundreds of journalists from different national and international media who called for more information.
After that, the Peruvian Presidential Office sent the media an e-mail with the "Final Declaration" of the summit, but it was the Declaration of Humala and not the official document for the conclusion of the Summit.
Last October, Peru was the host of the III. Summit of South America - Arab States (ASPA), and even at this occasion, despite the pressing invitation by the press, the so-called Lima Declaration, which had been announced before, was not published as much.
On the official website of the ASPA you can convince yourself that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities stressed that the information systems were available for journalists, but they limited access to information to a large extent.
The summit also ended with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to adopt a judgment of the Hague Court resolving a border conflict between the two countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would adopt the decision of the IGH, which starts on Monday in The Hague, in the process of initiating the Lima against Santiago to listen to both sides.
"We will follow and execute the judgment on the differences that we are currently presenting to the International Court of Justice," said Humala together with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile was, is and remains a country that respects international laws, seeks peaceful solutions to disputes, concludes agreements and submits itself to international courts," added Piñera and greeted Humala with a hand pressure in front of the flags of both countries.
The confirmation by both presidents that they would be subjected to the IGH was made after Colombia, after a decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, which considered it to be a serious mistake, had brought an action against the Bogotá Agreement, in which it agreed to be subject to the judgments of this international court.
At the summit the Presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner, were present.
Paraguay, who has been excluded from the Unasur since 2011 after his president Fernando Lugo was suspended, did not attend the meeting.
The host President Ollanta Humala opened the talks in the morning and ended the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The head of the state has left the final document, in which it announced that 16 decisions were taken and that 31 projects between the South American countries have been set for a total investment of 17 billion dollars.
On the decisions taken, he said that the countries of the Unasur will "take important steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, which we will extend the decisions on residence rights."
He informed that measures would be taken to "improve cooperation in the fight against urban uncertainty and organised transnational crimes, as well as measures to improve access to drugs and to the Internet at low prices in all areas of South America and to act jointly and efficiently in the event of natural disasters."
With the crisis in Europe, "economic consolidation (in Latin America) must not take triumphant trains, but should help to expand our production performance and show our peoples a better future," Humala added.
"We have decided to give priority to a number of 31 emblematic projects to improve the spatial links in South America and especially in rural and border areas... and thus unite our countries and open up new economic forms," said the Peruvian President in a read statement.
Among these projects were also five Peruvian, which were located on the cross axes of his territory from the coast to Brazil, and two of which were to provide a better connection with Ecuador, although he did not give any further details.
The final document also referred to the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve for its resumption in the Union of South American nations," which it is currently excluded from.
The need for Latin America to remain an integrated region for prosperity and peace and with good neighbourhood relations was another aspect highlighted at the summit.
In this sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before his participation in the regional meeting, that on Saturday in Mexico he expected a meeting with his opposition to Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, to treat the maritime conflict respectfully after a judgment of the IGH which Bogotá questioned.
"Perhaps I will meet with President Daniel Ortega tomorrow (Saturday)," said Santos.
"We will all check these ways - they are not exclusive, and the agreement with Nicaragua also requires talks with Nicaragua," he stressed.
"I hope to be able to tell President Ortega that we will treat this matter as civilized and respectfully as possible," added Santos.
Santos and Ortega would meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they intend to be present in the new President of that country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
As part of the summit, the Defence Ministers of the Block also met in advance to adopt the 2013 Action Plan, which aims to strengthen dialogue and consensus on the defence of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, although the latter country is currently excluded.
Peru is chaired at the time of the regional block.
"South America must learn to integrate citizens," Rafael Correa says
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, today confirmed that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal, with "South America can actually learn something from Europe."
Correa, who attended the Sixth Summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which took place in Lima, told the state television in Peru that Europeans "killed themselves in the Second World War and in other conflicts" and "today practically a country of fathers."
In this sense, he defended the project of creating a South American citizenship that promotes the UNASURS member states.
"The free movement of citizens and workers must be achieved in all South American countries, as is already the case in the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors that seek to return to the past," he warned.
President Ecuadors also endorsed the reorganisation of the Organisation of American States (OEA) under the preamble to reduce the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States and to take account of those signatories to the San José Convention on Human Rights.
Those who teach never commit themselves to anything, and in return, we always sign everything to the South Americans.
"It is incomprehensible that the InterAmerican Commission for Human Rights has its seat in Washington and is financed by the United States," he explained as a reference to the political asylum Ecuador granted to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa assured that he did not regret this decision because it had not betrayed his principles but had complied with his "deep democratic values and views on human rights."
He added that at that time there had been "justified assumptions that Assange would be delivered to a third country and that its procedure would not be complied with."
He also criticized the Swedish judiciary who asked him to conduct an interrogation on his territory for a alleged sexual offence, while "Swedish case law allows this through a video conference that could have been carried out through the Ecuadors Ecuadors' Embassy in London."
Correa explained that there was a risk that Assange's health and mental condition would be affected.
"Since he has been in our message, I have not spoken to him, but the Ambassador has informed me that he has a light problem with the lungs, but not a serious problem," said Chief of State Ecuadors.
However, there is a danger that he may take physical and mental damage because he was trapped in a narrow room and could not perform physical exercises on the outside.
"This would affect the health of every human being," he added.
Correa stated that the solution for the asylum granted to Assange in the Ecuadors' Embassy in London since June was the provision of a free letter that he could travel to Ecuador, and that this was in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe. He stressed that there had been talks with London to find a solution for the locked founder of WikiLeaks.
We are not dealing with human rights, we are not using this word in this case, but there have been constant talks.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe, because the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Garzón, leads a number of procedures to various European bodies," he said.
And "if Britain grants this free letter tomorrow, I think this is done."
And if Sweden consulted Mr Assange at the Ecuadors' Embassy in London or via Skype, as it allowed Swedish case law and was done in other cases, the problem would be resolved.
Correa used the opportunity to confirm himself as a defender of the freedom of the press and said that what he does not tolerate is "the mediacity, the evil intention and the lies that discourage the freedom of expression."
"The biggest enemies of freedom of the press are not the evil and perverse politicians, but bad journalists who strive for profit and blackmail," he said.
In this sense, he welcomed the fact that Ecuador was no longer dominated by such journalists "and not by the bankers or hegemonic and speedy bourgeois countries," and took precedence that he would "deepen the revolution in order to continue the path in this right direction" when re-elected.
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto against Paraguay in the Unasur at least until his next elections, arguing that the organism must "remain hard and not allow any opportunism and no state strike as legally disguised," because it "destroyed the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay."
President Ecuadors also believes that the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the judgment of the Hague International Court, which preferred the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua to negotiate the maritime borders between the two countries, is "absolutely justified."
At present, this judgment is not being implemented.
It is a problem between a South and a Central American state.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in pursuit of a common path.
They must be treated in full so that they can be overcome and looked forward.
He also trusted a good conclusion of the dispute on the sea borders between Peru and Chile before the same Court of Justice and said that "it is right for Latin America to call international bodies if both countries undertake to adopt the judgment, even if it is very difficult."
With regard to the possibility that he will be a candidate for the next presidential elections in Ecuador to achieve his third mandate in a row, he stated that he sees this possibility "with much optimism and joy, although it is sometimes very difficult."
Correa assured that if he lost the elections in February 2013, he would withdraw from political life.
I have never personally been interested in power, but under the unjust circumstances as in Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
"My political movement had the faith that it was me that guaranteed this probable victory, so I must fulfil this responsibility," he said.
If I were to win, it would be my last period as president, then I would withdraw from public life.
This also applies if we lose.
"This is decided," he explained.
Correa also referred to the treatment of the health problems of the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I just spoke to the vice president of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, who told me that he had travelled there for a planned routine treatment and that he would be expected to travel back to Cuba after the election campaign.
"It does not in any case mean a recurrence in the state of health of President Chávez," he commented.
The Ecuadorian Head of State took part today in Lima at the 6th summit of the Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASURS), which was completed with the call for greater regional integration in order to ensure sustainable progress, equality and security.
The cause of death due to AIDS is a late detection today
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed the test result: HIV-positive.
"It was like a bomb hit," he says about the moment he received the diagnosis that the doctor tried to "weaken" without any detectable success.
He hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his disease alone and began to inform himself about it; and this with such an effort that he just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), which he came to after several fights in 1994.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was difficult to imagine at the beginning of the 1990s when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more Stigmata.
At that time, even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye, "because it led to a dead end."
At that time AIDS was synonymous of death.
Today it is possible to survive this syndrome also with quality of life.
However, there are still many people in the clinic who do not know about their illness and where the virus has already done damage and has exhausted their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the appearance of AIDS in the world, i.e. after the first reported cases, "means the great success today that survival of a patient taking the treatment in time and the survival of the general population is exactly the same," said the head of the HCG's HIV unit, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, who said that this information had been supported by a renowned scientific publication in April this year.
The expert on infectious diseases and HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008 scientists concluded that AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of impaired immune system of individuals at the beginning of treatment, and that those who are not drug-dependent have greater opportunities: up to 30 years when counting 200 CD4 and 50 years when counting 500 CD4.
Simply said, the above points mean that those who receive the diagnosis HIV-positive at the age of 25, in this sense "can become easily 75 years old as long as they are under control," said this expert.
In order to correct this progress, it must be recalled that the Mexicans' life expectancy today is on average 76 years.
Even if mortality has decreased significantly in recent years (in Mexico, the number of people dying of AIDS has decreased from 6.678 cases in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (ONUSIDA's annual report), it is still right that 60 percent of the patients included in the national database have died since AIDS appeared.
Only in Jalisco died 255 people in 2011, and until May of this year there are 187 deaths, but it is assured that there has been universal access to antiretroviral medicines since 2005.
So why do people still die of it?
- I don't think the problem is access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and this is how it is in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years, we have had no supply problems with the drugs. The problem is that people come in far-advanced condition because they do not know their infections, i.e. in very late stages of the disease.
He makes a beating statement: "Nine out of ten patients come to us if they already have a accompanying infection. In order to influence global mortality, more early diagnosis is required, so that all people in whom this is necessary have to be offered massive detection tests."
This proposal is agreed by the experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (State Committee on AIDS Prevention in Jalisco) and also by the patients like Fabrizio who had carried out his test at a private laboratory, for the only reason that it had made a friend of him who, despite his young age, was already in the AIDS phase and even had the Kaposi sarkom (a cancer-like tumour), which is one of the usual complications.
Everything's different when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're gonna die and don't want to hear anything.
"If I have to die already, I'd rather crash three times," they say in my case.
The change was to improve, I feed myself well, drive sports and take the medication.
Today his parents only know he had cancer.
I live a normal life, just like everyone else.
"I work, do a lot, have an active but responsible sex life, I respect my health and the other person," says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO to animate with his testimony those who are afraid today in the context of the world AIDS day.
The sooner they know whether they are HIV-positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how to live responsibly like all people.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the Ladentic
Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, who has accepted the issue of HIV, explains that there are great holes between the health programmes and the simple citizen.
And the most important thing is prevention.
In the specific places "the distribution of condoms has actually been increased; in the past they were delivered individually, now they give us packages with hundreds of pieces, which is good, but there are still people who have no access to a condom," he said.
Young people are among the risk zones for new infections.
"What do you need?" is a widespread question of social workers, guidance staff in schools, apprentices and the health system that young people do not want to deprive themselves of, the correspondent assured.
He proposed reorientation of this inefficient distribution; the condoms should be located not only behind the laundry, but in equipment in public toilets of facilities often visited by young people.
It is not to be promoted by promiscity.
They should not be paid the beer and motel, as governor Emilio González answered the question of whether preservatives would be distributed under his administration.
"Sexuality does not look like this; it is best to bring the condoms closer to those who are already engaged in sexual activity," he pointed it out.
Key data from Jalisco
There are 13.435 cumulative cases (12.158 AIDS and 1.317 HIV).
The state is nationally located in the fourth place of new and cumulative AIDS cases, and in the 13th place in relation to HIV.
92% of infections are done by sexual intercourse, 6% by blood and 2% by perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV because for each registered case there are 4 or 5 people who do not know.
After the United States Court of Appeal has confirmed a judgment which does not recognise the restructure of Vitro Group liabilities achieved through a trade contest in Mexico, an unhealthy precedent is created for each national company with branches in neighbouring countries with payment problems.
It could therefore be said that in the country of stars and stripes, in contravention of international agreements, the procedures for survival of the companies that allow Mexican laws are not valid.
In practice, the recognition of the judgment given on 15 June by Judge Harlin Hale at the court in Bancarrotas for the northern district of Texas means that Mexican companies are liable to seize their property beyond the Bravo River.
However, the decision opens doors to the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico to call the United States Supreme Court for three inconsistencies.
While the judge of the case points out that creditors must be subject to the United States' bankruptcy law, the Fifth Circuit Appeal Court, headed in New Orleans, first states that the main proceedings are the commercial competition dealt with in Mexico.
The first point would mean that international cooperation in insolvency procedures for companies with a cross-border profile is not known.
In fact, for this purpose, the United Nations Model Law for the Unification of International Trade Law was established, with the American Law Institute being set up as an arbitrator.
Second, the judgment states that without the votes of the companies following the recognition of liabilities in the bankruptcy of Vitro's branches with their parent company, the necessary majority would not have been reached for the restructuring of the liabilities.
However, this possibility is recognised by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro is not the first case in which this scheme has been approved.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities have been confirmed by the Instituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles (Federal Institute for Trade Competition).
It is also true that after deducting the votes of the branches, the creditors of Vitro, the creditors who complained against Vitro at the courts of the United States, i.e. the Geier funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, had not reached a majority.
The vote would have been 45 per cent against 37 per cent.
This is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro is responsible for his difficult situation from 2008 onwards in the context of the major economic crisis in the United States which gave the country a hit.
For this reason, the González Sada family is opposed to the same appeal court in order to ensure that the vote takes place in plenary, that is to say by all the judges, because only three of them voted.
If this is not accepted, the Cerciorare appeal requesting the review of the proceedings by a higher authority shall be lodged by the Supreme Court of the United States.
The serious issue of this case is that the court left aside a document sent by the Mexican Government under the Figura amicus curiae (friend of the court), which describes the procedure carried out by Vitro under the Commercial Competition Act, and which points out that it had strictly complied with the agreements signed by both countries in order to comply with Chapter 15 of the United States Insolvency Act.
It is also pointed out that the country has subjected itself to the principles of the United Nations Commission for International Trade, i.e. the rules laid down for cases of cross-border insolvency that guarantee the equality of debtors and creditors.
Double carambola: a hit for Vitro and for the country.
General balance sheet
After the announcements by the Mexican aviation trade unions against the former owner Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who is accused of decepting a deceptive administration, have finally made progress by Asociación Sindical de Pilos Aviadores.
The request by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has now submitted a criminal proceedings against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is accused of disability to justice.
After that, the supervisory authority systematically refused to inform the head of the Republic of a transaction carried out by the entrepreneur in order to withdraw Pesos from Bank IXE's trust account F / 589 on the name of Mexicana de Aviación 198 million.
This appropriation is intended to cover the purchase of shares of Administradora Profesional de Hoteles (professional hotel management).
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main operator of the hotel chain Posadas.
Dragon Mart is surrounded
At a weekend meeting at a forum of the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmental protectors, academics, entrepreneurs and general members of civil society decided to create a broad front to resist the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
As you know, we are talking about a huge sales and sales centre in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean with products from the country beyond the wall, supplemented by a residential area for the staff of 150 companies.
In advance, Canacintra (the national Chamber of Processing Industry) has reached the merger of the governors in the south-east to resist the monumental institution, which partially destroyed protected areas and represents the mother of all the industrial threats.
ACTA is dead
Because the government of a Senate's request to explain under what conditions and circumstances the Mexican ambassador in Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known under the English abbreviation ACTA, has already been archived in accordance with the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property.
As you know, these measures were taken, although the Senate had not considered the possibility because he considered them a violation of freedom of expression in social networks.
Homex in the long term
In striving to pay long-term liabilities without affecting short-term liabilities, the construction company brings Homex stock certificates to the market of over 500 million pesos.
The issuance is the first of four equal emissions promising interest payments every 28 days.
Establishment of Competival
Created from the companies NYCE, e-Quálity and Kernet, leading companies of information technology, a group of companies under the name Competival, whose purpose is the service market of software clusters in Central and South America.
The corresponding investment amounts to over 1.5 billion dollars.
Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The world bummer of the basketball, Héctor "Hetin" Reyes, was connected to basket sports for more than 60 years and has touched the whole world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have as large a spiritual collection of the history of the country's basketball as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Before he was tied to the wheelchair by a stroke in 2008, Rexes was part of this sport for six years, whether as a player of lower classes, players of the first national league, delegates and head of the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or president of the Basketball Association.
"I have spent my life in basketball many hats, even several at the same time, when I was president of the BSN, head of the national team and president of the association in the 1990s," Reyes remembered when he visited Primera Hora at his house in Bayamón, where he lived with Isabel, his loyal wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes does not exaggerate this statement.
The walls of his house are decorated and testified with photos and memories of his long career.
Bayamón in the heart
The most emotional memories are those who remember his time at the Vaqueros from the mid-50s as a player until 1982, where he celebrated his 15-year anniversary as co-manager or manager of the club.
"These were my best years that I enjoyed most because I have been part of eight championships of the Vaqueros since 1967, whether it was as managing director, co-manager or coach.
There were many years of fulfillment, including the five championships together from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to a championship in 1981, the year of Jerome Mincy's debut at BSN.
From then on, "Cuco" took over Ortiz, who was a very good administrator, "says Reyes.
I remember Gene Bartow, who worked here as a coach and was employed at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me: "I have a very powerful and 2 m big player.
Do you want him? "
And this was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico ever had.
Bartow then recommended the freelance specialist Raymond Gausse, who was a citizen and one of our best throwers.
I remember how he said that if Mincy had allowed a championship for Bayamon, Gausse would take care of another one.
The championship of the Vaqueros with Gausse was granted to him, but already out of a distance, because he was already at the top of the association in 1988.
At that time he preferred to enjoy his executions and those of Mincy in the national team.
I remember the first time we won against the United States at the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico.
After that, the 1990 World Championship, where we placed the fourth place, which should have actually been bronze if not this Canadian arbitrator, who made us repeat the last move for the second time, said Reyes.
Was this group of World Championship 1990 the best national team you've ever seen?
She is one of the best, as well as those who won the Dream team at the 2004 Olympiade.
But my favorite is the team of panAmerican games in Cuba in 1991, where we won gold and offered a fight to the US team, like when they won against us at the World Championship Bronze.
In 1990, the young players (Javier), "Toñito" Colón and "James Carter," the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be there because of a knee defeat, were involved in the team, not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and Piculín.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of personalities, but with which we won a gold medal and made us very happy, was the one of the 1995 pre-Olympic tournament in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a substitute for the blocked players because of the events at the PanAmerican Games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold medal against any forecast.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
That was without a doubt Piculín Ortiz.
His numbers at international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated on this level as Piculín.
And this, without taking into account his career in the different league in which he played.
Who was the best coach from Puerto Rico?
This is a difficult question.
We had a series of good trainers like Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
I like Leo Arill's work from the boys.
What do you think is the best thing you've achieved in the association?
I was part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 to 1995, which included the BSN at the beginning of the 1990s up to 17 teams in a season.
What else do you have to do?
There are things I would have introduced, such as the regionalisation of the lower categories.
That the boys in Ponce, for example, only play in their territory and only meet in national playoffs on teams from other corners of the island.
Today the children do unnecessarily many trips and games.
At least I see the result of the required training and courses for trainers, table officers and arbitrators.
I'm proud of that.
What are you doing today?
I like listening to music, watching videos of music of my time in YouTube, enjoying my grandchildren and sometimes I go to a basketball game.
And of course I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who was always at my side.
Larry Hagman is dead.
Larry Hagman was born on 21 September 1931 in Forth Worth (Texas) and became famous worldwide with his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R." In the television series "Dallas," where he played a sceptical, homecoming and manipulating businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the oil magnat J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of the Habgier of the 1980s, is dead.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas," died on Friday afternoon due to cancer complications according to a family press release to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., producer of "Dallas."
"Larry was back in his beloved birthtown of Dallas, where he once again played the iconic role that he liked most," said the family.
The family of Larry and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the celebrations of the harvest dance party.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original and follow-up series, was at Hagman when he died at the hospital of Dallas, said her publisher Jeffrey Lane.
He made all the joy that knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived life in full trains," said Gray in a communication.
Hagman was diagnosed in 1992 with liver cirrhosis, and he admitted that he had been drinking a lot over years.
In 1995, a malignant tumour was detected in his liver, and he underwent a transplant.
In the years before "Dallas," Hagman was known as a nice type in the years 1965 to 1970 with the Sitcom "Enchanting Jeannie" of the TV station NBC.
There he played the astronaut Tony Nelson, whose life is put on his head when he meets an attractive "Dschinn" (played by Barbara Eden) who will live at his home.
He was also an actor of two comedians that were broadcast only for a short time, such as The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and Here We Go Again (ABC, 1973).
His cinematographic work included well-evaluated roles in "The Group," "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors."
But it was his masterful interpretation of the adorable J.R. that made Hagman a superstar.
The dramatic series of the television chain CBS via the Ewing clan and other figures in their surroundings was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertisement "Who shot J.R.?," which should create the expectation for an episode of emotions where the figure of Hagmann was almost killed, led to an international speculation, and millions of dollars were betted in weddings.

When the answer was announced in a chapter in November 1990, it was seen by an average of 41 million spectators who transformed "Dallas" into the second most viewed entertainment programme since the end of "MASH" 1983, which had 50 million spectators.
It was Kristin who had shot the brother-in-law of J.R. (interpreted by Mary Crosby).
J.R. had pregnant her and threatened to represent her as a prostitute if she did not leave the city. But others also had reasons to want him dead.
Hagman interpreted the role of Ewing as a corrupt, irreplaceable man with a charismatic smile: a deceitful businessman and unfaithful husband who sought to have his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) depicted.
"I know what to say on J.R. 's tombstone," said Hagman in 1988.
It should be called "Here is the honorable citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only business he didn't win.
Victoria Principal, co-actress of the original series, remembered Hagman on Friday as a "huge personality on and outside the screen."
He is unforgettable and irreplaceable for millions of worlds and remains in our hearts for those who were lucky to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success in the TNT television channel.
The recording of five chapters for the second season was completed, and a sixth chapter was just rotated, the transmitter informed.
From Warner or TNT there was no immediate explanation on how Hagmann's loss would be treated in the series.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of the actress and singer Mary Martin, who played classical works like "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan."
Martin was still a young woman when she got Larry during her marriage with attorney Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the stage in New York at the beginning of the 50s, and then served in the Air Force in England from 1952 to 1956.
There he met the young designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities have their residence.
In 2001 he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life."
"I didn't write anything I thought it could harm anyone or affect him in any way," said the Associated Press at that time.
After the liver transplant, he used to donate liver and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist anxious patients.
"I advise them, give them courage, I meet them when their operations are ahead and afterwards," he explained in 1996.
I want to give them some comfort, such as "don't worry, it's a little uncomfortable the first time, but you'll be fine."
He was also opposed to smoking and participated in several campaigns.
Beginning of the courses that study the "End of the World"
Every week, students examine apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, virus and germs and global warming.
Every semester, when the religious professor decided to take a course on the end of the world, he knew that he had an irreversible fishing hook: the end of the "long reverse counting" of the Maya calendar on 21 December, of which many people believed it was the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what to expect him in the next two months: the devastating hurricane Sandy, some of whom have called "Deudarmaggedon," as well as an increasing conflict involving Israel, the place where Christian theorists believe that the Apocalypse begins.
"I did not notice that this will be the most apocalyptic semester ever existed" said Charmé this week to students at the University of Rutgers-Camden (New Jersey).
If someone analyzes what happened today in the world as if we were thirty days away from it, this would be a really good period.
And he recalls that the bad thing is good for those with apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not the only professor who offers courses about the "end of the world" this semester, which should actually be the last in history.
In Temple, Professor Barry Vacker gives the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World."
Every week, students examine apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, virus and germs and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas spread over time," he said, as well as the way in which hypothetical scenarios are offered that lead to a certain human behaviour.
If nuclear material comes into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, students analyzed films with apocalyptic content and studied how they could be compared to real life.
"I have tried to inform the students about what is possible, probably, credible and impossible," said Beautiful.
On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, the professor of Latin American history Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, a fascinating professor of art history and anthropology, formed a team to offer a course with the simple term "The End of the World."
"We do not accept 2012 so that we always keep the option to rehold the course, in case the world does not fall," said Restall.
In spite of the "upcoming decline," students have to study, create projects and participate in statutory audits.
In Penn State the statutory examination is carried out on the eve of the Apocalypse, so students have no other chance than "to continue working until the night where the world allegedly ends," said Restall.
The courses were very popular.
"In two hours there were no more seats" said Restall about his course for students with a high average, which was filled with 35 students.
For a week before semester we received e-mails from students who asked if seats were still free.
Students on their part assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It is fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in Rutgers Camden for religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic sect- or religious mentality is actually just a matter of comfort or its lack.
The 25-year-old student Will Wekesa declared for psychology and nursing to have seen all apocalyptic movies.
"I have never heard of a class where this is taught," he said.
I'm enjoying it.
But none of the students questioned - and less one professor - declared to believe in the last date of the 21st December.
"Our first project dealt with the prophecy of Mayas, and in certain ways we discredit them," said Julie Zeglen, student last year in Temple, 21 years old and from West Chester.
The Mayas never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key point in the calendar, said Restall.
However, he notes that in Western society there is an apocalyptic fear that leads back several centuries when people responded to changes in their surroundings with the prediction of the end of the world.
The Internet has increased these speculations.
"Otherwise people don't think that way," he says.
This is mainly the case in the English speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a religious professor of the University of La Salle, who teaches the Philippines this year, quickly answers the question of whether he would know a course there about the "end of the world."
"The Philippines do not participate at the end of the world," he wrote as a sign of an exception to a higher authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall pointed out that over the years many days were spoken by the last court, and said that if nothing happens on 21 December, "people immediately think of a new date" or philosopher that 21 December is the beginning of a seven-year period that the end of the world would be.
Students and professors take this date easy.
Several said that they want to go to celebrations about "the end of the world."
"Maybe I'll call some friends so we can laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old student for communication.
