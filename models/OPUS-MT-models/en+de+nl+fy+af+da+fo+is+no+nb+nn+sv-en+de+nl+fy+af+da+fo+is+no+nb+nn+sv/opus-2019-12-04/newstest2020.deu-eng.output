Fire in French Chemical Works Deleted
The great fire in a chemical plant that is particularly dangerous in the North French city of Rouen has been erased. This shared the prefecture of Normandy on Friday. The fire was broken out the night on Thursday. No one was injured in the incident. The fire was in use with about 200 extinguishers.
The fire could be stopped
Anrainers were called to not leave their houses. Buildings around 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens stayed closed on Thursday. In the chemical factory on the banks of the Seine are produced additives for lubricating materials. The factory belongs to the company Lubrizole of US-billionaire Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called Seveso Directive of the EU, which requires particularly strict safety requirements.
In the factory, around 400 people work. The chemical factory has already provided headlines in the past - about when in 2013, through a leak the gas methanthiol depleted and the environment smoked widely after coarse eggs. In 2015, after an operating accident, about 2,000 litres of mineral oil fled into the city's sewage system.
Woman quit her job to search 57 days for her missing puppy
For two months a woman from Washington was looking for her missing dog - and announced her job extra for it. The seven-year-old Border Collie was leaving the hotel room during a short stay in Montana. 57 days missing from the dog every lead - but Carole King did not give up.
"It was terrible. I got bad," said Carole King to the "Daily Inter Lake." She and her husband had left dog Katie in the hotel room while they went to dinner. When they returned to the hotel, Katie had disappeared. They were looking for the animal but without success.
Donner had put dog in panic
In the hope that Katie could stay somewhere in the hotel, Carole King went to the reception. "The employee says," She left about four, four and a half hours ago, "Carole King remembers" Daily Inter Lake. "When the automatic entrance door opened, Katie ran out immediately. Probably a loud thunder had put the dog in panic.
With flyers and calls in Facebook groups, the Kings were looking for their beloved dog. But days became weeks. "I never gave up. I never lost hope," said Carole King to "Daily Inter Lake," who announced her job as postal employee to continue their search for Katie.
"The tears flushed"
57 days after Katies disappeared, Carole King got a call: a man reported and said that Katie was in his courtyard. But when King arrived there, Katie was gone again. She was searching for the neighborhood and suddenly her dog stood under a tree. "I just hug her. I didn't want to let her go," King remembered "Daily Inter Lake." The tears fled. "People stopped in their vehicles, stepped out and hug us. I think the whole neighborhood knew that we had found them."
Losses at the Federal Defense: Machine guns disappear without a trace
Friday, September 27th, 2019
Six machine guns of type MG3 have still disappeared.
In recent years, the Federal Defense has lost numerous weapons and tens of thousands of shots of ammunition. Among them are three machine guns. In most cases, the remains are unclear. The opposition speaks of a "scary" extent.
With the Federal Defence, weapons and ammunition are constantly disappearing - many of them so far, without a trace. Since the beginning of 2014, the troop has recorded the loss of 39 weapons, 39 arms parts and almost 20,000 ammunition shots. This is from a classified list of the Federal Ministry of Defence, which the editorial network Germany reports about.
According to the paper from the office of Defence State Secretary Peter Tauber from the CDU, two weapons, one piece of gun and 3474 ammunition have been returned. The still missing weapons and arms parts include six MG3-type machine guns, 11 G3-type guns, four G36-type G36-type guns, six P8-type signal guns and two P8-type guns. In addition, 30 MG3-type guns are missing.
The extent of arms and ammunition loss at the Federal Defense was "scary," said the Left Federal Day Commissioner Martina Renner. This is all the more true, since in the course of investigations little has been found again. The Left politician spoke of a "foolish balance." Renner criticised that the listing was not recognizable whether the disappeared ammunition also found those who were condemned in connection with the investigations against the state of this ammunition under terror suspicion.

Oil tanker "Stena Impero" left Iranian port
More than two months after being established by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" left the port of Bandar Abbas today Friday. As ship observation data from Refinitiv showed, the tanker moved and left the Iranian port. Port Rashid was indicated as a target port in the United Arab Emirates.
The tanker had actually been released by the Iranian government on Monday, but he stayed first in Iranian waters. From the shipping company it was said that they wanted to wait for an official message from Tehran.
On July 19, the "Stena Impero" was brought up by the Iranian Revolutionary Gardens in Hormuz's seabed under the accusation of having violated security provisions, but it was suspected that Iran would react to the controversial temporary establishment of an Iranian oil tanker before the Gibraltar belonging to the United Kingdom.
The road of Hormuz is one of the most important sea streets in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. A large part of the global oil port is shipped through the sea narrow. The tension in the region has been greatly exacerbated in recent months. Trade shipping has been dragged into the conflict between the US and Iran. There have been several incidents with tankers and drones.
Merkel appreciates the courage of people in the peaceful revolution
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel appreciated the commitment of the people in the GDR who went on the road 30 years ago in the peaceful revolution. In the autumn of 1989, brave citizens had pushed the former GDR regime, Merkel said at a festive act of the Thüringer CDU Group on the coming day of German unity in Erfurt. The Chancellor reminded, among other things, of the occupation of the Stasi Central. "State security was taken to horror," she said.
Musk strives for extradition record
Teslas Quartal may hold record. Despite the extradition tree, there were last losses in the electric car group.
New York.Tesla Chief Elon Musk has given his electric car company with the prospect of new record numbers strong momentum on the stock market. "We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote an e-mail to Tesla employees published by the industry blog Electrek.
The demand was strong, so that Tesla could book 110000 orders, it continued in Musks newsletter. The challenge was to bring the cars quickly to the customer. To do so, Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible to the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla shares went out of trade with a plus of over six percent. The course has not been so strong for nearly four months. In the second quarter Tesla had delivered well 95000 cars and thus reached its best value.
Musk needs records to achieve its high goals. 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360000 to 400000 cars. To do so, in the current and coming quarter year, there are six-digit numbers. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is required, but here are the margins of profit. Despite the boom there were last losses.
Mystery solved: That's why we can't kick ourselves
A kind of brake in the big brain prevents people from kissing themselves. This found scientists from the Humboldt University in Berlin with the help of experiments in rats as they reported on Thursday night. Progress had also been made on the question of why children were so strongly opposed to kittling just to demand more.
Finally, it has also been shown why only the coming of a tickling hand triggered laughter before touching. This is located on a deep layer in the big brain, which already triggers laughter at the expectation of the tickle.
According to the data, previous research showed that rats react with "laughs" in the ultrasound area when they are tickled by people. This "laugh" is mediated by the part of the large brains which serve the central processing of the haptic perception.
Laughter is suppressed while self-touching
So far, it had been assumed that the brain could distinguish between self-touch and touch by others - that is why people cannot chuck themselves. However, the Berlin researchers now found in the experiments on the rats that laughter as well as the activity of the relevant area of the large brain rhino were suppressed during a self-touch. This was also the case when living beings purify themselves. During the foreign touch and kitchens by the scientists, however, the activity of the brain and the impulse were increased to laugh.
Passive, however, the self-touch and touch by others at the same time, the laughter is also suppressed. This suggests that the rat's brain cannot distinguish between self-touch and touch by others. The new insights suggested that people cannot peel themselves because self-touch activates a brake in the big brain.
The rats had also been trained to kick themselves. In doing so, they sometimes discontinued this initiation in the experiment early, showed escape behavior or horror rigidity. This ambivalence is similar to the behaviour of the children. The ambivalence of the kitzel is a behavioural reaction that is the same in rats and people.
Disaster: Large fire in French chemical plant deleted
The great fire in a chemical plant in the North French city of Rouen that is particularly dangerous has been deleted. This shared the prefecture of the Normandy of the news agency AFP on Friday. The fire had broken out in the night to Thursday.
According to government information, there should not have been any health hazardous substances. The samples taken give no reason to worry, as Prefect Pierre-André Durand said on Friday morning at a press conference. No one was injured in the incident. The fire department was in use with about 200 extinguishers.
Schools and kindergartens were closed
The residents were invited not to leave their houses. Buildings around 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens stayed closed on Thursday.

The chemical factory has already taken care of headlines in the past - about when in 2013, through a leak, the gas methanthiol depleted and the surrounding area smoked widely after rocky eggs. In 2015, after an operating accident, about 2000 litres of mineral oil fled into the city's sewage system.
Brexit: Johnson criticized by his own sister
The Prime Minister's sister commented on Boris Johnson's speech at the first sitting in Parliament after the withdrawal of the mandatory break on Wednesday night. The Prime Minister is threatening to lead the country on 31 October without an agreement from the EU, Brussels should not accept its requests for amendments to the Brexit agreement. However, how he wants to achieve this is unclear.
The Prime Minister said, "The best way to honor Jo Cox's remembrance and rejoin this country would have been to complete the EU's exit." Cox had been murdered by a right-wing extremist during the 2016 referendum campaign.
Remembrance to attacks of Oslo and Utöya will be revealed
More than eight years after the attacks in Oslo and Utöya with 77 deaths, a memorial is revealed in Norway on Saturday in honor of the victims. The monument "Iron Roses" (German: the iron roses) consists of about 1,000 iron roses. They remind you of the roses that had been taken by thousands of people in the days and weeks after the attacks before the Oslo Cathedral.
The project of the artists Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsrud is now to be disclosed in the same place - the roses were embroidered by people from all over the world, including survivors and families of the victims. For the opening are expected among other Crown Prince Haakon and Crown Princess Mette-Marit.
On July 22, 2011, the right-wing sterrorist Anders Behring Breivik initially lit a car bomb in the government district of Oslo and subsequently shot a dozen participants on the island of Utöya in a holiday camp of the Youth Organisation of the Socialist Labour Party. In total 77 people were killed during the attacks.
Iran releases British tankers
The UN General Discussion did not bring any solution to Iran's conflict. But now there is one problem less. The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" held in Iran could put back into the sea. It could be a puzzle in the peace plan of Iranian President Ruhani.
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero", held on the Hormus road in Iran since mid-July, is back in international waters. After the release by Iranian authorities, the ship is on its way to Dubai, as the shipping company Stena Bulk informed.
The "Stena Impero" has left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew is now driving for medical investigations to Dubai, said shipowner Erik Hånell. At noon the ship left the Iranian waters. "It is good to see that it is over," he said to the Swedish TV station SVT.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in London described the establishment of the ship as illegal. "This is part of a model of attempts to affect the freedom of the seas. We work with our international partners to maintain shipping and international law," said it in a communication on Friday.
The Iranian Revolutionary Guard had set the tanker on 19 July under the accusation of having failed to comply with the rules of the Law of the Sea in the Persian Gulf. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released in early September. The remaining 16 crew members are doing well in the circumstances, said Hånell. They would have acted professionally in the face of the difficult and relaxing situation in the past ten weeks. The shipowner now works to bring them back to their families as soon as possible.
The British government suspected a reaction to a similar incident in British Gibraltar behind the establishment of Stena Impero: there was a supertanker with oil from Iran that was intended for Syria in early July. According to the authorities, the delivery was against EU sanctions against the war country Syria. The British had received the reference to the ship from the United States.
Iran spoke of "piracy" and threatened with consequences. In the middle of August, the "Adrian Darya-1" was finally released. Suspects that it was an exchange business to get the "Stena Impero" rejected London vehement.
The Hormus road is one of the most important sea streets in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. A large part of the world's oil port is shipped through the sea narrow. The tension in the region has been greatly exacerbated in recent months. Trade shipping has been dragged into the conflict between the US and Iran. There have been several incidents with tankers and drones.
Behind the tensions between Tehran and Washington is the nuclear dispute between both countries. The Americans pretend to want to build nuclear weapons. Iran rejects this. In 2018, the United States had stepped out alone from the international nuclear agreement, which would prevent Iran from building a nuclear bomb and at the same time end its political and economic isolation. Since then, the US government has been pushing the leadership in Teheran with massive economic sanctions against the country in order to force a more rigorous and extended agreement. Iran has been opposed to the pressure so far.
Because of the dispute about Stena Impero and other incidents with tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil deposits in Saudi Arabia, the United States is working on a coalition for military protection of commercial ships in the region.
The Iranian President Hassan Ruhani had presented to the UN General Assembly in New York a plan for security and peace in the Hormus street. With the initiative "Coalition of hope" for the Persian Gulf, Iran, together with the Arab Gulf States and without foreign protectors, wanted to ensure the safety of shipping in the Persian Gulf.
India is building a better future with its protectionist economic policy.
India would actually be predestined to "war winner." In view of the penalties imposed by American President Donald Trump on Chinese producers, foreign producers in the People's Republic are forced to redispose. In a survey by the UBS, India is called one of the preferred alternatives. This has freely not only created with the uncertainties of the Chinese-American trade crimes, but also with a giant pool of young workers as well as an internal market of 1.3 billion consumers, India seems to be a major role to play in the world-wide production crisis.
But now India itself has come into Trump's focus. From the Haudegen in the White House denominated as "the Kingdom of Customs," America has withdrawn the trade favors for 2000 products in early June. The USA prohibitively accused India of high tariffs and demanding better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirits, motorcycles and other things.
On the world map of trade wars, the rivers with India are quite simply a side scene. Furthermore, America is also looking at the world's largest democracy through security glasses. Delhi and Washington combine the concern about China's power claims in the South Indian Ocean. Against this background, a salve of American sanctions against India is unlikely. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has just joined a second five-year term of office, is therefore likely to weigh safely.
However, the problem lies in another place: the empirically hardened thesis that open markets accelerate economic development has a severe situation in the Socialist Republic of India. Also under Modi. His reform player focuses mainly on the bureaucratic insanity that has been embroidered in the multination state for too long any entrepreneurial spirit. Companies are now receiving construction permits faster for buildings. They benefit from a better energy and transport infrastructure, and a more rigorous insolvency and bankruptcy law creates conditions for liquidation of apparent companies with high debt more quickly.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. In the first five modi years, in India, much has been turned to better. However, in trade policy, this does not apply. Of which, the National Conservative Government insisted on protecting internationally low-competitive companies from foreign suppliers, even created new barriers.
In the West, modes of the Nimbus of the energetic reformer, which renews its country economically radical. This impression is not least due to the fact that the charismatic prime minister knows only too well what vocabulary Western managers like. But in the heart of the "India First" lawyer never deprived of a protectionist economic policy, which prevents Indian companies from being forced to depart from anachronistic phrases and thus fit for global competition. Business members who survive thanks to the shocks of their industries are among the tribes of Modis nationalistic Bharata Janata party and clatching these short policies.
Issuing Jacques Chirac on Monday in Paris
The former French President Jacques Chirac is scheduled to be attended next week in Paris. The former head of the State will be buried on Monday at Montparnasse cemetery in the south of the French capital, the news agency AFP reported on the Chiracs family. The funeral will take place in the narrow family circle. For Sunday a public funeral was held in the Paris Invalidendom, as media reported.
Responsible for the competitors: Dabo is the first secret hero of the Leichtathletik World Championship
The world tip was already in the goal of playing heartwarming scenes in the downcooled Khalifa International Stadium. In the first run of the men over 5000 meters Jonathan Busby began to swap from Aruba. He could barely stay on the legs 300 meters before the goal, ran in unhealthy attitude, when Braima Suncar Dabo from the West African country Guinea-Bissau suddenly underhacked him and supported him the last half Stadion round had already dragged into the goal. However, the forces were still rich in both, after the target flow of the armbanduhr.
"I just wanted to help him. Anyone in this situation would have done the same," Dabo said after the race in Mixed Zone, when he completely unexpectedly drew the attention of the assembled journalists. Evil he first went out, didn't want to talk about his hero. Finally, he wanted to set up his personal best time and when he had noticed that this would be difficult, he wanted to help only one fellow suffering. And anyway, he would be proud to represent his country, "he said.
He did this on the evening with impression - and much more intense than he would have thought. Because this hero will remain in memory. Zumal Dabo even left his competitor Busby in the goal and voluntarily took the last place - by the way, just five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Barega, who won this process. At the end it had used nothing, because the Busby, only with a lot of help, was disqualified precisely because of the end of the world light lethology association.
Dabo, who lives in Portugal and studied there in Lisbon, was here to set up a personal best time at the Doha World Championship. According to official data, he succeeded at 18: 10.87 minutes, but he was disappointed himself: "I wanted to run 17: 55 minutes. Under 18 minutes I had already been." However, only in training, it doesn't count.
Millionenmasch: Egypt rests for wild protest day
In Egypt, security measures have been strengthened in anticipation of possible government-critical protests. In the centre of Kairos a strengthened police presence was observed on Friday. Several subway stations remained closed, streets around the central Tahrir square were blocked.
In recent days, the police had strengthened their road controls, and pedestrians' cell phones were partially searched for news and photographs related to the protests. Hundreds had been arrested according to two non-governmental organisations.
Opponent of Al-Sisi
Last weekend, there were hundreds of protests in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura with hundreds of participants. They were directed against the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the critic of corruption and abuse. A so open protest against the political leadership had not been held in Egypt for years. The Egyptian builders living in Spanish exile and actor Mohammed Ali, who brought the demonstrations with video messages on Facebook to the roll, did not call for a "million march" for today's Friday as a guardian, but for its millions of ambassadors. Ali calls for a "People's revolution." The man is for most Egyptians, "he has also called for a" as a "as a subordinator," for the subordinate, "in the city of the city."
According to the number of arrests related to the protests, two observer groups continued to increase. The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) counted more than 1,570 arrests until Friday. The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and the Human Rights Watch (HRW) spoke of more than 2,000 arrests. These figures could not be confirmed independently at first. The government confirmed and did not comment on the figures either.
arbitrary arrests
Many people had been "arbitrarily arrested," only because they were 'at the wrong time', "HRW informed under the appeal of lawyers arrested. According to their lawyers, the accusations against the arrested range from" dissemination of false information "to membership of a" terrorist association. "In Cairo, Alexandria and other cities questioned and searched security forces in uniform, but also in civil clothing, and also arbitrary passages according to HRW data.
HRW also criticized the censorship in the North African country. Consequently, the government in Cairo blocks websites and online services to prevent further protests against Sisi.
Online dealers: shipping dealers should be able to donate returns more easily
For online dealers, many backshipped packages are lost goods. Around 20 million returns land on the trash like this. But there is an alternative.
The Ministry of Finance has shown online dealers such as Amazon and Zalando a way to donate recovered products instead of destroying them.
Although the company could not be exempted from the turnover tax on donations, the Ministry explained to a question of the Green Bundestag group, which reported the newspapers of the Funke Media Group on Friday, but the dealers could use the market value of the unsold returns so low that they would have to pay no or very little turnover tax.
Scientists at the University of Bamberg had found that the federal citizens would send back every sixth package on the Internet. Approximately four percent of the goods - about 20 million products - then landed in garbage. They would donate to companies according to the current legal situation would cost additional money, because the financial authorities evaluate donations as a turnover to which sales tax will fall.
Green Group Head Katrin Göring-Eckardt called on Minister of Finance Olaf Scholz (SPD) to clarify by a decision that companies can not assess sales products accordingly and donate them free of charge to non-profit organisations. The companies should be able to rely on not being punished for donations, not only for online trade, but also for other business from the modeling to the construction market.
Banksy art for auction: There was never a better time to sell this painting
The famous work of Streetart-Star Banksy, "Devolved Parliament," will soon be auctioned.
For Branczik, Banksys's work "the reformation of the oldest parliamentary democracy in the world into the basic maintenance of animals and tribes." From Saturday the painting is to be exhibited at Sotheby's in the UK capital until it is to be auctioned on 3 October. It is estimated to be 1.5 to 2 million euros.
The work was first exhibited in 2009 at the Museum of Bristol in the Southwest of Great Britain, where Banksy lives. This year the artist had once again exhibited the painting - at the same time as the original Brexit date on March 29. At this occasion the work called the former "Question Time" was renamed "Devolved Parliament" ("Delegated Parliament").
The picture could change the owner for a million dollars.
Last Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had delivered a hard exchange of battles with the opposition at the first meeting of the House of Commons following the abolition of a forced break by the Supreme Court of Johnson. Johnson wants to carry out the Brexit already twice delayed on 31 October without any agreement with the EU.
It is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, interferes in the Brexit debate. In Dover in the south-east of England he painted a picture that represents a man who breaks a star of the European flag with a chisel. The work sees thousands of trucks and other visitors every day when entering the United Kingdom.
Brexit debate is like a "walk in the park"
The violent verbal attacks by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Brexit opponents in Parliament do not contribute to a climate of hatred. Compared to the 2016 election campaign, the current controversy is a "walk in the park," Dominic Cummings said on Friday at a book presentation. "We will enjoy this. We will leave (from the EU) and we will win."
In recent days, Johnson had hit Brexit opponents in Parliament hard and accused them of, among other things, "betrayal" on the people; accusations that he could put the Members in danger because they could be the target of murder threats, he turned off as "Humbug."
Cummings said that the only way to get back to peace was if the MEPs finally respected the British decision to leave the EU, and it was not surprising that people were upset that Britain had still not left the EU three years after the referendum.
In view of the excited mood on Friday, even the bishops of the Anglican Church called for restraint. "We should speak with respect," said it in an explanation. "And we should also listen."
Pakistan's Prime Minister Khan calls for UNO intervention in Kashmir
With an emotional appeal, Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan once again called on the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict in his first appearance before the UN General Assembly.
Otherwise, a renewed war between the nuclear forces of Pakistan and India would be likely, Khan said on Friday at the Uno-General debate in New York. "If this went bad, you would have hoped for the best, but be prepared for the worst." The United Nations would have been responsible for Kaschmir. "You should have prevented it."
India and Pakistan have led three wars since their independence from British colonial rule in 1947, two of them around the Shared Region of Kaschmir. Both nuclear powers dominate one part of Kaschmir, another part of China. At the beginning of August India had withdrawn the Indian Kaschmir region from the autonomy state and thus increased the tension in relation to Pakistan.
Not even a bottle of water
The demonstrators in Cairo call for the fall of the Egyptian President al-Sisi.
Against the current protests in Egypt, the government responds with hard hand. It is taking sharp ammunition to the population, over 2000 arrested people join the prisoners of the 60,000 political prisoners who are already in prison. Protests have never been harmless in Egypt. However, since the power takeover of General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in 2013, the state apparatus has done everything in its power to avoid a scenario like at times of Arab Spring.
But one of the triggers for the protests in 2011 was the bad economic situation. Poverty, invisibility and the feeling of being suffocated by the own government, drove millions on the road. And this is a problem that also the regime of el-Sisi does not get in control, no matter how hard it goes against opponents. The situation has even worsened.
Today every third person lives in Egypt under the poverty limit. Since 2016, the currency has lost more than half its value, inflation is at ten percent. Whoever wants to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket must decide who he finances: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the military. The latter is not only responsible for suppression but also for the largest economic actor. The military builds streets, houses, football stadiums, produces food and much more. It was already before el-Sisi as before the great parts of the population have a lot of experience with the Egyptian people, including the dilemma in the supermarket is an old one. Critic will always be when they have large parts of the people who have any problems.
Tüv-Tests in Terminal: BER-Chef: No more "Showstopper" for capital airport
Two months have been checked whether the complex plant fleece works in combination with the BER fire protection. The operators are satisfied with the process. But the Tüv is not finished on the BER yet.
After large-scale Tüv tests at the terminal of the future capital airport, the operators confirmed the planned opening in October next year. This is certain, Supervisory Board Chief Rainer Bretschneider said after a meeting of the Control Board.
Airport manager Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successful completed exam, but also said that there are still shortcomings in the terminal. "We have many detailed themes, but we do not have a real showstopper." He assured that the timetable until the entry into service was still buffer.
However, there is evidence that the time reserve should no longer be too large. The construction declaration is now to be submitted to the Bauamt during the first quarter of 2020, at the beginning of the year this was planned for this autumn.
Hundreds of shortcomings in power cables are still to be resolved; the Tüv wants to examine them until February. "In order to create the conditions for the start of the flight operation, it is necessary to continue to work intensively to deal with the shortcomings," he said in a written communication.
Lütke Daldrup said that in many cases it is about missing evidence, less about new cable. There is also no release for all the dübel where the cable tracks are hanging. The airport manager expects it to be available until the end of the year.
In addition, fire protection at the transition to the station under the terminal is not yet satisfactory. The problems had led the project to another crisis three years ago. This time it is about smoking scraps that descend at a fire like a canvas so that the smoke does not spread. They go too far down. 36 engines must therefore be exchanged. Then there should be new tests with hot gas smoke at the beginning of the year.
Problems with fire protection and other construction defects as well as planning errors have been delaying the opening of the airport for years. Originally, it was planned to start operating in 2011. Since the beginning of 2006, the cost has increased from two billion to approximately €6.5 billion for the opening of the airport next year.
Since the passenger numbers in Berlin have since increased significantly, the operators are planning the expansion of the airport. Therefore, it is expected to take place at a special meeting of the Supervisory Board on 18 October, as announced by the president of the Bretschneider.
The airport company is now looking for two new managers. Financial chief Heike Fölster switches to the German Railway at the end of the year, personnel manager Manfred Bobke-von Camen returns to retirement next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster. She put airport finance on firm feet.
Chemnitz: Machines for Drugs exploded - Police arrest man
He needed money for drugs - and he got some machines in the Chemnitz city area to blow up! Now the perpetrator is finally in jail!
Over the past two years, the number of exploded cigarette and parking ticket machines in Chemnitz and the region has increased sharply. There has been a million damage!
After two detonations at the end of May, the police attacked a 33-year-old German on the Bu-rgerstraße and on the further road in Chemnitz.
Policeman Andrzej Rydzik: "In the course of the investigation of explosions of explosives in a crime unit with a particularly severe case of theft brought by the Chemnitzer Criminal Police, the suspicion against the 33-yes was not only confirmed."
Confronted with the new evidence, the 33-year-old chemnitzer now had eight actions.
The police spokesman: "Apparently he has financed his beta-ubission drug abha." Alone four times between August 20, 2018 and May 31, 2019, the bomber had sprinkled parksticks on the Bu-Rgerstraße.
The total damage caused amounts to at least 60 000 euros!
The machine bomber is now in custody and the police investigation against him is continuing.
It can be thought that he was also responsible for further automated explosions in Chemnitz and adjacent districts.
AUA takes over Eurowings flights from Vienna
The Lufthansa Group is changing its strategy for the airport of Vienna. In the middle of the prize fight with cheap flights such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, Lufthansa's daughter AUA takes over "the commercial control of all Eurowings flights from Vienna," confirmed a press address from Austrian Airlines to APA on Friday. Previously, "AviationNetOnline" reported about it.
The Vienna base of the Lufthansa cheap flight Eurowings is thus de facto dissolved. Four of the currently seven Eurowings aircraft will remain in Vienna. It will take over the AUA from January 2020 in the "Wetlease," i.e. including Eurowings staff. In Salzburg, three Eurowings jets will be stationed in the future to fly from Salzburg and Innsbruck as charter engines to holiday destinations. Streets from Vienna to Germany will be taken over by Eurowings Germany.
The Eurowings base in Vienna is integrated into the AUA rotation and network planning, the spokesman said. The flight times are to be coordinated on connecting flights. The aim is, on the one hand, to strengthen the rotary rotation of Vienna and, on the other, to develop decentralised traffic from the Länder.
As AviationNetOnline writes, Eurowings in Vienna only serves as a "Production Company" for the group sister AUA. For example, Barcelona and Rome would be used with AUA flight number, but mainly with Eurowings device. Although the board product should be adapted to that of Austrian Airlines, the pilots and flight crew would come from Eurowings. According to the report, the Eurowings flights starting under AUA flight number are no longer produced in Terminal 1, but as the AUA did in Terminal 3.
After the Niki-Pleite airport in Vienna, a prize match broke out. Ryanair's daughter Laudamotion announced only on Thursday to increase the fleet in Vienna next summer to 16 aeroplanes. The Irish cheap aeroplane sends four Ryanair machines and crew to Vienna, also in the so-called "Wetlease," which the trade union criticised as an environmental structure to the collective agreement.
On Friday's AUA board Andreas Otto said that Lauda will have overtaken the AUA in five years. "We will remain the number one at the location in five, six or ten years."
Queen granddaughter Princess Beatrice is engaged
Beatrice, Eugenie, William and Harry: As children the cousins were the best friends. Now the last one of the four marries. Beatrice is engaged!
Wonderful news from the British Royals: In the Italian holidays at the beginning of the month Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi (34) should have stopped around the hand of his friend Princess Beatrice (31). This was announced by the palace on Thursday.
"We are delighted to be able to announce our engagement. We are both so happy to start this adventure together and can hardly expect to be married in fact," the couple, which has been together since October 2018, announced in the official communication.
And further: "We share so many similar interests and values and we know that this will help us very much in the coming years full of love and happiness."
Sister Eugenie cut the pictures
The official engagement photographs have recorded her sister, Princess Eugenie (29) - and also published immediately on her Instagram account.
A royal festival
The wedding is scheduled to take place in 2020. More information on date, place and everything else will be announced by the palace in the coming months.
But it is certain that the wedding of the number nine of the British throne sequence and the real estate mogul will be a feast similar to the wedding of Eugenie on 12 October 2018 with Jack Brooksbank (33).
Study on causes of heart disease
Smoking, overweight, unhealthy nutrition - there are risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. But what really triggers a heart weakness or infarction? Hamburger researchers now want to look at the inheritance of 9000 healthy and sick people.
The analysis of the inheritance of 9000 people wants Hamburger and Swiss scientists to find the causes of cardiovascular diseases more detailed.
The research project is the largest of this kind in the German-speaking area, the University Clinic Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) announced on Friday. The Kühne Foundation promotes the project with 12.5 million euros. From Switzerland, the High Mountain Clinic Davos, which belongs to the Foundation, and the University Hospital Zürich are involved.
Overweight, smoking and unhealthy nutrition are one of the major influential risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Genetic factors determine the risk. However, the interaction between genes and external influences is only insufficiently known, it was said. Now scientists want to compare the complete heritage of 8000 healthy people with the one of 1000 former patients of the university heart and vascular centre at the UKE.
At present, more than 4000 of the approximately 20,000 relevant human genes are known for possible disease-causing changes in DNA - so-called mutations - was called the clinic. Every year about 200 were added.
The aim of the five-year project is to develop new options such as the prevention, detection and treatment of heart rhythm disorders, heart weakness and heart attacks. Data could also be useful in exploring other people's diseases, according to Stefan Blankenberg, head of the university heart and vascular centre. New insights could be made on interaction between heart and brain, heart and kidney as well as on cancer diseases.
The chairman of the Kühne Foundation, Klaus-Michael Kühne (82), also stressed that there is a strong will to use the data also to explore other diseases. The clinic of the Foundation in Davos has so far dealt mainly with allergies. Now, on the medical campus there, a center for cardiovascular precision medicine should be created and a professor of bioinformatics created. To justify its commitment, the logistics entrepreneur living in Switzerland said that he had been operated in the open heart three years ago in Hamburg and very grateful.
The biosamples of the healthy participants come from Hamburgers, who also participate in the Hamburg City Health Study. According to the clinic, 45,000 volunteers are the largest local health study in the world. In the inheritance encryption is strictly respected the protection of anonymous data, scientists assured. It is about a petabyte (1000 terabyte) of data, said Holger Moch of the University Hospital Zürich.
The inheritance of a person can now be decrypted within 24 hours, according to UKE. The purely cost for it was 1300 euros. The first gene sequencing worldwide, whose results were published in 2001, cost several hundred million euros. The study is scheduled to start on 1 October, all 9000 samples are to be analysed at the end of 2020 and the first results are expected in the year thereafter.
Nigerian police liberate hundreds of mishandled boys
In Nigeria, the police released more than 300 tortured and abused boys from a Koran school. According to indications from residents, security forces searched the school in the North Nigerian city of Kaduna and discovered the partly minor victims, as police spokesman Yakubu Sabo announced. "The victims were assaulted. Some of them claimed to be raped by their teachers," said Sabo.
The boys had been held under the pretext of being taught in the Qur'an and "improved". In fact, the protectors had been held by their teachers under "most dedignant and inhuman conditions", said Sabo. About a hundred students, including children of nine years old, had been chained in a small room.
According to the Quran School for about ten years. Residents had made the authorities aware of repeated irregularities in the facility. The parents had proven shocked when they were informed about the conditions in the Quran School, Sabo said. They had not known about the suffering of their children. The operator and six employees were arrested according to the police.
Most of the Muslim north of Nigeria there are many private coran schools. They replace the often inadequate state institutions. People in the region suffer from frequent attacks on armed bands. According to the United Nations refugee aid work, more than 40,000 people fled across the border in the last ten months in the neighbouring state of Niger.
Dressed and tortured: Nigerias police free 400 children from school
Police in a school in northern Nigeria have released nearly 400 students from horrible conditions. "Many of them were chained and some had visible injuries indicating torture," said Chief of Police Yakubu Sabo in the city of Kaduna.
There the children had been discovered on Thursday after a clue in an Islamic school. The conditions there had been "unworthy." The officials arrested the head of school and six teachers after the liberation operation.
The children, all boys, had been held at their school like slaves and put on chains. Some had been sexually abused. Television images showed abducted and injured pupils in a noticeably bad state of health.
World Football Choice: Other accusations after Messis and Klopps Cor
Football "Signature not valid"
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe excellent
With a gala in Milan, Fifa's World Football Association features the best player, the best player and the best coach of the year. For Lionel Messi it is the sixth honour and thus record.
After Nicaragua's captain explained that he had never voted in the World Football election, from other countries accusations come to the Fifa. Egypt was not judged at all - with a courious justification.
Much of the Fifa has proven to be anxious in recent years: the World Championship Forces, the dubious plans of its President Gianni Infantino, the general behaviour of various corrupt functionaries. However, the Fifa World Football election has not yet been suspected of being unclean - if one prevents the voting-entitled national trainers and national crew capitalists of member organisations often to vote for sympathy rather than for objective assessment.
But after the captain of Nicaragua had already complained that he did not vote at all, further injustice emerges: Egypt complains that the voices of National Coach Hossam El-Badry and Captain Mohamed Salah have not been taken into account. Indeed, they do not appear in the official and publicly visible voting overview.
The Fifa apologizes that "the signatures on the electoral forms had been delivered in large letters and therefore not valid." The Egyptian association had been contacted several times to clarify the situation - without an answer.
Sudans coach also surprised
Also from Sudan there is a cry about the election. While the situation in the case of Egypt is understandable, the Sudanese association states that trainer Zdravko Lugarisic had not voted as it was finally considered: with Lionel Messi on place one, Virgil van Dijk on two and Sadio Mané on three. According to Fifa, the vote was also received, with signatures and official stamp of the Sudanese Federation.
Nicaragua's captain Juan Barrera had also accused him of saying: "I did not vote for the # TheBest2019 Awards. All the information on my voice is wrong, thank you," he wrote. In his case it was suspected that the Nicaraguan football association simply voted in his name.
The association came on Friday the message: True, but was of course no intention. The completed electoral documents were "mistakenly" with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan selection, it was said in a message of the association. However, the second captain Manuel Rosas had chosen. "We take responsibility for the administrative error," it was said in the communication. Rosas as as well as crew trainer Henry Duarte had voted for Messi, "as it stands in the official list of FIFA."
The other cases leave the Fifa in an investigation now, but emphasises that the election process was externally supervised by the advisory firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers. As long as Lionel Messi remains undeniable winner of the World Football election - and Jürgen Klopp World Trainer of the Year.
Ukraine affair: Ranghohe Republicans stand up for official investigation
Two ranghohe Republicans have opened up for an official investigation against the US President and party friend Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important," said the Republican Governor of the US state of Vermont, Phil Scott. "Where this leads from here, this is determined by the facts that are found." He wants to know more about the Whistleblower affair before action is taken. An impeachment procedure can lead to the discontinuation of the President.
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations, which had shown that Trump had repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj in a telephone call to investigate the activities of the democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine. According to Scott, Trump Biden observed "for years."
The Republicans have so far withheld criticism of Trump because of the Whistleblower affair, but few have shown discomfort. Scotts' statements are now a first sign of this in Trump's party. In doing so, the moderate governor of Virginia had already turned several times against Trump's policy, such as the relaxation of environmental protection rules and the tightening of immigration regulations.
As another ranghoher Republicans, Charlie Baker, Governor of Massachusetts, also spoke for the investigation. "It is a deeply disturbing situation," Baker said. "The right approach and responsibility for the Congress is now to investigate the matter and go on the ground."
Scott and Baker, as the governor of the US states, formally did not take part in the proceedings against Trump, which is decided in the Congress. Therefore, their statements are symbolic. Nevertheless, the first Senators of the Republicans have also expressed criticism of the situation. My Romney, who represents the state of Utah in the second Chamber of Parliament, said that the case is "extremely disturbing, deeply disturbing." US media also report that among the Republicans the first internal risks arise.
The affair could lead to the initiation of an office procedure against Trump, the Democrats in the House of Representatives have announced an investigation on this matter, and they pretend to him abuse of power for the purpose of foreign influence for their own political benefit.
There is no precise timetable for the office procedure. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could strive for a so-called impeachment. However, the decision on actual postponement fell in the Senate where Trumps Republicans have the majority. Therefore, the prospects for success of such a procedure are small. So far, no US President has been dismissed by an impeachment procedure of the Office.
Was torture on board of Racketes "Sea Watch"?
Three men were arrested in Sicily, they were supposed to have raped and murdered in Libyan refugee camps.
The German captain Carola Rackete (31) was arrested in June after having unlawfully steered the port of Lampedusa with the rescue ship "Sea Watch 3" and 53 Libyan refugees on board. After strong protests and international criticism - also by Austrian Federal President Alexander van der Bellen - her house arrest was repealed by an Italian judge after a few days.
Now there are new serious accusations against racquets. Three men who are accused of torture in Libyan refugee camps could have arrived in Italy with the "Sea Watch 3". The suspects have been arrested in a reception camp in Messina (Sicily) after migrants had recognized their plagues in Italy. "We cannot exclude this, but have no secure information on this," said "Sea Watch" Species Ruben Neugebauer der Deutschen Presseagentur.
The police said in the middle of September that the suspects in the North African country had raped, tortured and even murdered. It was Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). "The migrants were systematically harassed and exposed to cruelty - by repeated and permanent physical violence," it was said in the communication.
NGOs and auxiliary organisations now point out that they cannot know exactly who comes on the ships. "We cannot scan who the people are. They come without passports," said Neubauer. Torture is one of the main reasons why people flee from Libya. It is therefore quite likely that there are also perpetrators on the ships. "It is therefore very important that this is followed."
Italy's judicial ex-Minister Matteo Salvini called for an immediate apology from Rackete, which is still being investigated in Italy for aid to illegal immigration.
Musk strives for extradition record at Tesla
Tesla-Chef Elon Musk has given his electric car company with the prospect of new record numbers strong drive on the stock market.
"We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote an e-mail to Tesla employees published by the industry blog Electrek.
The demand was strong, so that Tesla could book 110,000 orders, it continued in Musks newsletter. The challenge was to bring the cars quickly to the customer. To this end, Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible to the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla shares went out of trade with a plus of over six percent. The course has not been so strong for nearly four months. In the second quarter Tesla had delivered well 95,000 cars and thus reached its best value.
Musk needs records to achieve its high goals. 2019 he wants to deliver 360,000 to 400,000 cars. To do so in the current and coming quarter years, six-digit numbers. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is required, but here are the margins of profit. Despite the boom there were last losses.
US budget dispute: reiterate only a bridge financing
The new financial year will begin in the United States on 1 October without a proper budget. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and decided on a transitional financing until 21 November.
Although the US Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August to increase the expenditure ceilings for the financial years 2020 and 2021, the United States stood before the new fiscal year starting on 1 October again without spending plans. On Thursday, the Senate followed the House of Representatives and decided on a transitional financing (Continuing Resolution, CR) until 21 November. Without such a decision, there would have been a shutdown on Monday at midnight, a partition of the federal administration. President Trump still has to put the decision into effect.
Shutdown turned off
The federal administration is now financed at the level and according to the priorities of the expenditure plans for the financial year 2019 ending on Monday. This is because the Congress has not been able to agree in time on the 12 expenditure laws which allocate the funds to the various departments and authorities. The federal administration cannot benefit from the expenditure framework for the new financial year from 1.3 to 1.4 Bio. $.
The Democrats have completed ten of the twelve laws in the House of Representatives, where they have the majority. However, the spending laws reflect the priorities of the Democrats, which have little chance in the Senate dominated by the Republicans. Conversely, the Senate also has ten of the twelve spending plans more or less ready, which are hardly capable of a majority.
The Ghosts are separated mainly from the issue of resource allocation for domestic security and border security. In the Senate, Republicans are apparently trying to force $12 billion for wall construction, one of President Trump's major priorities. Democrats are disturbing the wall building plans and their funding, which is actually intended for other military buildings and projects. The dispute about wall construction was already escalated in December 2018 and had led to a 35-day shutdown.
At the wall building the spirits divorce
At present, it is unclear how the parties want to get closer to this issue. Probably more than agreeing on all 12 expenditure laws in the next seven weeks is a extension of the transitional financing beyond 21 November. Nor is a closing down not excluded.
In the context of the congress's persistent inability to agree on the twelve spending laws in good time, and the associated risk of a shutdown gain ideas to automate the process of popularity. Draft p. 1877 to avoid shutdowns would automatically continue financing the federal administration at the previous year level, stop parliamentary travel activities and withhold their wages until the new annual spending plans were presented.
France allows artificial fertilisation for lesbians and singles
In France, artificial fertilisation will also be open to single-start women and lesbians in the future: the Paris National Assembly voted with a large majority in favour of a government bill according to which all women can benefit from in-vitro fertilisation and thus the demand for anonymous semen donations is likely to increase significantly.
The presentation still requires the consent of the Senate. In the three-day emotional debate, critics in the right-hand camp had warned that in the future many "children without father" could grow up. The French bishop conference is also opposed to the innovation.
The new regulation is the core part of a bioethics law that was defended by Minister of Health Agnès Buzyn as a "opportunity" for society. It forms the modern family in which there are children with only one parent or with homosexual parents. According to her idea, the cost of artificial fertility for all women is to be borne by social security.
Continued fertilisation with sperm of dead husband forbidden
On the other hand, the National Assembly rejected an amendment which should give widows access to the sperm of their dead man for artificial fertilisation. In Belgium, Spain and the UK the artificial fertilisation "post-mortem" is allowed. In the past, there were cases in which women were in vain complaining about the release of the sperm of a deceased. The opponents of the protest in Paris argued that such a born child would then bear a "particularly severe fate."
Many Members of the Government Party of La République en Marche (the Republic in motion, LREM) of President Emmanuel Macron and members of the opposition had expressed their support for the artificial fertilisation with the sperm of the deceased partner. They stressed that a widow would be imposed on a "double mourning" if their husband's death was also unfulfilled.
The initiators of the now failed amendment consider it unfair that a widow can be frustrated with the sperm of an unknown, but not with that of its own partner in the future.
So far, the artificial fertilisation in France is only allowed heterosexual couples who cannot bear witness to children. They must be married or live together for at least two years. Buzyn had already announced in the summer that the maternity would continue to be prohibited.
In Germany, artificial fertilisation is theoretically open to all women - it is often difficult for single or lesbian couples.
Compensation for Climate: Call for flight delivery for Unis becomes louder
There is a lot going on at universities, so the country wants to make a climate tax there in the future. Rectors say they don't have money for it. But now they are also under pressure internally.
The universities should also restrict themselves to flying. Photo: dpa / Julian Stratenschulte
The debate on a climate tax on flights from universities and universities which was postponed before the summer break is coming up again. After the national rector conference had sceptically responded to a corresponding advance from the green-black coalition, the plans now receive support from universities. In a joint declaration the doctorates of six Baden-Württemberg universities and a pedagogic university for a compensation of service flights. This was the first step "urgently needed," at the same time, there had to be a broad debate on the avoidability of flights, which you did not yet approve.
Russia again arrests North Korean fishermen
According to the FSB Secret Service, the arrested illegally caught in Russian waters. Ten days earlier, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. At that time there was a change of gunshot between the border guards and the boat crew. Three Russians and a North Korean were injured, the fisherman was later injured. But this time there was no injury, it was said.
The Communist North Korea is suffering from chronic food shortages. The North Korean fishermen were therefore on the way in Russian territorial waters. Russia's coastguard is running patrol according to its own data on the protection of its marine biological resources.
30.000 inks seized
During the re-inspections, 30,000 ink fish were discovered and seized on the boats and the data were seized by three fishing and two engine boats and brought to Nachodka and Posjet at Wladiwostok.
Russia's Fisheries Authority had also issued no fishing licences to the North Koreans this year following complaints from local entrepreneurs. Thousands of fishermen from North Korea have been arrested there this year.
The head of the association of Russian fishing companies in the peripheral region of Primorje, Georgi Martynow, recently also complained about high environmental damage caused by the North Korean fishermen. They were fishing with narrow synthetic nets prohibited in Russia. These would also bring small creatures from the sea. Furthermore, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea where they would need 200 years to be replaced.
In the future only 18.000: USA lowers the limit of asylum
The "most generous nation in history": Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police representatives in the White House.
The richest country in the world is shocking against guardians: As the foreign ministry in Washington confirms, the ceiling for the legal admission of refugees will be further reduced. In the future, the most threatened faithful and Iraqi asylum will be obtained.
The US government wants to reduce the already historically low border for the admission of new refugees once again. In the marketing year 2020, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, it is intended to leave a maximum of 18,000 people in the country, as the US Ministry of Foreign Affairs has stated. In the almost expired marketing year, the limit is still 30,000 people.
The government of President Donald Trump has drastically reduced the readiness to receive protection seekers from all over the world in recent years. Under the predecessor government of Barack Obama, much higher reception limits had been valid.
The upper limit of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the introduction of the US refugee programme in 1980. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs nevertheless called the United States as the "most merciful and generous nation in history," a formulation that strongly reminds the language usage of the President-in-Office of the United States.
A "responsible handling" with refugees aims to allow refugees to return to their homelands to help them rebuild, said Trump. For his hard course in migration policy he receives a great deal of support from supporters, but there is also massive criticism.
A major point of dispute is the border with Mexico that wants to seal Trump. In order to finance the construction of a border wall, Trump had imposed the national emergency. Whether there is a time link between the current measure and the current internal policy developments in the US capital is unclear. Trump is currently under pressure because of the Selenskyj affair and a potentially threatening civil service process.
According to the Foreign Office, the US Government intends to focus in the future on the inclusion of two refugee groups: people who are being persecuted for their faith - and Iraqi people who have helped the US military in the country and are thus at risk, as the Foreign Minister's statement suggests, but from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, they are to be admitted to the country for a maximum of 1500 refugees.
In particular, the US wants people from this "northern triangle" of Central America to apply for asylum in other countries. Against this background, the United States has only concluded migration agreements with Guatemala and now with El Salvador and Honduras to curb immigration at the US South border to Mexico.
Court orders the release of Orang-utan from the zoo
An Orang-utan female was transferred to an inventory station for human monkeys in the United States at the request of the Argentinian Justice from the former Buenos Aires zoo. The "Sandra" born in 1986 in the Rostocker Zoo was assigned the rights of a "non-human person," therefore their release was mandatory. The animal was brought to Dallas on Thursday night by direct flight - but not as passengers, but in the cargo room, as Andrés Gil Domínguez explained.
Since the 53 kilograms of heavy human monkey is unable to adapt to life in the wilderness, she will in the future live in the lodge of the Center for Great Apes in Florida. There are already 21 more orange utans and 31 chimpanzees, among them "Bubbles," formerly pets of Popstar Michael Jackson. Before entering Florida, however, "Sandra" has to survive a 40-day quarantine in Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita in the U.S. state of Kansas.
"Sandra" spent several years in the former Ruhr-Zoo in Gelsenkirchen after her birth in Rostock before she was moved to Buenos Aires in 1995. In 2014, the process of "Sandras" fundamental rights by animal protectors has contributed to the conversion of the Buenos Aires zoo into an ecopark. By 2023, there will be a research and education site to preserve biodiversity.
Record for Swiss Extrembergsteiger: 550 meters in 46 minutes
The Extrembergsteiger Dani Arnold has succeeded in a new Husar ride at the 3,000 meters high tin in the Italian Alps.
Without net, double floor or other tools, the Swiss forced the 550 meters high north wall of the Great Tinn in a new record time.
Dressed with jeans, T-shirt and only supported by absolute dizziness, Arnold needed 46 minutes and 30 seconds for the rise. Thus he underbanned the old best brand by almost 19 minutes.
Arnold is now a record holder at the Free Solo Speed at four of the six most important European northern walls.
Nike benefits from new online marketing strategy
The US Sports Product Manufacturer Nike has booked a significant profit plus despite the trade conflict with China. Net profit increased to 1.4 billion dollars (almost 1.3 billion euros) in the past quarter. That is 25 percent more than in the previous year, as the group announced on Tuesday. This is why the new marketing strategy "Nike Direct" is primarily based on the new marketing strategy that the Adidas competitor directly addresses to its customers online.
Turnover increased to 10.7 billion dollars in the three months period until the end of August. Nike sales increased most strongly with a plus of 22 percent in China. Thus, the group from Beaverton in the US state of Oregon also benefited in the People's Republic of China from its approach to direct access to consumers via the Internet or smartphone apps.
Chief of Finance Andy Campion announced that Nike would continue with strategic investments to drive the "digital transformation" of the sporting product manufacturer and thus expand its competitive advantage. Investors reacted to the quarterly figures - the shares of the sporting product manufacturer increased by more than five percent.
Lifelong stadium ban on racism in Italy
Because of racist comments on football professors Juan Jesus of AS Rome, the association from the Italian capital has imposed a lifelong stadion prohibition against a fan. Jesus, from Brazil, was seized by the fan on Instagram. Jesus then published the private news and asked his club to take action. "@ officialasroma you already know what to do with such a fan. # NoToRacism. Stolz on being who I am," wrote the 28-year-old man who has been playing at AS Rome since 2016.
The club reacted late on Thursday. He reported the Fans' Account at Instagram and the police. Besides, the Roma followers should never visit another game of the association again, the club wrote on Twitter.
Racism is a problem in Italian football. Regular scan Italian fans racist accusations against black players rivaling teams. "We cannot have racism in society or in sport. In Italy the situation has not improved, and that is very serious. One must identify the responsible and throw out from the stadiums," Fifa President Gianni Infantino said on the weekend. The occasion of the statement was racial songs at the First League party between Atalanta Bergamo and AC Florence on the previous Sunday.
But even about the followers of Juventus Turin there had been recent discussions. The Italian authorities have now proved 38 random fans of Recordmaster Juventus Turin with a stadium ban. Four of them should no longer enter the stadium for a period of ten years, the police informed them. The rest of them are therefore prohibited from four to seven years.
The fans are associated with ongoing investigation of twelve leaders of Ultra fishing troops in the surroundings of Juventus. The twelve are accused, among other things, of severe blackmail, money laundering and private violence. The club had launched the investigation with an ad last year.
According to Italian media reports, the Ultra leaders should be behind the black trade with tickets. They would have "controlled" the ticket for the fan curve and have blackmailed Juventus employees to get to cheaper cards.
Generation Z: Are they really different from Generation Y?
Millennials are narcissist, the generation Z is political - whole years are considered with griffy names. If you look more closely, the awards are full of contradictions. So how well do these labels describe the respective sense of life of young people?
"The crabs are coming!" This call officially started on September 21 at the Gucheng lake in Gaochun, which also invited the opening event of the 19th China Gaochun Lake Crab Festival, as announced by the Nanjing-Gaochun District Committees.
Gaochun, which is the southern runner of Nanjing in Jiangsu Province, is one of the national environmental zones. The city is the first international "Slow City" in China and is also located here the Chinese seat of the international "Slow City" movement. The city has ideal conditions in ecological terms with a mixture of "30 percent mountains, 20 percent water areas and 50 percent fields." Gaochun's magnificent natural environment offers its inhabitants all conditions to become rich.
The people of Gaochun have already begun crawling in the early 1990s. Over time, the crawl industry has developed into a magnificent sector that has provided high incomes and become an important part of Gaochun's economic development. In recent years, Gaochun has actively pursued a large, ecological and scientific development of crawling as well as technology-based crawling. And the city has endeavoured to promote more efficiency in agriculture and the income of farmers.
In recent years Gaochun has set up a reform of the "distribution of power, optimization of administration and government services" and with caution the service network for "permits under one roof, a team for law enforcement, a network of services, a platform for lending," which will fully optimize the environment for permits, services and development.
Gaochun fully exploits the advantages given on the ground by connecting to the southern Jiangsu and the southern Anhui and uses the development zone and its position as an international "Slow City" as an outline sign to locate intelligent high-end production plants, biomedical and medical technology companies, energy storage and environmental protection, from the cultural and health sector and organic farming companies leading in the "3 + 2" area, while Gaochun has also promoted the construction of a national, all-scale tourist area and public services, and tourism areas of national importance.

Conflict between Iran and the United States: Ruhani speaks of the end of sanctions - Trump contradicts
The Iranian President Hassan Ruhani, after returning from the UN General Assembly, spoke of a alleged US offer to revoke sanctions. In return for talks with the Tehran leadership, Ruhani said on his official website that the United States would have put an end to all sanctions.
However, US President Donald Trump opposed the Iranian colleague on Twitter: "Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on him so that there was a meeting. I said, of course, no."
Ruhani describes the situation as follows: Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron were present in New York and insisted that a meeting would take place. "And America says I will lift the sanctions," Ruhani added. The kind of penalties that should be terminated had stood at the debate. "And they have clearly said that we will lift all sanctions."
However, this argument had not been accepted in an acceptable way, Ruhani criticized. In view of the current penalties and the "poisoned atmosphere of maximum pressure," no one could predict the outcome of negotiations.
At the beginning of the week, Chancellor Angela Merkel had met with Ruhani in New York. Background was the hope of Europeans to save the nuclear agreements negotiated with Russia and China with Iran. This was intended to prevent the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons. France's President Emmanuel Macron had expressed the hope that Ruhani would meet with US President Donald Trump as Merkel on the edge of the UN General Assembly.
Heavy earthquake near Istanbul - Almost 200 descendants
After the western Turkey was shattered by two earthquake within the shortest time, fear of a disaster is growing. 34 people were injured at the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the earthquake on the previous day there have been almost 200 afterquake, said Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay on Friday. Thus the concern about a disaster is growing.
14 schools in Istanbul were closed for security reasons. Hundreds of buildings were therefore damaged. On Thursday the earthquake of strength 5.8 had shaken the Marmararegion before Istanbul and caused panic in the millions of metropolis. Now the government wanted to set up a commission to prepare the country better for earthquake, Octay announced.
In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for beetles, said Istanbul's mayor Ekrem Imamoglu. In the city itself the latent danger is always ignored. Every year, bad built houses fall into - among other things, murf made by the many smaller earthquake, the Istanbul regularly shakes.
Town planners such as the famous architect Mücella Yapici have been warning for years that large open areas that were registered as a refuge in the centre have been built. Only on the 20th anniversary of the Gölcük-Beben in August the Istanbul building engineer chamber had warned that an estimated million buildings in Istanbul were not earthquake safe.
The Epicenter of the Being of Thursday was located in the Marmaraeer in front of the district of Silivri and in about seven kilometres of depth, as the civilian protection authority Afad announced. A smaller afterburial caused even greater panic on the streets a few minutes later.
The Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu informed on Twitter that injuries or damage had not been reported at first. The State Sender TRT showed people who ran into panic from the houses. Students were brought out of the buildings for security reasons in the district of Silivri. Some students cried as on pictures.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly terrestrial. Under the Marmaradier lies a section of the so-called North Anatolic disturbance that marks the border between the Eurasian and the Anatolic earthquake. Turkey is repeatedly shaken by earthquake. One of the deadliest in 1999 was the earthquake near Istanbul. At that time more than 17,000 people were killed.
Researchers fear that a earthquake of strength could threaten 7.1 to 7.4. But when it comes to the earthquake, it is unclear. At the earthquake on Thursday it again hit the west of the country and Istanbul.
Companies design emergency plans, private people have packed so-called go-bags with everything necessary standing next to door doors, and schools teach children how to behave when the earth wackles. When the next big coat comes, be unclear.
The Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said after his return from New York that eight people had been injured. Some buildings had suffered minor damage. The Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu followed the developments of the Istanbul disaster coordinating centre (Akom). According to it, two minarets of mosques collapsed into the districts of Avcilar and Sariyer.
Warning before aftermath in Istanbul
In the social networks many users reported panic. Buildings wrapped. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Telephone lines had been interrupted. It had been more intense than that of Tuesday, writes a user. The head of the Turkish Red Half Moon, Kerem Clinic, warned over Twitter to be buried. He called people to stay away from buildings that had suffered visible damage.
The date of the funeral is stated at 1.59 p.m. (local time). Only a few minutes after the first funeral, according to CNN Turkey, there was an afterfuneral, which was indicated with a strength of 4.0 on the judge scale.
Only on Tuesday had a earthquake of strength 4.6 shaken the Turkish Marmararegion - it was to be felt until Istanbul. Even its epicenter was located in the Marmarameer west of the Million Metropolis, the Afad Civil Protection Authority informed already on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that made headlines this Tuesday: Pakistan was also hit by a severe earthquake.
Researchers assume that a catastrophic earthquake in Istanbul could occur sooner or later - the tension between the tektonic plates is extremely high. Scientists believe that it will eventually be released - and will cause massive damage.
Earthquake researcher Sükrü Ersoy expects that the earthquake is now a warning. This has made it more likely, he said to CNN Turk. "These could be the signs of a larger earthquake," said Ersoy to the sender. "Sooner or later the great earthquake will also come."
A few weeks ago there had been an incident - the Beben caused great concern also in Istanbul. In Albania there had also been a severe earthquake only a few days ago - there were 68 injuries. This year the Earth had also been praying on the ground lake.
Parliament: New ignition in Ukraine affair
Two brittle documents provide new ignition in the Ukraine affair about possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump. On the way to a possible office detention procedure, the US Democrats see themselves strengthened: the complaint filed by an anonymous indicator on Trump and its controversial telephone with the Ukrainian President attach important points of reference to investigations against the President. Trump sees itself once more as a victim of a "witch hunt." He also doubted the credibility of the Whistleblowers.
USA: United Airlines passenger locked up in toilet - airline redirected
Because a passenger was locked up in the board toilet, a flight was redirected by United Airlines. The toilet door had been blocked during flight 1554 from Washington to San Francisco, the airline informed the US media.
At an unscheduled interim landing on Wednesday night (local time) in Denver, the woman could finally be released from the narrow cabin. About an hour she had been locked in it, US media wrote on behalf of other passengers. Passengers had to change the machine for a further flight to San Francisco.
In a video broadcast on the Internet, which according to the US media is to come from flight 1554, it is to see how several people try to free the woman. "We are currently working to open the door, ma'am. We'll get you out soon, okay?" says a man in it. The airline has apologized to all passengers. Offen was first of all whether the woman receives compensation.
The cockroach: Inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan writes Brexit Roman
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with the whole Brexit chaos? He writes a book about it - and his protagonist is undeniable.
Inspired by Franz Kafka's famous story "The transformation" the British successful author Ian McEwan (71) wrote a book about the Brexit chaos in Britain.
The novel "The Kakerlake" (original: "The Cockroach") will appear in German on 27 November, the Diogenes publisher (Zurich) informed. This is about the transformation of a man named "Jim Sams," who was ignored or hated in his previous life, but now is now the most powerful man in Britain. He sees it as his mission to implement the will of the people and is deliberately determined to stop from nothing and nobody.
McEwan was quoted with the words: "If Parliament is closed so that the government cannot be challenged at a critical moment when ministers lie unashamed as once the Soviet leaders, when Brexiteers in high positions pledge the catastrophe of a no-deal - then a writer has to ask himself what he can do. There is only one answer to it: write." McEwan only appeared in the spring of the novel "Machines like I" about artistic intelligence.
Kafkas 1915's first published narrative is by Gregor Samsa, who wakes up one morning and "looks like a monstrous infidel," is gradually excluded from family and society and is ultimately based on it. "Ian McEwan is inclined to describe a world that is headed," it was called Diogenic publisher.
EU invests €9.5 million in Austrian railway infrastructure
11.200 wagons in Austria and Hungary get flux brakes to reduce the noise caused by freight trains. In addition, sections of the railway links between Graz and Györ and Vienna's Neustadt and Sopron are modernised and electrified.
According to the EU Authority, this is intended to make travel more comfortable and reduce CO2 emissions.
Thomas Cook: All trips canceled until 31 October
The German tour organiser Thomas Cook canceled all trips up to and including 31 October 2019 one day after his insolvency application. Travelling could "not be made for insolvency reasons," the company announced on Thursday night.
This also affected bookings of the brands Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Travel, ÖGER TOURS, Booker Travel and Air Marin which are already paid or fully paid. As it stands for travelling with start from 1 November 2019, the company left open. In consultation with insolvency insurance the further procedure was examined, it was called.
Thomas Cook in Germany had been in the sog of the British parent company's pledge and had submitted an insolvency application on Wednesday. The company, including Neckermann Travel, Öger Tours and Book Travel, employs about 2,000 people in Germany.
Insurers want to transfer money back to hotels from now on
On the other hand, from this Friday hotels abroad that are currently hosting Thomas Cook vacancies will receive money from Zurich insurance. According to Zurich, payments to the hotels are subject to the condition that vacancies are no longer required for extra payments.
Based on the booking information and without the presentation of separate bills, the hotels in the holiday resorts are now to receive 50 percent of outstanding payments, as a Speaker of the German Press Agency said. "This applies immediately and subject to the fact that Thomas Cook travelers from these hotels are not immediately asked for individual payment of hotel bills or otherwise required," said spokesman Bernd Engelien further.
Insurance thus responded to reports from hotel guests who had been forced to pay their accommodation on site themselves according to their own information. Some had to put more than 1000 euros on the table. The German Travel Association (DRV) and the Federal Association of Consumer Centres had strongly criticised this.
How many hotels are affected, will be voted with the insolvent travel provider on Friday, said the insurance spokesman. According to Thursday, 70 000 Thomas Cook holidays were still on the way from Germany. Zurich Germany has secured vacation and return of Thomas Cook customers.
Insolvency managers want to try to continue the three Thomas Cook companies in Germany and find a future solution.
However, the now announced payments to hotels by Zurich Insurance only help the travellers who are currently on their way. For Thomas-Cook customers who want to fly on vacation, it looks bad. On late Thursday night the company announced that all travel would be cancelled until and including 31 October. This also applies to those bookings that are already paid.
As it stands about travelling with start from 1 November 2019, the company left open. In consultation with the insolvency insurance system the further approach will be examined, it said. Basically, these cases are also responsible for insurance Zurich. The sale of new travel has stopped.
The company refers to the insurance company Zurich, which can be represented by the company Kaera. Customers could inform themselves on the Kaera website about ways of reimbursing the travel price and claim their claims through a web form.
Prince Harry destroys explosive mine in Angola
For a long time, Prince Harry continues Lady Diana's commitment. In Africa he is now walking directly on the traces of his mother.
The British prince Harry in Angola lit and destroyed an explosive mine with a blue splitting vest.
Near a camp of the British Halo Trust at the place of Dirico he placed the lighthouse on Friday morning in front of current TV cameras. In a safe distance the explosive body exploded in the Savan landscape, without harming. Although alone the Halo Trust has destroyed more than 100,000 relics of the decades of bloody conflict in the African country, there are still more than 1000 mining fields that threaten the population.
On the fifth day of his African trip, Harry wanted to walk directly into the city of Huambo on the traces of his mother Diana (1961-1997). With the same explosive champion who once accompanied his mother, he wanted to go back the way she went at that time. The pictures on which Princess Diana went in 1997 through a ruined minefield had gone around the world. She had also demonstrated support for the Halo Trust.
Harry (35) and his wife Meghan (38) have been on a ten-day African trip since Monday, which has begun in the South African tourist metropolis Cape Town.
Swimming Brexit negotiations: The danger of a no-deal remains acute
In fact, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had clearly defined: with him there will be a third postponement of the Brexit negotiations not guaranteed. But what statements have been made with the polarizing British. The recent judgment of the Supreme Court in Great Britain floats like a Damoklessworth over the blonde. His suspension of Parliament to carry out its Brexit course sture until the exit date was cancelled at the beginning of this week. However, a law adopted by Parliament has always been forbidden by Johnson to extend bilateral talks in the case of past negotiations with the EU until 31 October.
Boris Johnson still thinks the deal is possible
But the pressure does not seem to pass on to Johnson. Meanwhile, when he visits a hospital, he pointed out that in the event of a refusal, he supports an extension of the negotiations by the end of October:
You know, we're gonna stick to the law.
At the same time, however, we are confident that we will leave the EU by 31 October.
And best with a deal. I'm careful optimistic that this will work.
And the time is running from the Brexit negotiators in Brussels. Around six weeks still the EU and the British negotiators have time to prevent Britain from leaving the European Union without an agreement. However, the recent talks have not made a breakthrough again. An agreement by the end of October seems to be more difficult to imagine at present. Brief of the British Prime Minister not the law, a new postponement of the exit date is in force. However, the opposition does not trust the words of the Prime Minister. She fears that in the case of a no-deals the Brexit might somehow enforce.
US Authority: Other deaths by e-cigarettes
The number of deaths related to the use of e-cigarettes in the USA has increased to 12. In addition, there have been 805 confirmed and likely injuries in this connection, the US Health Authority CDC informed. According to a study in the New England Journal of Medicine, there were already more than 900 people affected, about 500 of which have been confirmed. The cause of lung damage is still completely unclear. In Europe no similar increase of lung damage has been known to date. The complaints seem to be limited to users in the USA.
The fear of new protests in Egypt grows
Million times the videos of Mohammed Ali were shared into online networks. The construction entrepreneur and actor living in Spain calls for a "People's Revolution." For Friday he has called for further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military who accuse critics of corruption and abuse. Ali hopes to have a million participants in central places in the country.
The security authorities are alarmed. In the center of Kairos there was already an enhanced police presence to observe. Several subway stations remained closed, roads around the central Tahrir square were blocked. In the past days the police had strengthened their road controls and pedestrians' phones partially searched for news and photographs related to the protests.
On September 20, the demonstrators also gathered around the Tahrir Square.
Last weekend there had been protests in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura with hundreds of participants. There had not been such an open protest in Egypt for years. Accordingly, the security forces responded hard to it. According to the Human Rights Watch (HRW) organisation, almost 2000 people have been arrested since last week. Many of them had been arbitrarily arrested - only because they were "at the wrong time at the wrong place," HRW informed on appeal to lawyers arrested.
The organization also criticized the censorship in the North African country. Consequently, the government in Cairo blocks websites and online services to prevent further protests against al-Sisi. Since 2013, the General has ruled the country after having crashed the democratically elected Islamic President Mohammed Mursi. Thousands of Islamists, government opponents, bloggers and activists have been arrested and partially sentenced in recent years.
"Ocean Change": Arved Fuchs from Greenland expedition back
The Polar researcher Arved Fuchs returned on Friday from his Greenland expedition. He was welcomed when he arrived at the port of Hamburg, among other things by the skipper Boris Herrmann, who had brought climate activist Greta Thunberg with the race hunt "Malizia" over the Atlantic.
With a team of scientists, Fuchs had investigated and documented the effects of global warming on his sailing ship "Dagmar Aaen" on the islands and Greenland coast in recent months.
The Fridays for Future movement is a blessing, said the Polar researcher. He has waited for years for the young generation to speak. It has been known for decades that the earth has warmed up. Nevertheless, many acted as if there were a planet B.
"What happens on the sea often takes place under the exclusion of the public," said Fuchs. He and his team wanted to inform people about the effects of global warming and the waste of the seas. In expedition, among other things, a drone green glacier was measured and fished with nets for micro-lastics, it was called.
In the context of the Hamburger Climate Week, the Polar researcher from Bad Bramstedt has been awarded the "Seadevcon Maritime Award" for its "sustainable and respectful use of the world's seas." For all of us who are at the heart of the ocean survival, Arved Fuchs is a great example, "said Skipper Boris Herrmann at the award." He is a witness to the changes that have taken place in the Arctic in recent decades. "
expensive spaghetti in Rome: tourists paid for noodles 430 Euro
430 euros for two plates of spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant near the English castle in Rome: that seemed two Japanese tourists too much. The invoice with 80 euros of drinking money was paid by the two women, but they posted the receipt on Facebook, which triggered heated reactions.
"Such cases harm the reputation of Rome. We call on the police to investigate whether this is a fraud," a spokesman of Federagit, the association of travel leaders in Rome according to the Roman newspaper Il Messaggero (Friday edition).
Prompt came the reaction of the owners of the restaurant. The Japanese had ordered not only spaghetti but also fresh fish, the local owner justified himself. However, this is not to be taken from the bill. Even a drink of up to 20 percent of the bill was normal, the host said.
A call in Ukraine, and everything is broken? US President Donald Trump could, after the turbulent disclosures of the past few days, actually be confronted with a postponement procedure, the Democrats want to examine this with their investigation in the House of Representatives as soon as possible - the talk is about weeks until a decision would be taken.
At the beginning of the scandal, the telephone call with Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj is supposed to be public. The accusation of the Whistleblower, who ultimately brought the conversation for national security and for the democracy of the United States with his complaint, is monstros: the President has abused the power of his office to instrumentalize the government of another country for an influence on the choice of 2020. He had used the dependence of Ukraine in this process blackmailing and thus forced them to act against a political opponent.
The core of this project must also be understood in the communication published in the meantime of the conversation with Selenskyj, although it does not reflect the full text. However, the Telephone of July 25 is only an episode of a much larger story in which the center of Trump is mainly his personal lawyer: Rudy Giuliani.
From the public's point of view in May 2019, history begins when the New York Times of Rudy Giuliani reports to Ukraine. He wants to meet in Kiev with President Selenskyj, and the lawyer himself knows very clearly that his intentions are delicate. "We do not interfere in a choice, we interfere in an investigation that we have the right to do," he says in the newspaper. It can be considered that it is inappropriate, but "there is nothing illegal for my clients." Giuliani wants to be assisted by my government, which is hardly a basis. "
The lawyer and former New York Mayor seem to have been infected with the right conspiracy fantasies that are tied to Trump's countercandidate in the 2016 election: Hillary Clinton had conspired with actors in Ukraine, critics said then to construct an occasion for Russia's investigation in the USA. However, this accusation was never taken seriously.
This is precisely the investigation that Trump will speak so prominently on the phone with Selenskyj in July. The version of Giulianis and the President says: The former Vice-President and currently prominent candidates for the presidential candidate of the Democrats, Joe Biden, had as a Ukrainian officer of the Obama government on the release of the then Ukrainian General Attorney General Wiktor Chocolate, pressing financially for Ukraine to stop the corrupt investigation of the gas company in whose supervisory board his son Hunter HBiden was active. Biden senior has pressed Ukraine financially to stop the corrupt of his family.
In fact, the process was something different. When Joe Biden called for the Ukrainian Attorney General to leave, the investigation against the gas company had already been completed, Hunter Biden was never directly affected. Chocolate was also profoundly accused of being corrupted, the US government was not the only Western partner who pressed for his release. In addition, the Obama government even expressly supported the investigation against the company.
Interference with Instagram Facebook and Whatsapp: Social media are down
Users worldwide report massive disturbances with Instagram and Facebook. Consequently, mainly Germany, Great Britain and Spain are affected. On the website all disturbances. Users report that Facebook has not been downloading since about 15.30. Instagram also announces the error message that content could not be loaded. Whatsapp also seems affected by the disturbances, although not yet in the same extent.
Instagram and Co. often affected by disturbances
It is not the first massive incident this year. Already in March and July the services had fallen out for several hours. As in the previous cases, users are also using Twitter this time especially to make their trouble air.
Polish scientists saved in the Antarctica
Three Polish scientists have been rescued from the Chilean Air Force from the Antarctic ice. They had travelled with a sludge boat and several miles away from their base when their engine failed. They were lucky in the accident - less than an hour needed the Chilean rescue helicopter to save.
Eduardo Mosquera, Commander of the 4th Chilean Air Brigade:
"At 9: 30 we received the message, shortly before 10: 00 we started, and good 20 minutes later we were over the slope boat."
Poland has operated the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station on King George Island since 1977, 19 scientists work there. The frozen researchers were safely brought back to their research station.
Attention: Smartphone NOT load wirelessly
Practical but harmful
Inductive technology via Qi standard is extremely practical, but should not be used.
As several new smartphones have come to the market, which support wireless loading and sell themselves very well - all ahead of the new iPhone 11 models, we would like to recall a study from the beginning of July. Though wireless loading of mobile devices is extremely practical, but not necessarily recommended.
Higher temperature adds battery
Researchers warn against the wireless loading of smartphones. According to the findings of the Universal of Warwick, this is extremely harmful to the devices. That's why the significantly larger heat development. If you charge a cell phone normally by cable, the battery heats up to 27 degrees within three hours. In the case of wireless loading, even when the smartphones are perfectly oriented on the charging pad, however, it is always measured over 30 degrees. If the phone is a little beside the coil, the temperature rises even higher. In addition, it also increases the watts of the charging pads, which in turn drives the power consumption to the height.
Capacity and lifetime
According to the researchers, the temperature for the durability of batteries is a decisive factor. Every degree plays a role. When loading with higher temperatures, the battery is not only in capacity, but it also does not last so long. The lifetime is therefore lower. The researchers therefore recommend that the smartphone always be uploaded by cable. As a battery exchange with modern smartphones is always associated with high costs, this is likely to be a helpful tip. Apple has finally increased the cost of a battery exchange even once again - and for all iPhones.
Practical
The technique is extremely convenient: simply put the device on a corresponding charging path - these are now even installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery is charged without a miserable cable salad and modest plug-in. However, as Qi (stands for inductive energy transmission) is implemented a worldwide standard that exceptionally even Apple is involved in, there are few restrictions. However, according to researchers, technology should only be used in exceptional cases.
Everest-Stau photographer: 13 8000 in six months
According to its own data, a nepalese mountain climber has climbed 13 of the 14 highest mountains in the world within just six months. Nirmal Purja (36) had reached the top of the Manaslu in Nepal and thus set up a record, informed his expedition organizer.
The former soldier wants to climb every 14 eighteenth thousand in seven months. Purja calls his project "Mission Possible." He has already made international headlines: from him comes a viral photo of mountain climbers who are on Mount Everest snake.
The picture of the mass range triggered a debate on stronger security measures on the 8848 meters high mountain and highest summit of the earth. In May eleven climbers had died in the victory within a few days.
A problem for Purja could be the encounter of the 14th eighteenth thousand: Currently, Chinese authorities are blocking the Xixabangma mountain in Tibet. As a reason for this, it is called bad weather. At the beginning of the week, Purja wrote on Twitter that Nepal's government wanted to speak to China to allow him to rise.
Four dead elephants discovered on Sri Lanka
Among the dead animals, there was also a wealthy elephant shoe, a police officer announced on Friday. "We suspect that the elephant was poisoned."
The four cadavers were found in a protected area near the famous and visited by many tourists earlier Field Festival Sigiriya. According to the police minister, the animals were probably between 15 and 25 years old. An autopsy was ordered to determine the cause of death.
In Sri Lanka, almost 200 elephants are killed every year. The perpetrators are often farmers on whose land the animals had previously been held unharmed. At the same time, about 50 people are killed by elephants every year. This is usually happening when the animals move through nearby their habitat villages.
According to estimates in Sri Lanka, only about 7,000 elephants live. Theoretically, the death penalty is due to their killing.
Holding British oil tanker leaves Iran
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" leaves Bandar Abbas harbour town more than two months after he was arrested by Iran. According to the IRNA, this was announced by Bandar Abbas's shipping agency. The Iranian Revolutionary Guard had set the British flag tanker on 19 July under the accusation of having failed to comply with the rules of the Law of the Sea in the Persian Gulf.
Management by Thomas Cook in criticism
The competent Economic Committee of the House wants to investigate the plague of the travel director Thomas Cook in full. This is to deal with the board's salary packages as well as with the question of why the British Government did not allow the survival of the companies that fought. "Our interest is in supervising the company as well as the control of external auditors," the committee chairman Rachel Reeves informed in London. "Obviously, we have to do it with a bad example of management givers."
According to experts, genes are overestimated at intestinal cancer risk
The role of genes in the family increased risk of intestinal cancer has been apparently overestimated so far. To this conclusion, researchers from the German Cancer Research Centre (DKFZ) Heidelberg come into a current study. Other risk factors such as family nutrition habits are likely to weigh more than so far. This had consequences for calculations of the individual intestinal cancer risk, the DKFZ scientists emphasise.
Elon Musk lets Tesla shares rise
This was written by Musk in an e-mail to Tesla employees published by the industry blog Electrek on Thursday (local time). The demand was strong so that Tesla could book 110 '000 orders, it continued in Musks newsletter.
The challenge is to bring the cars quickly to the customer. Tesla must offer as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked the information: Tesla's shares went out of trade with a plus of over six percent. The course has not been so strong for nearly four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered nearly 95 '000 cars and thus reached its best value.
Musk needs records to achieve its high goals. 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360 '000 to 400' 000 cars. For this, six-digit figures must be obtained in the current and coming quarter year. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is required, but here are the margins of profit. Despite the boom there were last losses.
Does British government want to circumvent Brexit law? Johnson restrained
The British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, is holding a cover on whether he is looking for ways of circumventing the last law adopted by Parliament against an unregulated Brexit; on a similar question he just said on Friday in front of journalists that his government would comply with applicable law.
The law stipulates that the government must request a postponement of the deadline for exit should not have been reached with the EU until mid-October. Johnson criticises this as a "capitulation law" which hampers negotiations with the EU.
Former British Prime Minister John Major had said on Thursday that Johnson could try to use "political chikane" to circumvent the law. Johnson could use a procedural trick that would postpone the entry into force of the law to the time after the EU exit.
Johnson said that he was striving for a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident to leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is to reach an agreement."
Iran is obviously driving uranium enrichment high
Iran's President Hassan Rohani has increased pressure on European contractors in the fight on the rescue of the historic nuclear agreement. "Unfortunately, the European States show inability or lack of willingness when it comes to concrete actions," said Rohani at a press conference on the edge of the UN General Assembly in New York on Thursday. In the event that they were not due to their promises, he put "further steps" away from the agreements of the courageously negotiated 2015 agreement.
Background is the conflict with the international agreement to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb, which in return contained the commitment to Teheran to normalize economic relations. In 2018, the United States, on its own, withdrew from the agreement to force Iran with "maximum pressure" to a change in the course of the policy considered aggressive in the Middle East. President Donald Trump's government wants to negotiate a new agreement with harder terms and now replaces strong sanctions against Teheran. Iran reacted with a renewed uranium enrichment in the Treaty.
The International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic is now using the centrifuges installed in early September with uranium or at least prepared for use. According to IAEA information, Iran is also preparing for the construction of more than 300 centrifuges.
Perhaps Europeans were not prepared to bear their part of the deal and therefore allowed the Iranians to bear the costs and the burden of pressing US sanctions alone, allegedly Rohani, but there will still be further talks that hopefully have a solution.
Rohani continues to contest Iran's settlement in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, after an attack on an important oil situation in Saudi Arabia in mid-September, the joint event changed: Germany, France and the United Kingdom followed on Monday the US assessment that Teheran was responsible for the attack. Originally, the Huthi rebels supported by Iran had known themselves to attack in Yemen, which was considered to be a false confession by the US. "We have nothing to do with it," Rohani confirmed his position on Wednesday.
"Those who make such accusations must provide evidence of this," said Rohani. However, the European leaders could not have done so during the talks with him during the UN General Debate. Instead, they would only have called for the rebels in Yemen not to carry out an attack like this. Rohani had met Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson in recent days.
Prior to possible talks with US President Trump, the far-reaching sanctions of the US administration had to be abolished, Rohani called on the Washington government to turn to a policy of "dialogue and reason."
Comet crossed by another star solar system
Astronomers are currently observing a comet from the deep parts of the world. This did not happen before. The comet allows feedback to other solar systems.
What was initially only a presumption has now been confirmed: an interstellar guest crosses through our solar system. The comet from the depths of space was baptized to 2I / Borisov after his discovery and raised the interest of astronomers all over the world.
On August 30, the most advanced comet was discovered by Amateurastronomer Gennadi Borissow at the Margo Observatory in Crimea - with a self-built telescope of 65 centimeters of diameter. Observations from various observatories confirmed not only that it was an unknown comet but also showed that it was not from our solar system.
After 1I / 'Oumuamua of 2017, 2I / Borisov is only the second interstellar object that was seen during a tour of our solar system.
2I / Borisov offers astronomers the rare opportunity to get insights into a foreign solar system from nearby before he disappears on nightseeing. First observations show that the interstellar comet is similar to that of our own system, as the astrophysical Institute of the Canaries reported. "The current speed of the comet is high, about 150,000 kilometres per hour, which is in this distance well above the typical speeds of objects surrounding the sun," reported Davide Farnocchia from the U.S. Space Authority Nasa in a communication.
According to the analyses, the comet is also responsible for the designation and categorisation of heavenly bodies, which leads him out of our system - and clearly interstellar origin, as the International Astronomical Union (IAU) announced. She also has responsibility for the designation and categorisation of heavenly bodies. In honour of his discoverer, the interstellar Swiss stars, which had first been led under the catalogue number C / 2019 Q4, her name is 2I / Borisov, while the first part of the name indicates that it is the second interstellar object discovered in our solar system.
The astronomers are lucky: Unlike 1I / 'Oumuamua, 2I / Borisov has already been seen on the way. Thus the researchers remain many months for investigations. "The object will reach the greatest brightness in the middle of December and will then be seen with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020," explained Farnocchia. "Then it will only be observed with larger professional telescopes by October 2020."
Several Observatories have already taken the visitor's view. Thus a team around Karen Meech from the University of Hawaii, which had already led the characterisation of 1I / 'Oumuamua, in a first study determined the diameter of the sky object to 2 to 16 kilometres. Recording of the Gemini Observatorium on Hawaii shows a clear welding of the comet.
Researchers of the Astrophysical Institute of the Canaries (IAC) have already gained a first so-called spectrum of the interstellar Swiss star, which offers a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object is similar to those of comets of our solar system, and this indicates that its composition must be similar," IAC researcher Julia de León reported. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form through similar processes as in our, the León colleague Javier Licandro.
The discovery of equal two interstellar visitors within just two years suggests that these objects could open a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems. However, how often such stepvisits are still difficult to estimate. One of the next interstellar visitors could possibly begin a planned satellite mission by the European Space Agency Esa.
By 2028, the Agency intends to deploy the three-part space probe "Comet Interceptor" on a waiting position in 1.5 million kilometres away from Earth (German like comet-catcher). According to Esa-Science Director Günther Hasinger, it will either lie on an untouched fresh comet from our own solar system, or on an interstellar visitor like 1I / 'Oumuamua.
First landing on Pekings new Mega Airport Daxing
On time before the 70th anniversary of the People's Republic, it is up to you: The new Mega Airport in the south of the Chinese capital has landed a first passenger machine of China United Airlines, a special honor for captain and crew.
By 2022, around 45 million passengers are to be manufactured each year at the new airport, and in 2025 it will be already 72 million. Chinese President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion expensive project. China's latest prestigious project is also called "seafarers" because of its six-arm building structure.
The complex has four runways to be extended to seven and is equipped with the world's largest automatic air traffic management system. A new subway train transports passengers to the city of Pekings in just 20 minutes.
Already during the construction, the Chinese had repeatedly assumed that Berlin could learn from Beijing. The opening of the capital airport in Germany, which was built since 2006, and much smaller, has been repeatedly postponed. In Beijing, however, a first passenger machine was landed after four years.
New oversound aircraft is scheduled to fly in 2030: In four and a half hours from London to Sydney
From London to Sydney in only four and a half hours - of which the UK Space Agency dreams. Possible to make this flight for the 2030s, a special drive (Synergetic Air Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre) developed by the company Reaction Engines from Oxfordshire, the US Sender CNN quoted the agency. "This is the technology that could definitely accomplish," said Chief of Agency Graham Turnock to the station. "We speak of the 2030s for the commissioning, and work is already very advanced."
In order to advance the project, the British Space Agency wants to work closely with the Australian community. A flight from the British capital to Australian metropolis currently lasts about 20 hours. As the only oversound aircraft for passenger transport, the Concorde had covered the New York-Paris route from 1976 until the end of its operation in 2003 and took three to three and a half hours to do so. In 2000, there was an accident at the start of a Concorde at the Paris Airport Charles de Gaulle, where all 109 people came to life. In the last year, the US-American aircraft designer Lockheed Martin's plan was known, together with the US Space Authority Nasa superflugue developed all aircraft. "
"Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transport," writes Reaction Engines among other things on its homepage. The Sabre drive could be used for efficient travel at a speed of Mach 5 - that means five times as fast as the sound. Furthermore, such aircraft are also usable outside the Earth's atmosphere and thus allowed the "next generation truly reusable space-travel equipment."
Rebellion in Washington: Trump wants to track down anonymous tippers in Ukraine affair
In the Ukraine affair for possible abuse of power by the US President, Donald Trump is trying to track down possible undense places in the White House.
"I want to know who gave the information to the Whistleblower," Trump said on Thursday in front of US Messenger staff at the United Nations in New York. The person concerned was almost "a spy" and in the past "a little different" than today.
This was considered as an intimidation attempt against tippers. The event was not actually public. However, several US media broadcast audio cuts from the speech on Friday. Democrats replied to the President's statement.
On Tuesday, the Democrats in the US House of Representatives announced preparations for an office prosecution procedure against Trump. Their accusations were mainly based on the written complaint of an anonymous intelligence officer who lifted serious accusations against Trump and its government centre. On great public pressure, the signs of the indictator had been made public on Thursday.
As part of his work, the Whistleblower wants to have received information from several government employees saying that the US President "uses the power of his office" to achieve that another country interferes in its favour in the US election 2020.
At the heart of the allegations, there is a controversial telephone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July, in which Trump encouraged his colleagues to investigate which could harm his political rival Joe Biden. This is about previous business of Biden's son Hunter in Ukraine and alleged efforts to protect his jumping from Ukrainian justice. Biden is in the race around the democratic presidential candidate for the election in 2020.
The Whistleblower also accused the White House of concealing with regard to Ukraine's telephone: leading government employees would have tried to keep the exact wording of the conversation under the ceiling. As usual an electronic text protocol had been created. However, after the conversation on the instructions of lawyers from the White House, this was removed from a normally planned database and was stored in a particularly protected system. To date, only a rough conversation protocol was published.
The identity of the guide is not publicly known. The "New York Times" reported that it should be a member of the CIA's foreign secret service.
Trump once again questioned the credibility of the source on Friday. In a series of Tweets on the subject, the president wrote, among other things, that the so-called Whistleblower had spread information from second hand that had proved to be incorrect. Therefore, there may not be any tips or spies at all.
As Trump expressed in New York about those who were supposed to have accessed the Whistleblower information, however, disgraceful. The president of the US representative house, Nancy Pelosi, reacted anxiously and complained, Trump's statement once again underruns the integrity of the government.
The House of Representatives has been conducting several investigations against Trump and its surroundings in various committees for months now. In view of the Ukrainian accusations, the Democrats are now pursuing investigations with new rage in order to initiate a possible office prosecution procedure against Trump.
"The Whistleblower has given us a roadmap for our investigation," said the Head of the Secret Service Committee in the Representative House, Adam ship. Trump attacked ship sharply, gave him a false presentation of things and once again demanded the resignation of the committee chairman. Trump seized ship regularly and had already requested its withdrawal months ago.
More than 300 former US government officials from the security and foreign policy field, most of whom were active under democratic but also under Republican presidents, stood behind the investigation initiated by the Democrats on Friday for a possible office procedure. If the accusations were preserved, that would be "a sceptical abuse of power" by Trump, it was in it.
There is no precise timetable for the further process. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could strive for a so-called impeachment procedure. However, the decision on actual postponement fell in the Senate where Trumps Republicans have the majority. The prospects for success of such a procedure are therefore small. So far, no US President has been dismissed by an impeachment procedure of the Office.
VW Works Council: Jobs are being "sloppy" depleted
The VW brand's plans to further reduce the costs in production could go to the detriment of manufacturing in Germany and Europe. This concern is reversing the Board of Commerce of the car owner. The brand wants to reduce its annual factory costs from EUR 10 billion by 2023 by EUR 2 billion, of which 500 million will be saved this year.
The "future pact" negotiated in 2016 between companies and works councils already provides for the reduction of 14.000 jobs in Germany alone by 2020. In principle, a job can only be reduced in the car industry if it is proved that the related activities are no longer necessary. In addition, employment security will apply by 2029.
However, as our newspaper now found out from business council circles, jobs in production, which are not actually available, are "sloppy" over another path - so past the official course. Thus, freelance regular posts would often not be re-occupied.
In these cases, the Works Council has no possibility to force the restoration. Meanwhile, there is a lack in many places of staff taking up labor density, the concern about a gradual outbreak of vehicle plants would increase. Thus, the fear that vehicle production could be withdrawn gradually from Germany and Europe, because it is more favourable in other parts of the world. From VW it only said: "An adjustment of the employment volume as agreed socially acceptable along the demographic curve."
The VW brand wants to standardize the production worldwide even more and centrally control new projects. It also aims to reduce costs and accelerate decisions - behind it is the goal of increasing productivity and thus competitiveness. At a management conference in Berlin, Andreas Tostmann said: "In unsafe times from Brexit to the threatening trade war between the US and China, we are well advised to make ourselves crisisproof."
In this way there are already successes: for example, this year's production costs per vehicle would fall for the first time since 2013 compared to the previous year. Before journalists Tostmann said that the production time for the Gulf 8, which is to be presented on 24 October in Wolfsburg, would be reduced by 1.1 hours. Exactly figures on the production duration do not call VW, according to the information of our newspaper it is at the Gulf 7 about
20 hours.
In our region, the Wolfsburg Stammwerk is the only VW factory in which vehicles are produced. The Braunschweig and Salzgitter finished components. For Wolfsburg VW-intern the Faustregel applies that there are 800,000 cars to be built there annually so that the plant is satisfactorily profitable. In 2018, however, the utilization in Wolfsburg was only about 700,000 vehicles - due to the falling diesel demand and the problems of switching to the new consumption and exhaust gas test procedure WLTP.
As the production board of Tostmann announced last year, in Wolfsburg, however, a million cars should be rolled off the band. This should allow the bundling of the golf production in the tribe - because the Zwickau plant renovates the golf production by refurbishing to the site for the e-car production.
In addition, the SUV Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) are produced in Wolfsburg. However, the sales figures of Gulf and Tiguan have last evolved. Therefore, the expectations are now resting on the Gulf 8. In spite of all efforts to build e-mobility, it is intended to remain the Wolfsburger's bread and butter car.
Forced with Voodoo to prostitution: Human traffickers condemned
Young women from Nigeria have been occupied with shade, slept into the Ruhr area and forced to prostitute. Six suspected traffickers must go to prison for this.
Six suspected traffickers from Nigeria were sentenced to probation and prisoner sentences of up to eight years and three months on Friday in Bochum. The accused had slept young women from Nigeria into the Ruhr area and forced them to prostitute. In order to force their obedience, the reluctant Nigerians had still had to take a ritual swing in the home before a voodoo priest.
The victims were between 17 and 22 years old. They were brought to the Mediterranean by means of libyan sludges. However, the dream of a better future did not fulfil itself. In Germany, they were distributed to different boards to deal with the alleged lubricants costs of an average of 25 000 euros. Therefore, their wages were completely reduced.
The defendants - four men and two women - had admitted the lock-in and the subsequent distribution of young Nigerians to boards in the process. "The work made women physically and mentally difficult to create," Judge Isabel Hoffmann said in the conviction. "Some were properly opposed."
The judgments refer to industrial and tyre-related displacement of foreigners, trafficking in human beings, pimp and heavy forced prostitution.
Ufo calls for negotiations with Lufthansa
FIm Daustretit with the Lufthansa Group has again threatened Ufo with strikes.
If the company did not return to the negotiating table, the trade union would "inform on 14 October about the labour struggles in the LH Group," Ufo's collective board Daniel Flohr announced on Friday. Lufthansa and her daughter Eurowings have for months refused to conduct collective bargaining with the Ufo Group. It is also about whether the trade union has legally terminated collective agreements with Lufthansa.
On this point, Ufo is now looking for a decision by the Labour Court Frankfurt now strengthened. Lufthansa wanted to make it clear that the collective agreements were not terminated. The court rejected the applications. The company confirmed the decision and examined the appeal against it. "That a second court sees the matter completely differently, I think it is unlikely," said Ufo Board Flohr.
In August, Lufthansa also submitted an application to the German Labour Court in Frankfurt to have the status of Ufo as a trade union checked in court. The company argues that the trade union has not set up a representative board for months and is therefore unable to fill its role as a collective partner.
Prior to this, there was a heavier dispute in the partnership, in which many members of the board and the council have resigned, including the long-standing Chief of Trade Unions Nicoley Baublies. Ufo had suspended an already-begun disagreement on the strike of the cabin staff at Eurowings at the end of July due to the doubts about its leadership.
Facilitated entry: Saudi Arabia announces new visa system
So far Saudi Arabia has not been known as an international tourist magnet, but it is now to change. The country at the Persian Gulf wants to introduce new visa rules.
With a new visa system Saudi Arabia wants to attract more international tourists in the future. By 2030, the number of international and domestic visitors would be increased to 100 million per year, the Tourism Commission informed.
"The opening of Saudi Arabia to international tourists is a historic moment for our country," said the chairman of the Tourism Commission, Ahmad Al-Chatib.
Saudi Arabia is difficult to access for tourists so far. Visas are usually only available for short business trips, religious pilgrimages or visitors forgiven with relatives in the desert state. With the new rules, the ArchConservative kingdom hopes to increase revenue from tourism business. According to his own statement, Riad wants to reduce its dependence on oil trade.
In mid-September, several rockets and drones had hit two of the most important oil plants in the east of Saudi Arabia: the country's largest oil refinery in Abkhaik and the Churais oil field. As a result, national oil production drastically broke into the level of oil prices. It should take several weeks until the Kingdom's oil production reaches its old level again.
Justin and Hailey Bieber are in preparation for wedding festival
Singer Justin Bieber (25) and his wife Hailey (22) are preparing for their wedding party. The model posted on Thursday (local time) in their Instagram Stories several party photos on which she can be seen in the white wedding look. Reality Star Kendall Jenner (23) and others had arranged a bachelor's farewell in Los Angeles according to the People Magazine.
Justin posted several colorful, including bananas printed suits on Instagram and asked his followers: "Help me choose my smoking for the wedding." According to media reports, the celebration pair wants to marry church next weekend.
The Biebers gave themselves the word "yes" in a New York City Office a year ago. There was no greater festival at that time.
In an interview with the Australian Vogue, Hailey recently explained that after initial problems, the two had found a common level: "If you don't want to enter into compromises, you can't have a relationship."
Two deaths at plane crash in the Czech Republic
Two people died when a small aircraft crashed in the west of the Czech Republic. The wreck was discovered on Friday in a forest area near the city of Mecin (Metschin), the police informed us. The dead were a 38-year-old woman and a 64-year-old man.
The authorities had been searching for the machine since Thursday night after the crew had issued an emergency signal by GPS. In the search there was also a military helicopter in use. The cause of the accident still needs to be detected. The crash site is about 30 kilometres south of Pilsen (Plzen) and 100 kilometres north-east of Regensburg.
Half of the European trees are threatened with extinction
In addition to pests are diseases, alien species, non-sustainable wooden beating and the growth of cities causes the threat, the World Nature Protection Union IUCN reported on Friday in Brussels. She has examined the stocks of all 454 trees known in Europe. 265 of them are not present on any other continent. Of these 265 are threatened 58 percent. 66 hours would already be at the highest level of danger and thus before extinction.
The IUCN shares endangered species in six categories: from "potentially endangered" to "endangered," "severely endangered," "endangered" and "extinct in nature" to "extinct." Overall, it lists more than 28,000 species of animals and plants worldwide than endangered.
Threatened Everish and Wild Rosary
In Germany Eberese (Sorbus) are threatened mainly, one of the authors, David Allen, the German press agency. "Most are threatened because the populations are small anyway or by the transformation or weakening of their habitats."
It also looks bad for the wild common Roscastania. Since 2017 they have been considered "threatened," level two of the IUCN scale. The greatest threat is the Balkans mini mott. It has spread from the 1980s from South East Europe across the continent and has hardly natural enemies. IUCN estimates the number of wild Roscastania (Aesculus hippocastanum) in Europe to less than 10,000 copies. Not taken into account in this assessment are the trees in cities, parks and alone.
Straucharts and Moose also in danger
The IUCN scientists at the same time created new European red lists for molluscs, shrubs and moose. More than a fifth of molluscs and moose and almost half of all straw species are threatened, according to the IUCN. This is mainly due to the destruction of the wilderness, the species involved, agricultural practices and climate change. Soft animals such as snails played a key role in the recycling of nutrients in the soil and are an important source of food for birds and other animals.
"This report shows that the situation is precarious for many overlooked and underestimated species, species that form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet," said Luc Bas, IUCN Director of the European Office. "We must limit the impact of humans on our ecosystems and make the protection of these species a priority."
Earthquake before Istanbul: 34 Injured reported
In recent earthquake in Turkey 34 people have been injured. According to the data, there were no dead people. Dozens of people had to leave their homes, 14 schools in Istanbul had been closed for security reasons, said Turkish Vice-President Fuat Oktay on Friday.
Hundreds of buildings were therefore damaged. Since the beast on the previous day there have been almost 200 afterbuoys. On Thursday, the earthquake of strength 5.8 had shaken the Marmararegion before Istanbul and caused panic in the millions of metropolis.
Now the government wanted to set up a Commission to better prepare the country for earthquake in the future, announced Oktay. In the past 20 years Turkey had not been sufficiently prepared for beasts, said Istanbul's mayor Ekrem Imamoglu.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly deprived of earthquake. Under the marble is a section of the so-called North Anatolic disturbance that marks the border between the Eurasian and the Anatolic Earth plate.
One of the heaviest beetles was one of the strengths of 7.6 in 1999 near Istanbuls. At that time, the Epicenter was located in Gölcük southeast of Istanbuls. More than 17.000 people were killed.
Already on Tuesday a quake of strength 4.6 had shaken the region around Istanbul. The authorities called the inhabitants to stay away from damaged buildings.
Super Bowl 2020: Jennifer Lopez (JLo) and Shakira show in the mid-term show
The Latin pop singers Jennifer Lopez and Shakira will lead the half-time show of the next American Football Finals Super Bowl. This announced the singers at Twitter. "It won't be bigger," Shakira wrote to a photo of herself and Lopez. She was mad at standing on the Super Bowl stage. On February 2, 2020 it will be so far in Miami.
Jennifer Lopez explained that she had dreamed of performing at the Super Bowl since 1996 - then she saw Diana Ross flying into the sky at the half-time show. "Now it's still special because the NFL exists 100 years and I will perform with another Latina." She could hardly wait to show "what we girls can do on the biggest stage in the world."
Shakira pointed out in a statement that she was honored to stand on one of the largest scenes worldwide and to represent Latin and Latin from the United States and the whole world. "And then on my birthday!" The main sponsor of the event wrote on Twitter that it was the first time that the two "queens" were on a stage together.
Shakira comes from Colombia. Jennifer Lopez was born in New York, her parents come from Puerto Rico.
Fight against decreasing audience numbers
The Super Bowl is the highlight of the American football season. The game and the mid-term show are among the most viewed TV broadcasts of the USA. Even though you have recently dropped audience numbers: In February the spectacle attracted the least spectacles in the USA for more than ten years. Nevertheless, there were still nearly a hundred million people on average.
On the mid-term show of the last Super Bowl there had been rebellion in advance: In the struggle with quarterback Colin Kaepernick, topstars such as Rihanna, Pink and Cardi B did not want to appear last February. Finally, the Popgroup Maroon 5 introduced the mid-term show - the criticisms were little friendly.
Kaepernick, then quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, had taken over the gesture in 2016 / 17 before NFL games in the national hymn of protest against police violence and racism. With his protest, Kaepernick triggered a movement, many players took over the gesture. This caused great excitement, US President Donald Trump attacked the mostly African American football stars sharply. Kaepernick himself has been united since March 2017 and has no longer challenged NFL party. He prefers to not hire him for political reasons.
Cook-Pleite: Hotels get money from insurance
Some banks are expected to be expensive according to a press report to the price of the travel provider Thomas Cook. High depreciation on outstanding bonds and loans is threatened. This also affects the Credit Suisse, writes the Financial Times in its issue of Friday.
Banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit or the Credit Suisse would probably have to make a total depreciation of up to 1.8 billion British pounds (around 2 billion euros) on their books, according to the report.
The creditors of bonds would have to purchase debits from 900 million to 1 billion pounds and the creditors between 550 and 825 million pounds. The amounts actually depreciating are expected to lie at the top of the bandwidth, an expert said to the magazine.
The extent to which the creditors' losses will actually be at the end of the bankruptcy process will show themselves. A person close to this procedure did not spill too much hope. For example, the around 40 aircraft of Thomas Cook in the UK are "old" and many of the properties are in bad positions. Most money could probably be withdrawn with the sale of the airport slots as well as the brand Thomas Cook, it continued.
Rackete must have brought suspected murderers to Italy
Sea Watch Captain Carola Rackete may have brought men to Italy who were supposed to have tortured and killed people in Libya. "We cannot exclude this, but have no secure information on it," said the spokesman of the Refugee Organisation Sea-Watch, Ruben Neugebauer, the news agency dpa.
Other migrants would have recognized the three men in Italy. They were accused of raping, torturing and killing people in Libya. The suspected perpetrators had been arrested in the host camp in the Italian Messina. Rebuilt stressed that the refugee organisations could not check who they left on their ships. "They came without passports."
Carola Rackete had brought illegal migrants to the port of Lampedusa on 29 June, with a ship embraced by the Italian financial police. On that day the three suspects should have arrived there. The captain is investigating for aid to illegal immigration.
USA warns federal government against Huawei
The head of the US Internet Authority Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, has warned the Federal Government to trust the Chinese network equipment Huawei.
We believe that the risks are too high, "Pai said to the" trade sheet "with a view to the construction of the new 5G mobile network.
China has a "national security law" which requires each company to "under Chinese jurisprudence" to follow the instructions of the security bodies.
The current law also prohibits companies from informing third parties about such questions, "said FCC Chief. This makes it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
In the meantime, the Federal Government has agreed to ask suppliers for a "confidentiality declaration."
First, Berlin wanted to try to control the risks, for example with technical solutions, the "trade paper" reports using its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible. The 5G technology does not consist only of the hardware:
Just the software is important to keep the devices up to date. This software consists of billions of lines of program code that change over time, "said Pai.
It is "very difficult to imagine" that a government authority, "wherever, would be able to check every individual update in real time to track security risks," said FCC Chief.
The Chinese group Huawei is presenting close contacts with the Chinese state apparatus:
Property relationships are intransparent. The employee company, which allegedly belongs to the company, is not necessarily independent of the government, "Pai said the" trade paper. "
The United States was informed that government employees were placed within the company. Pai was recently for talks in Berlin to promote the position of the United States.
Chemical factory in North France burns: Schools closed
In the night, residents hear explosions. A gigantic firewall illuminates the sky over a North French chemical factory. The fire is erased after hours - but the refreshment can now take days.
After a fire in a chemical factory in the North French city of Rouen on Thursday, the schools and cripples remain closed in the region.
In twelve municipalities, the facilities would not be carefully opened on Friday, informed the competent prefecture. The Ministry of the Interior had asked the citizens to stay as far as possible in buildings and not suspend the smoke. Injury was not found. Farmers and breeders were invited to bring their animals inside, protect their feed and first stop harvesting.
The fire could be completely deleted on Thursday night, as the prefecture announced. There is still a risk that after the eradication smell spread, so the prefecture on Twitter. According to the prefecture, 240 firemen and 90 police and gendarms were in use at the site of fire.
A gigantic black smoke column had previously emerged from the chemical factory. French media reported huge flames and explosions in the factory of Lubrizole, producing the additive for oil. The production plant is a few kilometres away from the city center.
The factory in Normandy belongs to the so-called Seveso category of dangerous sites, which are particularly monitored. In Italy Seveso in Milan, a devastating chemical accident occurred in 1976.
The prefect of the Normandy region, Pierre-André Durand, said to the news station BFMTV that there was no "high toxicity" first found in samples. However, pollution of the nearby Seine could not be excluded. In the river dust dams had been built against pollution, the prefecture explained.
The fire broke out early in the morning at 2.40 p.m., reported the authorities. The cause remained unclear at first. Rouen is a regional metropolis and lies at the Seine between Paris and the port city of Le Havre.
French Minister of Finance: "Germany must invest now"
The French Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs, Bruno Le Maire, has called on Germany to invest more to stimulate economic growth in the euro area.
Germany must invest now, the sooner the better, "said Le Maire on Thursday night in the presentation of the French budget for the next year.
The euro area economy was weaker, the Minister warned.
We must not wait until the economic situation gets worse in order to make the necessary decisions. "
Le Maire said that the countries that had budgetary options for more investment should act, among other things, with regard to Germany.
France did not have these margins, the Minister added and referred to the high government debt of his country. This is more than 98% of gross domestic product. French government debt had to be "stabilized" and "reduced," Le Maire said.
In recent years, France has been calling on Germany to make more public investment to revive the European economy. In return, German politicians have repeatedly called on France to tackle its budget deficit.
The French budget presented on Thursday for 2020 provides for tax relief of more than EUR 9 billion for households.
This means that the French government responds, among other things, to the protests of the Yellow West movement. The new debt is expected to fall to 2.2 percent, according to expected 3.1 percent this year.
Is he still trying to trick?: Johnson avoids question about Brexit tactics
The British Prime Minister Johnson strongly criticises the "capitulation law" adopted by Parliament.
Parliament is back, a law requires the British Prime Minister to avoid a chaos-brexit, but critics fear that Boris Johnson could still use a clump. However, this option is addressed by the Tory politician.
The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is keeping himself covered about whether he wants to enforce an unregulated Brexit - despite the last law adopted by Parliament, which is exactly what is to prevent. Johnson just said to journalists that his government would comply with the law in force.
The law stipulates that the government must request a postponement of the deadline, no agreement should be reached with the EU until mid-October. Johnson criticizes this as a "capitulation law" which hampers negotiations with the EU.
The former British Prime Minister John Major had on Thursday expressed the presumption that Johnson could try to use "political chikane" to circumvent the law. The Prime Minister could use a procedural trick that would postpone the entry into force of the law to the time after the EU's exit. Johnson said he would strive for a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident to leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is the one with an agreement."
Johnson's chief consultant Dominic Cummings said that he felt the political struggle around the Brexit as a "walk in the park," and was confident that the desired EU exit was still coming: "We will enjoy that, we will win, we will leave (Anm.d. Red.: from the EU), no worries," said Cummings of the British newspaper "Telegraph."
Cummings, who led the Brexit campaign "Vote Leave" during the 2016 EU referendum, is now acting as the head of the British government office Downing Street. He is supposed to be behind the uncompromising policy that led the Prime Minister to an unresolved situation.
"The Polaroid Diaries" by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - they all stood in front of the camera of Linda McCartney, which has become one of the very big rock photographers. But it doesn't always have to be the great glamour. The photobuch "The Polaroid Diaries" (pockets) appears deep into the very private world of the McCartney family.
Paul McCartney, who was married to her from 1969 until Linda's death in 1998, was obviously proud and touched when he presented the film band "The Polaroid Diaries" in the middle of September at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Among the illustrated guests included Ringo Starr, Stella McCartney, Olivia Harrison and Pretenders Frontwoman Chrissie Hynde.
After the launch of the event, McCartney wrote at Instagram: "# ThePolaroidDiaries is a fleeting look into the life of an extraordinary family from the time before Instagram, a celebration of LindaMcCartney's legacy as an engaging artist and the immediate magic of the Polaroid film."
With Linda McCartney, who had studied art history at the University of Aizona until she found her photography, the camera was always there. Thousands of Polaroids have made it, some hundred of them are now published in The Polaroid Diaries for the first time.
It is portraits, still life, landscapes, several hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 1970s until the late 1990s. "She wanted real moments," writes the art critic Ekow Eshun in his predecessor. And of course, one is always at the heart of: your husband Paul - as you may never have seen him.
Then he dances with his daughter Mary on the shoulders, calls in the bathrobe with a bag on his head or wears unforged moonboots. Certainly, the McCartney's were an extraordinary family, but beyond the headlight on her farm in Southern Gland or Scotland also had a perfectly normal life. Thus Mary McCartney said that she had slept in a bed as a baby that her father had bathed from old potato boxes. And it was not always cleaned with the McCartney's.
How hardly another medium catches the Poloraid camera the immediate moment. The recordings of Linda McCartney are certainly a kind of family diary, but they are much more than pure snapshots.
It is about the decision-making click: You have to recognise when a great photo happens before you. And then you have to squeeze it at exactly the right moment, "said Paul McCartney." If you cut two seconds later or two seconds earlier, it could be a completely different photo. "And Linda would have had the gift to always catch the right moment." She just knew she had it, "Paul said in the Eshun Essay.
The light, the composition, the image section and the colors, which makes "The Polaroid Diaries" not only a fun picture book for Beatles fans, but also a great aesthetic pleasure, where landscapes seem like abstract paintings. The perfect supplement to the recently created Beatles album "Abbey Road," which appeared exactly 50 years ago.
"We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran"
In spite of the US sanctions imposed against Iran, Turkey intends to continue to import oil and gas from the neighbouring country. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview published on Friday that Turkey could not interrupt oil and gas imports from Iran.
We will continue to buy our natural gas from there, "said Erdogan in New York, where he had participated in the UN General Assembly.
However, Erdogan admitted that Turkey had problems with importing Iranian oil as some companies had "withdrawn" because of the US threats.
Nevertheless, Turkey "will continue our relations with Iran, particularly in this matter and many other issues," said the Turkish President, who had repeatedly criticised the US sanctions against Iran in the past.
Since its exit from the international nuclear agreement with Iran, the US has pursued a policy of "maximum pressure" towards the Islamic Republic. According to the United States, Iran has been pursuing a nuclear programme in secret and does not comply with the agreement.
Their sanctions have led to the collapse of Iranian oil exports and a serious economic crisis in Iran.
US government wants to restrict the admission of refugees
The US government wants to drastically reduce the reception of refugees. The US Foreign Ministry stated on Thursday that the annual ceiling for a resettlement programme should be reduced from currently 30.000 to 18.000 refugees, which corresponds to an average of 40 percent.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the United States would continue to be committed to supporting refugees, but the most important task is to protect and serve US citizens. At the moment the US immigration system was overburdened.
The US Government wants to focus in the future on the inclusion of two refugee groups: people who are being persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and are thus in danger, as the Foreign Minister's Declaration shows; however, from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, a maximum of 1500 refugees are to be taken in.
The 1980 programme selects refugees from UN camps worldwide and relocates them to the United States. The ceiling of 18.000 refugees for the 2020 financial year would be the lowest in the history of the programme. The current ceiling of 30.000 is a low value. When the predecessor of US President Donald Trump, Barack Obama, left the White House, the figure was almost 85.000.
Assistance organisations were disappointed at the announced reduction of the ceiling. "This is a very sad day for America," said the Head of the International Rescue Committee, David Miliband. The US would thus further harm their leadership in protecting the most vulnerable people in the world.
Trump attempts to strictly limit immigration to the United States - legally and illegally - and according to its own data, the US government expects 350,000 asylum applications for the coming financial year. These figures are separate from the resettlement programme.
Donald Trump - "Coming near a Spitzel"
US President Donald Trump has accused the spies of the Whistleblower affair. Whoever has given the informant who has accused him of abuse of power, "comes close to a tip," said Trump according to a record of a private event on Thursday in New York. Reporting several US media consistent.
Therefore, Trump spoke to American UN mission staff. When he was asked about the person who informed the Whistleblower about controversial events in the White House, he said, "That's coming close to a spit." Then Trump added: "Do you know what we did in the old days when we were smart? Right. The spies and treason we used to deal with a little bit differently than we did now."
Observers appreciated the latter remark on a possible response to the death penalty. Democrats exercised sharp criticism of Trump's statements and gave him intimidation of witnesses. It was also a attempt to impede a congress investigation into a possible office procedure against him, the chairmen of the committees for foreign affairs, secret services and supervision in the House of Representatives wrote.
The Whistleblower claims to the President in a now published complaint that he has abused his office in order to ask another country to intervene in the US election 2020. In concrete terms, it is about his controversial telephone call with his Ukrainian colleague Wolodymyr Selensky in the summer: Trump suggested that he should investigate his possible democratic challenger Joe Biden and his son Hunter in Ukraine. Trump contends any misconduct.
It is still unclear who are both the Whistleblower itself and its informants. However, as the New York Times reports, the Whistleblower is supposed to be an analyst of the CIA's foreign secret service.
Refugee boat concert: Baby and infants drowned in Aegean
Every time people try to get across the Aegean Sea from Turkey to Greece. The often too small boats often present. Seven migrants have now died - including five children.
In front of the Greek island of Chios, seven migrants were killed in the fall of a slug boat. Among the death victims were also a baby and four other children, the Greek Coast Guard reported. Four children, three women and five men could therefore be rescued from the flood from the crew of a passing ferry.
Among the victims should also be a Schleuser, the local news portal of Chios, Alithia.gr. The migrants had broken up in the morning from Turkey. They had tried to reach the small island group Inousses in the north-east of the island of Chios. Inousses lies between Chios and the Turkish mainland.
Hundreds of migrants from Turkey are currently moving to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean, mostly in far too small boats. Last year, according to United Nations Refugee Assistance Agency (UNHCR), 174 people died on this route.
The Who Cancel Concert
A US concert of the Rockband The Who has found a year's end because of leadsänger Roger Daltrey. In the middle of the show on Wednesday night (local time) in Houston, his voice failed. Daltrey said to the audience at the eighth song: "I think I should let it go as long as it is still running."
Lead guitarist Pete Townsend asked to apologize and added that Daltrey could "really not speak now." Townsend promised the audience to come to his expense at a reconciliation concert. However, an appointment is not yet fixed.
For Friday in Dallas and for Sunday in Denver, the only remaining founding members were the 75-year-old Daltrey and his 74-year-old band Townsend. The British cult band formed 55 years ago.
Rental sudden set: WeWork lets real estate markets shake
In New York, WeWork has become the largest office tenant.
Within a few years, WeWork rises from the small start-up to the driving force on the most expensive real estate markets in the world. But now the company is in crisis. Users have to fear billions of revenues.
The crisis of the office rental WeWork threatens to disturb the balance on the world's largest real estate markets. The company had suspended the founder Adam Neumann a few days ago as boss, postponed the planned stock exchange and started selling subsidiaries and values such as the private jet for the managers to gain financial space for the coming weeks and months. In addition, WeWork has stopped the completion of new leases with immediate effect, including in New York and London, the largest tenant of office areas suddenly reports from the market.
WeWork rentes large office areas in the long term and rentes them in part small units to members in the short term. This can be individual volunteers, small startups or entire departments of large companies. So far WeWork burns money with this business at breathtaking speed. Last year the company entered a loss of 1.6 billion dollars, at a turnover of 1.8 billion dollars. This year alone, the rental costs by leasing are supposed to have increased new large areas to an estimated 2.5 billion dollars. To limit the loss, the new company management is now to draw the emergency brake and to stop the leased new areas with immediate effect.
According to the Financial Times, WeWork has now concluded lease contracts with maturities of up to 15 years, resulting in commitments of more than 40 billion dollars. These huge liabilities could become a problem not only for the company itself and its investors, but for entire real estate markets.
According to calculations by the economist Dan Alpert from the Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork rented in Manhattan, one of the world's most expensive real estate markets in the past 24 months, almost 300,000 square meters of office space. WeWorks alone made new contracts to ensure that the demand for offices in New York was greater than the new areas that came into the market at this time. Without WeWorks expansion, the office vacancy in the US Metropolis would have increased in this time, as Alpert wrote in the "Business Insider." Similarly it looks in London where WeWork has been in several dozen offices in this time.
Even in the UK capital, the balance on the real estate market could be noticeably pushed without another expansion of the aggressive startup. Among other things, WeWork is the main tenant, in a office house purchased last year by the savings fund provider Deka for almost 100 million euros at the center of the financial metropolis.
Many residents have rebuilt their properties for the requirements of WeWork with high investment. If WeWork fails to make its business model profitable soon, the real estate owners would probably have to write off part of the expected billions of revenue. Access to WeWork reserves - in any case scarce - they did not have, despite the long-term lease contracts. Because the rental of the individual sites of WeWork is usually carried out by any extra-founded subsidiaries, so-called Special Purpose Vehicles, for which the parent company has only limited limits.
Russia again seized numerous North Korean fishermen
The Russian Coast Guard has again committed North Korean fishermen. In the past few days, a total of 262 other wilders who had been illegally fished in the waters had been arrested, according to the Russian Home Secret Service FSB informed Interfax on Friday.
Only ten days ago 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. Previously the border guards had been shot and three of them were injured. This time there were no injuries, it was said. The Communist North Korea suffered from chronic food shortages.
The North Korean fishermen were therefore on their way in Russian territorial waters. Russia's Coast Guard runs according to its own information on the protection of its marine biological resources patrols. During the re-inspections, 30,000 ink fish were discovered. In addition, the data were seized after three fishing and two motorboats and brought to Nachodka and Posjet at Wladiwostok. According to Ria Nowosti, the Coast Guard in 2018 found more than 8,000 infringements.
The Russian Fisheries Authority had also not issued any fishing licences to the North Koreans following complaints from local entrepreneurs today. Thousands of fishermen from North Korea have been arrested there in 2019 according to the media.
The head of the Association of Russian Fishermen in the distant region of Primorje, Georgi Martynow, recently also complained about high environmental damage caused by the North Korean fishermen. They were fishing with narrow synthetic nets prohibited in Russia. These would also bring small creatures from the sea. Furthermore, the nets would simply be disposed in the sea where they would need 200 years to be replaced. Even the ships themselves do not comply with hygienic and technical regulations.
According to Moscow, three members of the Russian Coast Guard were injured during the arrests in the previous week. According to the FSB, a also wounded North Korean man died later of his injuries. On that 17 September Russian border guards first arrested a North Korean boat and then a second one after this had opened the fire.
USA imposes a prohibition of entry against ex-President Castro
The US has imposed prohibitions against the former Cuban President Raúl Castro and his children. The US Ministry of Foreign Affairs founded this in a communication on Thursday with Castros' participation in "gross human rights violations." As head of the Communist Party of the Caribbean State, he stands for a system in which thousands of Cubans are arbitrarily arrested and there are more than 100 political prisoners.
As chairman of the armed forces, the brother of the dead revolutionary leader Fidel Castro was also involved in human rights violations there by supporting President Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. "The violation of human rights and the use of violence by the Cuban regime to support the former Maduro regime are responsible for the ongoing crises in Cuba and Venezuela," the American Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo twittered.
On Wednesday, President Donald Trump had expelled prohibitions against members of the Venezuelan government and the military. In Venezuela, for months, a bitter power struggle has been committed between the government and the opposition. The United States have imposed a whole series of sanctions against Maduro's government to force him to kneel and help the opposition leader and self-named interim president Juan Guaidó to power.
Cuba is considered one of the closest allies of Maduros. The socialist Caribbean island receives oil from Venezuela in exchange for the services of posted doctors. According to the United States and the Venezuelan opposition, Cuba has also sent numerous secret service agents to Venezuela to help the government to oppress government opponents.
New climatic protests of Fridays for Future
A week after the so far largest international climate protests, Aberthousands of people want to go on the road for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, Fridays for Future is planning again actions and customer bands in dozens of countries worldwide. The beginning should be due to the shift of time in New Zealand and Australia before the protests over Europe to North America. There, Climate activist Greta Thunberg wanted to participate in a great speech in the Canadian Montreal. Also before the White House in Washington, demonstrators wanted to gather.
How great the global commitment will be this Friday after the record participation of the previous week is relatively unclear. Thunberg himself was good things. "Last Friday more than four million people were striving for the climate. This Friday we do it again!" she wrote on Twitter. So far, in the context of the strike week 6383 actions in 170 countries, she added.
Particularly in Germany, last Friday, the Zulauf was very large. A good third of all global demonstrators - about 1.4 million - had participated in the protests in 575 German cities. This time, a list of the movement has been planned in at least 65 cities. Below in metropolis such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller municipalities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt, people want to go on the road for climate.
At the age of 15, Thunberg had set itself before the Swedish Parliament in August 2018 to call on the politicians of their country to make greater use of climate protection. From this the Fridays-for-Future movement has emerged within a short time. In the climate protests, pupils and students are particularly involved, but increasingly also scientists and other adults.
Together, they demand more ambition from politics in the fight against global warming and the threat of climate disasters. In particular, according to the Paris Climate Agreement, global warming must be reduced to under 1.5 degrees compared to pre-industrial times.
Thunberg arrived in New York just a month ago after a two-week Transatlantic Tower with a high-sea racing hunt. She had last attended the United Nations climate protests and summits. On Monday she held an emotional speech at the UN, in which she spoke to the Heads of State and Government of the Earth. In her home Stockholm, she had been spoken to the Right Livelihood Foundation on Wednesday for their efforts to improve the climate protection of the Alternative Nobel Prize.
Russia forbids smoking on the balcony
The people of Russia are no longer allowed to smoke on the balcony in the future. This provides for a change in fire protection. "This also applies to smoking," said a spokesman of the Ministry of Emergency on Thursday in Moscow, said Tass, the agency. The ban is to enter into force on 1 October.
Anyone who smokes must therefore expect a fine of 3,000 rubles (42,46 euros). If the cigarette should unfold a fire, then the penalty will be higher. According to the Ministry, the prohibition also includes burning candles. Also meat picks on the balcony are no longer allowed.
Beating against cyber criminals - Investigators lift out servers
In the fight against crime on the Internet, German investigators have for the first time raised a large server provider for illegal business in the Darknet.
A total of 13 perpetrators are suspected to have hosted numerous websites on the Mosel as an operator of a data center in a former NATO bunker in Traben-Trarbach, which operates their activities through international criminals.
This was reported by the General Attorney General in Koblenz. Seven suspects were arrested on Thursday night in a major action. Darknet is a disguised part of the Internet.
Customers of the suspects should have been the operators of the world's second largest Darknet market place for drugs, "Wall Street Market," which had broken the investigator in spring. The attack on 1.25 million Telekom Router at the end of November 2016 was also controlled by a server in the Cyberbunker.
One such hoster had been raised for the first time in Germany, it was said. A webhoster provides the infrastructure for an Internet presence.
In the access operation with the support of special units such as the GSG9 there have been searches in Germany and neighbouring countries. It has been the result of almost five years of investigation. In the afternoon the investigators want to inform about further details.
New global climate protests of Fridays for Future
A week after the so far largest international climate protests, Aberthousands of people are going to go on the streets for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement planned again actions and customer events in dozens of countries worldwide.
In Germany, protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller municipalities and cities such as Jews in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt. Climate activist Greta Thunberg wants to participate in a great show in the Canadian Montreal.
Who are Thunberg's rear men?
Justice and courage are high virtues, even in the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoke factories that heat up the climate. Even more astonishing that a 16-year-old girl keeps the power people of this time the mirror in front of his nose. But what is behind it? Is it helpful or smart marketing of a climate activist? Historical masterpower or manipulative tactics for his own sake?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg puts the masses in motion and brings young people to raise themselves for a better climate-friendly world. It is historically not the first time in Europe that a young person can win a collection of children and adolescents. Already in 1212 a child named Nikolaus from Cologne felt excerpent to engage in a fairer world. At that time, he also won a set of young people for himself and convinced him to cross the sea to get to the beloved country, similar to Greta Thunberg recently made his journey to America with a sailing boat.
But is there a shadow page in this respect? Why does it need a share called "We don't have time" to save the world? Moreover, Greta Thunberg has rich PR managers on its side. In addition, her mother has published a book that has been widely sold thanks to the daughter in the light of the ramp. Even old followers of Greta Thunberg were a little disappointed about the last PR show, or the journey with the boat was probably also too thick to be done. This is not unfounded, because the action came in the media very well into effect and there was a lot of money flowing thanks to the imposant action.
This is where the spirits are separated: is it morally right to enrich financially in the court of the world? Is it still authentic if certain groups of people work together with stock exchanges during the World Justice Action? No matter what position is ultimately taken, a critical and reflective point of view is increasingly important in a democratically dominated society, because democracy lives by different opinions and discussions. Therefore, it can make sense also seem to be a good thing to question critically by certain trend players.
Comet discovered: Interstellar guest crosses through our solar system
A strange comet is crossing our solar system right now.
The assumptions of the astronomers have confirmed: a strange comet crosses through our solar system at the moment - it is only the second of his kind
Garching / Washington - The researchers have only long suspected it, but now they have certainty: A comet of another star crosses our solar system at the moment. He was baptized after his explorer 2I / Borisov and is currently working on astronomers worldwide.
2I / Borisov: Comet was discovered by Amateurastronomers in Crimea
The said body was discovered on Crimea by an amateur engineer named Gennadi Borissov. He looked with a self-built telescope to heaven and further follow-up confirmed his first suspicion. It is actually an unknown comet that does not come from our solar system. He is only the second of his kind that was seen during the flight.
The great opportunity for astronomers is now to gaze insight into a foreign solar system from nearby. Apparently, the comet is similar to that of our own system, as the African Institute of the Canaries reports. According to the International Astronomical Union (IAC), the comet is clearly interstellar origin and is currently moving on a so-called hyperbelbahn that leads it out of our system.
Comet has already been seen before arrival - and can be observed several months
But before it is so far, the astronomers can observe him thoroughly. Because, unlike his predecessor, 2I / Borisov has already been seen in his approach, which means that he can be investigated from Earth for many months. "The object will reach the greatest brightness in the middle of December and will then be seen with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020," says Davide Farnocchia from the U.S. Space Authority Nasa. "Then it will only be observed with larger, professional telescopes until October 2020."
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I / 2017 U1 "Oumuamua."
First findings about Comet 2I / Borisov raise hopes in science
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated to be 2 to 16 kilometres of diameter. At the same time, the sky body seems to be similar to our comet - because as the IAC researcher Julia de León expresses it, the spectrum of the Swiss star is similar to ours. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form through similar processes as in our, the León's colleague Javier Licandro complemented.
However, the observation goes beyond individual recognition. The fact that two such objects have already been discovered within just two years may allow a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems.
Asteroids employ the researchers again and again. Only recently a giant asteroid passed the earth and came dangerous near her.
"Absolutely reject": Rachel Johnson shocked about brother
Boris Johnson is becoming more lonely. First, his younger brother leaves the cabinet, now his sister eats with clear words the war language of the Prime Minister as "flawless." It is not the brother she knows.
"Surrender," "fraud," treaty ": Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure and continues to reassure - at least verbal. At Question Time in the subhouse this Wednesday, this was the result of a massive upsetting of the opposition, and now other critics have spoken: dozens of bishops and his own sister Rachel Johnson.
The famous journalist and author said to the Sender Sky News, her brother uses words like surrender, as if the opponents of an EU exit were "hanged, pulled, quadrupled, edited and feathered." They consider this to be extremely disgusting. They do not recognize the version of their brother again, Rachel Johnsons, who had joined the anti-Brexit Party in the elections to the European Parliament.
In particular, she insisted that her brother Jo Cox mentioned, an EU-friendly subhouse member who had been murdered by a Neonazi in 2016, a few days before the exit referendum. Her memories could best be honored by moving the Brexit, Boris Johnson had said in the subhouse. "It was very tastless to refer to a member who was murdered by someone who 'Britain first' rief," now criticised Johnson's sister. The perpetrator was obviously cut off from the right-wing camp that "felt" by this kind of language. "
The widow of Cox also criticized the Prime Minister sharply. "It makes me sick when Jo's name is used like this," he twittered. The best way to honor them was if you were passionate and determined for what you believe in - no matter what you think you are. But never should you "demonize the other side." He also complained that an atmosphere had arisen, had become more likely in the attacks.
Only a few weeks ago Boris Johnson's younger brother Jo had laid down his office as State Secretary and his mandate as a Tory Member. "In the past few months I had been torn up between loyalty to family and national interest - it is an insoluble tension," Jo Johnson founded the step.
Johnson's language was also on sharp criticism in the Church. As the "Times" reports, all 118 bishops and Archbishops of the Church of England criticise the language that "this country is not worthy." In a joint statement they said: "In recent days, the language, both in debates and outside the Parliament, has been unacceptable. We should speak with respect."
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez show up at the Super Bowl
The NFL sets a strong sign in the year of its 100-year existence: in the mid-term show of the coming Super Bowl two women with Latin roots are performing. They promise "an explosion of fun and energy."
Latina power at the Super Bowl: The Superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will deliver the half-time show at the forthcoming final of the US Football League NFL. This was announced by the organizers on Thursday (local time).
"I feel incredibly honored and humiliated to represent the Latin community next to JLo, because it has an incredible strength in the United States," Shakira announced in a video.
The final of the American football league, which celebrates its 100th birthday next year, will take place in Miami on February 2. In the metropolis on the south tip of Floridas many people live with Latin American roots. Shakira ("Waka Waka") comes from Colombia, Lopez ("On the Floor") is puerto-rican origin.
"I love the Super Bowl putting two women on stage this time - and two Latin's," Lopez said. This is sending an important message to all Americans and the world. She promises for the show "an explosion of fun and energy."
The 50-year-olds were born in New York after their parents emigrated from Puerto Rico. In the 2000s, she landed with songs like "Waiting For Tonight" or "Let's Get Loud" big hits and later released songs in Spanish. Lopez also works as an actress and is seen in the drama "Hustlers" in the German cinemas from November.
Shakira was known in Colombia as a star of a telenovela and singer. Her global breakthrough was created in 2001 with her first two-language album and the single "Whenever, Where ever."
The announcement of the mid-term guests is expected in the USA every time with tension. This year many also value the selection as a political gesture. Finally, the country is deeply divided, not least through President Donald Trump's immigration policy.
The Super Bowl is the largest US sports event and at the same time a gigantic advertising spectacle. Musicians such as Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and the Rolling Stones provided Furore. Normally, over 100 million television viewers watch at the NFL finals, it is also very popular in Germany now.
Last year, political controversy occurred. The quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who had refused to raise itself in the play of the national hymn, had been hard on the quarterback Colin Kaepernick. Some musicians had rejected a Super Bowl performance with Kaepernick, including Rihanna and Pink. The Rockgroup Maroon 5 was ultimately criticized by many.
An actor and Youtuber adds Egypt's ruler: for the time being, however, Mohamed Ali would rather stay abroad.
The two men who influenced the return of blood on the streets of Egypt spent the past week both abroad. On Friday, one of them went back to Cairo Airport. State President Abdelfattah al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly. In 2013, the former General, who held off the Muslim Brother Mohammed Mursi, the first freely elected head of the country, had spent a pleasant time in New York: US President Donald Trump had taken action against the political Islam, because they had not led to any concern about the violations of human rights on Nil, "Sisi said in a week, in Ethiopia, that he had been opposed against the political Islam," he said to say to the President of Sisne, "he did not cause of the State in the Nil.
The President of the other man who is currently deciding what is happening on the streets is going to go astray. Mohamed Ali, of course, stayed abroad where he escaped the access of the security forces who would immediately arrest him if he tried to enter Egyptian soil. Weeks ago, the 45-year-old actor was only known as a minority of the Egyptians. Today, he is the tongue-giving voice that he would encounter the political discourse in the cafés, the living rooms and the teaspoons of the country: With his Youtube channel "Mohamed's secrets" Ali calls on his countrymen to rise against Sisi.
He goes to the head of state directly and in quite Rustic language. While the people are hungry, the president is sweeping in luxury and is making a great new palace build, it says. The army leadership based on Sisi's rule, Ali prevents corruption and enrichment. Because in his second profession as a builder he did 15 years with exactly these men's business, he seems to know quite exactly what he's talking about - that's at least the impression of many Egyptians, as the just exploding clicking numbers show.
After the first week since Sisis Griff had been arrested for the first time after the power of thousands against his rule and almost 2000 citizens, among them prominent figures of civil society, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians, had been arrested, Ali called for a "millionaire march" for this Friday. That really so many people would dare on the streets, was unlikely. But there came to isolated smaller protests, for example in Giseh at Cairo and in the city of China at Luxor. Videos showed protests that participants Al-Sisi corruption had initially preceded and demanded its departure. At these protests the police also set Tränas and Gummice.
From the city of Mansura in Nildelta, where demonstrators last week ripped banners with the president's portrait, massive police presence was reported on Friday. Security forces built checkpoints in the city and on the outbreak streets. In Cairo several subway stations were closed in the city center because of "maintenance work," most roads around the Tahrirplatz, the heart of the revolution of 2011, were blocked. And on the Rabaa Square, on which 2013 supporters of the crashed Muslimbruders Mursi were thrown off a large party until the army took them under fire and killed up to 800 people, another measure should prevent themselves from being seduced by the crash of the mursi.
Mohamed Ali prompted these arrangements to change his tactics: "Our goal does not have to be the Tahrirplatz," said Ali in Barcelona in his video camera. "Don't let us meet with police officers." But as a retractor, that is not to be understood: "The whole of Egypt is the Tahrirplatz."
If the provider promises too much performance
If the Internet connection appears to be much slower than the provider's, there are various testing options.
Anyone who concludes an Internet contract does not have to trust the speed of the providers blind. Customers can check themselves how much of it is actually achieved in the event of faults.
Finally, the pre-promised transmission rates are a contractual component and should therefore also be achieved, the Bavaria Consumer Centre explains.
If the connection appears to be much slower than requested by the provider, there are various testing options. Thus, the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) measuring the actual data transmission rates and comparing them with the agreed rate in the contract.
"However, the tests of the suppliers are carried out according to the specific requirements of the bidders and are therefore not uniform and objective," the Bavaria Consumer Centre points to its attention.
If the connection is much slower than announced, customers can set a reasonable period of 14 days for the provider to produce the promised performance. This is best done by subscriber.
If this does not have an effect on multiple requests, customers can cancel and may also claim compensation. However, if there is no success, only help the way to appeal.
First ranghoher Republicans for investigation
As the first ranghoher Republican, the Governor of Vermont has expressed himself for an impeachment investigation against US President Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important, yes, and where this leads from here, is determined by the facts that are found," said Phil Scott at a press conference on Thursday. He wants to know more about the Whistleblower affair before measures - an impeachment procedure can lead to the discontinuation of the President - are taken.
Scott said he was not surprised by disclosures that Trump had repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj in a telephone call to investigate interventions by the democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine, because Trump observed bids "for years."
Republicans have so far restrained with criticism of Trump for the Whistleblower affair; few have shown unhappiness. Scotts' statements are a first sign of this in Trump's party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has already turned against Trump's policy several times, such as the relaxation of environmental protection rules and the tightening of immigration regulations.
Spider-Man stays in the MCU: Further Marvel film planned
It was a shock for all Spider-Man fans: at the end of August it became known that Sony and Marvel will go separate paths in the future. Tom Holland's Spider-Man would no longer be part of the "Avenger" universe. It was completely unclear how to continue with the movies about Tom Holland.
Now the surprise: Spider-Man receives another final third film within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) after "Spider-Man: Homecoming" and "Spider-Man: Far From Home". This reports several US media consistent. So the cinema start is to be established: in the USA the film will start from July 16, 2021.
In the magazine "Screenrant," Marvel-Boos Kevin Feige is quoted: "I am glad that Spidey's path is continued in the MCU. I and everyone at the Marvel Studios are very pleased that we can continue to work on it... He is the only superhero with the ability to play in different universes as Sony continues working on his spidey verse. You never know what the future will bring."
But how does it come to the sudden good news? Sony Marvel is supposed to have offered an offer. According to industry magazines, the Disney group, to which Marvel also belongs, would participate with 30 percent in the revenue of coming Spider-Man movies. However, the message is not confirmed.
So Duchess Meghan and Prince Harry show up in the "Suits" final
After nine seasons, the series "Suits" has reached the big final in the USA. In the last episode there were many Happy Ends and as many Cameo performances. And also the royal couple Prince Harry (35) and his Meghan (38), who participated in the series for many years, tribute was collected in a charming way. Attention, the following sections contain Spoiler to the serial final.
One thing in advance: Duchess Meghan did not return in the final for a final farewell greeting as Rachel Zane, at least not for new scenes. Instead, a few remarks showed the most memorable scenes with today's Duchess. For example, the moments of the failed and successful wedding with Mike or how she welcomed him after his detained prison sentence.
But also her real husband, Prince Harry, was recalled in the "Suits" final, of course in a wedding scene. When Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman, 49) shouts straight towards the altar to marry his fiancée Sheila (Rachael Harris, 51), Harvey Specter (Gabriel Power, 47) makes a lot of remarks about his suit. Whether he had actually thrown a rock, the deceased Harvey of the groom wants to know only to sneak up: "Louis, you are not the prince of England."
Aegean: Baby and four more children drown in boat accident
A baby and four more children drowned in the midst of a refugee boat in the Aegean. In total seven people died in the accident, as the Greek Coast Guard announced on Friday. Nationalities are still unclear.
The boat sunk near the Greek island of Inousses, which lies between the island of Chios and the Turkish mainland. Four children, three women and five men could be saved.
Hundreds of migrants from Turkey are currently moving to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean. Last year, according to United Nations Refugee Assistance Agency (UNHCR), 174 people were killed. Federal Minister Horst Seehofer has now announced to visit both countries.
Together with his French colleague and the EU Commissioner responsible, he wanted to inform Turkey about "how it stands about the refugee situation," said Seehofer on Friday. Then he wanted to learn more about the "administrative problems of the Greeks" in Athens in order to help tackle them.
A spokesperson from the European Commission confirmed on Friday the planned trip to Seehofer with EU Internal Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos and French Minister for the Interior Christophe Castaner.
In Greece, unusually many immigrants from Turkey continue to arrive. On Tuesday alone, 654 people transferred to the Greek islands, it was called by the Greek Ministry of Civil Protection on Wednesday.
Does the Turkey deal still work?
The rising figures have given rise to doubts about the functioning of the 2016 EU-Turkey Agreement, which provides that the EU can send back all refugees and migrants who are illegally coming through Turkey to the Greek islands, and in return, the EU wanted to take up a Syrian refugee from Turkey for each abandoned Syrian.
However, because of the lack of staff, the processing of asylum applications is very difficult on the Greek side. According to the Ministry of Civil Protection, Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos, there are nearly 29 400 people in the camp. The worst is the situation on Lesbos: currently 5200 migrants are housed in a camp with capacity for 650 people.
Never since the entry into force of the EU-Turkey Refugee Pact in March 2016, so many have been reported by the State Rundfunk.

Green politician must be responsible for embarrassing photopan
The head of the Canadian Greens, Elizabeth May, in the campaign - was manipulated for this reason of the cup?
The Canadian Green Chief holds a multi-way cup in the hand on a photo. But now it came out: The cup was manipulated.
Ottawa / Canada - it has remained quite unnoticed - and finally noticed. The reusable coffee cup with metal stream has never been held in hand by Elizabeth May, the head of the Canadian Greens. On the party's website she had seen on a photo with this cup, in conversation with citizens. However, the photo had been published before and also spread to the media - and there was still a snapper (papp) cup, as the Canadian National Post reported.
Green boss has to be responsible for photopan
The National Post pressed May for manipulation and that the Fake News Party produced to appear more credible on the subject of "environmental protection" and that in the middle of a campaign for the subhouse election, Trudeau is also increasingly difficult for a bribery scandal.
The photo went viral in the social media and started the discussion about fake news. A user shares a comparison of the photos and writes: "The Greens manipulate a photo of their chairmen to hide their one-way cup."
May showed himself shocked and warned on her blog to have no knowledge of this action. In order to underline this, she posted the original: she, in conversation with citizens, a cup in the hand. However, he put her right, she was from bamboo. She always had it. A speaker of the party said it was only about placing the pardelogo in the picture, and not to hide something. From the photo is only one part to see on the site.
May writes, it hurts her for the employee who did this. "I don't want to call him stupid, but there was nothing to hide from the guardian," she says to the guardian and at the same time asked something from her overcommitted team: "If they want to rework a picture, they could not do anything with my face, so I look younger?"
The German Greens are also hit because of their use of single-way plastic or for flight travel in Shitstorm - but their pictures were not fotoshopped. Thus the chief of the Bavarian Greens, Katharina Schulze, had in the holiday ice with plastic spoons, as merkur.de * reported.
Influencerin wants free upgrade: Lifelong flight ban at Cathay
It was said that Jaqueline Ng had been secured an upgrade by email from Cathay Pacific, but when she asked for check-in, she was not allowed on board - and she should never fly with Cathay again.
Spontan get an upgrade for the Business Class - of which many passengers dream. Sometimes they are lucky, and the employees at the check-in offer a change from the Economy Class for free.
However, this case shows how not to do it: A self-declared influencerin has actively asked the airline Cathay Pacific for a free upgrade. On Instagram Jaqueline Ng follow more than 65,000 users. On May 30, it flew back from Taiwan to New York and on June 7.
On the Hinflug, the employees Jaqueline refused an upgrade, although she showed an email in which she allegedly presented an upgrade in view of Cathay Pacific. The letter wants the influencerin received from a marketing employee of the airline. On the other hand, the airline accuses Jaqueline of having forged the mail.
On the return flight, Jaqueline tried again to get an upgrade for the long-distance flight. This time, the woman should have shown the same mail, but with another reference number. The JFK airport staff were skeptical: they hacked at the headquarters. And indeed, the employee who allegedly came from the mail should have disputed the mail contact with Jaqueline. This also confirmed the mail system in which the news did not show up.
The airline employees at the airport canceled Jaqueline's ticket and imposed a lifelong flight ban with Cathay Pacific. For 1,400 US dollars (about 1,280 Euro) she had to buy a new flight ticket to Taiwan.
With her case, the influencerin turned to Elliot Advocacy, a company representing consumer interests, because Cathay had paid her the price for her original ticket, but Jaqueline also claimed the cost of the new ticket.
But as long as Jaqueline does not submit the metadata of the mail, the case remains clear: For Cathay the influencerin has committed fraud, it remains blocked for future flights. The airline's business conditions also say that it does not have to pay for the new flight. Jaqueline does not want to be satisfied with it - and now switches on a lawyer.
Oil prices according to report on ceasefire in Yemen
The oil prices fell by more than one dollar on Friday afternoon. Last time a barrel (159 litres) of the North Sea species Brent cost 61.83 US dollars - about 1.4 percent less than the previous day. The price for a barrel of the American variety West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell by 1.3 percent to 55.77 dollars.
The trigger for the cursus was a report by Wall Street Journals on a ceasefire in Yemen. Saudi Arabia should have agreed to a ceasefire in four areas.
A drone attack on the oil plants in Saudi Arabia had brought about five percent of world oil production in mid-September. The Huthi rebels associated with Iran in the Yemen Civil War had advertised the attacks for themselves. Saudi Arabia, like the US government, is responsible for Iran. A ceasefire would discourage political tension in the region.
If an agreement were actually reached, one could concentrate on growth and demand care, said Ole Hansen, Head of the Commodity Strategy Department at the Saxo Bank of the Bloomberg News Agency.
The oil prices thus continue its downward movement of the past days. A barrel of WTI oil had cost up to almost 59 dollars, Brent nearly 65 dollars a week ago.
Last but not least, Bloomberg, calling on Insider, reported that the repairs of oil plants in Saudi Arabia after the attack in mid-September have progressed faster than expected. Consequently, the production volume has reached a volume of eight million barrels per day again and is moving back towards the original quantity.
Last time there were several press releases calling on insider who reported rapid progress of Saudi Aramco's state oil company in the repair work. However, raw material experts pointed out that Saudi Aramco is currently planning a stock exchange and avoiding negative headlines.
At the same time, there was some relaxation in the conflict between Iran and Western countries: the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" is more than two months after the arrest by Iran and the recently issued release on the way to leave the port. The crew is now preparing for departure while the ship is still in front of anchor, shipowner Erik Hånell informed Swedish broadcasting on Friday morning in a SMS.
However, the United States announced that it would transfer missiles and soldiers to the Iranian Archbishop to Saudi Arabia. The fear of escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries such as the USA and the United Kingdom had temporarily driven oil prices to a significant level in recent weeks.
The accusations against Trump are tightening up
In the affair of possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump, disguise accusations against the White House have been heard. Several leading government employees had intensively endeavoured to prevent access to the word of the conversation after a dispute between Trump and Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selensky. This explained an anonymous poetry. The spokesman of the Representative House, the Democratic Nancy Pelosi, threw the White House explicitly "concussion." Trump spoke of a "Hexenjagd."
North Korea considers the third summit of Trump and Kim to be questionable
North Korea has expressed doubts that in the nuclear dispute there will soon be a third summit of Machthaber Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump. The meaning and prospects of such a meeting would be questionable due to the lack of progress in implementing agreements of the first summit in Singapore, said top diplomat Kim Kye-gwan on Friday according to the Agency KCNA.
The US had not done anything to implement the decisions of the summit last year, said the advisor of the North Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He also criticised US sanctions and the joint military manoeuvre of the US and South Korea. He hoped for a "wise" and "brave" decision of Trumps to bring it back to closer.
Trump had said on Monday that he wanted to know what a third summit with Kim was supposed to take place before he declared himself ready. The negotiations on disarmament of the North Korean nuclear and missile programme have been undermined since the failed second summit of Trump and Kim in Hanoi in February. In June, they both met in the demilitarised zone between the two Korean states. They agreed to revive the discussions, but so far without great success.

Pounds under pressure - interest rate reduction expected
British pound under pressure
In view of a rapid reduction in interest rates, the pound is losing value compared to the euro.
Frankfurt speculations on an early interest rate reduction of the Bank of England (BoE) add to the pound Sterling. The British currency billed up to 0.4 percent on Friday to 1.2269 dollars.
The triggers of the sales were statements by the Notenbankier Michael Saunders. This led to a reduction in interest, even if a chaotic brexit could be turned away, as the insecurity would affect the British economy in the foreseeable time. This statement was surprising as Saunders was the defender of a restrictive monetary policy, analyst Ricardo Evangelista from the Brokerhaus ActivTrades said.
Last week, the Bank of England had already pointed out the burden on the economy of the Brexit Hickhack, without signalling a direct reduction of interest. Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to take his country out of the EU without divorce agreement on 31 October.
More: With his provocations the British Prime Minister has taken a high risk. But it could pay for him, says Handelsblatt Editor Kerstin Leitel.
Doping: Other Russian manipulation proven
Material from the Moscow Analytical Laboratory is being manipulated - this confirms David Howman, one director of the World Antidoping Agency (Wada) and today's head of integrity of the World Body of Leichtathletics.
At the start of the Body Tech World Championships, new details of the Doping Scandal in Russia come to light - and they destroy the few of the credibility that Russian sports had won back at the beginning of the year and even only somehow. In January 2019, the Moscow Doping Laboratory finally delivered the required samples from 2012 to 2015 to the World Antidoping Agency (Wada). Now it turned out that they were falsified.
In December 2014, systematic fraud had been revealed in Russian sports. Wada had blocked the Russian Antidoping Agency (Rusada) for three years. During this time Russian athletes were not completely banished by the world stage. After individual examination at the 2016 Summer Games in Rio, the International Olympic Committee took place around 270 athletes of the country under neutral flags, during the winter games in February 2018, 168 Russian athletes took place as a participant. Also in the World Cup in the various sports, they were allowed to be there in the summer of Russia even the football WM with the host.
Positive findings missing
In the following September, the Wada withdrew the Rusada band again, but asked for access to the laboratory and the said samples. The data should provide information on the extent of the coverage of doping cases during state doping. They should help to punish athletes afterwards. Three months later they were finally delivered.
However, the chairman of the independent integrity commission (AIE) of the World Body of Body (IAAF) has now confirmed that the Doping data was manipulated from the Moscow Analyselabor. "Yes. We received the data nine months ago. We should check whether the Task Force received the right data," said David Howman in the interview of the "Frankfurter General Newspaper" of Friday. "We have found numerous discrepancies between the data mentioned in the McLaren report by a Whistleblower and those that received it from the Russians in January." Many positive findings were missing. "
The World Cup is not affected
This confirms the attitude of the IAAF: The Body Tech Association holds as the only organization on the band of Russia. At the Doha World Championship, 30 Russian athletes start under neutral flag. They had to prove that they trained outside the Russian system and undergo tests.
At the beginning of this week the Wada manipulation had already put into space and asked Russia to respond to the accusations within three weeks. Russia is now threatening the new Rusada lock and in the worst case also the exclusion from the Olympic Games 2020 in Tokyo.
