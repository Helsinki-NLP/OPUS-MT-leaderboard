Gutach: More security for pedestrians
They are not 100 meters away from each other: on Tuesday the new B 33 pedestrian lamp was put into operation at the village parking lot - in the view of the older town hall collector.
Two plants so close to each other: intention or turtles?
This question was clearly answered yesterday by Mr Gutachs mayor.
"The town hall was installed at the time because it secured the school path," Eckert explained yesterday.
The Kluser light secure both cyclists and bus passengers and the mountain residents.
The installation officially put into service yesterday was important for the crossroads Sulzbachweg / Kirchstraße.
We have the museum, two churches, course park, bus stop, a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area › Grub ›.
"At the high traffic and pedestrian level a further light had to come to their safety," says Eckert.
This also confirms Peter Arnold from the Landratsamt Offenburg.
"According to current measurements on the B 33 daily go through about 12 000 vehicles the municipality Gutach, of which about 10 percent are heavy load transport," Arnold emphasises.
Therefore, the construction of a further light is more than necessary: "Security is simply going ahead here," Arnold said.
In total four traffic watches had been carried out, a circular traffic was also envisaged, but again rejected due to the narrow area of Sulzbachweg / Kirchstraße.
According to Arnold, everything was tested before the location of the ample masts: "By means of an extra for us with particularly long timers of wooden trailers we have tested whether these vehicles can drive from the Sulzbachweg to the B 33 without knocking the ample masts."
Arnold explained that the 15 000 euros expensive ampoule system itself is the "most modern thing that is currently on the market."
The system is equipped with coloured LED, which illuminates so strongly that the lights of the car drivers are well visible, for example, at low-standing sun.
And sparingly, it is also: the older lighting systems consume about 100 watt, the new just eight watt.
There are three lighting systems per direction.
Arnold explained the technology of the new plant: it is equipped with two radar sensors.
If the pedestrian presses the light button, the upper radar sensor tests the traffic position.
If the road is free, it comes directly green for the pedestrian, if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase for the pedestrian can be terminated.
"If a group or disabled people go across the street, the green phase will be extended, so everyone will safely come through the road," said Arnold.
Of course, the driver must be involved as a partner here and observe the road.
This was not the case yesterday: hardly showed the light for pedestrians green, a high-class vehicle roamed through - in the case of light red.
For more than 30 years, Josef Winkler has written himself the need of his childhood and youth from the soul.
The catastrophes of his Catholic village childhood - the linguistics, the hanging to rough violence and stubborn sexuality, the intimacy and joylessness - have described the core poet many times.
The Booker prize winner is known primarily as a prosaautor, theatre texts are rare in his work.
Collage from Prosatexten Gerhard Fresacher presents for his performance "weather lights on the tongue tip," which can now be seen in the garage X at the Petersplatz, therefore a collage of prosatexts.
The theatre maker combines elements from the autobiographically-shaped novel "Der Leibeigene" (1987) with prosaminiatures from "Body, his family rewarded" (2003).
On the largely empty stage - important requisite: a knitted sofa, on which it is evidently copied and masturbated - the eight-headed ensemble is hanged by the text material.
Regisseur Fresacher seems to have little confidence in the text.
The 70-minute performance overshades the template with a lot of government injuries, known from the repertoire post-dramatic game forms.
Above all, the actresses come to light in the sometimes somewhat questionable scenic transpositions.
They are touched hard, dipped with the head under water, tailed with their supper on the wall.
Involved in cellophane or melting, they stare on dangerous high sticks through the censorship, either monologise them loud or lie completely stubbed on the stage floor.
However, the text is hardly in this effort.
The best moments have the evening when singing - the bandwidth ranges from Deep Purple to popular songs.
Only at the end comes the exaggerated performance a little quietly, and Winkler's downright absurd humor flashes up.
A black box in the car?
US road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the falling highway system, and believe that they have found the solution in a small black box that is located in the armature board of each car.
The devices that record every kilometre of danger and report the information to the authorities are the core of a controversial attempt by Washington and the planning offices of the states to revise the obsolete system to finance US roads.
The usually rather boring area of road planning has suddenly created an intensive debate with colorful alliances.
Liberals have joined environmental groups and expressed their support that the government can use the small boxes to record the dangerous kilometres - and possibly where they were driven - and then use the information for the calculation of tax documents.
The tea party is shocked.
The American Civil Rights Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of data protection concerns.
But while we cannot agree in the Congress on action, several states are no longer waiting.
They are currently examining how they can switch over the next ten years to a system where drivers pay per mile.
Thousands of drivers have already tested the driver, some of whom are equipped with GPS monitoring.
This is really a must for our country.
"There is nothing that we will only possibly use," said Hasan Ikhrata, Managing Director of Southern California Assn. of Governments, which plans to record the traffic of the miles at all California drivers in the state from 2025 onwards.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
The technology is there.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is financed from the taxes, pays US Americans at the pillar, is broke.
But in America, it's not as much as it used to be.
Cars consume less gasoline.
The state oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 eurocent per litre) has not increased for 20 years.
Politicians don't dare at high spray prices to raise the tax even to a cent.
"The gas tax is simply not sustainable," said Lee Munnich, an expert on transport legislation at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently equipped 500 cars with travel writers to test a mileage-based pay system.
"This is the most meaningful alternative in the long term," he said.
It is known by bureaucrats as mileage-based usage.
It is not surprising that the idea can be found in urban liberals, because, for example, the tax could be used to influence driving behaviour in such a way as to reduce dust and climate-related exhaust gases.
The California Planers are committed to the system of developing strategies to achieve the state's ambitious, legally anchored targets on climate change.
But the Republican Bill Shuster from Pennsylvania, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also stated that he sees in it the most viable long-term alternative.
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are also affected by the idea of having drivers pay after the distance left.
"This is not a tax that disappears in a black hole," explains Adrian Moore, Vice President for Guidelines at Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former US transport ministers who had asked the Congress in a report in 2011 to move towards mileage-based settlement.
The US Senate approved a $90 million expensive pilot project last year, which would have comprised 10,000 cars.
However, the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the protest and thus responded to the concerns of Members from rural areas representing people who often have to leave many miles on the way to work or to the city in everyday life.
However, several states and cities are moving in this direction on their own.
The most committed is Oregon, who currently recruits 5,000 drivers for the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon pay the mileage charges instead of the mineral oil tax to the state.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is also considering one of these.
Illinois tests it to a limited extent with trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, among which the transport ministries of 17 states on the east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) are currently examining how to introduce the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where recently 50 volunteers were equipped with the equipment, drivers were skeptical about the idea that the government could follow any of their movements.
"Concerns against Big Brothers and such things were a big problem," explains Alauddin Khan, head of strategy and results management at the Ministry of Transport of Nevada.
People didn't want to.
When the test started, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: "It would be relatively easy to transform the tachograph into adult monitoring devices."
There is no need to build a gigantic, blocking technological infrastructure which would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is one of a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology with which the state can capture the kilometres that have been travelled, but not exactly when and where.
Thus, according to Khan, the public would also be more calm.
The hunting for this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California.
The company has originally not joined to help states tax drivers.
Instead, it was their goal to take foot in a emerging car insurance market where drivers are to pay on the basis of the risks.
However, the equipment tested by her is also interesting for road planners, because they do not work with GPS and provide limited information that is regularly uploaded by modem.
"People are more willing to participate when their speed and locations are not recorded," said Ryan Morrison, Managing Director of True Mileage.
Some of these public pilot programmes have made major mistakes.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement this.
In Oregon the planners experiment to give car drivers a number of choices.
You can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they don't choose any device at all and instead pay a flat-rate fee based on the average of all the inhabitants of the state.
Other bodies hope to be able to sell the concept of a mistrust public by equipping the equipment with more functions than the user.
In New York City, traffic officers want to develop a taxable device that also allows parking fees to be paid, insurance only has to be paid for the kilometres that are at risk, and speed data are collected from other vehicles in real time, thanks to which drivers can avoid stopping.
"Drivers would be motivated to participate by the added value of the benefits offered by the system," says the city's planning document.
However, some transport planners wonder whether the whole talk about paying per mile is not just a huge distraction manoeuvre.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the territory of San Francisco Bay officials stated that the Congress could simply solve the problem of the bankrupt highway trust fund by increasing fuel tax.
An additional one-off fee or annual levy could be imposed on drivers using hybrid vehicles or other vehicles which consume little gasoline, so that they also pay a fair share.
"There is no reason for an operation if an aspirin is sufficient," explains Randy Rentschler, the Head of Legislation and Public Affairs of the Commission.
When we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers are worried about their privacy and many other things.
Königsfeld: Small team beats himself wacker
The volunteer firefighters managed their autumn main test despite the lack of personnel with Bravour.
Only eleven men took part in the exercise.
In his exercise, Hans Kammerer had chosen the property of Feder in the Burgberger Straße.
There must have been a short-circuit when sawing.
Two people were injured by the emerging fire and the development of smoke, but one of them was able to send an emergency call.
After the first review of the situation by Hans Kammerer, two respirators of the Wehr were prepared to enter the building.
After a short time, the first person succeeded in finding and letting go.
The second person had to be worn.
This was not so easy as a close staircase was also to overcome.
The building, a workshop with integrated stall for two horses, was not easy to secure.
There was a lot of wood and straw balls in it.
There were also electrical machinery for wooden processing.
The first extinguishing attack took place over the tank in the vehicle.
A further line was carried out via a flooding hydrant at about 100 meters away.
Now three cancellation attacks could be designed.
A hollow beam tube was also used in the building.
Hans Kammerer was also involved in the exercise to show what is to accomplish with little available staff.
In serious cases, support is provided through the daily action group Königsfeld.
The commander was satisfied with the course of the exercise.
Networking of universities and companies important
At his visit to the district of Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald, Landtag President Guido Wolf was also able to explain to Titisee-Neustadt where the workers from tomorrow come from.
In the Higher Black Forest Support Centre, he followed this important question together with the head of the vocational schools, the circular gymnasium and the parental council chairmen.
"Education is an important location factor," emphasised Claudia Stehle, Director of the Hans-Thoma School, who presented the networked school project Education Centre Hochschwarzwald.
Wolf was impressed with the model training projects.
Since 2011, there has been successful cooperation between support centres, circular school and vocational school centres in the Forest Town.
He also praised family friendliness in the district.
"It is important not only to look at the family phase, but also to the period of care for family care due to demographic change," said Wolf.
He also argued that more and more employees took care of the care and care of their relatives.
"Without the support of employers, the resulting burden on employees can lead to an end to the employment relationship," said Wolf.
But no one could afford to lose qualified workers, he continued.
Another particularly important factor is the networking of universities and businesses.
"For those who have already met the benefits of the region during their studies, with their acquired knowledge and skills often receive the regional economy, which contributes to the strengthening of the region," the President of the countryside showed his conviction.
For only if adequate training places were offered could the needs of professionals also be met.
In his view, the site advantage of the district is its beneficial location in the south-west of Germany, close to France and Switzerland.
He also experienced the efforts already made to develop public passenger transport on his railway trip from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg.
"Keep persistent and ensure that public transport is improved," he explained to the address of the local politicians present.
With music experienced a entertaining afternoon
For 15 years, the Kaul family has already invited the Dietinger seniors to coffee, cake and then to a Vesper.
In the past, the older fellow citizens were recruited in the restroom.
Meanwhile, this afternoon will take place in the nursing home of St. Josef.
The home residents are looking forward to the delicious cakes and cakes.
Later there was sausage salad.
With common melodies, Silvia Kimme-Bantle and her father Karl Kimme entertained.
The more than 100-year-old natural stone wall as a precision of the old school court before the rehabilitation to the church road is to be put again on the rehabilitation costing plan of the city of Bräunlingen.
During the days before the Kilbig, the first work of the refurbishment of the front school courtyard built a small angle wall, to stabilise and static discharge of the more than one hundred years old natural stone wall with Balustrade.
The further approach foresees that Alexander Misok, from the Bräunlinger Stadtbauamt, should include the national monument office in the plans and create a rehabilitation concept for the old wall.
After that, a cost calculation will be made by experts who will then be placed on the table to the municipal council for the decision and determination of the further action.
A decision on this is expected to take place already next year.
After the refurbishment, plastering and planting of the old school courtyard within the two side wings of the school built in 1912, it is necessary to be reconstructed in the foreseeable time as a follow-up, the necessary refurbishment wall from ground to ground and placed on new ground.
The historic one-hundred-year-old border wall of the old school court to the church road, is mainly due to water and freezing damage, since there is no drainage, necessary for sanitation and has a bow inclination forward.
Deep cracks in individual stones show weather damage, but the wall is not at present at risk of collapse.
A stable wall is a prerequisite for one of the pupils using school courtyard, which has been done through the current attachment work.
Initially, the school rehabilitation was planned in 2008 / 2009, but high unplanned expenditure led to a shift.
An important word in the historical school mouse restructuring, which has already been used for cinematographic recordings, will be spoken by the National Council of Mines.
If requirements come from this page, the city of Braunlingen hopes for grants from the monuments.
The pupils of the Bräunlinger primary school, which are now being taught again in a well-cleaned old school building with new Aula, can soon use the old school court.
Özdemir wants to receive jazz training in Stuttgart
In the ongoing discussions on the future of the Musikhochschulen in Baden-Württemberg, Cem Özdemir, Federal Chairman of the Greens, has now joined.
"I think it is wrong to abandon the holistic training at the University of Music in Stuttgart," Özdemir said the "Stuttgart News."
Jazz and classic belong together at the Jazz site of Stuttgart.
In this way, Özdemir, which is considered to be a favourite for a direct mandate in the Bundestag election on 22 September, is opposed to the Green Red Government.
On the basis of a study of experts, the Commission is pushing for a reorganization of the five Musikhochschulen in Baden-Württemberg.
After that, the course of Jazz and Pop will be moved from the University of Music Stuttgart to the Musikhochschule Mannheim.
US border: "Super Tunnel" discovered for drug smuggling
At the border between Mexico and the USA, investigators discovered and shut down a "super tunnel" for drug smuggling.
As the US customs authorities announced, the more than 500 meters long pipes between Tijuana and San Diego were equipped with electricity, railway tracks and a ventilation system.
Three suspects were arrested, eight tonnes of marijuana and nearly 150 kilograms of cocaine were seized.
According to the data, the tunnel had not yet been used.
"These cartels are stupid if they think they could dig themselves under the radar," said the prosecutor-general of the South California District, Laura Duffy, at a press conference in a warehouse in San Diego, where it had been discovered an end to the tunnel.
To the drug bands, Duffy assured: "If you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them, we are determined to make this a huge waste of your dirty money."
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a long-term fight against drug cartels.
Since 2006, more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug crime.
Designed by experts
Due to the intense equipment of the tunnel, investigators assume that it was constructed by architects and engineers and that the construction took about a year.
The track system was so equipped that electric cars could be used there.
On the Mexican side, access is located in a building 80 meters from the border.
According to the authorities, a ladder leads 20 meters into the depth to the actual tunnel entrance.
The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 meters height and 90 centimeters width.
It would also have been appropriate to promote illegal immigration towards the United States.
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine fund.
The third, a Mexican, was arrested for the seized marijuana.
All three are threatened as a maximum penalty for lifelong resignation, as officials said.
Since 2006 eight such tunnels have been discovered, it continued at the press conference in San Diego.
But it was the first time that cocaine was found in such a tunnel.
Cocaine is usually smuggled in smaller quantities and not by tunnels.
This shows the "despair" of the drug bands whose traditional routes have been cut off, Bill Sherman said about the DEA in San Diego.
They'd do anything to get to the United States.
There were no details of the arrests, at least one was Mexican, it was said.
You have to expect arrests for up to ten years.
2014 will be Geisinger year
= = References = = = = External links = = * Official website
The return of the first documentary mention is getting closer and closer.
When the year ends in eight weeks, the anniversary year is up.
Geisingen and Churches-Hausen were first mentioned together in 794.
In churches a document was produced in which both places are mentioned.
On March 15 there is supposed to be an official start to the anniversary year, and since Geisingen currently has no hall, this recording event takes place in the place where both were mentioned for the first time 1250 years ago, in Churches-Hausen.
During the Jubilee several events are planned both in Geisingen and in Churches-Hausen.
Churches-Hausen will be the 1250 in July at a weekend from 18 to 20 July.
celebrate return.
On Friday with a festival, on Saturday and Sunday with a festival around the church hall.
At this weekend the church-house church party is also at the end of the weekend.
City Music Director Rudolf Barth has written an order composition for the city on the occasion of the anniversary, which is listed at three dates.
On June 21, together with the Black Forest Association's Sunday Feast, on July 12 in the Arena with fireworks and on December 13 as the first concert of city music in the new festival.
This is completed and inaugurated in the anniversary year, the official appointment is at the last September weekend, on 27 and 28 September.
In the course of the Geisinger City Bureau, a new chronicle is also released.
"But it should be a chronicle not only by Geisingen itself, but a printed work about the hostage of today, which consists of Geisingen, Churches-Hausen, Body Ferments, Aulfingen and Gutmadingen," said Mayor Walter Hengstler.
And the hostages of today also celebrate 2014's birthday, 1974 the modern space was carried out with the congregations.
The new Chronic will then be presented on November 21 or 22 at the new Festhalle in Geisingen.
2014 is also a year with many anniversaries.
The Narrenzunft Strohglonki begins on 8 February with a wedding evening on the occasion of its 60-year existence, the Harmonie Gutmadingen becomes 90 years and has the fixed banquet on 29 March and then celebrates the district music festival from 1 to 4 May.
The Old Works Leipferdingen is 40 years old, the Geisinger School has been at the new location for 50 years and celebrates this on 10 May, the Musikverein Polyhymnia Leipferdingen becomes 150 years old and celebrates this in the framework of the Brunnenfest from 4 to 7 July.
The city of Geisingen was first mentioned in a gift certificate owned by the monastery of St. Gallen in 764.
The document was produced in churches (Hausen), which was at that time a court place.
Both municipalities are thus mentioned in the same document.
Reason 2014 to celebrate this 1250-year-old accordingly, in addition, the municipal reform is also 40 years behind.
Council takes track systems into view
Should the rail crossing "Am Hirschen" be converted intensely to increase traffic safety?
Yes, the councils have decided.
Schiltach must take into account 220 000 euros for this purpose.
The Deutsche Bahn intends to improve the Kinzigtal track next year.
In particular, the safety of rail crossing is to be increased - there are regular collisions of trains with other vehicles across the country.
If the municipalities agree to the reconstruction measures, they must participate with one third in the costs, the rest of them share trains and coins.
Schiltachs Stadtbaumeister Roland Grießhaber explained to the municipal council the special features of the crossing "Am Hirschen."
There the city is planning to build a lease at the height of the tunnel mouths there west of the railways.
There could also be larger vehicles, such as those transporting Langholz, in the event of counter-traffic without having to block the tracks.
Greater owners therefore proposed to construct a necessary support wall so that the city could spread the next road in due time to ensure a smooth flow of traffic.
This was discussed controversially in the municipal council, as some councils questioned the need for street spread: Thomas Kipp put the mood of critics at the point: "Do we have to take so much money on account of so few vehicles?"
Mayor Thomas Haas contradicted: the railway crossing "Hirschen" is used regularly for langholz transports.
Even wood from the "Kuhbach" section was partly transported over this route because the up to 20 meters long vehicles could not use the route at the port bridge because they could not turn down the main road there.
In addition, Haas argued that the route served as a route for those vehicles that were not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road was blocked.
It should be assumed that, as is currently the case in Wolfach, Churchberg and Castle tunnels would have to be rebuilt and refurbished, the railway crossing on the "Hirschen" could also have an important significance for a longer period of time.
The councils agreed to examine the costs of the alleged spread of the road.
However, the reconstruction of the railway crossing was approved by a majority on the condition that the necessary support walls were built in such a way that the city could increase the subsequent road direction "railway station road" to approximately 5,5 metres for meeting traffic.
On the other hand, the reconstruction of the railway crossing at the Gerberei Trautwein could entail a completely different problem affecting access to the much increasing "rolling houses" road.
The administration had examined the train's conversion plans by the Engineering Office Breinlinger, as it had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhaus away was then possible without further delay.
The investigation concluded that it should not be ruled out that the deterioration of the road could lead to longer vehicles on board.
The city is responsible for this in turn as a road load carrier.
The reconstruction could therefore lead to liability disputes.
Haas argued that, since both the wooden outlet and the bending were working in the current state of construction, it should not be agreed to the reconstruction of the rail transfer.
Also at this point the risk of a train collision with a vehicle standing at the transition was significantly lower than at the other rail crossing, because it is directly next to the stop point centre to which there is a good visual connection.
Even trains from the main station would have to be braked so far that no collision would be threatened.
The majority refused the reconstruction of this railway transition, since the city of Schiltach had to "bathe" the problem of resting vehicles, according to the councils, since the railway could withdraw from responsibility after the completion of the construction work.
The board considers that it is unproblematic to reconstruct the "Vor Heubach" and "Vor Kuhbach," for which cross-section agreements have already been concluded with the railway.
Esa decides on large space missions: missions for billions
Distant planets, gravity waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects that they want to start in the coming years.
Thirty proposals were selected, five are still in the race.
Far worlds.
More than 1,000 planets on other stars have already found astronomers.
If there are at least some of these lives, no one knows.
The selection is difficult: should you look for gravitational waves?
Or rather explore the origin of the cosmos?
Or after Earth-like planets, maybe discover alien life?
These questions are precisely the responsible for the European Space Agency Esa.
For their Cosmic Vision programme, they are looking for ideas for two major space projects to make research decisive progress.
The budget for such "L missions" is approximately one billion euros each.
The start is expected to be 2028 and 2034.
At the beginning of September, the elite of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
Thirty ideas were under discussion, five of them have now come to the closer choice.
Numerous bodies review the proposals, follow up to the researchers.
In the next few days, a final decision will be taken by the Scientific Programme Committee.
A total of four major questions have been selected by the Esa, on which the missions of the 2007 programme "Cosmic Vision" are to find answers.
What are the conditions for the creation of planets and lives?
The exact processes of the emergence of stars from large gas clouds - and thus also the formation of planets surrounding these stars - are still in the dictionary darkness.
A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this darkness.
And if a star has planets, under what circumstances can life arise there?
To look into this issue, the space telescope "Cheops" will be launched in 2017, with which 500 already known planetary systems in our closest surroundings will be examined more closely.
But the possibilities are limited, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
With larger instruments, the astronomers could depict earth-like planets and even analyze the composition of their atmosphere and thus search for "biomarkers": gases that are considered to be indices of biological activity.
How does the solar system work?
This question should also ultimately give an indication of the conditions for the creation of life.
An important role is the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field as well as the particle radiation that it entails with the planetary system.
In our solar system these processes can be investigated in an exemplary way.
With the "Solar Orbiter" the Esa has already approved a mission of the M class (there the budget is about half a billion euros) for this issue.
The probe should start in 2017 and observe the surface and activity of the sun closely.
Of great interest to the researchers are also Jupiter and his moons.
They want to find out what role the giant planet has played in the development of the solar system.
For this purpose, the Esa provides for the first of the three L missions of the Cosmic Vision programme.
The "Juice" probe (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) is expected to begin its journey in 2022.
Eight years later, she reaches Jupiter to study the atmosphere of the planet as well as the eisive Moons of Europe, Kallisto and Ganymed.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
The world space offers many possibilities to study matter under extreme conditions and thus to investigate whether the natural laws we know are still valid there.
Perhaps there are also disparities that could guide physicists to a new theory under which all known natural laws can be united.
How has the universe emerged and what is it made up of?
13.7 billion years ago, our cosmos was created by the bullet.
In addition to the matter that we have, which consists of stars, planets and living beings like us, there is dark matter whose gravity holds together galaxies and galaxies, and dark energy which accelerates the expansion of the world's space.
So far, the researchers do not know what physical laws were valid in the first seconded breaks of the bullet, nor do dark matter and dark energy exist.
With "Euclid," the Esa has already authorised an M mission to launch for 2020.
With a special telescope, the probe is intended to investigate the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time throughout the sky, allowing for feedback on the nature of dark matter and dark energy.
Who could do the race
Of the 30 proposals, only two will remain at the end of the selection procedure.
According to many experts, the best chances for an authorisation as an L mission have "E-Lisa," a demanding approach to detect gravitational waves.
Among these are physics changes in the structure of space time, which Albert Einstein predicted almost 100 years ago.
They have not been rejected until today.
Elisa could do that, hopes the scientists behind the project.
The mission provides for a detector consisting of two or three songs stationed in space.
In contrast to installations on earth, it could also prove the gravitational waves created at the earthquake and thus provide new insights into the emergence of the cosmos.
Four other proposals are still competing for the second L mission: a large X-ray telescope called "Athena," to explore black holes, "Icy Planets," another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, "Prism," a mission to measure cosmic background radiation, and the "Exoplanet Finder," which is to detect and investigate earthly planets.
Proposals have already been eliminated for the return of samples from Mars, for the exploration of Moon, Venus and Asteroids as well as for solar physics.
Snowden ready to "cooperate" with Germany in terms of US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the Whistleblower of the US Secret Service, has declared that he is willing to travel to Berlin and proclaim before the German Bundestag if the American National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander do not give answers about their activities.
The German Member Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden on Thursday in Russia, where he received asylum to discuss the statement in Germany.
In a letter from Snowden, presented on Friday by Ströbele to the media in Berlin, this writes: "Although the result of my efforts was proven to be positive, my government continues to treat a different opinion as a breach of trust and tries to criticize political expression with penalty, in which no defence is possible."
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In the letter Snowden writes that he is convinced that the support of the international community could convince the American government to drop the charges against him.
The prosecution by the U.S. Ministry of Justice includes spying and theft of state property.
The German Minister for the Interior Hans-Peter Friedrich said to time online: "If Mr Snowden is willing to speak with German representatives, then we will find ways to allow this."
The relationship between the USA and Germany is burdened by the claims that the NSA had heard the phone from Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the member of the parliamentary committee responsible for the secret service, said to take the opportunity to listen to Snowden as a witness if this was possible, "without jeopardising him and completely ruining relations with the United States."
Ströbele, a member of the Greens, published a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia.
Ströbele explained that according to the lawyer of the former NSA employee Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
When Snowden testifies in Germany, he needed a guarantee that he was "safe" there, the honourable Member said.
Snowden explained in his letter that he saw himself exposed to a "serious and ongoing" persecution campaign that had displaced him from his home.
However, it was affected by the global response to "my act of political expression."
Citizens around the world, as well as high-level politicians, including in the United States, have called the disclosure of an uncontrolled system of comprehensive monitoring a merit to the general public.
In his letter, Snowden offers the German authorities an offer of cooperation, "if the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation have been solved."
Frontier Airlines charges for hand baggage
Frontier Airlines plans to demand up to 100 US dollars from passengers who want to steal hand baggage on their flight.
Frontier Airlines intends to calculate up to $100 for a piece of hand baggage and $2 for coffee or lemonade, even though in the announcement on Wednesday was read that passengers should keep the whole box.
The new fee applies to hand baggage in the luggage box above the seat, small bags under the seat are still free.
Frontier explained that 25 US dollars were charged when the fee was paid in advance, and 100 US dollars were paid to travellers who only paid on the flight ladder.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the fee of 100 US dollars aims to move travellers to take care of the payment in advance.
"We do not want to calculate this sum," she explained.
In 2008, airlines started to charge the first and second baggage abandoned.
Passengers who tried to circumvent them have therefore put as much as possible into the hand luggage as possible, resulting in the fact that the luggage boxes are often overfilled over the seat.
Fees are an opportunity to encourage passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said the new fee isn't really about making money.
It is about the faithful customers of Frontier who would have clearly expressed that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find place in the compartment above the seat.
Passengers who buy your tickets on the airline website do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger at Frontier's flight path may be allowed to take a baggage for free, but the next person must pay 100 dollars for a similar baggage.
O'Malley stated that the Frontier website and the check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers were informed of the fee before they came to the airport.
The new handbaggage fee from Frontier will only enter into force in summer, a precise date is not yet available.
Passengers often pass baggage increases and other charges, but airlines like to take advantage of them.
They argue that the transport of the luggage would cost money and passengers should pay this service if they wanted it.
Many at Wall Street consider the new luggage charges to be a sign that airlines are taking enough money to cover the costs of flight travel after years of loss.
However, most of them have so far left the fingers of fees for hand baggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. claimed three years ago as the first fee for hand baggage and later followed Allegiant Air, also a cheap pilot.
The only other airline with such a fee was the Hungarian Wizz Air, explained by the airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors the additional charges.
He estimated in a December 2011 report that the handbaggage fee for Spirit entails $50 million a year.
Sorensen, who used to hold a leadership position at Midwest Airlines, has recently flew with Spirit and was curious about what would expect him at the airport if passengers were confronted with the unusual handbaggage fee of the company.
"The boarding process was one of the most smoothly experienced in my career in aviation," he said.
I was expecting to see teeth and handy discussions on the flight ladder.
"The plane was full," he said, "and the boarding ran like sophisticated."
Frontier also follows Spirit for the 2 dollars required for coffee, tea, lemonade or juice.
The company stated that passengers who bought lemonade or juice should keep the whole bottle and refill coffee for free.
Water is still free.
US Airways had recently tried to demand money for refreshment drinks in 2008 but returned seven months later after complaining to passengers and no other large company had been pursued.
Frontier's step of charging for hand baggage if passengers do not buy directly from the airline is the latest initiative with which customers should be directed to their own website.
Airlines pay online travel agencies such as Orbitz 10 to 25 US dollars per ticket sold.
This provides an incentive for all companies to move passengers to buy directly at them instead of via an online travel agency.
However, Frontier has gone the broadest in this area.
In September, the company began to forgive only half as many multi-flight miles when booking via an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, the miles were again reduced to 25 percent of the route.
A flight trip with frontier animals booked by a third-party provider over 1000 miles therefore brings customers only 250 miles.
Passengers can also book seats only when purchasing directly on Frontier's website.
Frontier has a loyal customer tribe at his seat in Denver, but the business shrinks and the company loses money.
The revenues decreased by 9 percent and the flight capacity dropped almost 13 percent in the first quarter, as can be read in the financial report published on Wednesday by the parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc....
Republic has tried to get the finance of Frontier under the sales of the company.
Speak words come from the Bible
Good 40 women visited the last women's breakfast this year in the evangelical church community Bisingen.
The theme of the day in the community house was "Words from the Bible" and "Writing from the Middle Ages."
Zita Köhler, the chairman of the church council, went into a lecture on the biblical dictionary after breakfast.
"Words contain lifestyles, rules or warnings," she explained.
She compared several speakers with the corresponding biblical posts and explained the importance.
She called speeches like: "Wooden eyes be vigilant, as scales fall from the eyes, throw an eye on someone who is given to Him in sleep, washing his hands in innocence."
Several times the speaker also advised their listeners about what word it was about.
The medieval speech was accepted by the Communist Christel Dehner: All good things are three, make blue, ruin something.
She explained the meaning and origin of the vocabulary she called "bridges into the past."
A tombola was lost at the end.
The prices were covered on a table and were humorously converted before they were handed over to the winners.
Among the visitors of the breakfast round also mayor candidate Roman Waizenegger mixed.
Learning instead of unemployed: pilot project for unskilled people in tourism
A pilot project for the tourism industry was launched at the Mecklenburgische Seenplatte.
Under the leadership of the Federal Labour Agency, 49 women and men, who are already working as unskilled in the industry, are to be qualified as specialists for hotels and hospitals for three winters.
"New is that the six-month courses end with graduates," said Carmen Wiechert from the work agency Neubrandenburg.
The benefits are varied: participants would not be unemployed, companies would receive trained professionals who were increasingly missing in hotels and hospitals, and the Agency would not have to finance unemployment.
The Industrial and Commercial Chambers in Neubrandenburg and the Deutsche Hotel- und Gaststättenverband (Dehoga) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern are also involved in the project.
NSA explains that an "internal error" and not hackers are guilty of the crash of the website
The shadowy National Security Agency explained on late Friday that a mistake had hammered its public website for a few hours and not hacker, as was claimed online.
"NSA.gov was not available for a few hours tonight, as an internal error occurred during a planned update," explained the spy agency in an e-mail message.
The problem will be resolved this evening.
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed Denial of Service attack (DDoS) is not true.
In the early evenings, online server trackers had noticed that the NSA website was not accessible for at least six hours and this is still not available for some users.
Previously, a NSA spokesman had explained to ABC News that the Authority's sensible internal network was "in no way" compromised.
Secret information is not in danger, says the spokesman.
At least one group of hacktivists claimed that the NSA website had been hampered by a DDoS attack.
In such attacks, the target website will be flooded with page calls until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses.
The cyber tactics are relatively simple and the attacks do not serve to penetrate into the internal network of the target system.
The former super-secret NSA, whose nickname once was No Search Agency (no such authority), is now found in the light of the public and is exposed to sharp criticism following the disclosures made over its extended monitoring programme in the home and abroad in recent months - a result of the secret NSA data stolen and published by the desillusioned former NSA employee Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy about the secret service fired initial speculation that the incident today was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
The number of people without a job decreased slightly in October by 22 to 1.307.
Although the rate was 3.1 percent better than last year and also better than in September, "we would have hoped more," says Monika Felder-Bauer, Deputy Managing Director of the Works Agency in Sonthofen.
Because many companies have so far reacted to settings.
One reason for this is according to the field-Bauer: "We barely have professionals in crafts, health care and the care of the elderly."
Since September, annual vacancies for staff in the hotel and catering industry have continued.

Loss of profit in Bombardier after decrease in delivery numbers and orders
On Thursday, the Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15% decrease in net profits after being under pressure by decreasing orders and deliveries to aircraft in the third quarter as well as contractual problems in the railway sector.
Bombardier based in Montreal did not publish any flight test data for his brand-new aircraft to the CSeries and did not provide any new information on whether the plane could enter commercial use in accordance with the ambitious schedule next September.
Only three additional launches have been followed on the flight of the test aeroplane one and a half months ago, which makes it questionable whether the test phase is going as planned.
The results remained behind the forecasts and resulted in a price crash of more than eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
On Thursday, Cameron Doerksen, analyst at National Bank Financial, reduced his evaluation of "outperform" to "sector perform" in view of the limited exchange potential of the stock in the next one to two quarters.
"Although weaker numbers were expected for aircraft, we are clearly disappointed by the margin development in transport," said Doerksen in a customer letter.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries when the test program for the plane progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more sceptical over the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft series can catapult the company into the lower market segment currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test plane was presented to the public in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delays.
However, so far mandatory orders for the CSeries are 177 moderate, as potential buyers would like to wait for the results of the flight tests and see if the company's claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost savings potential of the new nozzle aircraft are true.
Currently there are 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.
President Pierre Beaudoin assumes that Bombardier will reach his goal of 300 mandatory orders at the beginning of the commercial use of the jet.
On Thursday, the management of the company also assured analysts and media that the program was in the schedule.
"The test plane has no longer remained on the ground than expected," said Beaudoin at a telephone conference and added that during the flight's standing time boarding tests and software updates were set up.
Every manufacturer is planning differently.
We have decided to make a first flight and then to set up a review period, whatever we have done.
That's what happens throughout the flight program.
The second of five test aeroplanes is expected to start in the next few weeks, the remaining shortly afterwards, it was said by the company side.
However, analysts remain sceptical about whether 12 months after the first flight the first customer can take a CSeries plane in operation.
Bombardier stated that it would review the planning for the start-up (EIS) and will update it in the coming months.
"The slow progress of the escape test - even if they clearly correspond to Bombardier's internal planning - strengthens our view that the entry into service will shift to the first quarter of 2015," said Doerksen.
In the third quarter, at the end of September 30, Bombardier's net profit fell to 147 million dollars, 8 cents per share of 172 million dollars and 9 cents per share in the previous year.
The adjusted profit per share is 9 cents unchanged.
The turnover dropped slightly from 4.2 to 4.1 billion dollars.
Analysts expected a profit of 10 cents per share and a turnover of 4.56 billion dollars, according to Thomson Reuters I / B / E / S.
The fourth largest aircraft manufacturer in the world claims to have delivered 45 aircraft in this quarter, a decrease of 57 last year.
The net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
The order stock in the air and space parks was 32.9 billion dollars on 30 September and was therefore unchanged compared to 31 December.
"In the field of air and space, the results were within the framework of our requirements, but the low order entry and the overall market conditions were disappointing," said Beaudoin.
Turnover in the air and space parks fell by 13 percent to two billion dollars.
Bombardier, the world's largest railway manufacturer, announced that revenues in this division have risen by almost 11 percent to USD 2.1 billion.
The stock of orders in the transport sector was 32.6 billion dollars on 30 September and was thus slightly increased compared to 31 December.
The margin of profit in the transport sector was affected by resolution problems in some major contracts.
According to company management, there will be new requirements for the fourth quarter.
In the afternoon trading on Thursday, the Bombardier share dropped by 8.5 percent and was at 4.83 Canadian dollars, after it was also announced that the Google Financial Board Patrick Pichette will switch to the board.
The Brazilian Embraer SA, the world's third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and bombardier's closest rival, reported a 10% decrease in quarterly profit on Thursday.
USA: Shooting at the airport of Los Angeles
An unknown fired shots at LAX Airport on Friday morning (local time).
While the airport line informed Twitter about the short news service that the shooter was in custody, the Los Angeles Times reported that the man was dead.
Also a security man had been killed.
The media also reported several injuries.
US President Barack Obama was constantly informed of the situation, said the speaker of the White House, Jay Carney.
The incident occurred in Terminal 3. Eye witnesses indicated having seen a shooter with a gun in one of the exit halls, as several media reported.
A traveler told the station CNN that many people were looking for panic protection.
Travellers would have screamed and children cried.
Among the waiting people, panic broke out, many had hid behind chairs for fear.
He heard two shots, says a traveler of the Los Angeles Times.
A staff of the TSA security department suffered a gunshot injury at the foot.
The scene had been "like in a movie."
After that he had been brought into a security area himself, the man reported.
The shots should have fallen close to a security control area.
Airport building evacuated
Television images showed how many medical and police cars passed before a terminal.
Hundreds of people were brought to safety from the building.
Users published photos of a special operation command and a rifle lying on the ground on Twitter.
As the airport line informed about Twitter, the incident began at 9.30 a.m. in the morning (local time).
The access streets were blocked, resulting in a long retreat according to CNN.
Apart from landings, air traffic had been temporarily stopped, it was said.
However, several airplanes were also observed on CNN at the start.
Terminal 3 is mainly served by smaller US airlines.
The LAX airport of Los Angeles is the largest airport in the United States.
Cocaine adviser who warned the drug boss from police investigation must go to prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, transmitted information to underworld size Neil Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid his secret drug addiction could come to light.
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Crown Court.
A known prosecutor who warned a drug baron from a major police investigation because he was afraid his secret drug addiction could be detected was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided underworld size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about investigations on its activities in drug trafficking after he had been compromised by his own cocaine search.
The first-class lawyer named Bash was arrested in his house in 2011 after the police had supervised Scarborough, which he had represented in a previous drug procedure.
Officials observed how Scarborough (32) delivered three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancashire, while this was with colleagues at a dinner of the law chamber.
The investigation revealed that Ditta regularly consumed class A drugs after traces of cocaine were found in his hair, on his wallet and on credit cards during tests.
For an eight-month period between January and August 2011, he tried to obtain illegal information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were then monitored by the police in the framework of a major investigation procedure on heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 other people they were arrested later after the police secured heroin and cocaine in a number of house searches worth £1.5 million and £200,000 cash.
Ditta, 42, passed on information to the criminals because he feared his drug addiction could be published.
Today, Ditta, who works for Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, was found guilty and convicted at the Liverpool Crown Court after a three-week trial in two charges for disability of justice.
He admitted the possession of cocaine in an earlier interview.
The lawyer was transferred after the police found out in their investigation against Scarborough that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and saw him go to Ditta's house and put the drugs there with a purity of 60 percent in a black golf glove under the lawyer's garbage ton.
Shortly after he had delivered the drugs, Scarborough regularly contacted Ditta, who was at dinner at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park.
The lawyer returned home, picked up the drugs and then nine messages were exchanged between the two.
In court, it was known that Ditta was a "regular consumer" of cocaine after having been detected drugs in class A tests in his hair, wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but refused to take cocaine and said that he spoke to the suspected dealer because he was his client, and claimed that her discussion was subject to the "legal secrecy."
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were ensured and a hairsample was taken from him.
During the police interrogation he declared that he operated an office under his private address as well as at the workplace and clients would call him at home for legal matters.
In court, it was known that he had called important actors in drug trafficking, some of which he had previously represented, after significant arrests and informed them about what the investigators knew about them.
Attorney Anne Whyte said, "A criminal attorney should know better than anyone else that you do not break the law."
Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal defender because he has been too much involved with certain clients.
The relationship in question is not simply that of a drug dealer, but of a drug dealer who supplies his lawyer with drugs.
Some of his communications were undoubtedly legitimate, because he was the lawyer of these persons.
But that went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between lawyer and client.
He opposed the police investigation as far as possible, so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities.
Mr Ditta therefore disappointed his professional status.
He was too close to certain clients, especially Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta showed every misconduct and said, "If I were a corrupt lawyer that I'm not, and I wanted to pass information on to Scarborough, I wouldn't wait 15 hours, but I would do it immediately."
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead from the Lancashire police said, "Mr. Ditta has taken the step from a criminal to a criminal at the moment when he began to acquire drugs from organised criminals."
His cocaine dependence led to hopeless compromises and made him susceptible to the motives of leading members of organised crime, who instructed him to obtain valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure trust and confidence in the public.
Ditta has failed this trust and tried to scare behind the facade of his profession.
The Serious and Organised Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigation against Ditta, which also led to a conviction in three cases due to the possession of cocaine and legal disability, which underlines our determination to bring criminals to justice.
This case should be a warning to criminals and show that no one can escape the arm of the law.
We'll find you and bring you to court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after he declared himself guilty of conspiracy to heroin, cocaine and cannabis trafficking.
Thirty-five other persons involved in drug trafficking were sentenced to a total penalty of 153 years for drug offences.
On his website Ditta published an area of questions and answers about himself in which he stated that his dream job was to represent as a lawyer client in the death cell in America, his ultimate guest at dinner was Mohammed Ali and opportunity inequality was the motivation for his work.
Revolutionary work of church music
At the end of the celebrations of his 160-year-old existence, the songwriter Dunningen will convert two Gottesdienste with the "German Fair" by Franz Schubert.
After the great success of the "Rock my Life" musical, which the spectators enthusiased in the spring of this year, the songwriter will enrich two services with the performance of the German Fair by Franz Schubert at the end of the Jubilee year.
On Saturday, October 26, this extraordinary fair will be heard at the St. John Baptist Church in Lackendorf from 19 on the evening fair in the St. Martinuskirche Dunningen and on Sunday, October 27, from 10.15 a.m. in the church of St. John Baptist in Lackendorf.
The so-called Deutsche Messe with the original title "Singer zum Feier des heiligen Opfers der Messe", D 872, is a spiritual musical work of composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was at the time of the creation almost considered revolutionary.
The trade fair is listed in the context of the services of God, as the contractor Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind.
Under the leadership of Hermann Schneider, the choir is accompanied by the Blaser Group of the Music Association Frohsinn Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi at the organ.
Haslach: Skepsis fails to trust
With the elections to the parish council in 2015, for example, in the Season Unit Haslach (SE) the basic elements will change.
There is then only one common parish council for all six parish.
At a joint meeting on Saturday, the bodies from Haslach, Hofstetten, Mühlenbach, Fischerbach, Steinach and Welschensteinach prepared for the changes.
Because there is nothing to change to the basic decisions of the diocese and it is to the parish communities to implement them as satisfactorily as possible.
In the course of the day it became particularly clear: the scepticism towards the new one is hesitating, but more and more confident.
From the ideas and expectations of the 2015 innovations to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the parish community council, the extremely constructive discussions of the six bodies with the main officials of the Sealcare team were conducted.
Regional dekan Georg Schmitt explained the newly established guidelines for seal care units in the Archdiocese of Freiburg on the basis of a presentation.
After that, SE Haslach, as a church community, will form a public law body which enters into the rights and obligations of the so far six individual church communities.
There will only be a common parish council and a founding council in which the parish power office is represented.
Each parish shall be represented by at least two elected members, and in the six parishes are formed locally so-called community teams.
Their task will be to promote church life in the future.
The question of the finances of the individual parish communities then showed a considerable need for discussion.
The innovations provide for the maintenance of collateralised assets in the parish.
On the other hand, liabilities are transferred to the general public.
There were great concerns about the large planned investments, whose commitment then meets all the parishes.
"Even in the past, only projects that could be managed by the individual parish alone were invested," relatified Haslach's parish chairman Bruno Prinzbach.
Practical experience with a joint panel for five parish pastors painted Barbar Ritter, the chairman of the board in the Seelsorge Unit Schutterwald-Neuried.
In 2006, they had made their job, "One will be, five remain," and they had to realize that this is not so easy at all.
The bodies of the Haslacher Seelsorge Unit then answered questions about the future composition and size of the common parish council as well as the practical work of the municipal teams.
The work will be carried out at further meetings and decided at a further joint meeting of all six bodies next spring.
In the end, Pfarrgemeinderat Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the Seelsorge Unit, which was approved by a clear majority.
In Pfullendorf the electricity becomes more expensive
The citizens of Pfullendorfs must adjust to higher electricity costs.
As the Managing Director of the Urban Works, Jörg-Arne Bias, confirmed to SÜDKURIER, there is a four-fold Pfullendorfer family of between 70 and 90 euros per year.
The main reason for the rising price is the increase in the so-called EEC levy from 5,277 to 6,3 cents per kilowatt hour.
This levy will be re-established each year in October by the four operators of the large power tracks.
These calculate the additional costs incurred from the energy turn which they can charge through a tax on the electricity price.
The city works Pfullendorf form the last link in this chain.
The Board of Supervisors of the Energy Company had even assumed a higher tax in its forecasts, as Jörg-Arne Bias reports.
Now the concrete figures should be calculated before the city works could inform their customers about the exact price increase next week.
"We assume an increase of 1 cent plus x," said Bias, with the number rather close to the 2 cent.
Light for permanent red: Watch for waiting time
Sometimes a light just doesn't get green.
The contact loop in the street does not respond, or the light sign is defective.
What do you want to do - ride red?
If a affected person has waited long enough at a red light and the cross is free, he can continue, the Stuttgart attorney Ralf Becker explains in the magazine "Motorcycle."
However, the waiting period had to be "appropriate," which could be interpreted differently on a case-by-case basis.
Becker advises to hold out at least five minutes before a failure of the light is expected.
However, whoever continues the journey despite red lights must be aware that he is responsible for an accident caused by it.
If you tolerate less than five minutes, you may not wait long enough, Becker warns and refers to a decision of the Oberlandesgericht Hamm.
In the negotiated case, a driver had ignored the light after about three minutes of continuous red and had to be responsible for a negligible red light violation.
The light was not defective, it was only a little later on on green.
A prohibition of driving was saved from him because of the special situation - but the penalty was not.
Municipal Council welcomes sound budget
When it comes to the budget in municipal meetings, Mayor Ralph Gerster is laughing.
The municipal sack in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and debt has not known the administration since 2005.
The 2012 financial year can also be recorded as a full success in this sense.
This was evident in the presentation of the 2012 annual accounts.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget was about 7.6 million euros higher than planned.
The surplus of the administrative budget, with about 1.8 million euros, is also about one million euros above the approach.
The surplus is mainly due to higher industrial tax revenues and the municipal share of income tax.
The budget for assets was also clearly above the planned values.
Instead of the €1.5 million planned, it was €2.5 million last year.
"This is essentially due to the higher contribution from the administrative budget," said Rothmund.
Since fewer investments have been made in 2012 than planned, the reserve allocation has also been higher.
Overall, the general reserve could be increased by around EUR 2.1 million to a total of EUR 4.9 million.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for the good work.
"Such a work does not simply shake out of the sleeve," Gerster praised with regard to the annual bill.
He and the councils were obviously pleased with the good figures.
It may sound paradoxical, but precisely these good figures could soon be expensive for citizens.
Due to the good financial situation, the municipality has been able to refrain from high elevation rates in the past.
According to Gerster, however, subsidies had been reduced by the country.
These grants from various compensatory amounts are subject to conditions.
Among other things, the cities and municipalities applying for grants must show certain lifting rates.
"We need to look at the issue of lifting, as investment will come up in the coming years for which we would like grants," announced Gerster in this context.
Nagold: Hugo Wermter for 60 years in the choir
With 60 years as a singer, Hubert Wermter's history is almost twice as long as that of the Herbstfest, in which he was solemnly honored.
Hubert Wermter stood as usual in the colours of his male singing club on the stage.
Even after 60 years, singing with the choir that is now more than sweet still makes him great fun.
In the association Wermter was also active, including for 28 years as a member of the Committee.
He received several awards for his commitment and his association: Jörg Kohr, pastoral referee on behalf of the Cäcilienverband Rottenburg-Stuttgart, gave him - since the choir is also a chorus - a certificate of the association and a letter of honour signed by Bishop Gebhard Fürst.
His singer colleagues handed him the document of the German chorus association as well as a graved tin teller.
In addition to the honour, the 31st autumn festival was in common trains: With the MGV Betra, the songwriter Salzstetten, the singer department Baisingen and the local music club, the fullmaringer had loaded a bunch of different choirs and singing styles that the approximately 400 visitors entertained.
The MGV Vollmaringen opened with vocal songs such as "In the vineyard" and "Funny, your brothers."
For the honour of her singer Hubert Wermter, they prepared a small stand - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "Federal song."
Betra also sang classical choir songs like "hunters" by Julius Wengert, "far, far away" by Hubert Goisern and the folk song "When you go through the valley."
With his mixed choir and his group of women - the "impulse" - the songwriter, Salzstetten took care of the women's share of the festival.
The mixed choir kidnapped by Antos Gus in foreign countries with the Neapolitan folk "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" while the "impulse" also used foreign languages: "Liberatio" and "Hey Jude" belonged to their program.
The Baisinger Sports Association's singer department returned to home with "What is the Swob?" by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Papperts "Bierlied," where the Vollmaringer Musikvereinigung offered the crowning musical degree.
For the children there was a small secondary program - "Grandma Hanne" a.k.a. Hannelore Stollsteimer introduced a casperltheater and read a few stories that the children worked well for lunch.
Child dreams will come true
The kindergartens and kindergartens in the customs district receive mail these days.
The Black Forest Boat, in cooperation with the Bauhaus and the Sparkasse Zollernalb, wishes to support the facilities in the realization of their construction and insulation wishes.
Does the kindergarten need a new sandbox?
All kindergartens, kindergartens and cripples from the entire customs district can participate in the action.
If you have a construction or conquest wish for your facility, you can apply with it at the Black Forest Boot.
Be creative with your children and surprise the jury of the action Kindergarten-Baustelle.
A jury, consisting of representatives of Black Forest Boat, Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb, selected three requests from all entries.
What are the conditions for participation?
The wish should be realised with construction material of a maximum of 2000 euros and on a (action) day.
In addition, the winner himself has to provide many hard building helpers.
What's the matter with the day of action and the helpers?
Bauhaus provides the material with the support of the Sparkasse Zollernalb.
It will be delivered to the kindergarten on the agreed day and will then be processed directly by the helpers.
Helpers can be parents, grandparents, friends, associations and, of course, the educators and children themselves.
Kenyan press repents of controversial media law
"We are in a frightening situation and one may ask: what does Parliament hold from simply abolishing judicial independence tomorrow," was read in the newspaper which considers the draft law to be inconstitutional?
"The law is draconic and very criminal and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, Managing Director of the Capital Group, which also belongs to CapitalFM, one of the most respected independent radio stations and news sites of Kenya.
He said that the new media tribunal "will always be presumed, because it is an extended arm of the government," and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope the President listens to us and we appeal to him to reject this draft law and send it back to Parliament," he said.
According to the newspaper The Star, the government has "effectively seized the media" by the new law. However, The Standard, Democracy and Freedom of Speaking in Kenya wrote "a serious blow" and titled the draft as "draconic."
The adoption of the law is one of a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the aftermath of the attacks by armed Islamists on the Westgate shopping centre in September.
The Kenyan media took the wrath of the authorities because they published footage of security cameras on which it was seen how the units that were sent to the crime scene allegedly robbed the luxurious shopping centre.
Chief David Kimaiyo responded with the appointment of two journalists and a leading media representative to interrogate, even though the presumption was withdrawn after a screaming of the media.
According to the new law, media houses can be prosecuted with a penalty of up to 20 million Kenyan schillings and individual journalists with up to one million and the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation.
The Tribunal shall also have the right to seize the possession of the persons concerned if a penalty is not paid.
According to Daily Nation, "a single punishment can push most radio stations into bankruptcy."
In addition, the newspaper considers that these measures could have a devastating effect on their description according to "vibrant blogosphere" Kenya.
If they shut up the media, politicians could do whatever they want.
"No one will ever know," said Mutuma Mathiu, journalist at the nation, who calls the Kenyan media a decisive control factor in public life.
"If politicians leave themselves, lead the country into bankruptcy and return us to the time of the hunters and collectors," he commented.
The Kenyan legislature has already raised public trouble in the past.
In May they agreed to revoke the reductions ordered by the National Compensation Commission and put their defective wages of approximately 532,000 shilling tax-free per month into force - they are one of the highest in the world.
Bad-Dürrheim: A dream becomes true for the FC
At the importance for the city and football club, the official inauguration ceremony for the artificial sports place, despite the cold weather and the rain, did nothing.
I guess a more pleasant holiday time had all wanted last Saturday, but Peter didn't want to play with it.
So all those who came without a parachute or could not hold one for a reason.
That was the musicians who enumerated the festive act, just like some speakers.
Nass also became the president of the FC Albrecht Schlenker, who spoke of the fulfilment of a dream.
His thanks were to all the mayor Walter Klumpp, who had been very committed to the implementation of the project, the municipal council, the companies involved and members of the association who came forward.
This is particularly Lothar Hero, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The retired pensioners moved 400 square meters of patches for the new paths.
This remarkable volunteer commitment also appreciated the Landtag Commissioner Karl Rombach.
Other greetings were for the City Sports Committee Hubert Baier, the district president of the South Bavarian Football Association, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr from the planning office, who announced a donation for the youth division of the club.
Mayor Klumpp remembered that ever-recurring weather-related influences in spring and autumn added to the original lawn square so that it could not be played.
Fifteen years ago, there were the first thoughts on solving the problem, when it was thought of building a third place on the grounds of the football club or at the real school at the Salinensee.
Both were rejected again.
Six years ago, thought came up about the construction of an artificial sports site, which was generally considered the ultimate solution.
Concrete plans were taken up two years ago when FC took over the cabinet in Erbpacht, promised a cost contribution of EUR 100 000 for the construction of the place and approved the country's funding of EUR 104 000.
In October 2012, the municipal council decided to take over the remaining 356 000 euros from the total cost of 560 000 euros, summarizing Klumpp.
The construction start of the 68 times 108 meters large artificial grass place took place on June 4th.
During the three-month construction phase, 3000 cubic metres of soil were removed, half of which were used for the construction of a Dirt-Bike route.
The Union and the SPD continued their coalition negotiations on internal and judicial issues.
The relevant working group met in Berlin in the morning.
Among other things, we are talking about direct democracy, parliamentary bribery and the federal police.
In the morning, the Working Group on Migration and Integration also wanted to continue its discussions.
This should include duplication of citizenship, where both sides have contradictory ideas.
The SPD wants to end the obligation for immigrant children born in Germany to choose one - the Union rejects a double passport.
On the subject of transport, which is not on the agenda this Friday, the SPD supported its no to a car toll required by the CSU.
A Vignette was a "flatrate for multiplying and thus ecologically counterproductive," the SPD negotiator explained in a letter to his group on transport, Florian Pronold.
There was a threat to eradication on land roads, which are already the priority of accidents.
In addition, the introduction of a toll for all cars would be a first step from Pronolds's point of view.
"There is a danger that the compensation for Germans will be cancelled at a later date," he said.
Dieter Thomas Kuhn in Stuttgart: The singing fountain wave on the free light stage

Car drivers seriously injured in case of accident
In the event of an accident on Thursday night, a 37-year-old car driver from Aachen has been seriously injured.
According to the police, a 41-year-old from Müsch was on the way to Grefrath by 9: 15 with her car on the Kempen external ring.
When she wanted to turn left to St. Töniser's street, she overlooked the 37-year-old's car.
The driving tracks collapsed.
The Aachener suffered severe injuries and had to be brought to the hospital for treatment.

The BMW of a 23-year-old constancy came into conflict with the BMW.
Also damaged was the VW Passat of a 19-year-old who was driving behind the BMW.
In total, about 15,000 casualties occurred, the police informed them.
The road had to be blocked during the accident recording, it continued to be called.
Vienna Airport cancelled passenger calls
Mr. Max Maier, please come to gate 24.
In future, there will be no longer at Vienna-Schwechat Airport.
Most of the loudspeakers pass away - the noise level is to be significantly lowered.
Creating a more relaxed atmosphere is the goal of this innovation.
As Airport spokesman Peter Kleemann announced to Radio Vienna, Vienna Airport follows an international trend with the recruitment of transcripts that affect individuals.
For example, the airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt or Dubai already refrain from the noisy calls.
By removing these transcripts - on average, around 200 personal calls from the speakers on a day - it is expected to be more calm at the airport in the future.
"It has also been shown in the experience that these individual transcriptions have been seen relatively little, but at the same time all other information about changed flight climbs or time of departure here undergoes a little bit," said Kleemann in conversation with the radio station.
Highlander Games at the Caltenhof
In addition to the tractors, there is a second competition at the farm autumn party at the cold yard from 6 to 8 September.
On Saturday, September 7th, start the Highlander Games at 1.30 p.m.

Teams and single fighters measure themselves in the disciplines tree strain throwing, hoof throwing and water egg wear.
Four and a half meters the tree strain is long and 25 to 30 kilograms heavy.
"It does not matter to the breadth," explains organizer Peter Sailing.
The tribe must be thrown out vertically, let it skip once and then come straight to the bed.
This is assessed with most points.
It depends on the accuracy of the target when throwing the cough.
From eight meters away, thrown on a pile.
Skill and strength must be demonstrated by the participants in the water egg carriage over 50 meters.
Time and amount of water in a Bottich are measured at the end.
From each "clan" or team two may then participate in the single competition.
The winners of the team and individual competition receive prizes.
Training can be done from 10 o'clock.
A suitable clothing is required, for example, the fighters can enter the shotgun rock.
But also weakian desire is allowed.
For "Outfit," the jury will forgive a few more bonus points.
You can sign up until an hour before the start of the competition.
With the Scottish-Swifty Highlander Games and the tractor-pulling, which starts half an hour earlier, a lot of action has been announced on the mainland on Saturday.
In the evening, the blast music friends come at their expense.
At 7 o'clock, the birabohmic blast music from Schömberg is designed for the great entertainment evening.
The chapel plays fleet Polkas and fairy tales.
Their repertoire also includes sensitive rolls and a satter big band sound.
With this, Heinz Koch will be known as a singing host and black-worm baron for a while under the rains.
In Dornhan he has already appeared at the Christmas market and at the narrenzunft.
On Sunday, the music club maintains linen for early kicks, from 2 pm the peasant chapel böffingen is a guest, and the "Oldies" then have the festival cut off.
It is already on Friday that the DJ Ralf will be held for a championship party.
Other programme points include the Oldtimer and Tracker Meeting on Saturday and Sunday, exhibitions of companies on agriculture and forestry.

Organizers are the multi-purpose support association, the ski club and the tractor friends "lighthouses."
Overview of milk and egg options
Vegan nutrition requires vegetable alternatives to eggs, milk and milk products.
Purified tofu with plant seed is, for example, a quartz set.
The vegetarian farm is also referred to as World Day on November 1st.
The vegetarian farm Germany proposes a number of vegan alternatives on the occasion of the World War II on 1 November:
Pure plant margarine is a good alternative to butter, allowing yogurt to be replaced by soya yogurt.
Instead of milk, soya, oats, mandles or rice milk could be used.
Appliable plant saws replace conventional slaughterhouses.
There are also vegetable alternatives for eggs.
Half the cracked, mature bananas, for example, can replace an egg as a binder in a cake.
Also 50 grams of apple or an edible spoon made of linseed plus three edible spoons of water are suitable for this purpose.
Slowly, dough instead with eggs, for example, with a mixture of a teaspoon of baking powder, a tablespoon of food strength and three tablespoons of mineral water.
But also 50 grams of soya yoghurt or silk tow can fulfil this purpose.
According to Vebu, around 800 000 people are currently eating vegan, which is purely vegetable.
Sleepless in New York
On the way to their host families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, the students of the Black Forest Gymnasium met the American big city of New York.
After eight hours of flight, the Brooklyn Bridge reached the heart of the city, Manhattan, on foot.
Here already a fascinating view of the world-known skyline, which is a special attraction in the evening light.
Due to the time shift, the students were on their feet almost 24 hours, but faithful to the motto "The city does not sleep" was decided on the day at Times Square.
Despite shutdown, on the second day the liberty statue could be reached with a ferry and cleared on foot.
Then it was about the financial center around Wall Street to remember the 11th September.
On the third day, students from the 373 meters high view platform of the Empire-State-Building were able to gain an overview of the fascinating big city and enjoy the view.
After that it went through the hectic driveway of the New York streets through the Rockefeller Center to Central Park, which offered an ideal opportunity to spend a short time in the autumn sun.
After a short flight from New York to Boston, the pupils have arrived in their host families and experience school everyday at Weymouth High School.
This year also a Hubertusmesse is celebrated on the Namestag of the Holy Hubertus in the parish church of St. Marien on the Hülsbergstraße.
St. Hubertus was a rather ruthless hunter who was later appointed Bishop of Lüttich by a vision.
The hunting horn bladder group of the hunting horns of Westphalia under the leadership of Brigitte Kluth musizes on parforcehorn (natural horns in the mood Es) according to old, originally French melodies.
The leaves wear riding clothing because they mainly accompany horses, horses and dog meats on towing hunting musically.
The ceremony will take place on Sunday 3 November at 11.30 a.m.
The newly designed pot shines with a new cafe.
One that invites you to stay and return.
One that wants to make the name a program.
According to Lexicon, a psychological phenomenon is referred to as déjà Vu, which is expressed in the feeling that a new situation has experienced or seen.
In the event of visiting the same name café at the strike in the district of Kleve in sight to the University of Rhein-Waal it does not have to remain with pure déjà Vu feeling.
Finally, the café with the beautiful name has exactly the aim: to make a real stay not only grateful, but always easy to see again.
Because it's fun and it's just beautiful.
A look into the inner life at the Opslag 8 gives a good feeling to the viewer on hold.
The highly modern but not cool café ambience looks like a place to feel well.
Here the team with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the top spoils the guest with various coffee or cocktail variants.
For this there are delicious cakes or individual fresh baguettes.
The holders, both 33 years old, made themselves a name before the opening of the jewelry café as gastronomers: in Kranenburg they led the "Art Lounge."
From moving to Kleve to the warehouse, the sympathetic café lovers hope more audience.
Not least through college.
"We don't have a specific target group," says Daniel Büttner.
Instead, the two students here want to address young students as well as seniors and all age classes between them.
Speaking of café lovers.
The sympathetic pair of holders is behind the coffee pleasure.
Enjoy the fragrance of hot brow in the most variations themselves.
Expressofan
Daniel Büttner is the Expresso fan and Mirjam van der Stelt the Cappuccino drinker.
"A baguette - this is my thing," she betrays the NRZ.
There were two events in the bright café.
Better say one.
Because the harbour festival was rather outside - the café Déjà Vu did not benefit from it.
But there was also the ring night night.
"Nice, successful and funny," the two 33-year-olds found.
But not everyone's thing.
Maybe that's why Daniel Büttner is not a prominent fan of event evenings: "You can't do it all right."
And with an event, I always talk to only those who are interested in the special event.
That's why events will be the exception with us.
"We want to disturb the very normal operation as little as possible."
That is to say, Déjà Vu is also a trustworthy person.
With regard to the quality of the products offered here, as well as the team and the beautiful surroundings at the impact in Kleve.
The road that develops more and more into a catering area.
To the joy of many Klever, the guests from close and far and the students who discover the maze meile and thus also the café Déjà Vu for themselves.

A day of gratitude at the MGV in Dinker
It was the 165. Foundation party to which the MGV "Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker" had invited this year and 52 guests, active singers and their wives, had liked to come.
In the club place of the "Witteborg" hostel in Dinker, everyone enjoyed harmonious co-operation entirely in the sign of music.
Traditionally, the foundation festival is always the right festivity to make honours.
This time, writer Rolf Wagener welcomed the special award "Singer of the Year."
"You have not only written a lot for us, but you have also played so many rounds for us, for our heartfelt thanks," said the Chairman of Chores Erich Schlotmann.
This year the awards for participation in the performances and choir samples through activity strings went to the choir leader Dieter Schulze with 44 participants, followed by Honorary Chairman Horst Pier-Ribbert, the chairman himself, and the last year's "singer of the year" Friedrich Winkler with 42 participants each.
Place five occupied Notenwart Artur Brückner.
A special thank you the board addressed to the team of Vereinswertin Ange Pier-Ribbert, who once again had engraved a menu of the extra class and Gerda Pier-Ribbert for the table decoration.
The MGV "Friedrich-Wilhelm" always meets his regular choir samples on Tuesday at 7.45 pm in the club site.
"New sworthy voices are welcome to us at any time," Schlotmann said.
UN announces new targets in the fight against poverty
The United Nations is starting to draw up a number of new targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals for Poverty Fighting announced 12 years ago.
In the run-up to the UN Sustainable Development Summit, which began in Rio de Janeiro in the evening, Australian diplomats played a key role in the promotion of "sustainable development objectives," to replace the Millennium Goals ending in 2015.
They were included in the final draft document, which will be adopted by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, at the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on the evening at the summit that the time had come to "think about national interests."
"I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to start a process to agree on universal, sustainable development objectives," he said.
"These objectives will build on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will not hesitate to implement this mandate given to me by the Member States in order to achieve our vision of sustainable development objectives based on the success of the Millennium Goals. "
Although SG Achim / Baden has been without victory for four days, there is still a good mood in the handball ligists.
Coach Tomasz Malmon has no doubt about that.
Everyone is still fully motivated to do this.
Nevertheless, I hope that we will finally win again.
"Because I don't remember how such a victory tastes," Malmon expects a success experience from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II.
Although the Third League Reserve from Fredenbeck has currently not ripped any trees, Malmon lifts the sign finger in front of the field warning.
Many players I have trained in the A youth myself.
Therefore, they will certainly be particularly motivated against their ex-coach.
"It is also necessary to wait for further reinforcement from the first," explains SG-Coach.
In order to finally return to the track of success, the Malmon team must definitely increase in comparison to the previous performances.
Before all things in the coverage work and during the switching game, it was the last thing it haped giant.
Opportunities must also definitely be improved.
Therefore, I hope that my players have finally got their head free during the short break.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing in the face of collapses between influential personalities
Thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputos under the vigilant eyes of the statue of Samora Machel, the founder of the state and first president of Mosambic to agree to peace calls in a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace again, we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, managing director of an investment company.
For fear of the future of the country, she exchanged her business clothes against a T-shirt with the "We demand security" in Portuguese and joined the population at the capital's independence site on Thursday.
For two weeks now, there have been reports almost daily on interference between government forces and Renamo, which are one of the worst fighters since the peace agreement over 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, which was initially supported by white-ruled Rhodesia and later by the apartheid government of South Africa in attempting to destabilize the independent government of the country.
After the 1992 Peace Treaty, she became a opposition party.
Analysts consider it unlikely that the country will return to an adult conflict, but the recent events of foreign investors and locals have worrying.
There is a lot at stake for the rapidly growing economy, because the discovery of huge gas reserves off the coast and coal stocks in the north-west could bring investment of over 50 billion US dollars from companies like Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the USA in the coming years.
The ruling Frelimo Party, since 1975 the dominant power, and Renamo blame each other for the tensions.
Renamo claims that the government has provoked the recent collapse by attacking its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional Hochburg Renamos, on 17 October.
The attacks on the former rebels escalated when government troops attacked Renamo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, said Renamo's spokesman to the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for the collapse and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to defeat concerns about instability.
Against AFP, the French news agency, he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama considers itself "losers," who "wants to use all his remaining forces to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government."
Both Frelimo and Renamo emphasise that they want to avoid a war.
But the concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted with the words that Renamo abandoned the 1992 peace agreement.
In contrast to the FT, he said that so he meant that Frelimo no longer respects the agreement.
"Our vision is to start negotiations again and seriously," said Mazanga.
Previous talks between the parties have helped little to resolve the tensions that have been fired by a number of collapses this year.
"We have two adult men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who collapse their heads," says Joseph Hanlon, lecturer at the Open University and Mozambique expert.
None of them is good in negotiation and none is prepared to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, who is pressing for electoral reform, has already stated that she will boycott the municipal elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as an attempt to create concessions and financial advantages by the government.
Renamo's electoral order has been shrinking since 1992, while a newer party, founded by a former Renamo member, is likely to improve during the elections.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza - whose resignation is due when his second term of office ends next year - would destroy the country's democracy.
"He does not want multi-party democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace because he does not want to give up the presidential office," said Mazanga.
It is unclear what capacity Renamo has, but it has made unrest attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important North-South connection.
Most fighters took place in the province of Sofala, which lies a few hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but in which Beira is located, using the port, mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale to export coal.
In June, Rio interrupted the use of the railroad for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the route.
Mazanga replied back to the question whether Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted "to warn the international community that things are not good in Mozambique," said Mazanga.
Instability has increased the frustration of the government, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, because many people were already concerned about corruption, slow progress in development and a recent abduction wave.
"People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country and he should be the one to find solutions to the problems," he explains.
Omar Sultane, a demonstrant, said people just wanted stability.
"No one interests Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace and usable streets again," he explained.
Children should be taught myths and legends as "models for life," says a writer.
Thor's stories showed that "brutal power has no chance against clever tricks," and the Arthur legend demonstrates how important it is to have a dream.
However, many of the myths are "far too wild, too offensive and in some cases too dirty to be taught at schools," why Crossley-Holland pleaded for a "careful selection" of ancient works.
"I find it wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education," he said.
I've been proposing this as a plan for 20 years.
He added that with authors and teachers who are "excessive didactic," children would "completely shut down," because in entertaining stories the messages would be "subtle."
Crossley-Holland, who has translated Beowulf from Angelsaksisch and is author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales, said: "You can follow certain intentions, but you should keep them in the background as possible."
The biggest difference between an adult author who writes for adults and a writer who writes for children is the need to provide hope.
Not everything needs to be simplified or lead to the happy end, but there is an immense sense of good and evil.
This must be underscored, revealed by the history and not explained.
This is the old story of the show instead of telling.
Hansjakob moves again in Freihof
100 years ago Heinrich Hansjakob took his retirement in Haslach, and on Sunday his last years became alive in the "Freihof."
The many spectators were enthusiastic about the very short two scenes.
From the arrival, from the grant of honorary citizenship to his death, the script author and Hansjako actor Alois Kraftzcyk had designed a entertaining piece that received a lot of applause under the direction of the Cornelia people.
Marcus Zagermann took the audience as a spokesman through the ten different scenes, explaining connections and overcrowded time jumps from the youth to the forthcoming retirement.
On October 22, 1913, Hansjakob comes home in his child's sky, in his Freihof.
And then the scene game began, in which Alois Krafczyk once again shine in his paraderolle as the great son of the city.
Stilecht performed with the twin panner and "Schwarzwälder Füchsen" by Erich Becherer from Mühlenbach.
He was not only received by the audience with a lot of applause, but also his sister Philippine welcomed him.
Billy Sum-Hermann understood it incredibly well to move into the role of the sister and lend her to Mimik and the gesture of immense life.
Between the individual games the Mühlenbacher Farmer Chapel played suitable selected pieces of music and thus rounded the performance.
In order to grant the honorary bourgeoisie, Haslach's mayor Heinz Winkler gave himself the honour, who in the presence of the then official Hättich, together with a part of the city council, made his expectation.
Their expectation then made the three-queen singers that led Hansjakob to the proclamation: "Oh, how beautiful, there will again be youth memories to my own three-queen time alive."
With their song "O Jesulein" they welcomed the audience in the Freihof as well as the stork day children with their loud "Out, Out."
His criticism of the official church had at that time expressed Hansjakob as well as his concerns about the emergence of agriculture, the consequences of industrialisation or the effects of war.
In the homeland, behind his grave chapel on the fire at Hofstetten, he found his resting place.
"A troubled spirit had finally found his tranquility and had gone home forever," it was called at the end of the scene game.
There was a lot of applause and a lot of promising words from the audience for the performance.
Basketball: The hope of the neckar giants grows
The chances for the Ligaverbleiben of the athletic Ludwigsburger Bundesliga basketball players have increased.
Because if there is a Wildcard procedure, then there is now one competitor less for the Neckar Riesen.
The Hamburg Towers basketball project abandons an application for a possible backseat.
"We will not participate in the Wildcard procedure," said ex-national player Pascal Roller, who has been designing the concept for a professional club in Hanseatic City since 2012.
A first breathing was still not heard from Ludwigsburg.
"We did not deal with the Wildcard procedure as long as it has not been established that Düsseldorf does not receive a license," said Neckar-Riesen-Boss Alexander Reil of our newspaper.
Up to May 23, the ascendant Düsseldorf Baskets can submit documents to the arbitration court and prove its economic maturity.
To date, however, the Rhineland-Rhineland-Rhineland-Rhineland-Rhineland-Rhineland-Rhineland-Rhineland-Rhineland has been refused the licence twice.
The arbitration court is the last instance.
Haigerloch: Abendmahlskirche puts in the viewpoint
As a contribution of the city to the 150-year existence of the Evangelical Church in Haigerloch, the city's cultural and tourism office dedicates the last of its this year public themes on Sunday, 27 October, the evening mahlskirche.

Snowden could also testify in Russia
The former US Secret Service expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum in the US Spa Affair.
Representatives of the Federal Attorney General could either ask written questions or personally meet the 30-year-olds in Russia.
This was reported to the Interfax Agency, calling on unnamed circles who are familiar with the situation.
It was said that such a question could be resolved intergovernmental.
An exit of Snowden from Russia is practically excluded.
"In this case, he loses his refugee status," the Agency quoted its source.
Since Germany was an ally of the United States, Snowden threatened the extradition there, it continued

Rhenus Midgard has also invested heavily in land.
They distribute the coal coming from the ships to the hills.
The company has several iron in the fire at the site.
In addition to the coal import, Rhenus Midgard is using wind logistics, among other things.
Black sends the coal in the storage place in front of the pond.
Distribute or load the coal here as required by two giant blue shutters and rechargers.
In every movement of the conveyor, a shrimp of warning sounds over the site.
"The signals serve security and are statutory," says Matthias Schrell, Managing Director of the Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
In the event of unfavorable wind, it is unfortunately widely heard - and so there have already been some complaints from people from the city north.
He takes the complaints very seriously and has therefore contacted the persons concerned, says the 40-year-old.
In close consultation with the authorities, the warning signals are now being kept down with technical measures.
In the future it will continue to focus on open dialogue with the neighbours.
Because Matthias Schrell still has a lot to do at the location.
With the expansion of the Lower Saxony Bridge, Rhenus Midgard continues to rely on coal imports for power plants and is one of the great in Europe in this sector.
Capesize bulk carriers can be manufactured here for a long time.
"This year we want to crack the 3 million tons brand in the envelope," says Schrell.
In addition to the Eon power plant on site, the import coal goes to domestic power plants.
If the GDF-Suez power plant is still on the grid, nearly 5 million tonnes of coal imports per year would be realistic.
The three ship loads on the bridge and the second transport band could create up to 10 million.
Bayern's basketball player despite first defeat optimistic
Even the first defeat in the Euroleague could not diminish the enormous optimism among the Bavarian Bavarian basketball players.
"No one can prohibit us from believing to win against the best team of Europe in the past two years," Bavarian Coach Svetislav Pesic, after the unhappy 83: 88 (39: 47) on Thursday night at Olympiakos Piräus, the title defender.
We sent the message: Basketball exists in Munich too!
At its first third appearance in the European king class, the Munich people sold themselves very well for a long time, but were simply not clear enough in the decisive phases.
The guests first managed to turn a 15-point restraint 13 minutes before the end of the game into a tour before pirate again gave the game a turn.
"We fought unbelievable back against the double Euroleague champion, but then made lightweight mistakes again," said Bayern-Profi Yassin Idbihi.
We're proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most successful casters of the Munich, who in the first two parties had celebrated significant victories against the Italian serial champion Montepaschi Siena and the Polish title carrier Zielona Góra.
Ben Greenman: Ten years New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
It could be said that New York City is the birthplace of stand-up Comedy in America: almost a hundred years ago, the varietal artist Frank Fay, who worked as a Conférencier at the Palace Theatre at Broadway, began to tell the crowd of direct jokes in the form of a conversation.
In the course of the years, Fay's innovation was expanded, as was last seen at the New York Comedy Festival.
This year the festival celebrates its ten-year anniversary with over sixty shows in small clubs and large theatres.
"Most of these headlines started with Carolines and then became more successful until they were ever too familiar to join a club," Hirsch said.
We designed this festival so we could continue working with them.
At this year's event, there are performances of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher as well as of "Stand Up for Heroes," an annual music and comedy benefit event for army eveterans at Madison Square Garden, where, among other things, Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby are performing.
With the festival the world of comedy has also grown.
A number of comedians who participate in the festival this year have become known about rather unconventional ways, such as broadcasts on smaller television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll became known with a sitcom on cable television (the ironic-sloppy Fantasy Football Series "The League" on FXX) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was a part of the occupation at "Saturday Night Live" as well as at "Parks and Recreation" although she is the most famous for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On."
Both Kroll and Slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices (the surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic W. Kaumau Bell concentrated on races) are products of the decentralised world of the American comedy.
One of the biggest visitors of the festival is an interview: David Steinberg is speaking to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but has become a respected TV and film director as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007 he moderated a TV show called Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg at TV Land.
The meeting takes place at the Town Hall in the middle of Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry's entire work," said Steinberg.
He told me when he's here, then sometimes he goes through the alley between two buildings and thinks, "Hey, if I lose all my money, I might live here.
Iran satisfied with the process of nuclear negotiations
Iran shows itself a week before the next nuclear meeting with the five UN veto forces and Germany satisfied with the negotiation process.
"After years, an agreement was reached with the International Atomic Energy Agency to eliminate the differences of recent years," Foreign Minister Mohammed Dschawad Sarif wrote on his Facebook page.
Although it would be a long way, the nuclear supervisor would be satisfied with the negotiation process and also optimistic that at the end both sides would come to a solution.
Drama in Uruguay: Boys kill games with machete
Two children have admitted the murder of an 11-year-old in Uruguay.
The two 14 and 12 years old boys had invited their victims to go hunting birds with them.
With machetes and knives armed they stabbed the 11-year-old on Tuesday and threw the body into a well, the newspaper "El País" reported on Thursday.
They would then have played soccer in a workforce district before their apartments.
The body was found in the following night in the village of Cerro Pelado, 15 kilometres north of the exclusive beach resort Punta del Este.
As an alibi, a five-year-old half-sister of the younger who had taken her should testify that she was sexually attacked by the boy.
But when the girl described before the police the dathergang without mention of an attack against her, the two boys admitted the deliberate killing of the 11-year-old.
As a reason, the elderly called a rivalry in football.
He was provisionally admitted to a psychiatric juvenile institution.
Penitentiary must go to prison
Because of explosive trafficking in human beings, pimp, threat, insult and dangerous injury, the Landgericht Konstanz has condemned a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen to three and a half years in prison.
The former federal defense soldier, who worked as a doorman after two operations in Afghanistan, made a confession in the context of a trial agreement.
He has therefore met women in five cases via Internet or telephone contacts, which he sent to the line after a few weeks against their will.
He used to break resistance with violence and threats.
He retained the revenues of women who purchased for him for some years.
By confiscating mobile phones and SIM cards, he interfered women's contacts with the outside world.
Together with a colleague who mediated the women, he brought them to various boards in the southwest.
There he had them partly monitored to control their revenues.
In court, the defendant first claimed he was suffering from a severe trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan died next to him in an explosion.
After a psychiatric expert expressed great doubts about the mental constraint and hence a reduced debt, the 33-year-old made a comprehensive confession.
The court didn't have to hear any of the damaged women anymore.
As a Kripo official reported, at least four other cases of explosive trafficking could be identified after a first notification by means of telephone surveillance measures.
The interviews had been marked by high aggression.
In later interviews, the injured would have confirmed their martyrdom.
Another witness, with whom one of the women had discovered blue spots throughout the body, has not made any statement until today.
It is "a completely broken personality," which sees violence and exploitation in this semester as normal.
The defendant regretted his behavior yesterday.
"He had dissolved from these circles and wanted to live a very normal life after the detention," he said.
Oil price continues after up to 96 USD per barrel
The oil price continued to fall on Friday after concerns about a high offer surpassed a report which says that the energy-intensive manufacturing sector in China is growing.
The reference crude oil variety for deliveries in December had fallen by 14 cents to 96.24 USD per barrel in the late morning in Europe in electronic commerce at the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The contract fell by 39 cents on Thursday, which meant a fall of 5.8 per cent in October.
The large supply of crude oil has burdened prices in recent weeks.
The United States Energy Ministry stated on Wednesday that the US offer increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
In the course of five weeks, the offer had increased by 25 million barrels.
But on Friday there was evidence of stronger demand by two reports of an increase in activity in Chinese production.
This indicates a continued recovery of China's economy, whose growth had increased to 7.8 per cent in the third quarter after it had reached the lowest level in the previous quarter for two decades.
Raw oil of the Brent variety, a reference value for international crude oil, which is also used by American refineries, fell at ICE Exchange in London by 26 cents to 108.58 USD per barrel.
Court blocks decision on the NYPD Stop and Frisk Directive
On Thursday, a federal court of appeal in the United States blocked the order of a judge requesting changes to the stop-and-fresher program ("stop and search") of the New York police department, and removed the judge from the case.
The Second US Appeal Court stated that Judge Shira Scheindlin's decisions would be suspended until a decision was taken on the appeal of the city.
The Judge had in August judged that the city violated the Constitution by the way the programme for the maintenance and questioning of persons was implemented.
The city appealed against its assessment and ordered remedies, including the decision to set up a monitoring body to assist the police in amending its Directive and the relevant training programme.
On Tuesday, the Court of Appeal heard the arguments for the suspension required.
The appeal report stated that the Judge had to be dismissed from the case because she violated the Code of Conduct for US Judges by providing that a judge should avoid the appearance of party; this was partly justified by a number of media interviews and public statements in which she had responded publicly to the criticism of the court.
The judge had sentenced police officers to violate the civil rights of tens of thousands of people, because in an unreasonable way they targeted black and Latin American men with the stop-and-free program.
It appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of essential changes, including reforms in the field of directives, training and service supervision, and ordered a pilot programme of cameras carried out on the body in quarters where most controls were carried out.
In August, the city of New York agreed to terminate the practice of storing names and addresses of persons who were rereleased after a police control.
An oral hearing on the appeal of the city is scheduled after 14 March 2014.
The stop-and-freshness tactics were criticized by a number of citizens' rights supporters.
Controls of this kind have been in different forms for decades, but the number of recorded controls during the term of office of the partisan mayor Michael Bloomberg increased to a full-time hole of 684.330 in 2011, most of them black and Latin American men.
In 2004, four men belonging to all minorities filed a complaint that developed into a collective complaint.
In favour of changes to the NYPD's Stop and Frisk programme, the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trustworthy and effective police and influence the way other police presidencies use the regulation.
The opponents believe that the changes would diminish the police 's moral, but not crime; money would also be wasted and the wider problem of a police force that is under pressure after thousands of posts have passed over the last decade.
The Judge pointed out that it did not end the stop-and-risk practice which was constitutional, but only reform the way in which NYPD's controls were carried out.
From the happiness of dreaming camels
Luck is an oasis that only succeeds dreaming camels
The first president Wolfgang Henne described the history and fascination of the association "Helping Hands."
On Saturday afternoon, the 10th anniversary of the association was celebrated, which can already have significant successes.
The first president, Henne, reported in detail about the work of the association.
In 2004 he was the first to be in the Cheijk-Zajed hospital in Nouakchott.
As a result, further cooperation developed, and Gynecologist Henne carried out numerous operations on site on several trips.
During the speeches, images of the operations on a large screen were shown so that the guests of the Jubilee event could take a picture of the actions mentioned.
The desert vehicle of the association was also shown.
It is a former Federal Border Protection Vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, the former OB of Nagold, had proposed to equip this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and is now planning, according to Henne, to operate at the association in advisory function.
In 2008, in the record period of almost a week, Schleeh from Baiersbronn created the medical station in Socogim, a Elendsviertel on the edge of the capital - voluntarily.
She also mentioned a new mother-child hospital in Nouakchott
Particularly interesting in times when the birth clinic is to be streamlined away in Nagold.
We learn a lot in Africa as a doctor, as hens say, for example, drainage against burning out.
Because of the political disturbances in the country one could not make as many journeys as planned, but for that many doctors came to Germany to hospice here in various areas.
In addition, containers are regularly sent to Africa with material, such as medical equipment, medicines, bandages, hospital beds and glasses in March this year.
Co-initiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself delivered plenty of local colorite by telling the experiences of the Stammheimer musicians, who traditionally support the association, during their journey to Mauritania from Mauritania from Mercedes to the mobile goat stall.
As his personal moves, he called his work in the field of audit as a young member.
When he realized how much money was lost on the way, he decided to help Africans control a budget by the people.
In addition, fowl stressed that the global economy also requires global human love.
Nor should it be forgotten that Africa is closer than some people think.
From Gran Canaria it is not far to Africa.
Coulson used phone hacking to check a tip
The earlier news of the Word publisher Andy Coulson allegedly used "phone hacking, monitoring and confrontation" in trying to confirm a false tip about an affair of the then Interior Minister Charles Clarke.
Attorney Andrew Edis QC explained to the court at the Old Bailey that News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with his "attractive special consultant" Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper instructed the private detective Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlby's voicemails and persecuted them, but Coulson also called her and left messages as the court found out.
"According to the Public Prosecutor, Coulson, who is now a publisher of the NotW, is no one who stands in front of the apartment of people and hopes to capture them on a fresh act, but one who likes to confront people with a story to see their reaction," Edis said.
He said NotW uses three procedures to investigate stories: phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously, he knows about the second, the surveillance, otherwise it can't be.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hacking?
He denies it, but we say, "And if he knew about it."
Rumors about an affair Clarkes were first picked up by NotW's feature editor, when a source that was sexually interested in Pawlby was said: "Don't waste your time, she's with Charles."
A band with voicemails from her phone of at least three occasions was secured in August 2006 in Mulcaire's apartment.
The investigators also found records on the detective's computer where Pawlby and her sister were stored as "projects."
In the time when the investigations ran, the grandparents of Pawlby received anonymous calls in which they were asked for information about them, Edis explained.
Meanwhile, the former chief porter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup supervised the movements of Pawlby.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her a voicemail with the following content: "I have a story that we want to make out tomorrow, which I would like to talk to Charles about."
Edis explained that Coulson's activities in this story followed the same pattern as other important personalities, such as the former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson Blunkett had confronted an affair with a married woman when he had lied himself with the co-accused Rebekah Brooks who had been married at that time.
Coulson and Brooks argue that they have sworn to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted the phone hacking.
From protest against the planned wealth tax, the French football will actually make the first strike since 1972.
A conciliation meeting ends without a result.
In the conflict about the wealth tax, the government and the professional football in France have been manoeuvring into a dead end after a failed conciliation meeting.
Although President François Hollande received his complaint on Thursday at the Paris Élysée Palace of Association and Association representatives, he also heard their complaints.
However, he refused to save the football from the planned 75% tax on income of more than one million euros per year, which all companies in the country should pay for two years from 2014 onwards.
The opposite was also hard.
The strike announced for the end of November will now be carried out, the Head of the Association of Proficlubs (UCPF), Jean-Pierre Louvel, announced.
The games held between November 29 and December 2 in Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 are thus discontinued.
Tchingen: No absolute protection possible
"We want to involve the inhabitants early in planning," Mayor Jens Häußler opened the public information event on the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
About 80 participants had come to the community hall to explain the planned measures, to ask questions, to express concerns and to bring ideas.
Häußler made it clear: "The final decisions fall the members of the municipal council."
The floods, which were unprepared by Gechingen on 15 May 2009, have been a sharpening event that raised the question of protection measures for the future, according to Hytler.
A river area survey had been commissioned with the neighbouring municipality of Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
"Protecting as many buildings as possible is the goal," says Hytler.
The planning of protection against an overflow to be expected statistically every 100 years according to the German weather service is based.
Climate change is taken into account by a 15% surcharge.
In professional circles this is called "HQ 100aKlima."
The water masses, which had caused significant damage in Gechingen in 2009, correspond to a 1,000-year flood.
"There is no absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement," says Hytler.
In order to achieve HQ 100aClimate protection, around four million euros must be invested in gechingen, with the municipality being able to expect national subsidies of around 70 percent.
However, Häußler pointed out that there was only support if a comprehensive approach was implemented.
To this end, the municipality is dependent on the participation of the citizens.
A costly planning and approval procedure had to be completed.
In the best case, the implementation could be started in 2016.
Among other things, the protection concept presented last week in the Municipal Council (we reported) provides for local measures in the flow of Irm's fluid from the Stammheimer Valley.
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept, participants took the opportunity to present their concerns.
Among other things, it was questioned why no more dams and restraint basins were planned to protect the site.
Gregor Kühn, expert plan of the delegated Engineering Office Forest and Corbe from Hügelsheim, who presented the concept, stressed that it needed the interplay of all presented measures to achieve the desired goal in the sum.
Joachim Wald of Forest and Corbe also said that the most economical solution was to be found.
There was discourage in the anchorages of the altar, which, even in the case of normal weather rain, have to suffer from an overload of the channel network.
The problem is known in the administration and the first measures have already been taken.
However, Häußler pointed out that the directives on channel systems should not be mixed with other than the protection of floods.
The municipality is obliged to interpret the channel network in such a way that two to three years of rainfall could be seized.
To dimensionate the wastewater channels larger, millions would swallow.
Heavy injured after collapse
On early Friday afternoon, two car drivers were severely injured on the National Road 44 near Revensdorf in the event of a frontal collapse.
The police immediately closed the road completely, but could not say much about the accident.
However, there are several testimonies that should be evaluated first.
It says that the 19-year-old driver of a VW Golf drove towards Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf met her with his hyundai.
Both vehicles collapsed, where the woman was so badly stuck that the fire department needed almost half an hour to get her out of the vehicle wreck.
The actual cause of the accident remained unresolved at first.
Both injuries came into nearby hospitals.
The route remained closed for about two hours.
It could be called the Dostojewski of the United States.
Philip K. Dick was a divinist, a metaphysician, his novels and stories also have something serial.
Amazing the relationship in the outer: the tingling eyes, the beard, the high forehead.
And as Fjodor M. Dostojewski can be understood with his massive oeuvre as the founder and apologist of the Russian soul, Philip K. Dick is read as American prophets, which are quite valid in their own country.
Some titles are published in the Heyne publisher, the Haffmans cassette with the 118 stories distributes second thousand ends.
Dick explains America - the empire of breathtaking technical progress, coupled with paranoia, security insanity and the belief to be chosen.
Dick had God's experiences, his late books read like a mixture of John's Revelation and a computer manual.
Maybe he was crazy, he had drugs in his brain.
He understood early that the computers are divinity.
He wrote a computer theology and asked what distinguishes a person from a machine, the creator from his creature.
That's the "Blade Runner" problem.
Killing.
A Master of Science Fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories inspired film directors like Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is now particularly significant.
The "Minority Report" comes from the year 1956, it flows the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy Tribunale.
It is being developed here the principle of "pre-crime," "pre-crime," that is, what is now more or less official doctrine of the White House.
In Dick's world, which is terribly similar to ours, mutants are looking into the future - and the police are attacking.
"We capture individuals who have not violated any law," says the head of the authority.
"We'll catch them before they can commit a crime of violence."
And: "There are no serious criminals in our society, for this we have a strawberry full of pesudo criminals." They read time streams.
They assume that bad things happen and prevent the criminal thought from being put into practice.
Dick's story works like the bluepause for the anti-terror laws and the interrogation of the NSA.
Anticipation of the attack: This is how Obama's drone philosophy and practice works.
But Dick's story isn't finished yet.
The chief of police complains that there is no more division of violence, the military controls everyday life - and what is left of the state.
Then the guardian himself will be monitored and transferred to a future crime.
The system is crashing.
It's perfect, but it's lying.
It invents its own conditions.
Takes mistakes and sacrifices not only in purchase, but builds on it.
The system creates the danger it is fighting.
Leading Philip K. Dick means getting closer to the truth all the time.
Spa affair about Merkel in Russia testify
The former US Secret Service expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum in the US Spa Apartment around Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Representatives of the German Federal Attorney General could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-olds personally in Russia, the Agency announced Interfax.
Previously, the Green Bundestag secretary Hans-Christian Ströbele had met yesterday as the first German politician Snowden in Moscow to talk to him about the affair.
NSA disclosures strengthen corporate paranoia due to state surveillance
On a mild day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew deep over the US consulate in Frankfurt am Main, Germany's capital finance.
At the instructions of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection and Terrorism (BVT), the German Home Secret Service, he should photograph the roof of the US External Post, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Federal Bank.
According to German media, BVT wanted to demonstrate the presence of surveillance antennas and the action led to a change of word between the US and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, American Director of National Intelligence, reiterated in September that the US did not use any means of foreign spying "to steal the business secrets of foreign companies on behalf of US companies so that they could expand their international competitiveness or profit."
But since Edward Snowden, who became a Whistleblower, began to publish his full horn in US surveillance secrets, European governments and business leaders are no longer sure if they can speak to the Director.
Reports that the American National Security Agency is spying on the Brazilian oil company Petrobas and purchasing data from American cloud providers including Google and Yahoo have brought the company paranoia to a new peak due to state surveillance.
The barrel brought the discovery that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone was intertwined, possibly for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can face up to it, business management is certainly also potential objectives.
Snowden has made intensive cooperation between US intelligence services and companies transparent.
I think it is possible that these data will be used for mutual benefit.
"Germany must wake up," explains Oliver Green, President of BITMi, representing small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe that the United States was now an almost as great a risk as China when it comes to industrial pioneering and data stealing, such a survey published by the consultant company EY in July.
However, the documents passed by Snowden have not yet shown that the US has passed on the business secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politics have expressed their concern that the EU lacks certain IT and Internet possibilities and should reduce its dependence on the US.
The companies are sceptical about this.
In the Bundestag it was suggested that we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and open them back slowly...
"This is not how this works," says Hasso Platner, chairman of the German software manufacturer SAP.
If you wanted a strong European IT industry, you should not have let them die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidised, from coal to cars to agriculture.
Everything but the IT industry.
However, the range and technical refinement of the US spy-owned companies discovered by the Snowden discoveries have shocked which had previously seen the greatest spy risk in China.
Cloud computing is a major change because European business leaders are now more aware that data stored in the USA is subject to the case law and therefore potentially endangered.
According to a survey carried out by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trading institution, the discoveries of the US data mining activities with Prism reported about ten percent of the non-US members plans to use an American provider.
Jim Snabe, Deputy Managing Director of SAP, says, "We see a new question from customers that was not there a year ago - she says," Where are my data stored and can you guarantee that these physically remain in this legal area? "
Many German corporate leaders believe that the recent reports simply confirm what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and that they must be watched at any price.
That economic spying is not a surprise.
It's always been like that.
"It has been a subject for many years and has not changed fundamentally by the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, Chairman of the Chemical Company BASF.
The Americans are spying on us at the commercial and industrial level, as we are doing, because it is in the national interest to defend our companies.
Corporate management usually does not boast about the countermeasures that have been taken, because this gives attacker benefits.
In large companies, employees have been blamed for a long time that taking a free USB stick on a fair or the unguarded leave of a laptop in the hotel room is not advisable, said.
Ulrich Hackenberk, board member of Audi car manufacturer, says that for years it has been a standard practice to collect the phones before a board meeting so that they can not be used as interrogators.
German BVT advises managers to use simple prepaid phones when travelling abroad because smartphones may be compromised.
The prepaid phones are thrown away afterwards.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to hacking and monitoring.
In Germany, many of these companies are world-wide market leaders in the respective niche.
"Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets against unauthorised access," the BAT warns in a report.
The US warns its own companies from economic spying by other countries.
According to Washington Post, in February, France, Russia and Israel, two of the countries were placed behind China at the US National Intelligence Estimate at rank to obtain economic data from the hack.
A member of the board of a German Blue Chip company agreed when it comes to economic spying, then "the French are the worst."
Bernard Squarcini, former Head of the French Home Secret Service DCRL, was quoted this month in an interview with the following words: "The Secret Services know very clearly that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terror, spy on their allies."
Hechingen: Fair gives answers to wedding questions
"Marriage is the most important discovery journey that man can do," the philosopher Sören Kierkegaard said.
Tips, as at least the wedding celebration succeeds, now gave a special fair in the domain in Hechingen.
There were important providers around a wedding.
A trend: The Retro-Look has recovered.
That's about to start with the wedding clothes.
White is must, best covered or in cream.
Front are the many roasted and embroidery dresses closed, often with a loop, while in the back they go down the back and often end in a sleeve.
However, as Stefanie Koch stressed from the fashion house, the spirits divorce.
In men the suit dominates with vest and plaster, but creamy or brown combinations can also be chosen.
Important is the selection of the site, has been explained.
Jewelless adjacent rooms are not optimal, the ambience should be special.
Here the domain drew attention to its own offer in the Remise.
If you want to drive the carriage, Uwe Link has an offer for it.
"But coaches are also popular for young people's divorce," he says.
Romantic is also required for invitations, flower arrangements and also for wedding pictures.
More and more in fashion, the "After-Wedding Photo" - i.e. reception facilities in special places, preferably such as waterfalls, a few days after the party, but in wedding clothes, explained Elisabeth Keidel.
Many more details of a successful wedding were presented in the domain on Sunday.
Flower arrangement, rings, wedding table, cake and also a magician, such as Marko Ripperger, who can enjoy guests stylish.
Don't forget the right cosmetics and nail care.
All for an unforgettable party.
Dogs friends successful
For the repeated time, the athletes of the dog friends Bitz were successful at a rally-obedience tournament.
Achim Scherrenbacher started in cinnamon with two dogs; with his dog Sandy he reached 94 points in the class Beginner and secured the fifth place, and with the 15-month-old Marley he brought it with 87 points on place 12.
Susi Höpp, with her Woody in class 1, stood the critical view of the performance judge.
Parents of a teenager from Georgia who died in a tragic accident believe in murder
The parents of the teenager, whose body was found in a wrapped ringer mattress in the gym of his high school, are convinced that her son was murdered, said the lawyer of the family on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta in the U.S. state of Georgia was found on January 11 in an upset mattress that stood behind the tribune in the cave.
The investigating officers of Lowndes County came to the conclusion that Johnson died in a tragic accident, however, which doubts the 17-year-old's family.
"They are convinced that her son was murdered," said Benjamin Crump, the lawyer of Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, against FoxNews.com.
You never thought he died the way the sheriff succeeded.
"They believe that it is beyond any logic that violates the laws of physics as well as the health of human beings," Crump said.
Instead, they are convinced that the truth is concealed to protect the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
"Your son went to school to learn and came back in the body bag," he commented.
The U.S. Attorney General Michael Moore said on Thursday that there will be a formal investigation into the death of Johnson, since a number of important questions are still unresolved.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death due to a crime?
This was explained by Moore at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts, wherever they go.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I represent the view that there is a sufficient basis for a formal investigation," he said.
Moore explained to reporters that the initial autopsy indicated that Johnson had died of the consequences of a "position-related embroidery."
However, a second autopsy caused another cause of death, so Moore.
"There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that if there were sufficient evidence for a criminal or civil investigation of the death of Johnson, he would instruct the FBI to carry out the investigation.
A representative of the County Sheriff's Authority was not ready to comment immediately on our request on Thursday.
On Wednesday, a court in the South of Georgia ordered the authorities to release all surveillance videos that the investigators have verified.
The teenager's parents said they were hoping that the video records contained clues on how he died.
CDC publishes allergy directives for schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a series of guidelines for dealing with food allergies from children in schools.
These are the first such directives issued by the US Government, as the number of children with food allergies is increasing.
One of 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy.
According to CDC, the spread of food allergies among children increased by 18 per cent between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines contain information for schools which are intended to raise awareness of food allergies and how to deal with children who show allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools have epinephrine in stock - the car injection of the EpiPen brand is most commonly used - to face a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction.
Legislators in the states have recently amended the rules so that schools can keep epinephrine easier.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms mentioned by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say, "It feels like something's pushing my tongue," "My tongue feels like a hair is on it" or "My tongue is crying."
Parents of intersexual children can choose "sex undetermined"
Germany is the first European nation in which a third sex is recognised for children born with unclear genitals.
Newborns are no longer allocated stiff male or female.
Under the new law, parents no longer have to explain sex to such children, but can indicate "undetermined" or "not defined" on the birth certificate.
The aim of the law is to take the pressure of parents so that they do not have to make overhasty decisions on operations for gender allocation in newborn children and to combat discrimination against intersexual people.
According to BBC, an intersexual person said years later, "I am neither man nor woman."
I will remain the flickwork created by doctors mutilated and full of scars.
It is estimated that one of 2,000 children is not born as a boy or as a girl every year.
They are one of the intersexual, a group that is covered by the diagnosis "sexual differentiation disorder" (DSD), a collective concept for people with atypical chromosomes, germs (ovaries or testicles) or unusually developed genitals.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersexual.
The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed, but most experts in the USA recommend using the best available information on gender assignment if a determination is not possible and not waiting for the psychological and physical development of the child before deciding - if at all - for an operation.
The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specialized in the problem of gender identification, said the new German law "sounds like a good thing."
Intersexual children represent an ethical dilemma.
"Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgical surgery, but most children do not," he said.
You could do a sex assignment without surgery and then wait for the development of identity.
The scientific data on how a child develops his gender identity at all are not very precise.
No one knows why it's happening.
It's like the secret why people are gay.
In a 2011 report to the European Commission, it says that intersexual people should be distinguished from transsexual or transgender persons, because their status is not gender-related, but is conditional on their biological constitution, which is not exclusively male or female, but typically both at the same time or not clearly defined as one of them.
These characteristics were shown in subordinate sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and stature, priority sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals or in chromosome structures and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination that intersexual and transgenic persons are exposed to in their professional life and of the extent of harassment, violence and prejudice crimes.
Boys that don't match the sex image have a special camp now.
In the meantime, in Australia and Nepal it is possible for adults to indicate male, female or "third sex" on official documents.
In June, Australian Norrie May-Welby (52) was recognised as the first "genital" person in the world after a court had granted the lifelong maintenance of a "undefined" gender status.
In addition to M and W, German cards will have a third allocation, X for intersexual, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, such as a message message to France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French members of the strict Catholic country signed a petition that the "gender theory" should be removed from school books.
The American website Catholic Online has also opposed the German law, with the justification: "If the world is engraved in a new state, where the sex is a decision, but not sexual activity, then we are turning two more pillars of civilization."
The mother of a newborn from Maryland explained to Baby Zone that it would be better for babies to be assigned a sex at birth.
"The parent is already stressful enough without further restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of your own child," she said the parent website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children born with both male and female genitals were called hermaphrodites, according to the attractive Greek God who had both sexes.
Ten years ago, medicine considered the sex to be something that could be erased and rebuilt.
But in the meantime, the ethical foundations of an operation are questioned, since it is now known how complex the gender identity is, and that doctors can also be wrong because they do not know how the child feels when growing up with the sex they have assigned.
"In the middle of the 20th century, it was called a psychiatric emergency," said Drescher.
If such a child was born, then they called not the psychiatrist, but the surgeon.
The prevailing theory of the treatment of children with unclear genitals relates to Dr. John Money from Johns Hopkins University, who considered the sex to be formable.
He characterized the term "gender identity" and argued that social and environmental attacks - as parents raise a child - interacted with the genes and hormones of a child and that one person considered himself male or female.
But in a case known under the title "John / Joan" from 1966 his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been separated from a fucked-up circumcision to castrate the child completely and also to remove his testicles and then raise him as a girl.
"Money presented this case as a successful example of a transformation, but he was not," said Drescher.
When the boy was about 15 years old, he moved back to male sex and married a woman.
At 38, he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practice this model.
But in the 1990s, with the entry of the Internet, survivors of these sex operations have come to the public who are "not happy with the result."
Like Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old author from Montana, born with XY male chromosomes, but dubious genitals.
The doctors were not aware whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never have a "satisfying life" as a man.
So his external organ and the testicles were surgically removed shortly after the birth of 1976 and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12, he received female hormones.
"I knew I was not a girl," he explained to ABCNews.com
I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he should receive a vaginal plastic.
But since he was depressed and knew that something was wrong, he demanded his medical records.
What he found was shocking.
I was sterilized when I was born, and no one ever told me that.
Bruce was born with a DSD by which his body could not produce enough testosterone for the development of genitals.
After knowing the truth, he changed back to male identity, received testosterone injections and removed his breasts.
The operation has made him infertile.
Today he fights for others in an organization called Interface Project for intersexual people being perceived as normal.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, Managing Director of the Advocates for Informed Choice legal group based in California, is concerned that the German law "can encourage" to stamp and stigmatize. "
"Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and advise the child not to" assign ", she said.
We fear that this will promote intervention.
We think it would be better to assign the male or female sex and then wait.
But yet we do not know how the law will impact, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports Australian law, because "it enables adults to recognise as third sex."
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions on their legal sex," she said.
The German law is about the assignment at birth.
This is not a fight at which you should force small children at that time.
When they are grown up, they can decide their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Pittsburg Brustradiologist who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group, says the German law "Plenipotentiary" both parents and children.
Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with male chromosomes but has a DSD called complete androgen resistance.
Because of the receptor defect of the target cells for testosterone, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no egg sticks.
Today, Katie is 29 and married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as an employee in child psychiatry.
Although she is infertile, she hopes to have a child through adoption or a motherfucker.
"The law gives parents room, so they don't have to make overwhelming decisions," said Baratz.
It gives them time to do different tests and clarify things and gives them so time before they write "male" or "female."
In this way everything is fine - you raise the child and love it.
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy your parents' happiness.
And you don't have to rush a surgery that can no longer be reversed.
"This includes the children in the decision and eliminates the fear that parents are relieving because they think they would not do the right thing," she explained.
In the end, the child decides about the sex that is better suited to him - and that is wonderful.
This enables children to make the decision themselves.
Unknown injured girl by shot from car
Unknown people have injured a twelve-year-old in Saxony-Anhalt when shooting from a car.
The perpetrators had probably fired a group of children on Thursday night in Gento with an air pressure weapon.
That's what the police told you in Castle.
The girl was easily injured on the left wound.
Rescue forces took the girl to the hospital.
The shot came from a small car that had passed a group of six children and had stopped suddenly.
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The perpetrators also shot at a bus stop.
A disc broke.
Then they drove away.
Criminal police investigated, it was called Friday.
Until now, the police inspection can look back at a quiet Halloween night.
Officials were called only twice to obscure children who threw them against house facades.
Since the owners of the house realized this in time and the eggs were removed immediately, there should not have been any material damage.
In addition, some Sylvesterböller were also lit in the city area, but there was no damage to the situation.
A residents of the Bishop-Friendship Road reported that his car was wrapped with Klopapier and his bike blinds were removed.
However, until the police arrived, the man found all his cyclists in the immediate vicinity, so the police did not have to continue to act.
Living with a future perspective
Actually, Waltraud Ries lives traumatically.
Your house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with a lot of green, an old tree stock, nice neighbours and not too much traffic.
There are only a few minutes of public transport in the city.
"You are hopefully not afraid of spiders?" asked Waltraud Ries and pointed to a fat spider on the door frame.
I've been looking for a new apartment for my husband and me for some time.
But you know how difficult this is in Stuttgart.
However, the reason is not spider phobia, but the concern that at age the many stairways to the house and in the apartment can no longer handle, she explains.
In addition: Since a Meniscus operation, the midfifciger has had to know in her own body what it means to move with disability from floor to floor.
Recently, a book of her appeared on the topic of 'Lucky living at age - Which form of residence is the best for me?'.
"Our apartment is the best example of what doesn't work at all at the age," she starts telling.
When she moved to the Maisonette apartment with her husband more than 20 years ago, it was just a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green.
Today, with the middle of fifty, Waltraud Ries thinks differently about it.
She also knows that she is one of the few people who are dealing with the topic of "living in age."
Most people are pushing it out as long as they can.
Old will always be just the others', she says smiling.
Only when the pressure of suffering is really high, you worry.
"Then it can be too late," says Ries.
In her book, the interior architect presents 17 housing models for a self-defined living at age.
"However, which form of residence you choose is always an individual decision," she explains.
There is no solution for age.
Even those who can afford the retirement seat in Tuscany or Brittany should always consider that they could also become ill.
And: 'Without good knowledge of the national language one also unites in the Dolce Vita,' gives the specialist bookmaker to think of relocators.
Among their models are classic care models, alternative housing forms or the often quoted retirement WG.
At the age everyone has so his ticks and makeup
'For me such a community of living would be nothing, 'she means with an eye wink.
Not even like a student WG with a shared bathroom and kitchen.
"At age, you just need your retreat rooms," says Ries.
The fact that a senior housing community can still work does not mean that the bookmaker does not want to exclude it.
This had to go differently than in the classical WG.
And sometimes you just want your peace, 'she thinks.
With this opinion, at least she is not alone in the capital of the country.
"Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own apartment as long as they can," is also the experience of Theresa Rütten, the head of the civil service life at the age of the capital of the country.
Your department advises people about the topic of 'getting older'.
Therefore, just older people would often also buy inconveniences and restrictions only to stay in their usual surroundings, that is also the experience of the Foundation's product test.
Today there are many ways to create the house or apartment barrier-free.
Ries recommends that all those who are concerned with the ageing reconstruction of their house or apartment, first of all, inform themselves thoroughly and not instruct the first best craftsman.
Today there are also specialists for the ageing reconstruction.
Even in the rental apartment, one or other can be realized, and if it is just the toilet seat elevation, the interior architect will clarify.
But not always the existing apartment can be redesigned age-friendly and thus barrier-free, even if it is still so beautiful.
This experience had to be made by Waltraud Ries.
Although you could install a staircase elevator inside the apartment, which would also be paved with stairways to the door of the apartment, the far greater obstacle.
She'll continue searching until she finds the ideal object for herself and her husband.
Before the move it greets her more than before the spider at her living door.
USA wants to continue prosecuting Snowden
The United States has not changed its attitude to the former US Secret Officer Edward Snowden.
He will continue to be accused of passing on unauthorized secret information.
Therefore, he had to take a criminal trial in the United States, said the spokeswoman of the US Foreign Ministry, Jennifer Psaki, in Washington.
Nor would the recent statements by Snowden change anything.
Previously, the German Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele had called on the United States, after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow, to stop threatening him with punishment.
Psaki emphasised that strongest statements were about the one of a parliamentarian and not the one of a German member of the government.
Intelligence enthusiast Edward Snowden is in principle ready for a conversation with German authorities.
First, however, he wants to know his situation.
This has been clarified by the former NSA staff sought by the US in an unaddressed letter published by the Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwarded to the Federal Government, the Bundestag and the Advocate General.
The letter has the following text after a translation by Ströbele:
To the Competent
I was asked to write to you about your investigation of mass surveillance.
My name is Edward Joseph Snowden and was previously contracted or employed as a technical expert at the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) of the United States.
As a result of my employment in these institutions, I witnessed systematic violations of law by my government, which led me to act by moral duty.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I saw myself exposed to a serious and persistent hatred which forced me to leave my family and my home.
I currently live in exile and enjoy temporary asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation in accordance with international law.
I am encouraged by the response to my political action, both in the US and elsewhere.
Citizens around the world and also high-level officials - including the United States - have judged the disclosure of a system of comprehensive monitoring which is not accountable to anyone as a public service.
These spionage disclosures followed many proposals on new laws and directives aimed at the previously concealed abuse of public confidence.
The benefits for society from these findings are becoming increasingly clearer and at the same time the risks taken into account have been reduced.
Although the result of my efforts was proven to be positive, my government of Dissens continues to treat it as a faithful breach and strives to criticize political expression and put charges against it.
Yet, speaking the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the United States Government, with the support of the international community, will take this disappointing attitude.
I hope that, when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved, I will be able to participate adequately and legally in the responsible clarification of the facts relating to the statements made in the media, in particular with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports.
I look forward to a conversation with you in your country as soon as the situation is resolved and thank you for your efforts to safeguard international law that protects us all.
Edward Snowden testified by Hans-Christian Ströbele
Kindergarten has found a private buyer
"The building is in good hands," says Winterling's mayor Michael Maier.
The municipality has sold the former kindergarten on the Gartenstraße to a private person.
The municipal council agreed to the sale at its recent meeting in the non-public part.
The building changed its owner to a "reasonable" price.
"The community is satisfied," Maier emphasises.
In the budget, EUR 100 000 was earmarked.
It is not yet clear how the new owner wants to use the former kindergarten.
The mayor is right that Winterlingen has handed over the responsibility for the building before the winter to someone else and therefore no longer has to do for the entertainment of the house, like to heat, look for the garden and to clear the walk.
"This effort is now gone," Maier is pleased.
Place concert at high summer temperatures
The Musikverein Hammereisenbach offers a place concert on the terrace of the guest house Hammer.
When Dirigent Bianca Willmann lifts the pole at 7.30 o'clock, the thermometer still shows 25 degrees.
About 50 listeners look forward to the sounds of the Hammrich musicians.
The president, Manuela Honeck, explains the music pieces.
Honeck thanked all those who had helped to manage the first musician hock successfully in this context.
Report: Obama campaign considered to replace biden by Hillary Clinton
The closest advisors of President Barack Obama have considered in secret to replace Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton in the 2012 election campaign, according to the New York Times.
The discovery is the most remarkable surprise of the long-awaited work of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann on the 2012 election campaign, "Double Down: Game Change 2012."
The Times is a copy of the book that will soon appear, and she reported on Thursday night that the president's top advisers would have performed "extensive group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011" to find out if it would look better for Obama's flattering hope of re-election if he dropped Biden.
According to Jonathan Martin, the National Political Correspondent of the Times, the book thoroughly records the history of the efforts of leading employees of the campaign and the White House, in particular the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure the impact it has on the survey values to exchange the former Foreign Minister Clinton against the Vice President.
The potential change was a strict secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the president's closest advisors - including Daley, former campaign leader Obamas, Jim Messina, and former leading advisors of the White House, David Axelrod and David Plouffe - knew about the planned change.
In "Double Down," it is claimed that Daley had been at the forefront of efforts to exchange bids despite their "tight, personal relationship" before a decision was finally taken against such a chess, after the data showed that Clinton's candidate would "not significantly improve Obama's chances."
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the government actually considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
"I said a whole series of things that should be considered, and that was one of them," Daley explained to the magazine.
One must remember that the president had terrible surveys at that time, so we thought, "For God's sake, what do we do?"
While Daley called the investigations "provided care," Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN that during the re-election campaign considerable effort had been made to find out whether such a train would pay for the electoral urns.
"In campaigns, not so much money is spent on surveys and focus groups if you don't seriously think about something," Martin said on AC360.
However, it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team was thinking about an exchange.
Martin said to CNN that he asked Daley if his then boss had known about the potential change.
Although Daley explained that he did not believe that the president was "aware of the possible change," the former Chief of Staff admitted that it was "possible" that Obama had known about it.
Martin added that "Double Down" did not provide a definitive answer to the question whether the political explorations had reached Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin whether he seriously thought Obama had no knowledge of the investigations on whether to drop Biden during the elections.
"Possible," Martin replied.
What happens to my e-mail on the way?
E-mail is actually called electronic letter.
Was the postal secrecy technically implemented in the design of the Internet service as with the conventional mail?
In the conception of early Internet services, the focus was on enabling communication.
The basic technical protocols have therefore not been taken into account to create a stable basis for a sound-proof exchange of letters.
Therefore, a conventional e-mail corresponds to an open postcard rather than a sealed letter.
If user "Anna" sends an e-mail to "Benni, are the computers of the two directly connected?
The email program or the browser of Anna will send the mail to the mail server of her service provider in the first step.
For example, if she has a Gmail account, that would be Google.
This mail server sends the content to the provider Benni uses.
On the route the mail can run via several other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can then call the content from his provider.
Are conventional e-mails being read on their way through the network?
Most emails are read on the way several times by software robots.
For the provider of the sender, it is usually checked whether the mail carries a damage program as an annex.
A virus check is also carried out on the recipient systems.
In addition, the providers check whether it is a troublesome and unwanted spam mail that is immediately deleted or at least sorted into a spam folder.
Do the robots have another task?
For systems like GMail, the robot also identifies the information that Google needs to place context advertising.
If Anna and Benni communicate via Gmail about their future holiday trip, Google can inspire relevant links to vacation offers.
Do unknown people also read the e-mails?
The likelihood of unauthorised people reading an e-mail is extremely low.
Theoretically, however, this is possible.
In companies, administrators often have the opportunity to read electronic mail.
The law enforcement authorities and secret services also have legal possibilities to capture or take note of e-mails.
This will include possible illegal delays.
Is it possible to protect e-mails from reading?
With a encryption according to the OpenPGP standard, an e-mail can be encrypted effectively against reading.
With a high technical effort, it is also possible to hide the metadata of e-mail communication, so that it is not even possible to detect who communicated with whom.
How important are Yahoo and Google on the email market in Germany?
Yahoo and Google play only a subordinate role in the mainly private posters, according to a survey by Convios Consulting from August 2013.
While the shares of Yahoo-Mail had fallen last, GMail was able to clearly add from Google.
Mother in the woods worn out and retired
When his pathetic mother died, a man from Wolfsburg made a plan.
He buried the dead in a forest - and continued to pay her pensions and care.
A 67-year-old Wolfsburger buried his dead mother after investigating the police in the woods.
First, he covered the death of the 89-year-old, then he took the money for more than one and a half years.
Now the 67-year-old must be responsible for fraud, as a speaker said on Friday.
So the man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was suspected already in May: at that time, there was no need for medication for the nursing mother.
The pensioner told the investigators that his mother had travelled to Spain.
Because this was strange to the officials, they continued to investigate.
It was found that the two had lived in a common apartment for more than 15 years and he had last taken care of them.
The 67-year-old finally gave birth to his mother's death.
According to the police, an autopsy showed no evidence of a capital crime.
Would you like ice cream that lights up in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has developed the first in the dark light ice - with the help of quals.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of marine animals and created a brilliant leakage of it.
The idea came to him after he had read a research work on quals and could convince Chinese scientists to artificially produce the glowing protein.
The ice cream reacts with the tongue when it is consumed, thereby increasing the pH in the protein and triggering the light.
Chris explains that the ice cream reacts to the heat in the mouth and shines - the more you lick, the sooner it gets.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company "Lick Me I'm Delicious," says: "The product is incredible, but still in a very early production phase, and so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds."
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH.
When the mouth heats the protein, the pH rises and the ice brightens.
We have tested it in the last few months and it seemed ideal for us to bring it to the market on Halloween because it has this wonderful light effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because the qual light is four times more expensive than gold.
Every bullet costs me about £140.
But it tastes delicious for that.
Charlie's experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual tastes, including beer, cheese, beef and leaf gold.
But its latest creation is to become even more ambitious.
He says, "I would like to develop an invisible ice cream."
This is on and for itself impossible because of the light-breaking caused by the ice crystals that consist of ice cream; but I suspect we will find a way to create it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a qual made artificially by Chinese scientists
After six days, the TSV Morsum is still without any point in the Handball Association League.
However, it is now for the team of Ingo Ehlers tomorrow's Derby against the TSV DaWelt who celebrated last weekend his first victory.
With this game the season begins new for us.
"I hope we finally have our head free," Ehlers's behavior gives itself optimistic.
At last, with the exception of the permanent injured Hendrik Blohme, he has available his complete cader.
Also the world, like us, puts on tempospiels.
That is why we need to keep our error rate low.
However, first and foremost it is necessary to increase the coverage, which has left everything but a safe impression.
= = References = = = = External links = = * Official website
The game was of course a house number.
But that's why we're not the favourite yet, because in Derby, everything can always happen.
However, Panitz now wants to play in Morsum to start a series.
Lack of Jan-Malte Jodat.
For this, the A-Youth Joost Windßuss, who is active with double playing rights at the A-Youth League HC Bremen, celebrates its season debut.
If you're not hot in such a game, stay at home.
Halloween 2013: In figures
When I was a kid, Halloween had something magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, stay late and dress up for the neighborhood.
Today I've become a Halloween muffle.
In the last two years I have not declared myself willing to distribute from my apartment from candy, and I guess this year will not.
But according to statistics, I'm a black sheep, as far as Halloween is concerned.
The majority of Americans - 158 million to be precise - celebrate Halloween this year and spend a total of USD 6.9 billion for sweets, costumes and decorations, according to the American Federation of Retailers (NRF).
One thing I look forward to every Halloween again is the trend values.
The costumes will be about 1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, exciting unanimated objects are the last shouting.
Women no longer have to cover themselves in sexy clothes, they can now embody seductive food such as pizza, hamburger or carrots.
As far as men are concerned, I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet the Daft Punk Space men will get it into the Instagram Feeds this year.
According to Google, the most wanted costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess there's nothing wrong with tradition.
We dressed our dogs last year and were not alone to my astonishment.
In fact, Americans spend $330 million this year on costumes of their pets, according to the NRF.
That's a lot of hot dogs.
As far as sweets are concerned, we are not ticklish.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year, so The Nielsen Company.
That's about 270 million kilograms of chocolate, carpets, bonbons and rubber berries.
So good news for the 41 million people, according to the US Ministry of Commerce, who are pulling through the neighborhood by saying "sweet or oxygen."
In fact, we are going to buy over 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and - we are not kidding - eat.
The only thing we do not want to consume is the sugar sweetening Candy Corn; yet 15 million kilograms of it are sold by Halloween, according to the National Association of Candy Manufacturers.
That's about nine billion corn grains.
It's a mystery I couldn't solve yet.
There's nothing more of Halloween than houses where it spits.
They have great names like "Terror Behind the Walls" (which, by the way, is in a real prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock."
In fact, there are 1,200 officially recognized spookhouses in the United States that earn $500 million revenues, so America Haunts, and that includes the wonderful photos on which you just pee in your pants and then put your friends on Facebook where you don't get rid of them, and then one of the guy you stand on leaves a comment like "nice face expression."
But let's finally come to the pumpkins.
Charlie Brown made us familiar with the Great Pumpkin when we were kids, and cutting a Pumpkin is like the jewelry of the Christmas tree - something we made from small ones.
Fortunately, the "baby in pumpkin" trend only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up cutting the pumpkin and not sitting in it.
This year, Americans will spend about 106 million dollars for pumpkins, according to the US Census Bureau.
The pumpkin leaves, which slowly rot in the front garden, are probably from Illinois, where 245 million kilograms of pumpkin were harvested this year.
If you want to point right, then call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and cut something pretty out of their 921 kilo heavy pumpkin.
Living fire in Helmbrechts: Rescue personnel mountains chilled body
The firemen had to leave in Helmbrechts on the late Thursday night.
A triple family house in the district of Hof catches fire at night to Friday.
The rescue forces bring a chilled body out of the house.
Rescue forces found a chilled body in a three-family house at a fire in Helmbrecht.
Whether it is a resident is still unclear, as a police spokesman in Bayreuth said.
On late Thursday night it had burned on the ground floor of the house.
When the firemen arrived, the flames were already beating out of a window.
The forces went into the apartment and found the body in a room.
This and another room burned out completely.
The whole ground floor was damaged.
All other residents had not been home during the fire, the police spokesman continued.
The building is no longer viable for the moment.
The exact cause of the fire was not clear at first.
Germany's largest country church has launched an open sieve to recruit for the profession of the pastor.
Background is a possible parish deficiency: the Evangelical-Lutheran Landskirche Hannover expects that the number of its currently about 1,800 pastors will be halved in the current situation by 2030.
For young people of today the profession is very attractive and offer good prospects for the future, said Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in conversation with the Evangelical Press Service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the course of work and day.
With Burfien, the Landskirche has for the first time commissioned a pastor in a full place to enthusiasm young people for the theology study.
Currently, fewer young people decide to study theology after graduation.
Burfien leads this back to the process of desertification: "God's voice is quiet, the world is loud."
The profession is characterised by great freedom and diversity.
I am the master of my calendar and I can set my priorities where I am important.
Pastors could be very close to people as a soul carer.
They earned as much as teachers and could live well from it.
Certainly more will be paid in the free economy, but theologists would have a safe employer for this.
This is what young people meet today, who are not just about career, but about sinful work.
According to the Landskirche, which comprises three quarters of Lower Saxony, approximately 60 pastors are currently retiring per year.
At the same time, about 40 graduates of a theology study begin their Vikariat.
In thin peripheral areas such as the resin, the emsland or the Wendland it may be difficult to occupy places in the future.
Burfien wants to organize a study day for young people and also invite celebrities who have studied theology.
The theology study offers a wide range of training.
You can even become a federal president.
Land Rover Rally Series announced
In the interior you can find racing seats and six-point belts as well as a release premises.
The options range from reinforced brakes, a service package with support of Bowler-Works mechanics and logistical support to vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport, explains: "The Rally customers who come to Bowler have changed."
They are not all experienced racing drivers, but people who are looking for excitement and adventure as well as for an accessible way to world class events.
We are pleased to be able to open this path in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format creates new possibilities to experience the different Rally disciplines in the UK and abroad and prepare newcomers for the straits and the reality of Rally Raid.
We really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge car - this will be a entertaining championship.
In addition, the Defender Challenge has a training and test day in February as well as the option to participate in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Fire defense called to save a dog who sat 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rock spring in a stone break
Cockerspaniel-Hündin Ruby had escaped after a smaller traffic accident
Three days later she was discovered by a walker in the quarry in her miserable situation
Firefighters sailed off to rock wall and saved the dog from safe death
The fire department managed to secure a dog that was stuck on a 15 meter high front in a rock wall.
The nine months old Cockerspaniel-Hündin Ruby had escaped after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before she was saved from a quarry on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his friend Becky Hall, 20 of whom the dog belongs, came to the Steinbruch Flappit in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to receive Ruby again and to thank himself for the firemen of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately searched for their missing puppy and published help calls in social networks when she had escaped after the small traffic accident in the quarry.
Around 14: 15 on Wednesday, a walker who carried out his dog saw the stranded Ruby on the 15 meters high section in the quarry.
The Cleckheaton Fire Station's technical rescue team speeded up and sealed off to rescue Ruby's, which was then transported up in a dog box.
Andy Clayton, a technical rescue team specialist, said, "She was in a dangerous situation.
It was located in the middle of the rock wall - 15 meters from the top and the floor.
She didn't move muscle during her rescue - she was like froze.
But now she's fine.
She then ate some dog cakes.
That was a pretty unusual operation.
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible.
Peter Lau, a technical rescue team specialist, said, "Ruby had a huge happiness."
There was the possibility that she was very severely injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the veterinarian, but he found nothing but fatigue and dehydration.
Becky Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said, "watching rescue was scary."
I couldn't believe she was really up there.
It was wonderful to keep her back in the arms.
The veterinarian explained that if the fatigue had become too great and it had collapsed, it would probably have crashed.
The firemen have done great work.
It was really brave what they did.
We're just so grateful and each one of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson from Keighley added, "We were afraid she would fall, but she stayed upstairs."
The firemen were great.
I can't believe where she was.
Mick Jagger explained that he never hit Katy Perry when she was 18.
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week, the pop star said she was a background singer on the 2004 Jaggers song "Old Habits Die Hard."
Perry explained that she ate with the Altrocker tonight, and that "he turned on me when I was 18."
She added, "It's been a long time and he was very nice to me."
In a statement, a representative of Jaggers, 70, said on Thursday that he "categorically denied that he had ever made closer attempts at Katy Perry."
The representative added: "Maybe she confused him with someone else."
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest show at the Rolling Stones Tour this year.
Her new album "Prism" landed in place 1 this week.
George Kerevan: European deflection gives the Scottish choice
A new day, a new horror story about independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland is needed to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.
This provides the keyword for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a boundary secured by wire along the Hadrianswall.
In fact, the Strathclyde presentation highlighted the possible economic benefits that would bring more freedom of travel in the rest of Europe, but this - as expected - did not matter in the headlines.
Nor has anyone mentioned that the EU Member States often remedy their strict rules if it is more favourable to them.
Since Scotland is not currently part of the Schengen area, the continued non-respect for Brussels would only be a small confession in return for what you really want from the Scottish people.
So, actually, no story.
And one that has already come so in the years that it is already similar to a fossil: For the first time I heard the "independence means passport controls" duck at least 40 years ago.
An interesting point in repeating this ancient history is lost.
Why should an independent Scotland expect it to dance after the European pipe?
Why exchange the London yoke against Brussels, especially now?
These are the real European news: the great plan of European unification after the war has come to an end.
With the euro crisis, the project Europe has officially died.
All over the EU, parties are gaining ground that are hostile to the EU or want to overthrow the euro as a Community currency.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Party's alternative for Germany - founded only this year - was able to reach almost five million votes in the Bundestag election in September and thus effectively relocate the Free Democrats (equivalent to the British Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic resistance to the plan to create a federalist Europe.
However, the current economic crisis appears to be a turning point.
Because of the strict savings policy imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank in connection with the forced jacket in which the respective national economy is forced by holding the single currency, many people believe that the project Europe has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments causing excessive budgetary deficits - that was only the case in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has set its members at exchange rates which are advantageous for German exporters - and that is what German politicians would like to leave.
Without the possibility of devaluing the local currency, South Europe is recovered with a built-in productivity disadvantage towards Germany.
The only way is to reduce wages and public expenditure - encouraged by Berlin.
The current real and monetary problems are the subject of a deeper European problem of productivity.
As a result of the "green" energy directives prescribed by Brussels - a code for the subsidy of French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers - the European industry pays double for electricity compared to the United States and four times for gas.
This is a humiliating disadvantage, as we could already see in Grangemouth.
All world wage fixes do not protect the European petrochemical industry from being pushed into the corner by cheap American slip gas.
As a result, a revolt rises, especially in France, the first cheerleader of the EU.
After the war, the political elite of France saw the EU as a vehicle with which Germany could be held in chess and Paris at eye level with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway for political legitimacy and has pushed Europe on its own economic policy, which has to fight the affected French economy.
The result: Marine Le Pen's right-wing, EU-hostile Front National has just won a decisive re-election and hence referred the ruling socialists to place three.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the voters - a timely warning to the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a split in the right spectrum would automatically be beneficial to the left.
What does Le Pen do with its newly won popularity among the white French of the working class?
It wants to use the EU elections next year to embrace an anti-EU, anti-Community currency block in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties cut off well during these elections - and that is very possible - then for the first time such a block could dominate the European Parliament.
This is the point on which I want to go: in not too far from the future, the growing commitment to the EU and the single currency will come together for the abolition of the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will be more like the "Europe of the (sovereign) nations," which General de Gaulle favored.
Germany and some of its satellite economies may stick to the euro, but France and South Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect Britain to distance itself from this project in the hope of embellishing itself with the United States.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific region suggests that Britain will be alone in Atlantic rain.
Where's Scotland with all this?
We can decide to be a region of (in the final consequence) small-England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests - whatever it is to say to Berlin and Brussels where they can be.
I suspect that Scotland could go very well in a more relaxed European union, provided we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other similar countries is easier in a non-federated Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider maintaining Norway's economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is - noteworthy - the most successful political movement against savings policy in Europe and has won a spectacular majority in 2011 due to the rejection of the proposed (and carried out) reductions to be responsible for the Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory Lib Dem coalition.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to decide now for independence only to force a policy of savings from Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: Growing faster
AfroAmerican and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white companions, as investigations show.
Physical changes do not directly mean puberty yet
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that the epidemic obesity is a trigger of early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is less pronounced in boys
The former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in child health and family care.
Should a mother be concerned if her daughter grows at the age of seven or eight years of breasts and shampoons?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, the paediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and represented a new standard.
"I spend a lot of time calming parents - usually this is not a sign that the puberty is now coming quickly," said Kaplowitz.
Clear indications of development, such as growing breasts, shame and shoulder hair, as well as body smell, are shown in girls earlier.
However, there was only a slight shift in the age of the Menarche (occurrence of the first regular bleeding) in the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970.
"When the development of the breasts begins, it will take at least two to three years until the Menarche," said Kaplowitz, also author of the book "Early puberty in girls: The essential advisor to deal with this often occurring problem."
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty progresses.
It is controversial what is actually the beginning of puberty, but it is "early mature" if the breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth push before the age of eight.
In most cases the process slows or stagnates - something that a child doctor can closely monitor.
In the event of faster progress, tests may be indicated by an endo-chronologist to prevent serious problems such as tumours or cysts.
There are treatment methods for delaying early menstruation and defending another sequence: premature ageing of the bones, which can ultimately lead to growth inhibition and thus to small body growth in adults.
The recommendations for medication or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child, development speed, growth rate and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is reluctant in terms of medicine, but he admits: "The suppression of puberty can mitigate behavioural problems and the feelings of girls to be different from their age comrades."
The other big problem is understandable: parents simply don't want their very young daughters to have the period.
"They are concerned about the risk of pregnancy or how they handle the hygiene side," said Kaplowitz.
"It was a shock," remembered a woman whose daughter got her days with ten.
Even if there were first signs and we had talked about menstruation, it was not emotionally prepared.
She came scared and excited from school home because she was the first in her friend's circle.
There are many widely published theories about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other food, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media would be the cause.
Boys get into puberty like girls before.
Kaplowitz believes that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of obesity.
He supported the implementation of a study in 2001 on girls aged six to nine who create a connection between body fat and entry into puberty.
Other studies support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In this country, African American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white companions.
There are different explanations for this.
Global seems to be influenced by an early puberty of all kinds, from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another puzzle: Although boys grow the face and shame hair earlier, the trend towards a complete former puberty is not as pronounced as with girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference underlined the complexity of the issue.
The appearance of acne and shamhair is even common in babies and infants.
"We need to be careful as we identify the real beginning of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a paediatric endocrine at Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to be advised by their pediatrician how to talk to their child.
"This may mean you have to have a conversation earlier than expected," riet Kaplowitz.
If you stay calm, the child usually reacts well.
Girls who flourish early need the insurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it occurs earlier than thought.
Jumbo manufacturers argue in view of large orders about seat width
Between leading aircraft manufacturers there has been a dispute about the width of seats in the tourist class on long-distance flights, which indicates the tone for a bitter impact on the Dubai Airshow this month.
The dispute concerns the seating width offered by passengers on long flights in the tourist class - not always those most committed to airlines, but this designated space is the key to the efficiency assertions for the latest aircraft of Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus called for an industry standard this week, which requires a seat width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in the tourist class, but the American Archrivale Boeing says that airlines should decide that.
The dispute comes at a time when aircraft builders compete to sell even larger versions of their two-engine long-distance fliers and expect record orders at the event from 17 to 21 November.
How the rear part of the plane is designed - especially if there are rows of nine or ten seats - is crucial for the stated economic results that the new mini-jumbo design is intended to deliver.
Boeing claims that his modernised "777X" box 406 people at seats in the tourist class, which are more than 17 inches wide and thus allow ten per row.
Airbus explains the competing version of the A350 carrier 350 people in 18 inches wide seats in the tourist class, with nine per row.
Aircraft giants often distribute lifting on technical details through advertising in the specialist press.
Airbus now calls on the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X with over 100 orders is expected to make the race, directly to the public.
Recently, the company presented an ad that could be the beginning of a new display war and showed a picture of the donors in which three people are cheered together in a restaurant, and the title: "Would you accept that?"
"Boeing proposes long-distance flights in seats that are closer than regional turbo pros," says Airbus sales manager John Leahy.
In view of changing nutritional habits, people are getting thicker, but aircraft seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 defined the modern long-distance journey, and the end of the century, the weight of the male average American between 40 and 49 years has increased by ten percent, according to the data of the US Ministry of Health.
According to American health statistics, the male average figure in the 21st century is 100.8 cm.
Airbus says that his rival is holding a seating concept from the 1950s when the average body size of the newly baptized "jet set" was narrower.
According to Airbus, investigations have been carried out that showed that an additional duty (2.54 cm) per seat increases the quality of sleep by 53 percent.
Boeing disputes the numbers of Airbus to the seats and says it is not in the discretion of manufacturers to decide how airlines make the balance between flight tariffs and facilities.
The company also explains that according to investigations the experience in the plane depends on more than the seat width.
"It really goes on to give airlines flexibility so they can do what they think they need to do to be successful," explains the aeroplane expert Kent Craver von Boeing.
They don't want us to dictate them what makes them profitable.
You know their business better than anyone else.
Passengers are talking about more elbow freedom, but manufacturers are becoming increasingly a subject that can affect sales.
A race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least 700 billion US dollars at list prices in the coming decades is behind the discussion, which could have a lasting impact on the US or Europe's export balance.
As Reuters reported for the first time in July, the seat layout is the driving force behind the struggle for the new Jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest two-engine long-distance designs than the market leader in this segment, the 365-sitting Boeing 77-300ER.
The statements of Boeings on the results depend partly on the comparison of the 777X with its ten seats per series with the original design of nine seats in the 777.
The increased unit costs are still lower than those currently used with ten seats per series.
"Boeing therefore squeezes more seats in his plane to make it more competitive to our products," says Kevin Keniston, Head of Passenger Comfort at the European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts, full cabins with ten seats per series at existing 777s indicated that many passengers chose the closer arrangement, which could be associated with cheaper flight tariffs.
"Eighteen inches of seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is: from an economic point of view the Airbus offer is controlled from the threat by the 777," says Mary Kirby, expert for cabin equipment, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats but a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
The world-traveling jet sellers even carry bandwidth to measure the facility in competition.
Even if they praise the comfort, all manufacturers also offer jets with high-density design for cheap airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with ten-seated rows, but has not sold yet, according to its own statement.
Until recently, Airbus has emphasized the importance of more adaptability of the cabins and offered broad seats on the corridors for some jets.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jet experts say that the reputation of a new industry standard is likely to be lost, but could be distracted from the wave of 777X sales.
New anti-nicotine vaccine could make the garuit for the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could destroy the fun of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for life.
Before testing humans, further tests are needed, which may take a few years, but Professor Ronald Crystal from Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the first results were good.
"We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can once help millions of smokers who have tried to stop trying all the methods available on the market, but had to experience that their nicotine search is stronger than these approaches," Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains an harmless virus that has been modified in such a way that it contains genetic information for the production of nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then produce a constant stream of antibodies.
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, which means that a smoker does not experience nicotine high.
In experiments vaccinated mice administered by nicotine maintained their normal activity level.
Mouse without vaccination, on the other hand, would have taken a "time off," the researchers explained a sign that the nicotine had reached her brain.
The experiments are described in the Science Translational Medicine Fachblatt.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The vaccines had to be given so often that they were expensive and unpractical to maintain the antibody level.
However, the costs of the new vaccine are likely to be significantly lower, because it transforms liver cells into antibodies.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine could be given to people if he was sure to give children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, thus preventing nicotine addiction.
But more likely is that smokers would use it to stop.
"They know that when they start smoking again, because of the nicotine vaccine, they no longer feel pleasant, and that helps them to lay down the habit," he explains.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but at the same time warned that further research was necessary.
Tripodi contends to have been influenced by Obeid
To the former Minister of the New South Wales Labour Party Joe Tripodi, an investigation is initiated by the state corruption supervisor.
The former NSW Minister disputes that the Maritime Paying Regulations have changed at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden holdings in three land in the state-controlled country.
On Friday, the Independent Commission against Corruption (ICAC Independent Commission against Corruption) extended its investigations on whether Obeid has influenced various state ministers to extend lease contracts at the Circular Quay, where the Obeids operate two restaurants and a café without a call for tender after their expiry in August 2005.
Now, because of the accusation, Tripodi knew about Obeid's hidden interest in the land, after Tripodi's former Deputy Chief of Staff, Lynne Ashpole, said so on Thursday.
In years of talks that started in 2005, the government had pushed for public tenders for the lease contracts.
The owners were opposed and wanted longer maturities.
In 2009, the lease contracts for the companies at the Circular Quay, which deposited the Obeids 2.5 million dollars annually, were renewed without a public tender.
Tripodi, who was port minister from February 2006 to November 2009, had originally voted for public tenders.
However, he refused to make the changes at the request of Obeid, which, as Tripodi confirmed, had pushed for a reorganisation of government custody regulations.
One of the ICAC's telephone records showed talks from August and September 2007 between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had been transferred to the port ministry after having worked under Obeid in the Fisheries Authority.
"Was the topic discussed in these phone calls the development of commercial parting arrangements?" asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony WHeily Tripodi.
"No," said Tripodi.
I can't remember what was discussed, but it definitely wasn't.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli fighters attack target in Syria, so official sources
Israeli hunting planes had attacked a target in the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday night, confirmed a leading government co-worker against Fox News.
The official did not explain what the objective was, but said it was at least one.
According to Associated Press, the target was Russian SA-125 missiles.
At least twice this year Israel has already carried out air beats on missile deliveries in Syria.
Foreign workers with 457 visas could be subjected to "authenticity test"
The government is considering an "authenticity test" for foreign workers with 457 visa in the context of extended measures.
If the test is introduced, it would be used above a criterion to prevent the 457 from being used to occupy unqualified jobs or as a back door for the entry of family and friends to Australia.
Today, a government discussion proposal was published after the former members of the Labor Party, Maxine McKew, had condemned the government's comments on foreign workers because they could be perceived by the neighbours of Australia as insults.
"Loudstrong declarations like, foreigners are supposed to stand behind" and, Australians first recruit "is a very unpleasant fall in times when trade unions demanded a protected labour market," she said to the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that white workers should be protected - and if some people in the region humiliate an echo of this historical artifact, that would not surprise me.
The discussion proposal encompasses twelve measures, which were once referred to by former Minister for Immigration, Chris Bowen.
Minister for Immigration, Brendan O'Connor, who was visiting talks yesterday on human trafficking in Sri Lanka, has implemented five of the recommended amendments and the others are still being considered.
If the "authenticity criterion 'is adopted, a person applying for a visa may be verified to verify whether" the application is real in cases where the applicant is related to the holder or a relevant person of the supporting undertaking or is personally connected'.
Companies could also be obliged to account for the number of 457 visa holders, after in the past, companies who wanted to support only a small number of workers have finally hired hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old sri-lancan asylum probably died of a heart attack after he arrived this week with a refugee boat on the Christmas Island.
The wounded nine-year-old son of the man who had come to Australia with him has been supervised by an adult cousin who was also on the boat since his father died on Wednesday.
Australian authorities brought the man to the Christmas Island Hospital where he died.
A study was announced by the British Government to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
In the work of HS2 Ltd, it is proposed to establish high-speed connections between Scotland and the north of England from the start of phase 1 in 2026.
Minister for Transport Baroness Kramer said the project "will bring Britain closer together."
The Scottish Minister for Transport, Keith Brown, said he was very pleased to work with the British Government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail connection between London and the West Midlands.
After completion of phase 2 there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government corrected the estimated cost of building the high-speed road between London and Northern England from GBP 32.7 billion to GBP 42.6 billion.
The British Government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has instructed HS2 Ltd to search for further routes and travel time improvements for North England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of a travel time of at last three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said, "Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network that brings Britain and its cities closer together."
We move forward with HS2 because it brings enormous benefits.
Without it we are facing a capacity crisis in our railway network.
But it is also about the connection between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which is improved thanks to HS2.
Scottish State Secretary Alistair Carmichael commented: "Today's announcement is a good news for Scotland."
On behalf of the Scottish government, Keith Brown Carmichael called on to "understand" the Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Brown said: "The high-speed rail connection has the potential of enormous economic benefits for Scotland, but at the same time also provides the economic power of Scotland an argument for fast rail connections throughout the UK."
That is why we are pleased to work as partners of the British Government and to examine the options for a high-speed rail line in Scotland, which creates benefits for everyone and complements the link between Glasgow and Edinburgh which the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to examining the investigation report with the British Ministers next year and deciding jointly on the next steps.
Rules on electronic equipment in aircraft remain in force provisionally in Australia
Australian air passengers must continue to switch off tablets and smartphones when starting and landing, despite efforts in the US to loosen the rules for such devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows US airlines to change their requirements so that passengers on their devices can read, watch or play e-books during critical flight phases, provided they are in the "flight mode."
During most of the flight passengers are already allowed to do this, but many people find it annoying that they should not read their e-books when starting and landing.
However, Australian companies observe the decision to implement which US airlines are required to do lots of work but do not follow any immediate plans to amend their rules.
The CASA also stated that the announcement would be examined, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic equipment in critical flight phases in Australia still apply.
"The CASA currently has no specific rules on the use of electronic equipment on the aircraft," has been declined.
The subject is subject to provisions which require airlines to maintain safety at any time and passengers to follow the safety instructions given by cabin personnel.
Virgin has already held talks with the CASA about an extension of its Wi-Fi entertainment system on flights and explained that you are open to change, but these should be initiated by the legislator.
"We would welcome a review of CASA's authorisation of electronic devices, because we are convinced that this would improve customer experience after we now offer (wireless entertainment) during the flight," said a spokesman.
Qantas stated that you will remain with the current rules until further notice.
"Our current directives provide that electronic devices should not be used when starting and landing, and we do not currently have plans to change this," the company explained.
The FAA rules apply to US airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations that passengers can benefit from and will certainly look at the FAA decision as well as the reasons behind it.
The decision has different effects in US companies depending on the age of the fleet.
They must demonstrate that their aeroplanes can tolerate radio disturbances by mobile devices and change manuals, training materials, hand baggage programs and customer training.
"After a airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet, it allows passengers to use portable, lighter electronic devices such as tablets, e-book reading devices and smartphones at all levels," FAA announced.
In rare cases in bad sight, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off the equipment during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier devices be placed safely under the seat or in the compartments over the seats when starting and landing.
In front of the Revierderby against Shelke, fellow-ripe BVB trailers with light rockets had provided ugly scenes in the Veltins arena.
Borussia Dortmund then announced hard consequences.
Before the Friday game of the Bundesliga against the VfB Stuttgart, the Ultras responded with a silence - first.
It was an unusual, almost splendid acoustics that offered the viewer up to the beginning of the Bundesligaspiel between the German Vice-Master Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart in the signal Iduna Park.
Hearing were mostly the guest fans with their songs.
The South tribe, on the other hand, where the faithfullest of the faithful - and loudest - BVB fans stand, first presented themselves exceptionally quiet: no songs, no battlecalls.
The podium of Capo, which otherwise coordinates the joint ignition, remained unoccupied.
And at the front of the tribe, a large flag with the label "Stadium Ban."
Only when Torhüter Roman Weidenfeller, as always, became the first BVB player, burned up short-term jewelry.
When his crew colleagues followed, there were loud singing and weeping shells - but not everywhere.
There was nothing in the central blocks 12 and 13 of the South Tribüne.
Also that stadium spokesman Norbert Dickel once again listed the positive experiences of the last days - Derbyvictory, victory over Arsenal, contract extension of coach Jürgen Klopp - did not provide for celebration laune.
Only five minutes before the Anpfiff the Capo clomm his podest - and until then, with hands, tangible tension escaped in a loud scream when the thick as usual the mood questioned on the ranks in the stadium.
As always, the South tribune was on the line - and finally, here was the lowest place in the stadium again as used to be.
And at the latest when with Anpfiff from the South tribe the loud call "Derbywinner stands up," was again everything as always.
The silence before was probably a response to the events of the past days.
Immediately before Revierderby at FC Schalke 04, some of BVB-Anhängers had fired lightning missiles into the audience ranks and on the square - and hit almost Torhüter Roman Weidenfeller.
The game was popped late because of the chaotic scenes.
BVB-Boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had then received the tops of the Dortmunder Ultras in his office - and one believes Watzke's words, this was a rather uncomfortable appointment for the fans.
"There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra movement," announced the BVB boss on Thursday night at a podium discussion in Frankfurt.
As an immediate measure, Watzke forbidden Ultras a choreography for the home game against the VfB Stuttgart.
"I've forbidden that," he explained.
We cannot give up the zero tolerance policy on pyrotechnics.
In addition, the ultra has been shown various ways of punishing - until Tuesday they now have time to choose one.
Otherwise, Watzke said, the BVB will lay down a penalty by the end of next week.
"This is going to be insecticizing," insured Watzke.

Pfandhuizen boom in Singapore as the crisis has arrived in the middle layer
Janani Amirthalinga exchanged a golden bracelet, a ring and a pair of earrings at the Bendemeer shopping centre in Singapore to pay the school fees for their daughters.
"My husband and I just bought a house, there's all my money in it," says Amirthalinga.
Although she earns 3,000 Singapore dollars every month (about 1,730 euros) as an administrative co-worker and her husband also works, the monthly family income is not sufficient, she explains.
In fact, demand in parts of Southeast Asia - where the debt of households is increasing - is so large that ValueMax, where she has made her exchange, became the third Pfandhaus listed on the singapurical stock exchange this week.
The commitment to jewelry is not only a quick way to get money - 1,300 Singapore dollars in the case of Janani Amirthalinga - but also almost as favourable as an unsecured bank loan.
Typically, Pfandhäuser in Singapore demand an effective annual interest rate of 17 percent, which is just about above the 15.4 percent required by the United Overseas Bank, a local creditor with a branch in the same shopping centre.
However, Pfandhäuser offers the advantage that there is no need to check the credit dignity or income evidence here, and therefore loans are possible faster than banks.
For this reason, millions of people in the region are turning to Pfandhuizen after families feel the pressure from rising cost of living as well as increasing household and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans due to a loose financial policy in the developed economies, families with lower and medium income are looking for penthouses to compensate for the difference in the boiling economy.
This week, the Rating Agency Standard & Poor's growing budget debt, mainly through rising mortgages, was a risk factor for the credibility of Asian banks.
Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have, according to the Agency, the highest budgetary debt in Asia relative to gross domestic product.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80 per cent of GDP, a 60 per cent increase still in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high consumer debt in Thailand, which has barely come out of a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed a continuing weakness in exports and a decline in consumer demand.
"In the end, this means that in view of rising costs, people in the middle to lower segment (the income scale) will try to complement their income wherever possible," says Song Seng Wun, economics at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historical ceilings in gold prices over the last two years have strengthened the trend of committing personal objects, as people are using the opportunity to turn the jewelry of the family into cash.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the wrapped goods are gold in the 200 pound houses of the city state.
People say, "The gold price looks good, let's get Grandmother's gold chain and get it back next month."
The largest Thai Pfandhaus operator, EasyMoney, has experienced a 20% increase in customer growth in its branches in recent months.
The growth in the Pfandgeschäft is so strong that ValueMax, the operator of the Bendemeer branch and 15 others in Singapore, wants to expand not only to the neighbouring Malaysia - where the company operates four houses - but also outside Asia, so Yeah Lee Ching, Managing Director of ValueMax.
The company finances this with 60 percent of the $66 million that it took this week with the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some borrowers were set in the cross-fire because of high interest rates, Yeah explains that Pfandhäuser not only paid more favourable interest than other borrowers, but also did not directly increase the debt.
"Customers insult objects they already possess, and the liquid personal value does not increase the budgetary debt," she explains.
The mortgage business is increasingly accepted as short-term, secured financing in society.
Nor are all people who use mortgages in financial difficulties.
Rich people from Singapore also come to ValueMax's branches to commit gold bars and Rolex watches, for which they receive up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Customers come to us from every social shift.
"These include prosperous people borrowing something for a business or investment in the short term, or small companies that have to bridge bottlenecks in the cash flow," says Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
NSA sucks data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help
The Secret Service Enthüller Edward Snowden has a fundamental interest in helping Germany to clarify the increasingly burdensome NSA spa affair.
After presenting the Green Bundestag secretary Hans-Christian Ströbele, his surprising meeting with Snowden in Russia was about the conditions under which the ex-secretary would testify to a German prosecutor or to an investigation committee.
Snowden had referred to his complicated legal situation, Ströbele said to the ARD magazine "Panorama."
Save package over 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanic Health
The Australian government insists on the tough conditions linked to the rescue package of over 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanic health care to ensure that the government of the state cannot waste the money.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take "immediate measures" to avoid a crisis caused by an ageing population of the island state, a higher proportion of chronic diseases and system limitations.
The financing for a period of four years was decided after government consultations with the independent Tasmanic Member Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has scratched an emergency rescue package that, in our opinion, addresses the unique challenges facing the state," Plibersek said today.
The $325 million package includes $31 million emergency aid for electoral services.
Further 2600 operations, including orthopaedic interventions and treatments for grey star, are intended to eliminate residues.
In addition, there is money for daily clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better post-stationary care, specialist training, mental health services and the introduction of a system for the electronic recording of health data in local hospitals.
"These investments are in line with the ideas of the clinic employees that I am concerned about saying that they are the best way to improve the Tasmanic health system," said Tanya Plibersek.
The Minister insisted on a strict reporting and accountability of the Tasmanic government.
The state must maintain the current level of funding to obtain money from the Commonwealth and report monthly on where the additional funds were spent.
A tripartite Commission will be set up to ensure that the state provides health services as efficiently and efficiently as possible.
As Wilkie said today, the 325 million dollars would only be of little use if "they were not accompanied by real reforms that bring the public Tasmanic health system to a more sustainable course."
Nevertheless, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, which he first expressed to the Prime Minister in early May.
"I am confident that federal aid will make a major contribution to removing the state's public health system from the caring list," said Wilkie.
According to the government of the Federal State, these electoral services will largely compete with the recent cuts.
But the Healthpolitical speaker of the opposition at federal level, Peter Dutton, believes that today's announcement is just a "patch solution."
"We are in today's situation because the laboratory government has withdrawn $430 million from the health system," he said to ABC TV.
It can't be that a government is ripping almost half a billion dollars out of the system and putting 300 million Commonwealth into it and then pretending to be good news.
Dutton asked Plibersek to guarantee that not one dollar of the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux 'adaptation of the novel by Denis Diderot convinces with extraordinary production equipment and contemporary details, however, is also more difficult cost than necessary.
The act in France of the 1760s tells the striking story of Suzanne, a young noble who is sent from her family to the monastery.
When rebellious, she is confronted with the extreme cruelty of an extremely sadistic superior and becomes the object of erotic fascination of another.
The film never slides away in blisternity or sensation lust - and there is his problem.
The solemn seriousness with which the film is told also makes it a torment for the audience.
Syria has destroyed its ability to manufacture chemical weapons, such as a monitoring group
Syria destroyed important facilities for the production of chemical weapons and gauge gas ammunition, explained the global monitoring group for chemical weapons on Thursday, while there were serious collapses in the north of the country near one of the sites where suspected toxic substances are stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the start of the Civil War three years ago.
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came one day before the date
1 November the organisation established in The Hague in Damascus to destroy or "inoperable" all facilities for the manufacture of chemical weapons, including all machines for mixing chemicals to toxic gas and filling ammunition.
The completion of this process, which is basically the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone of an ambitious timetable aimed at the destruction of all Syria's chemical weapons by mid-2014.
Destroying the facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus still needs to begin to destroy existing weapons and supplies.
According to the assumption that there are about 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons in the country, including mustard and nerve gas Sarin.
The announcement came at a time when fights took place on Thursday in the city of Safira, from experts saying that there is a production facility for chemical weapons and storage sites here, as the Syrian Human Rights Observatory, based in the United Kingdom, announced.
The group of activists pursuing the number of dead in Syria through a network of activists said on Thursday that 120.296 people had died.
Of these are 61.067 civilians, including 6.365 children.
On the side of the government, 29.954 of them belonged to the army of President Bashar Assad, 18,678 were government-friendly fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militia.
2.202 deserted army soldiers and 5.375 opposition fighters were also among the dead, many of them foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated the number of dead in this conflict at 100,000 since March 2011.
This number has not been updated so far.
The conflict has forced about two million people to escape from the country.
Assad's troops have been fighting the rebels in Safira for weeks, many of which have links to al-Qaida groups.
The Observatory said that there were losses on both sides on Thursday, but did not mention details.
The struggles underline the danger posed by the chemical weapons inspectors, because their mission to free Syria from its toxic weapons arsenal is a race against the time in the midst of a devastating civil war.
According to the OPCW, which cooperates closely with the United Nations, the team is "convinced that it has seen all the important production and mixing / filling facilities mentioned by Syria and experienced their destruction."
Therefore, "no further inspection activities are currently planned."
At the beginning of the week, the inspectors had declared that they had completed the first round of inspections and visited 21 out of 23 of the sites indicated by Damascus.
In view of safety concerns, the inspectors said that the visit to two institutions had not been possible.
On Thursday the OPWC stated that the two sites had been "abandoned" according to Syrian statement and the objects of the chemical weapons programme there had been transferred to other mentioned facilities that were inspected. "
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two facilities that the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved next month by the OPWC Executive Committee.
"I draw the hat in front of the bravery and courage that you have all shown in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever carried out by this organization," said Ahmed Uzumcu, Director General of the Monitoring Organisation in a comment published by OPCW.
For three years now, the mainly Sunni Muslim rebels in this civil war have fought against Assad's government and its security forces, which are members of the Alawites, a division of the Shiite Islam.
With regard to further developments, the Head of the Observatory, Rami Abdurrahman, said that on Wednesday there was a strong explosion in an air defence facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion was not known, he explained.
Anger on judgment for bombers of Bali
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who had died in 2002 in the Bali bomb attack reacted upset about the judgment for the last of the founders who were put to trial, as Umar Patek was supposed to be shot by state law.
Patek, who was on the run for almost ten years as one of the most sought-after people in South East Asia, was sentenced to 20 years in prison yesterday for his role in the construction of explosives for the bombing.
He could be dismissed after 15 years.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of the mass murder because of the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, where 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and many more were injured.
A plea of guilt also took place at a number of terrorist accusations, including a wave of explosive attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The Public Prosecutor had called for a lifetime sentence, even if it could have applied for the death penalty for the man who was called "Demolition Man" because of his reputation as a master bomber.
The decision has raised painful memories at June Corteen, a Perth mother who lost her 39-year-old twin founders Jane and Jenny in the devastation made by Patek and his conspiracy almost ten years ago.
With tears fighting she said that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really mean, he should follow the other guys' footsteps.
"He should be put before a shooting command," said Corteen to AAP.
I have to live with every day that I will not have any more grandchildren and I will never see my daughters again.
The Sari Club was homemade to the ground when on October 12, 2002 a huge bomb exploded in a small truck that was parked in front of the night club.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's bar, where only 20 seconds earlier a suicide assassin had a backpack filled with explosives exploded.
After the attack, he fell into a coma for a month and "died" three times while hanging on a life maintenance system.
Hughes said Patek deserved the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cell Jemaah Islamiah - Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra - who were responsible for the bloodbath and executed four years ago.
Really, this guy was supposed to get the death penalty before anyone else.
To leave him alive - no, there is no reason to leave him alive.
20 years after he killed 202 people and injured many hundreds is not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers in court.
In January 2011, he was arrested in Abbottabad, Pakistan, where U.S. forces killed the former Al-Qaida chief of Osama bin Laden.
During the trial, an FBI agent stated that intelligence reports had provided the indication that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of rebuilding the link between South-East Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaida.
"He didn't stand up," said Corteen.
Until recently, he has shown no repentance for how much suffering he has caused to other people.
The judgment was given before the ten-year anniversary of the attack this year, which is commemorated in Bali and Australia.
"There will be many tears this year," said Corteen.
Patek can still appeal against his judgment.
FAA: Passengers can now use electronic devices in aircraft (but do not run phone calls)
Flight travelers can now hear their electronic devices from departure to landing for reading, working, playing, music and using the image of movies, but not by phone, according to the new guidelines issued on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the USA.
However, passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
As soon as they were implemented, departing from the respective airline, FAA staff Michael Huerta explained at a press conference.
Air carriers must demonstrate to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new directives and that they have updated the flight crew training manuals as well as the rules for the installation of equipment in accordance with the new rules.
The FAA stated that it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic equipment in aircraft.
Among these airlines were also Delta and JetBlue.
"Depending on the state of the plan, we could approve the extended use of electronic devices very soon," the FAA announced in a pronouncement.
At present, passengers need to switch off smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed.
They may not restart them until the plane has reached a height of three kilometres and the captain gives green light.
When entering the landing flight, passengers must turn them off again and must not restart them until the plane has landed.
According to the new Directives, airlines whose aeroplanes are protected against electronic disturbances could allow their passengers to use the equipment also when starting, landing and on the rolling field, the FAA explained.
Most new aeroplanes and other aeroplanes that have been refurbished for use of Wi-Fi to larger heights should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, President of the Professional Air Traffic Association, welcomed the changes.
"If the new regulation is implemented safely - and we work closely with the airline in this respect - both sides will benefit from it," said Glading.
We are honestly sorry to have to feel like guards on this issue.
However, Internet connections to surfing, exchanging e-mails, text messages or downloading data below three kilometres remained prohibited, the Authority explained.
Passengers are invited to move smartphones, tablets and other devices into flight mode.
So still no "Words With Friends," the Scrabble similar online game played by actor Alec Baldwin in 2011 on his smartphone when he had to publicly leave a jet from American Airlines because he refused to turn off the device while the plane was parked on the flight ladder.
And heavier devices such as laptops must continue to be stabbed, as there is a risk of injury here if they fly through the cabin.
Mobile calls during the flight continue to be forbidden.
The regulatory competence for telephone calls lies with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not with the FAA.
FAA may revoke the ban on certain electronic devices at start and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker from the National Transportation Safety Board, safety experts for national transport issues on CBS News said phones would still be considered a risk.
"Handy is really a problem, not only because they could cause potential disturbances in navigation devices, but because we know from the FCC that the transmission from the air can also disturb broadcast masts," says Rosenker.
A consultative committee of the industry, set up by the FAA to investigate this issue, recommended last month that the government allow a broader use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, the pressure on the FAA has increased to loosen restrictions for use.
Critics like the democratic senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri believe that there are no valid security reasons for the prohibition.
Restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of the equipment has become present.
In some studies it is mentioned that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore the switching off of the device.
The FAA began in 1966 to restrict the use of electronic equipment by air travellers after reports of disturbances of navigation and communication equipment by passenger-led UKW radios, which at that time represented the latest technological trend.
New aircraft are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also so designed and approved by the FAA that they do not care about electronic interference.
Air carriers have been offering Wi-Fi for several years when the flight height is reached.
The airplanes adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also more insensitive to interference.
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for the greater use of electronic devices according to the new directives, said Huerta.
Today's electronic devices generally yield significantly less radio radiation than previous generations.
E-readers, for example, only give up minimal radiation when you re-browse.
However, when downloading or sending data, the transmission values are stronger.
Amazon.com. is one of the defendants of a relaxation of the restrictions on passenger equipment use.
In 2011, the company co-workers invited a passenger aircraft full of Kindle E-Reader and made a test flight to identify problems but could not detect any.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using equipment.
Douglas Kidd of the Passenger Association National Association of Airline Passengers said that he considered the disturbance of the equipment to be real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other committee members said that there were only isolated reports from pilots who spoke for a disturbance of aircraft systems through the equipment, and most of them were very old.
However, the Committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to order the switching off of the equipment by passengers in the event of instrumental landing under poor conditions.
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and called them a reasonable adaptation for travellers who would be equipped with technology today.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognises that a pleasant passenger experience is not contrary to safety," said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
By air control service of North Sea Drill Island saved bird released again
A bird flown by air to the coast, which had been found exhausted on a North Sea drilling island, was released into nature again.
The water rod was flown to Aberdeen last month with a helicopter, where it was popped by the Scottish animal welfare organisation SPCA at their rescue centre in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, head of the centre, said: "This water rhyme was probably a winter tractor from northern Europe, which was stopped by the strong wind over the North Sea."
Apparently the exhausted bird sought refuge on the drilling island.
He added: "He could no longer fly, so we were contacted with the request for help."
During their release, the water wheel was fit and healthy again.
Is Europe's elite ready to do business with Britain?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy to a table and defining what those who provide wealth and work in the UK want to change to our relations with the EU.
To this end, we have commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey among British economic leaders and asked them what they think about Britain, the economy and the EU.
YouGov questioned more than 1,000 executives from the economy, representing some of the UK's business sizes, sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will surprise many people.
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now exporting outside Europe and focusing on countries that are modernising and growing while the countries are stagnating in the EU.
They wish that new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil should be preferred from the government side, rather than stopping with the long and exhausting process of reforming the obscure EU institutions.
In its view, the majority of economic leaders believe that control over these key competences should be retrieved to Westminster, from cartel law to product legislation.
There was general dissatisfaction about the internal market, because, according to the companies, the cost of Brussels regulations would now outweigh the advantages of being part of the European trade area - even 40% of the large companies agreed to the most traditional European-friendly ones.
Finally, and most likely most, our hearing of economic leaders showed that a clear majority of Britain wants a course towards change of the agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade, not politics.
This insight, which is found in companies of all sizes and leading groups, shows that the economy is pressing for a "meaningful change," which brings the handbook of action back to Britain.
This is a lot - an amendment to the agreement and better conditions for Britain would result in a 16% change of opinion in favour of staying in the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this survey shows that the British economy is behind its plan for renegotiations of the British conditions for EU membership.
It also shows that companies are expecting a significant shift in power relations back to Britain from a new negotiation.
A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary since the euro area is now moving towards a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the United Kingdom, as the result of our survey shows, which for businesses means increasing attention to trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to regulations.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom calls pipeline in Bulgaria the beginning of a new gas era
The start of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria represents the launch of one of the largest European energy projects, explained the Gazprom Board.
"Today's event is a milestone: The construction work on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun," said Gazprom's Chairman, Alexei Miller, on Thursday in a statement.
The project is a key element in energy security throughout the European continent.
South Stream aims to increase the diversity of Russia's exports through Europe.
A contractual dispute between Gazprom and his pendants in Ukraine, in which most of the Russian gas is stored for Europe, ensures an increased risk in conventional routes, as can be heard from official side.
Miller said that the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries were "permanently" eliminated.
Bulgarian consumers receive gas from South Stream at cheaper rates when the entire project goes into operation in 2015.
According to Gazprom, construction works in other subordinated countries are to begin on the planned route at the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic meters of natural gas.

Hearing before the Royal Commission: Two YMCA employees charged with accusations against Jonathan Lord for sexual offences
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales (NSW) had been accused of sexual offences related to children before the 2011 accusation of child care Jonathan Lord from Caringbah, as the Royal Commission for the sexual abuse of children learned.
However, in the opening statement before the Commission, the YMCA had stated that "in the organisation it had never had to do with an incident of sexual child abuse."
Managing director Phillip Hare was questioned about a case where a YMCA employee had been accused of crimes against child pornography, and another one where a sports teacher of the YMCA Caringbah Hall in 1991 had been convicted of the abuse of the child he was entrusted with.
Hare said Gail Furness, a lawyer assisting the Commission, that he knew about the first case but did not know the second one.
He acknowledged that the opening statement of the YMCA to the Commission had also been inaccurate in the claim that "there had been external audits of the YMCA in which the YMCA was recognised as at the forefront of child safety."
In fact, evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA was informed that it received the second lowest evaluation of four possible in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities (Ministry of Education) in August of the year.
Hare, who started with 21 at YMCA, admitted that the management failed "from me downwards" in the recruitment of Lord and did not ensure that employees had been aware of their obligations to report infringements of the child safety directives.
Lord had been sentenced to YMCA at the beginning of the year for sexual crimes against twelve boys during his two-year activity.
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.
Hare argued, however, that the YMCA had a cultural problem that prevented employees from reporting Lords' breaches of child safety.
The employees said that they had observed infringements, including that Lord was alone with children, cared for her as a babysitter, left her sitting on his lap, said to one that he loved it, and let children play with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose ruler was Lord and who had asked for a child protection training because she was concerned about his behavior, said that the child service manager Jacqui Barnat, who was the ruler in YMCA Caringbah, was "very intimidating and most of the time was very unacceptable."
The managing director stated that he would not accept employees' statements that they would not have trusted to return their superior notification.
Instead, he said, rather, had affected their friendship with the Lord their judgment, so they had not notified him.
Hare explained that he informed the board of the YMCA NSW that the lesson that the organization had to draw from the "Jonathan Lord incident" concerned "not reporting" by employees, and the board had agreed to it.
Hare said that the decision to urge staff to sign confidentiality obligations shortly after the accusations occurred had been taken by the Managing Director of the Children's Services of YMCA, Liam Whitley.
He said that this should prevent contamination of the evidence, but which had been "exaggerated" and badly implemented.
The YMCA NSW had not been a child-safe organisation in the period when Jonathan Lord was employed there between 2009 and 2011, said Professor Stephen Smallbone from Griffith University, expert on sexual child abuse, to the Commission.
He explained that there had been "serious problems" in recruitment, verification, preparation, training and supervision of employees.
The hearing was postponed until 20 December.
Tony Blair explained that he would use the opportunity to return as British Prime Minister, but admits that a comeback is unlikely.
In an interview tonight on the fifth anniversary of his departure from the office, the 59-year-old announced his views on various domestic policy issues.
Since his resignation in June 2007, after a decade as head of state, Blair has largely avoided speaking about British politics, and his comments are mostly limited to foreign policy and its role as a messenger of the Quartet of Peacekepers in the Middle East.
On the question of whether he would like to return to the Prime Minister's office, Blair was quoted by the Evening Standard from London with the words: "Yes, sure, but it's unlikely that this will happen, so..."
When the horseback audience experts found themselves in Shares in Cardiff to cure the horse of the year, they were aware that a tough competition was going on.
But no one was prepared for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
The Knirps, which is not even in the kindergarten and has only taken his first steps a few months ago, and his Shetland-Pony Toffee trapped loosely through the three rounds and picked up the first prize - leaving 30 grown opponents behind.
The inseparable couple, both equally large, were praised for their appearance, behavior and style at annual competition organised by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
At his appearance in competition with men and women with elegant melons he had set up his plate cap in a freaky angle and led the two-year-old Toffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the jury for his natural skills in dealing with the pony that was far above his age.
And Toffee received best notes for his appearance and his personality.
Fenton had received Toffee as a present last March for his third birthday and since then practiced with the Shetland pony every day.
His mother, Donna, 30, said, "Fenton and Toffee are a great ghost."
They had to go against the entire field of participants and went off the square with gold pokal and Rosette.
It was only the second time he participated in a competition with Toffee, and we were all excited when he won.
Completely strangers in the arena thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been performing horses for over ten years.
Howells said, "The whole audience was as electrified and everyone fired it and clapped it."
He ran on sand the entire length of the arena and although he looked so tiny, he did fantastic work.
Fenton is crazy about animals - he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens he cares about.
As he started, it won't take long until he's on the "Horse of the Year" show - and I'm sure he'll cut off well.
A speaker from the annual horseback said, "Fenton is only three, but he knows how to deal with his pony."
Together, they're a great team.
The jury evaluated Fenton and Toffee according to how well they had beaten and presented themselves in the lead ring.
They watch for good cooperation between ponies and leaders - and there were Fenton and Toffee the best in the ring.
I'm sure Fenton's cute clothes helped her part to make it really perfect for the occasion.
Chinese newspaper should be "reformed" after call
A Chinese newspaper, which had requested the release of a reporter accused of diffamering, was to be reformed on the title page, explained a press regulator.
The New Express, based in Guangzhou, had printed a rare public call for the release of the journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to counterfeit reports about a national company.
Now the new Express will be subject to "comprehensive correction," the regulatory authority explained.
The "rectification order" was obtained by the Press and Publications Authority, Radio, Film and Television in Guangdong.
Preliminary investigations revealed that the New Express, belonging to the Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several incorrect reports on the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
"The editorial management of the New Express was unordered," the regulatory authority announced in a statement.
She said it was decided to "impose an administrative penalty for Chen Yongzhou and withdraw his reporter license."
In addition, "the Yangcheng Evening News Group was instructed to make a full rectification of the New Express and recommended to identify the relevant controllers at the New Express and to immediately check the leadership team of the New Express."
Chen had written several articles for the New Express, in which he reported alleged financial irregularities with a manufacturer of construction machines named Zoomlion.
After being arrested, the newspaper published two calls for his release on the title page and supported his journalistic work.
But then Chen appeared on state television and admitted that he had published false reports against payment.
"In this case, I have damaged Zoomlion as well as the entire news industry and its ability to gain public confidence," he explained to the government news station CCTV.
I did it primarily because I was looking for money and glory.
I realized I was wrong.
Following Chens' apology, the New Express published an apology on the title page and stated that they failed to check the reports correctly.
Several known suspects have recently made confessions on television.
Experts say that confessions are still routinely forced, despite a change in law at the beginning of the year in which the authorities were forbidden to force someone to accuse themselves.
Discover drug tunnel with its own railroad between the USA and Mexico
One of the most refined tunnels for drug smuggling between the USA and Mexico, which was fully equipped with lighting, ventilation and electric train operation, has now been discovered.
The US authorities described the 120 times 90 centimeters measured tunnel as one of the most filling passages they'd ever found.
The tunnel, which runs over a length of just six football fields in the zickpack pattern, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
There are numerous invisible warehouses in the area, which makes it easier to hide loaded trucks with drugs.
The tunnel had been closed before drugs could be transported undetected in it, the authorities explained.
In the detection of the tunnel, eight and a half tonnes of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine had been ensured, according to the records of the Court of First Instance.
Three men who, according to the authorities, worked as drivers were charged with the possession and intended sale of marijuana and cocaine.
They are threatened by a pledge of guilt between ten years and life.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers set on an extensive underground network of drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after the marijuana harvest in Central Mexico in October, which poses the drug cartel the challenge of how they can quickly bring their product to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a 640 meter long passage of railways, which ran from a kitchen in a residential house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love each other
Actor Orlando Bloom and Model Miranda Kerr want to go separate paths in the future.
In an interview, Bloom said that he and Kerr still love each other.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are the parents of the two-year-old Flynn.
Actor Orlando Bloom has expressed himself for the separation of his wife, top model Miranda Kerr.
In an interview with American journalist Katie Couric, who should be broadcast on Friday (local time), Bloom said, "Life sometimes does not run exactly as we plan or hope."
Kerr and himself still loved themselves, stressed the 36-year-old.
"We will support each other and love as the parents of Flynn."
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010, and their son Flynn was born in 2011.
According to Lexika, veganism is subjected to vegetarianism, but differs considerably from that.
Because while vegetarians allow themselves to consume cream varieties, ice cream or a powerful Edamer, these villains are not on the menu of a vegan.
Milk, cheese, egg, besides the waiver of meat and fish, the vegan leaves away from all consumption of animal products - also honey is denied.
What remains, one may ask itself, but in close consideration, the vegan food world is characterized by a remarkable imagination.
"Bread strikes are very popular," explains Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the local reform house, which holds a variety of specific products for vegans.
Reuben Proctor also likes to visit the store in the Domgasse.
For 13 years the native New Zealand has lived vegan, in Lampertheim he finds (almost) everything he needs to live. "1997 I changed my diet and became a vegetarian."
About the centuries, the next step took place and I became a vegan.
"But the conviction came not only because of nutrition, but because of the shoe choice," Proctor says, the artificial leather prefers normal leather.
He realized that in other everyday interests there are no animal products.
In the first place, vegan is an ethics.
"I don't want animals to die for me," Proctor expresses the maximum of the Vegans, which covers the entire consumption behaviour.
Instead of retracting burgers, piercing or rubber bears, the Vegan quickly discovered completely new products, the enthusiasm grew.
"It is a double bonus," says Proctor today, "in fact vegan does not give up, it is not ascending, but it is an enrichment." The assumption that with the food conversion you reduce the selection of food options, Proctor rather returns to the power of habit.
And precisely these conditioners made some even so well-meant attempts fail.
"The addiction factor is a very crucial factor that allows many to give up quickly, similar to smoking," Proctor makes a comparison.
And he says, "Certain flavors are not to be determined by the beast."
Often it is the spices or the type of preparation that makes the taste.
"But one can also produce the same effect in other ways," explains the Vegan.
To a barbecue party, for example, Proctor brings aubergines, mushrooms and a few vegan sauces.
It observes a balanced, varied diet, in which it is also intended to taste defective once.
Of course you want something between your teeth, that is legitimate.
"It should taste, but it is not only to reduce to animal food," Proctor said.
He did not suffer health damage up to eating disturbances, another widespread assumption.
For me, the transition had a positive aspect.
I don't take any foreign cholesterol and I have an increased vitamin share.
There are high-performance athletes who feed themselves exclusively vegan.
"My blood values are fine, I often get checked," says Proctor.
In particular, many Vegansimus critics warn against the lack of vitamin B12.
"Since animals are fed with feed instead of grazing on the pasture, it is questionable whether in the meat you buy in the refrigerator, the vitamin B12 share is high," Proctor finds.
For Vegans there is also the possibility to take the coenzym in the form of tablets.
"My B12 values are fine," he explains.
Proctor should not go far for food procurement.
After all, basic nutrients exist everywhere and every supermarket now has soybean milk and other products.
Anything I need, I'll find in place.
Just sometimes I buy something special.
"Many people ignore that only the finished products are expensive, but this is how" ordinary "finished products are known to be."
However, the preparation of vegan dishes is far cheaper and less time-consuming than generally accepted.
"There is a lot to discover in the kitchen, with a few little knives you can achieve good if not partly better results," Proctor says.
Margarine instead of butter, a little more baking powder and carbon acid instead of egg, with his vegan cheese cakes Proctor could also make his parents-in-law wonder.
The Vegan gives a new sauce to family parties.
This has dynamics, when you cook together, it has a new role to play.
"The situations that may arise are as different as people themselves," Proctor says.
Of course, scepticism has already been brought to him.
Don't you like my food anymore?
"Shall I feel bad now because I drink milk?" - in such questions one must act as a vegan with a finger tip feeling.
"I do not reject people, I am a part of this society," Proctor does not want an enclave to have a deadline.
And more precisely, the everyday world does not appear as vegan strangers as suspected - and the vegan does not accept as limited as common in everyday life.
Fast food is also allowed.
There's fries everywhere!
"Many Dönerläden offer Falafel, or just a vegetarian yufka," Proctor says.
In a pizzeria he waves on pastries, or just ordered a pizza without cheese, all a question of habit.
The restaurants are so slow to cope with it.
"When I started to feed vegan 13 years ago, everything was much more difficult," the New Zealand can find a development: "You have to talk to people, make them aware of it."
"If there are enough questions, they may be inclined to complement the menu," he hopes.
Vegane restaurants develop, such as the cucumber in Mannheim or the café bird-free.
Proctor wishes that other restaurants also have at least a vegan dish on the menu.
Basically, vegan dishes are there for everyone.
Everyone can eat them, so they're exactly the opposite of exclusive.
"Meat dishes are exclusive, however, in the true sense of the word, because they exclude others," Proctor notes.
"If you want to avoid food scandals, veganism is a safe way to make most of it impossible from the outset," Proctor says.
However, the purchase of vegan products could be somewhat difficult at the beginning.
Especially when you learn to understand which can also contain animal additives in peanuts as a dye, you seem to leave the courage quickly with the fulfilment of ethics in so many hurdles and falls.
Not only did Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen write a book: "Veganissimo - Animal ingredients and their alternatives" explains the many ingredients that are added to food but also cleaning agents.
"One gradually develops a scanner view and knows what signs and logos one has to observe" It is sometimes better to do small steps than to stand or to stumble, "Proctor knows.
Veganism, he's an important moral finger show, pointing to consciousness.
Maybe he doesn't make it quite possible to take away his habits, but at least he can teach consumers to question his habits critically.
The stock exchange operator Nasdaq OMX continues to hold its customers in breath.
The trade at the Nasdaq Options Market was interrupted on Friday afternoon of German time.
In a communication, the operator gave rise to technical problems.
The other 11 US options markets, including two of Nasdaq OMX, continued their business unhindered.
The recent incident continues a whole series of smaller and larger pans with the stock exchange operator.
Only on Tuesday had the Nasdaq indices not been calculated for errors in data transport for an hour.
In August this year there had been two pans alone in one week.
First, the US Investment Bank Goldman Sachs had sent massive defective purchasing orders to the option markets for technical problems.
After that, the stock exchange operators needed almost a whole day to look through and delete the orders.
Two days later, half of the total share trading in the USA came to pass for several hours because of a computer panel at the Nasdaq Stock Exchange.
In addition, in the last year, the Facebook stock exchange had provided supervision.
The Nasdaq systems had not grown the flow of purchasing and selling orders, later the SEC established the stock exchange supervision and donated the company to a record penalty of 10 million dollars.
Constancy: Cyclers drive around 63-year-olds
According to the police, the accident had occurred when a 26-year-old man, on Thursday night, at 22: 00, was on the left road of the station to the marketplace with a lady bike.
When a 63-year-old man suddenly walked from a place, the bicycle driver was no longer able to brake in time.
In the following collapse, the pedestrian was pushed against the wall of the house, went further to the ground and increased a plate wound of about 15 centimeters on the head.
A rescue car team brought the injured to medical treatment at the hospital.
British police will send Assange an extradition message
Today, the British police gave an extradition message to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who sought refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard stated that he had sent to the 40-year-old Australian a "call to stand up" who called him to appear in a police guard, and added that if he did not comply with this, the arrest would threaten him.
Assange is threatening the extradition to Sweden for the accusation in a sexual offence after its possibilities have been exhausted under British law since the Supreme Court has rejected its opposition to the extradition at the beginning of the month.
As he fears that Stockholm will deliver it to the United States, he had sought refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on 19 June and asked the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard "sent a 40-year-old man an invitation to join a police guard at a time we chose," said a spokesman.
He continues to violate the terms of his release on bail.
The embassy did not comment on the communication of the police call.
Assange fears he will be delivered from Sweden to the United States and accused there of possible spying accusations after he had published over 250,000 diplomatic news on the discovery website WikiLeaks.
Driver who had been roasted with 210 km / h and hot drink between the legs receives a penalty of £1,000
A car driver was punished at £1,000 because he had driven up to 210 km / h and a hot drink between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was stopped on May 27 with his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree.
After the police stopped him, they discovered the drinking cup between his legs.
In front of the Colchester District Court, Howie was guilty without having driven the necessary care and attention.
He received seven points and a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also sentenced to payment of a cost of £90 and a sacrifice supplement of £100.
Tax on foreign real estate owners against London's speculation bubble
The Ministry of Finance has provisionally calculated the CGT measure, but is still waiting for the final decision of Schatzkanzler George Osborne, who in the 2012 budget imposed a 7% stamp tax on apartments that cost over two million pounds and annual fees for buyers who hold apartments as a company and not as individuals.
Already now, revenue from the stamp tax for residential property in the districts of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, which was 708 million pounds in the tax year 2012 / 13, has been collected together the proceeds for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, North East, North West, Yorkshire and the Humber region.
Cook said: "After the increases in the stamp tax on high-cost dwellings and the introduction of the related legislation against circumvention, it is difficult to claim that high-quality properties are taxed too low, regardless of the effects of the old community tax system."
"But this step could make some foreign investors more restrained in terms of buying properties in London, or stop owners from selling," he added.
First-class properties - the top five to ten percent of the housing market by price - in the wealthy London Southwest belt extending from Fulham to Wimbledon have cost the record value of 11.8% last year.
Prices in Central London had an equal annual growth of 5.6% but were overshadowed by a emerging "domestic market," where the southwest part of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) experienced a upward trend, such as an investigation of Savills.
Scientists were able to give more light to the context in which the swinging of a dog stands with its mood.
Previous research had shown that happy dogs with the dick wrestled more to the right (from the dog's perspective), while it was the left side for nervous dogs.
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive these subtle differences and respond to them.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trient, said: "People are well aware that the left and right brain half react differently to stimuli that cause positive or negative emotions."
Here we have tried to look at this with other species.
He also noted that in dogs, as in humans, the right brain half was responsible for the movement of the left side and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in feelings.
In order to learn more about how dogs react to the lateral dice of their species, the researchers monitored the animals while these movies of other dogs looked at.
They measured the heart rate of the four legs and analyzed the behavior.
Probably we'll soon understand why the dick moves in one, sometimes in the other direction
Professor Vallortigara said: "We showed the dogs movies with dogs - either a natural version or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects, and thus we could control the movement of the tail more left or right."
When the animals looked like an otherwise expressless dog moved the dick to the right (seen from the perspective of the whining dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But if the dick tendency was mainly left (again from the dog's perspective, which wings), then their heart rate increased and they looked uncalm.
According to Professor Vallortigara, the dogs do not deliberately communicate with each other through these movements.
He is rather convinced that the dogs would have learned from experience what movements they should worry about and when not.
He said, "If you have different encounters with other dogs and the whistling with the cock in a direction is more linked to friendly behavior and the right side produces rather a less friendly behavior, then you react on the basis of these experiences."
The researchers say that the findings of dog owners, veterinarians and trainers could help to better understand the emotions of their animal.
John Bradshaw, expert on dog behavior and guest scholarship at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Bristol, stated that this was not the first study in which it was examined whether left and right was important for dogs.
Last year, a team from Lincoln University found that dogs turn their head to the left when they look at an aggressive dog, and to the right when it's a satisfied dog.
In another research work at the University of Victoria in Canada, there was the following: "Dogs go to a robot dog if they are, dick" to the left and not to the right, rather than to get uncalm - just elsewhere than in the Italian study. "
According to his statement, the differences could therefore affect the fact that the dogs in the various studies did not interpret the animals in the movies or robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could help, he explained.
"Although there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two brain half is used for different purposes, many of the details still need to be determined - and dogs are no exception," Bradshaw said.
However, since their behavior is simply recorded, it will probably not take long until we understand why the dick sometimes moves in one direction, sometimes in the other direction.
Arctic Monkeys move appearance in Glasgow due to the disease Alex Turners
The rock band Arctic Monkeys postponed an appearance in Glasgow after her lead singer was infected with throat ignition.
The band from Sheffield was supposed to play in Hydro on Friday.
However, due to the disease of the lead singer Alex Turner, the concert must now be moved.
The band's announcement came after she had to postpone a performance in the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys announced: "After the decision to cancel the show at the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and on medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys also have to cancel the show at the Hydro in Glasgow on Friday, November 1."
"With Alex Turner, a throat infection was diagnosed, which is why it cannot occur."
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham is now held on 20 November, which was moved to the Hydro in Glasgow on 21 November.
All tickets keep valid for these shows.
We apologize to all ticket holders for the discomfort resulting from this.
Please contact the customer service at the sales points at which you bought your ticket if you need further support.
Pope Francis appointed first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will first call new cardinals of the Catholic Church on 22 February, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the most ranking clerks in the Catholic Church after the Pope and they are also the ones who choose a Pope, so that Francis will thus appoint the first group of men who will ultimately participate in the election of his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal who has reached a age of 80 can no longer participate in the election of the Pope - this happens to a group of 120 "electoral cardinals."
In a statement in which the message was announced, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman of the Vatican, said that a meeting of all cardinals will take place before the ceremony for the appointment of the new cardinals, which is also known as a consistence, is held.
"Pope Francis has decided to announce in advance his decision to convene the Consistorium in February so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from all over the world can be planned," said Lombardi.
Jack Valero from Catholic Voices said that the number of electoral cardinals will probably have decreased by February.
He explained that a Pope usually nominates as many cardinals as necessary, so that the number of electoral cardinals again is 120, and as many cardinals over 80 as he wants.
The consistence was important next year because it was the first since the French election in March this year, said Valero.
At present there is a certain overlapping on the part of Europe and in particular Italy.
"It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they only have a small number of cardinals.
The cardinals will also be the first to be called after the formation of the Council of Cardinals established by the Francis, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world who have the task of finding ways of reforming the Church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything alone.
"Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," said Valero.
He stated that it was "possible" that Francis would ask the cardinals for advice.
But so far we have not been in this situation - this is all completely new.
Valero said that, typically, the bishops from large places would be called to cardinals, but the French said "full of surprises - so we don't know who he is appointing."
GM calls back new pickup trucks in the USA to repair the seat line
General Motors calls back almost 19,000 of its brand new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra Pickup trucks with construction year 2014 to solve a problem with the manually adjustable seat lease, so a communication from the US Regulatory Authority for Vehicle Safety on Friday.
In some of the cars there may be a defect in the mechanism for reversing the front seat.
For this reason, they do not comply with the Federal Directives on the safety of vehicles in the case of head restraints.
"When driven from the back to the vehicle, it is possible that the head support does not properly protect the inmates so that there is an increased risk of injury," was read in the message on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration website (NHTSA).
The recovered models were manufactured between 1 August and 10 September.
The delivery of GM trucks started in June and is the main model start of the leading US car manufacturer since the insolvency-related restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the vehicle owners in the first half of October about the defect.
NHTSA was unable to examine the notification letter because of the 16-day government shutdowns, which had a negative effect on car purchases in October.
The sale of the Silverado and Sierra trucks, which were newly developed for the 2014 model year, increased by 20 percent in the first ten months of the year, said GM on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42.660 Silverado and 16.503 Sierra pickup trucks.
The GM share on the New York Stock Exchange rose by 1.4 percent to 37.47 US dollars on Friday afternoon.
Desperation cry of a Obama voter
I have elected President Obama twice in the hope that change is possible
He says Obama has done praiseworthy efforts that had been defeated by the blockade of Republicans
The blockade policy does not apologize for the website problems of Obamacare, the threaten attacks
Obama's memoirs about the 2008 election campaign were a sad memory of what would have been possible
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year student at Harvard Medical School.
I'm reading a horrible sad book right now.
It's a book that I believed it would raise me up during the rude second year of my medical school and give me hope again.
It is called "The Audacity to Win" (courage to win) and describes the Memoiren Barack Obamas for the 2008 presidential election.
When I'm done with my patient records in the evening and go to bed, the book leads me back to a time when politics inspired millions and a talk could rob the breath.
The election became an earthquake victory and news speaker held up to reflect the historical significance of this hour.
My classmates cried for joy and my parents gathered all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on the way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
In 2008, Obama became a member of Obama, with 82% approval.
And then I close the book.
Turning back to the present is an evil awakening as if you were ripped out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember these optimistic times - they seem to be a vague memory, a sad reminder of missed possibilities.
In the years since I first voted, something has actually changed.
But it's just nothing I could have imagined.
I recognise the great and versatile things that Obama has achieved, from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for health insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of the forced confusion of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden.
I too believe that party-political blockade tactics have pushed too many efforts to bring our nation forward: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closure of Guantanamo Bay, to mention only a few.
But after defending the Obama government with colleagues and acquaintances, I ended up with my explanatory attempts.
I have reached a point of political despair.
The Republican blockade policy cannot explain why it is allowed to interrogate foreign heads or kill innocent children by drones overseas.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data on the private life of Americans and why Whistleblower is punished, revealing state misconduct.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, was murdered without a procedure, and why the public financing and spending limits are circumvented during the presidential elections.
It does not justify the results of a report saying that the White House's efforts to reassure the media are the "most aggressive... since the Nixon government."
And recently it cannot apologize for the inability to design a simple website in the more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if that's what I should have expected.
Whether I should have understood by 18 that government work could contradict the previous political campaigns.
Obviously, the Office of Members is not a predictable course, as a opposition party and random events such as the Newtown massacre form the public debate.
But when I look at the examples mentioned above, they seem to have been largely elected by the government itself.
And that bothers me most.
I chose Obama again in 2012, not because I was enthusiastic about his candidate.
Mitt Romney was a confusing and unprecedented alternative, he seemed unable to define his direction and positions.
I had the impression that a second term of office for Obama, free of pressure from future elections, would fulfil the hope we had heard of for so long.
But with the drop in Obama's approval values to under 45% this week, the return to 2008 has become even harder by this book.
It wakes up in me the longing for the many promises that have dissolved in the air.
This week I read a section in the book that describes how Obama had to put a serious loss against Clinton in the Pennsylvania preelection.
In a meeting with the electoral assistants after the decision he told his employees that they had to come back to course and follow the purpose of their case.
"I want us to find our spell again," he said.
We need to remember who we are.
It's five years later, Mr. President, and I couldn't agree with you more.
The views expressed in this comment are exclusively those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims Prime Minister Tony Abbott had conflict of interest in parental leave
The billionaire and MEP Clive Palmer say that Prime Minister Tony Abbott would be in a conflict of interest in his plans for parental leave because his daughters become pregnant and could therefore benefit from it.
The mining magnat, which is in a judicial dispute about the payment of 6 million dollars of CO2 tax, put up the claim when he wanted to wipe questions from the table whether he was in a conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which are important for deciding whether the CO2 and mining taxes are cancelled or reduced.
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and the daughters of Abbott would personally benefit from the laws.
"He is in a great conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because if one of his daughters becomes pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether she gets a vacation or not," said Palmer.
Two months after the election, the Election Commission Palmer officially declared the winner of the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax with 53 votes in advance after the recounting.
Palmer called for a revision of the voting process so that it could go faster.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of the vote?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why should we not have a system to march in, enter data into a computer, select immediately and then have the result at 6: 30 in the evening?
Palmer also criticized the use of pencil when marking the ballot.
You use them because you can then radiate the results if you don't like them?
It's incredible to vote with pencils these days.
The Electoral Commission has examined the options for electronic elections and recently published a joint legislative proposal with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, stated that an international airport for the Sunshine Coast belonged to his policy and that he would take his new post "very seriously."
A public office is about the public service.
"We seek no reward except that of history, namely that we can serve in a critical time of this community," he said.
RBS suspends two foreign exchange dealers
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two dealers from its foreign exchange division, so two people who are familiar with the situation; this is another indication that the global administrative investigation on the alleged manipulation of the monetary market is taking place rapidly.
Some of the largest banks in the world, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they cooperate with the authorities in investigating the world's largest financial market, on which 5,3 billion US dollars change the owner daily.
The two dealers would be the first RBS employees suspended in the broadening investigation that entails the scandal of the Libor interbank business.
The Bank, which did not comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received information requests from authorities.
"Our investigation on this subject continues and we cooperate fully with the FCA and other regulatory authorities," the Bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, close persons reported that the RBS transmitted the records of e-mails and instant messages sent from and to a former trader to the UK Supervisory Authority, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This dealer, Richard Usher, had left the RBS 2010 and is now supposed to have been granted permission from his current position as European leader of the Forex Spot trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, Head of European Spot Trading at Citi, was granted this week and Matt Gardiner, former leading currency dealer at Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week at Standard Chartered.
None of these dealers were accused of any misconduct.
The Instant Message Group of Usher belonged to banks at Barclays and the Citigroup, said the situation close people.
UBS announced this week that she had taken steps against some of her employees after the Swiss regulatory authority Finma had explained that she was investigating an alleged manipulation of the foreign exchange market in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities worldwide - the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Competition Authority Weko, the FCA, the US Ministry of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - are currently dealing with accusations that bankers should have agreed on transactions in the monetary market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also initiated internal investigations or received information requests from authorities, said familiar individuals with the situation.
Banks come through Instant Messages and E-Mails from several years looking for cases of malconduct.
The news of these investigations has upset traders in an area that has heard one of the most profitable trading units of investment banks in recent years, but this year was under pressure because low volatility in currencies limits the chances for speculators.
Some banks have tried to play down the affair and said that it is almost impossible to manipulate the extended and highly liquid foreign exchange market, but leading dealers believe that this is not necessarily true.
A leading dealer noted that despite the enormous daily volume of foreign exchange trade, the fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use of its own internal platforms by banks would lead to "an impact on the market with very low ticket prices."
The message came out the same day when Credit Suisse announced that she canceled a dealer of her London Exchange Traded Funds office this week after he caused a loss of just about six million dollars at the end of last year.
The Bank promptly informed the competent authorities and works with them.
"We are sure that the dealer acted alone and that the matter is compromised," said Credit Suisse.
painted the building fence on the bechtle property
A group of citizens' initiative "Swiss meadow" has decorated the building on the bechtle property on the course promenade in Bad Herrenalb.
In addition, it cleaned and spread the pedestrian, it is said in a press release.
The planned coverage of the depleted house in the back part of the property had not been allowed for security reasons, because the site is threatening to disintegrate.
Alfred Abel, who is currently managing the property, had agreed with his colleague Reinhard Domke on the BI.
Before the action of the BI a transparent message "We have been set up for it."
However, this did not disturb the 20 members of the Citizens' Initiative much in their action.
Her motto on the big poster was called "We are against Bauruins."
In this way she wanted to point out the danger of even greater ruins on the Swiss meadow - should the huge project one day fail.
In conversation with many passengers in front of the "construction site," it was clear that some citizens believe that the implementation of the city project will be much better, although few do not have the same questions about the dimension of the project presented as the BI.
But they're starting to resign, because the city continues to delay these answers, it's called the BI's.
As you can hear, the mayor's public statements also have an impact.
In May, at the municipal meeting, he had said that he feared the out for the thermal bath, should the people vote against the plans for a bath and wellness complex on the Swiss lawn when deciding on the citizens.
Some seem quite afraid, others feel like "plumping blackmail" on the population, it says in the press release of the BI.

Rangnick-Schelte for Schiris: Man no Swallow King
As pleased as Ralf Rangnick is with the current high form of the Federal League table leader Red Bull Salzburg, the sports director of the "cops" was disappointed by the arbitrators.
"There is currently a dangerous tendency that Mane and Alan are being pushed into the category of Swallow kings," he took the two offensive wirbels in protection on Thursday at a press conference in Salzburg.
The youngest occasion for Rangnick's criticism was Yellow for Mane at 3: 0 against Great last Sunday, where Senegalese became a alleged actress to hang - which was certainly not, as the TV pictures showed.
"A huge mistake decision," Rangnick said the arbitrator Harkam called "completely overstated."
Harkam had also contributed to the escalation between Salzburg-Coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig-Trainer Adi Hütter after the party.
His German landsman defended: "I would have acted as Roger Schmidt in every single situation."
Schmidt himself wants to have no contact with his colleague after the shelter.
I don't know why.
"Because I am the one who was offended," the 46-year-old emphasised.
In view of the success, however, rangnick agreed to a lobeshymne.
"There are only two words for that," he said.
There's not much to suspend.
Especially the way the team plays is impressive.
I want this to continue.
Changes in the winter transfer time will hardly occur.
There are no great reasons to change something.
"Except a player comes with the wish that he wants to leave the club," Rangnick made clear.
Supreme Court confirms Obamas Health Act
It is a great victory for the Obama government: today the US Supreme Court decided that the health law closely linked to Barack Obama is constitutional.
By five to four votes, the judges ruled that the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act - it forces US citizens to complete health insurance or pay a penalty by 2014 - is constitutional within the framework of the tax authority of the State.
The Supreme Judge John Roberts moved to the side of the four more liberal members of the Chamber, while the Judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy voted against it.
The Court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 2700 pages comprehensive law and also considered that the provision of the health law that states should either extend the conditions of access to Medicaid or otherwise remove all State Medicaid advances would not be constitutionally restrictive.
The appeal against the law had been initiated by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law was strongly rejected by all the leading Republican presidential candidates, including the final challenger Mitt Romney, in the 2012 pre-election campaign.
Norway: Norwegian place makes light with giant mirrors
With huge mirrors, the inhabitants of a Norwegian village have brought light into their dark valley.
Due to the low sunset level, the Rjukan located in the West Fjord valley usually falls from autumn to spring in the shadow of the surrounding mountains.
With three gigantic reflectors at 45 meters altitude, on Wednesday, a century room came true.
"Finally!," swarmed Mayor Steinar Bergsland at the start ceremony at the TV2 station.
Some of the people of the valley set themselves up in the sun chairs, others put on safety-related sunglasses.
So far, sunhungry people had to ride on a close summit with a cable track in winter.
Ten years ago, the local artist Martin Andersen had presented the proposal to lead the beams into the valley with mirrors.
However, since 1913, there have been these basics in the place.
After several years of debate, the City Council had finally adopted the 5 million crowns (around 615 000 euros) expensive project.
A similar construction has been providing winter sunshine to the Italian Alpenort Viganella for some years.
Post barely clears Sundays
"Many citizens will not have noticed yet that the red points for Sunday lesson are still on various mailboxes of the core city and the parts of the city, but if you read the small printed on the yellow containers of Post AG, you quickly find out that the lesson is no longer taking place on Sundays and holidays," the FDP informs.
A request from the FDP confirmed that.
On Sundays and holidays only before the post building in Ernst-Ludwig-Straße 36 and Jakob-Müller-Straße 1 in Hüttenfeld will be emptied.
Whether or not to be emptied in Hofheim and Rosengarten on Sunday, the answer to the FDP's question will not be answered.
The social and youth political spokesman of the FDP, Fritz Rohrenbeck, wants to follow up here.
The Sunday emptying is an important postal service at Terminpost.
"In spite of the price increase for letters on January 2013, this enterprise is radical and unreasonable."
Thomas Bittner, chairman of the Liberal Group and city associations, supports his group colleagues: "What annoys me is the fact that here clammingly the hours of leave are changed or deleted."
The post is miles away from the neighborhood.
"At least the mailboxes in the parts of Neuschloß and Rosengarten must be emptied again on Sundays," said Bittner and Rohrenbeck unisono.
Also for the core city, especially non-mobile citizens, a mailbox with Sunday emptying should also be able to reach foot-and-mouth.
Rohrenbeck asked the city parliament whether the city administration was planning talks with the mail about this matter.
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the mail did not communicate with Lampertheim.
But there is also a Sunday lesson in Hofheim.
Your party has been in favour of privatisation.
"Then decisions are taken elsewhere," said Maier.
Frankfurter parking charges should increase vigorously
Parking in Frankfurt could soon become more sensitive.
The magistrate of the city will advise this morning on a presentation of traffic dezernant Stefan Majer (Green).
Therefore, parking fees are to be increased by 50 per cent.
However, it is not intended to increase prices, but to reduce the time range of parking and parking ticket machines from 30 to 20 minutes.
In December, the municipal council will have to decide.
The IHK Frankfurt Retail Committee considers this "not a good idea."
The possibility of parking immediately before the business is "an ununderestimated advantage for smaller retailers."
The Transport Club Germany considers that an increase after two decades is "quite appropriate and actually long overdue."
Public transport is also becoming more expensive.
Freudenstadt: Fast actions overromping hosts
With a narrow cader, Mr I of the TSV Freudenstadt had to join the Schiller-Schulturnhalle in Reutlingen against the TG Gönningen of the Swabian Alb.
The Elders were with an experienced team on the other side of the network.
Soon, however, it became apparent that they could not fully comply with the rapid actions of the Freudenstäter.
With the hard and positioned hits, the wreckage was extremely difficult.
Repeatedly they missed the passports and attacks played by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz clean over the grid center and were not in place in the block defense.
Two high first set wins clearly expressed the superiority of the joudenstäter in all matters.
In view of this impressive and playful performance, the third sentence was then won somewhat sloppy and lustless to the 3: 0 final stand (25: 13, 25: 14, 25: 22).
On November 2, with the TV Baiersbronn, which was clearly enforced in Nagold, there will be a much more powerful opponent on the field.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B-class, the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt were in front of the Murgtal Hall in Baiersbronn.
They delivered a hard-fighting two-hour match.
Nervosity on both sides caused errors and puncture gifts, and in the case of passports, the precision was sometimes deficient goods and in some critical games the superior prevented the view for possible puncture gains.
In this highly balanced meeting in the TSV team of Marcus Blasutto, however, the great physical effort and a joyful commitment of both teams were consistent.
Nursing day at the small English cabin
On the now fifth day of nursing in the succession of the Natura 2000 project of the upper Hotzenwald, a group of dedicated participants met at the small English cabin in Ibach.
Due to the suggestions from the population, this day in the area of the cabin of view should be cut out into the valley, said Mayor Helmut Emperor.
Many hikers, as Emperor said, described this area as the brilliant piece of the slopes on which the landscape offers the ideal framework for wonderful views.
He thanked the attendants for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the nursing day was an appropriate tool to strengthen the connection of man and nature.
He offers every citizen the opportunity to set accents in nature itself.
At the same time as the tourist aspect, environmental consideration could also be found.
This ecological aspect explained Friederike Tribukait from the Department of Natural Protection of the Fribourg Governing Council following the greeting by Landrat Tilman Bollacher, who had taken over the screenplay and wished the action a good success.
According to Tribukait, the long-term tourist goal covers the goal of preserving the newly grown old genus with its specific protected habitat types by opening and connecting to the still existing pasture.
Certain species such as rare butterflies and grasshoppers cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest areas.
You need these free connections to the arteries.
Tribukait said she did not want to miss breaking a lanze for the planned biosphere area at this point.
The current measure is not just seamlessly integrated into this plan.
A biosphere area also offers the opportunity for sustainable economic and environmental development based on the internationally recognised Unesco status and thus a continuous supplement to the achievements of the Life project as well as the previous nursing days for the future.
After these various speeches, chief manager Christoph Wehle and project manager Cornelia Bischoff divided the assistants into groups.
The larger trees had already been beaten in advance, the forest tractor is ready to call if necessary.
A group of helpers should take care of the exemption of Wacholderbüschen and the care of a dry stone lock.
The goal was the free view at the point of view.
Lessons: Buyers still only candidate
Information on the Internet: Although the Bearstadt Löffingen with its 7514 inhabitants, an intact infrastructure, a forward-looking school, children, youth and senior policy, as well as its own urban works can be called attractive city, no second mayor candidate has yet been notified.
As the only candidate for the succession of the nominee Norbert Brugger no longer candidates for age, Dieter Köpfler from Löffingen has so far been established by the 46-year-old Bankkopmann and Operator Dieter Köpfler from Löffingen.
The application deadline expires on Monday 11 November at 6 p.m.
Google, Samsung, Huawei accused of Nortel patents
On Thursday, the group that owns thousands of former Nortel patents stranded a lawine of complaints for patent violation against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, the company that was outbidden by Nortel's insolvency auction.
Rockstar, the consortium that bought Nortel patents for 4.5 billion US dollars, sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent violations before the U.S. District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is owned by Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused in seven cases of patent violation.
Patents relate to technology that matches search concepts on the Internet with relevant advertising, such as the complaint that affects the core of Google's search engine business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not directly accessible.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC make mobile phones that work with Google's operating system Android, which is in sharp competition with Apple's and Microsoft's mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial bid of over 900 million dollars for the Nortel patents.
Google increased its offer several times and recently offered 4.4 billion US dollars.
After the Nortel patents of Rockstar, Google purchased Motorola Mobility for 12.5 billion US dollars, a business that was also partly motivated by Motorola's library to patents.
"Although Google failed to acquire the patent at the auction, Google has violated the patents and continues to do so," said the complainant.
Rockstar demands a high compensation from Google as it claims that Google's patent violation is intentional, so the accusation.
Egypt accepts first freely elected President
Mohammed Mursi is taking office, but his day of triumph should not mean the end of political disputes in Egypt.
The Islamist Mohammed Mursi promised a "new Egypt," when he was declared the first freely elected president of the country and thus joined the successor of Husni Mubarak, who had been displaced 16 months earlier from the office.
With his introduction to the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi became also the first freely elected Islamic president of the Arab world and the fifth head of the state of Egypt since the fall of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He laid the oath in front of the 18 judges dressed in black robes of the court, who has its seat on the Nil and has been found in an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We strive for a better future, a new Egypt and a second Republic," said Mursi at the ceremony that was broadcast live on state television.
"Today the Egyptian people have laid the foundations for a new life - absolute freedom, real democracy and stability," said Mursi, a 60-year-old engineer and member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group, who had been taken sharply in the sight of the respective government since its creation 84 years ago.
Hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building when Mursi arrived in a small car convoy shortly after 11: 00.
Only a few hundred followers had gathered before the court to celebrate the new President, and unlike the presidential prunk of Mubarak time, traffic was stopped only in a short time so that the car convoy could cross the usual lively road that connects the city center with the southern suburbs.
As an uncharismatic "replacement wheel" of the Brotherhood, his personal prestige has grown since his victory and a Friday speech, in which he presented himself not only as a candidate of the Islamists, but all those who wanted to target the aspirations of the 2011 rebellion against the authoritarian Mubarak.
"Egypt is today a civilian, national, constitutional and modern state," explained Mursi, dressed in a blue suit with red tie, to the judges in the wooden chamber in which he laid the warrant.
Later, Mursi went to the University of Cairo, where he was supposed to hold his speech.
He was officially welcomed by an army capelle who played the national hymn he listened to in custody.
The military leader Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was present.
When he arrived, he was welcomed by hundreds of attendants in the largest audience hall of the university with speakers from "The Army and the people are one hand."
The University of Cairo, founded in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, has developed into a high-level Islamic student group in the 1970s.
On Friday, Mursi laid a symbolic oath on the Tahir Square, the birthplace of the rebellion which led last year to the end of the authoritarian rule of Mubarak, and he commended to revoke presidential power that the military Council had taken over by the Head of State chased out of the office.
But with the rejection of the official oath in court and not as usual in Parliament, he bends to the will of the military, which indicates that the battle of power will continue.
Mursis's speech at the Tahir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
Falkenberger Discothek ensures two great evenings
The new season in the Falkenberger Discothek "Blue Velvet" has begun.
Today's Friday night is called "Pump this party," and tomorrow's Saturday evening is going on with a C 25 party.
Fat beats and cool sounds are promised by the organizers of course on both days.
Workers crashed by ladder: severely injured
During the exchange of a defective external sensor on Thursday, a 51-year-old worker in Eggelsberg crashed from a ladder and wounded hard.
The man from Lamprechtshausen wanted to exchange a defective heating sensor at the outside facade of a guest house.
When he climbed on the ladder on the roof, it slipped away and the man crashed on the concrete floor.
He suffered severe injuries and was brought to Salzburg with the rescue helicopter "Christophorus 6."
Violent in South Africa: twice life-long imprisonment
Nine months after the brutal rape and ruin of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the perpetrator was sentenced twice for life on Friday.
This was reported by SABC.
The victim died later of the consequences of serious injuries.
John Kana had already been found guilty at the beginning of the week of the crime.
The act had triggered terror throughout the country.
The 21-year-old had raped Anene Booysen in February in an industrial facility in Bredasdorp near Cape Town.
14 hours the doctors fought for the survival of the victim, but in vain.
The viewing of young people was so horrible that nurses and sisters needed psychological assistance.
During the trial Kana had admitted to having been in a bar with Booysen in the night of the night.
He also confessed to beating them and raping them, but he contested to be responsible for the death of the girl.
The police initially assumed several perpetrators, but released two suspects from prison because the evidence against them was not sufficient.
The prosecutor also stressed during the trial that she was convinced that Kana was alone at the time of the attack.
In South Africa rape is almost a daily one: every year there are about 64 000 ads of sexual violence.
This is almost ten times as much as in Germany, but with 82 million people, it has significantly more inhabitants than South Africa (50 million).
However, police and women's associations in South Africa estimate the darkness of sexual violence to the 10- to 25-fold.
Jumbo visits the Black Forest ham
Jumbo was looking for the "best ham in the world": The Pro7-Star Bonndorf visited for the TV show "Galileo."
The spokesman makes it clear at the beginning: the most important thing for the ham are the piglets, Turbomast is not a good prerequisite.
Can skinks get in every supermarket be a quality product?
Uli is the head of the large ham factory in the Black Forest. Jumbo explains the operation of the company "Adler" in Bonndorf.
"Germany's favourite ham," as Jumbo announces the Black Forest ham.
Only with hair protection and coat comes he into the inside of the factory.
Jumbo also has to disinfect his hands for the first time before he can reach the microphone.
Jumbo sighted to strengthen at quick limbiss in Waldshut
"Here I am working huge quantities," amazes the television makers, black forests ham as a mass product.
16.000 cups per week speak for themselves.
Weight, fat content, color: Uli explains what it is about quality.
Most pigs are slaughtered at six months.
Television with level?
Details such as the Ph value of the meat also play a role.
The darker the meat, the higher the ph value.
"I'm excited when you tell Roberto Blanco what happens then," said Jumbo cynical.
Here the level of private television is presented in pure culture.
But watching is worth it anyway.
The audience sees that the breaking of the coils is still a handwork.
For: Black forests ham is traditionally found without bones in the shelf.
The secret of the ham is the spices mixture with the salt.
Smoking tower and smoke fire remind Jumbo optically of a "submarine."
The trick: Tannenweige provides the special taste of the Black Forest ham here in the smoke.
20 days in smoke make the ham almost black.
"Now the disc disappears in jumbo," he announces the test food.
"It's really delicious," says the conclusion of the TV star.
This will allow all stakeholders to live.
You thought travel agencies belonged to the past thanks to the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to resist the trend.
The company has increased its profit prospects for the whole year and expects record revenues from vacancies in Australia and the United Kingdom.
The travel company now accounts for a adjusted annual profit before tax between 325 and 340 million dollars, compared with 305 to 315 million dollars in its previous forecast.
If the current targets are achieved, then this means an increase of 12 to 17 percent compared to the record profit of 290.4 million dollars in the period 2011 / 12.
As Managing Director Graham Turner announced, the Flight Centre gained eight percent in the first half of the year and booked a strong start in the second half of the year, especially in the Australian and British private business.
"Since the beginning of the year, our ten countries have been profitable and some of them are in a good way towards record-year income before interest and taxes," he said.
These include Australia and the United Kingdom, which are typically one of our strongest results.
In Australia, the leisure industry recovered in the second half of the year, which equals a slightly weaker market for business travel.
Similarly, it was good for the Flight Centre's leisure business in the UK, while business customers also have less spending here.
The US business recovered from the seasonally weaker first half of the year, so a profit is expected for the third year in succession for the whole year.
The shares of the Flight Centre rose by 3 cents to 38.20 dollars yesterday.
Schools are kept to a greater focus on mathematics, literature and grammar
In English literature courses, students will have to treat at least one piece of Shakespeare, a novel of the 19th century, romantic lyrics and contemporary British novels from 1914 onwards.
The examination also includes "unseen texts" to encourage too wider reading.
The combined course of English literature and language is abolished.
From 2015 onwards, students will have to take an independent GCSE examination for language, with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Ministry of Education will publish tomorrow the new curricula for English and mathematics - the first subjects that have been radical transformed.
Other core boxes will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative, Ofqual, the audit supervisor, will announce a reorganisation of the GCSE structures, including a new designation system and less course work.
In a speech in the summer, Minister for Education, Michael Gove said that there is a "broad consensus that we need to reform our audit system to restore public confidence," emphasising that the CSEs would "become more challenging, more ambitious and more stringent."
Studies show that in English schools less time is spent on mathematics - 116 hours a year or three hours a week per year - than in most other countries.
On the other hand, Australian schools teach on average 143 hours a year and students in Singapore receive 138 hours.
Although there will be no formal requirement to provide more time for mathematics in the timetable, coalition circles say that the comprehensive mathematical testing - combined with a stronger weight of the specialist in ranking lists - will probably encourage schools to employ more hours.
The curriculum focuses more on "problems from the right life," including financial mathematics.
Lock beautiful animals and delicious cakes
The most beautiful rabbits of different races and paint beats present the circular group performance review this weekend at the Civil House.
The reviews have already been made on Thursday
Once again the local association W514 will organize this great exhibition.
The breeders of the associations in the district of Soest show here their best animals as well as young Wickeder hobbyholders their rabbits.
On Thursday, six prize judges evaluated the numerous rabbits and were able to distinguish outstanding animals.
Visitors of the show are well informed as the evaluation of all animals is appropriate on the cages.
The official opening of the exhibition will take place on Saturday at 2.30 p.m.
For all visitors the rabbit show is open on Saturday from 10 a.m. and on Sunday from 10 a.m. to 15.30 p.m.
Guests are also invited to a tombola and a delicious cafeteria.

Salem: Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical Conversation Forum
At the next Ecumenical Conversation Forum on Monday, 21 October, at the New Museum of the Castle, the theme is "To Hell with Hell - Theological considerations on today's handling of the last things."
Referent is Professor Johanna Rahner.
The Ecumenical Conversation Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Evangelical Churches of Salem, the Castle of Salem and the Cultural Sea Crisis.
Johanna Rahner wants to go into the forum of the question, how people today classify the "last things" after death.
If people in the past centuries had known too much about it and put it on those images of heaven and hell, "which so far form our ideas," the contemporary prophetic doctrine of the hopes of perfection is characterized by a certain embarrassment or even speech.
"The greater hope has been driven out by religious criticism," says the speaker.
She "provided us with so many questionnaires that the call signs seem to have come from us."
Johanna Rahner continues to say, "But the crucial challenge remains the trouble of death."
This is connected to the question of that desire, "which dreams that at the end everything may be good."
Johanna Rahner, born 1962 in Baden-Baden, studied Catholic Theology and Biology from 1982 to 1989 at the Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg.
She graduated to Dr. Theol in 1997, also in Freiburg.
The Habilitation for Fundamentaltheology and Ecumenical Theology followed in 2003 at the University of Wilhelms.
Since 2010 Johanna Rahner has been in a chair for systematic theology at the Institute for Catholic Theology of the University of Kassel.
Geisles: More than 100 young Catholics of the Little Heuberg confirm their faith in the celebration
In two Gottesdienste, 101 15- and 16-year-old young people of the Season Unit Am Kleinen Heuberg have been established.
In the morning, the group was accompanied by Laudato-Si, in the afternoon of the youth choir The Spirit.
With the reception of the company sacrament, the young people said yes to their baptism and asked for the power of the Holy Spirit.
In the past few months, the firmlings had prepared themselves for the great feast under the direction of Diakon Reiner Dehner and the help of numerous community members.
In various projects, they met various tasks of the Christian community and shared the youth day in subpower.
Illmensee: Second mountain bike race enthusiastic participants
During a magnificent weather, 214 bicycle drivers came to Illmensee to take the round course over the hill chains around the lake.
This will inform Ulrich Knobel of the organizing sports club Illmensee.
Among the participants, especially on the short distance over 15 kilometers and 300 meters of altitude, were also numerous every man raiders who once wanted to practice their hobby in the competition atmosphere.
Two junior drivers of the German top class were also at the start of this competition: Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came to the German championships with the recommendation.
Both of them were expected to disappear from the field.
As in the previous year, Felix Bader was able to save a small advance to the goal and defended his title as the overall winner of the short distance.
In place two, Pascal was able to place himself again.
With the ladies, it was Theresa Duelli from the team nightmare that made it all the way up on the victorious stairs.
Anne Adel came from Illmensee and Leonie Driver from Owingen.
A pleasant development is the growing number of drivers who live or work in the municipality.
Not only in terms of performance, the whole range of athletes was represented.
The age structure also ranged from ten years for the youngest to more than 70 years for the oldest beginners.
This year, in the main separation, there were even more absolute topathians at the start.
Four drivers were able to depart from the regional top drivers.
Among them Philipp Pangerl, a mountain bike semiprofessional from the Black Tusk Racing team.
Pangerl was already twice a world champion in the twelve-hour drive along with a team colleague.
This year he became European Master in this special discipline.
With Roland Ballerstedt, who already calls two German master titles in Duathlon his own.
After 45 kilometers and 900 meters of altitude, there was a wimpernslag finale in the target entrance in front of the Three Lakes Hall.
Pangerl was the first to run over the target line.
Just a second after that, the routine Ballerstedt was able to secure the second place in the overall valuation.
At the same time, Hermann and Warthmann became the third of the overall valuation.
Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest in the main separation.
The second place was Areane Blersch from Binzwangen from Natascha Werner from Stuttgart.
Sportsmen and helpers were very satisfied with the smooth and well-organized course of the event.
On the way through mud, rivers and jungles for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical assistance in remote villages in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend treating hundreds of patients
In the West African country there are not many doctors, only one for 5,000 people
Voice up here or with your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 of the "CNN Heroes of 2013."
You can vote for him or any of the other heroes in the top 10 to choose him as "CNN Hero of the Year."
The winner receives $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle looked at how his sick father lost consciousness and traveled to hospitals who did not have the means to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in 1981 in a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first he had only one broken arm, but then an inflammation formed that extended to his brain and caused a hematoma there that should affect him for the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," said Georges Bwelle.
We would have taken him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years joining his father in overfilled clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer there.
"It's not easy," commented Bwelle.
You can leave the house at 5: 00 in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first, and it's not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some people are even dying because they have to wait.
The situation has hardly changed since Bwelle's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organisation.
On the other hand, the relationship in the United States lies with a doctor for 413 people.
But even if there was a doctor for her, most Cameroon could not afford to visit.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and almost three quarters of health expenditure in the country are private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," says Bwelle.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
His father and so many of his countrymen suffered in Bwelle made the decision to do something about it mature.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team have performed 700 free operations last year.
He himself became a doctor and worked as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME, which travels to rural areas on weekends and offers free medical care there.
Since 2008, he and his volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday he and up to 30 people are forced into small buses and driving with the narrow medical equipment on the roof over unattached terrain into the villages that need help.
It's not always going smoothly.
More than once they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they will receive as heroes: a feast, song and dance and the best accommodation the place has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is really a reason to celebrate and wrestle - with its wide smile and its boundless energy - is happy at the happy celebration.
The next morning the team will start investigating hundreds of patients.
"Per ride we treat 500 people," says Bwelle.
They come from a circle of 60 kilometres around the village - and that on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, undernutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transferable diseases.
Others receive crooked, donated glasses or free birth documents - a document that is necessary for school, but many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evening, the team conducts simple operations with local anaesthesia.
The operations usually take place in a school, town hall or apartment; after the operation the patients rise and go to the recreation area to make room for the next.
The lighting for the surgery and the disinfection equipment is fed by the group's generator and so Bwave and his volunteers work until early morning hours on Sunday.
It is an exhausting pensum, but the village musicians usually help to keep the team motivated.
"They drum all night so we can stay awake and continue our work," says Bwelle.
On Sunday the team then returns to the city, tired but proud of the work done.
The group - a mixture of Cameroon doctors and foreign medical students - last year carried out 700 free operations and knows that with her work it makes a huge difference for the people she helps.
A man explained that the free operation of a breakdown he received now enabled him to work again.
"This changes the future of my family," the man said.
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon at the hospital, Bwelle also works at private clinics in Yaoundé at night.
With this second job he finances 60% of his nonprofit activity, according to Bwelle; the rest comes from private donations.
"I really don't know when he's asleep," says Katie O'Malley, who is studying medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia and volunteering in Bwelles group in the second year.
He's always either in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so he can go to these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe and support Bwelle, this is a chance to gather practical experiences that they would never get at home.
"We can be in surgery where we help to pour blood or keep the instruments for Dr. Bwelle," O'Malley explains.
This would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year.
Students usually pay for their trip to Cameroon themselves and bring often donated sanitary material.
However, if they are first in Yaoundé, Bwelle takes over the accommodation, transport and guidance.
"He's definitely a hero," says O'Malley.
He dedicates his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cambodian people knows no boundaries.
For Bwelle, almost permanent work is not a burden.
To help others to make a happier life and thereby fulfilling a promise he gave to his father gives him great joy.
"I'm so happy when I do this job," says Bwelle.
And I'm thinking about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do it to make people laugh again and ease the pain.

Excellent struggle mastered
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway Novelle "The Old Man and the Sea," is cut to the body Horst Janson.
Janson is an old rabbit in his metier, acting art.
The old man Santiago can't make a mistake about fishing.
That's how the two just complement themselves great.
You almost think you can see the wrinkles in the neck of the old man that the fisherman Manolo speaks of.
If Santiago is tired of living on the chair, it's real with Janson.
In addition, the role of the old fisherman is through and through a characteristic role that Janson has excellent championship.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a brave man who does not give up and ultimately wins the fight against the fish through his knowledge and his will.
Janson is on a wide range as a single producer on the stage.
He makes it possible to focus the attention of the audience on himself so that his monologues are not boring at a moment.
His efforts to finally draw the fish to the surface of the water are so real that the spectators forget that the sea is only made of blue-lit water bottles.
Director Jens Hasselmann lets the old man in the boat act in front of the fishing village.
During the performance, he highlights the active scene: Santiago's cabin, the bar of singer Marie-Luise's favor, which with her songs and her magnificent voice embraces Cuba's sense of life.
The four musicians play Cuba's rhythm and are also guests of the bar.
Tourism: descent to the Romans
A drainage channel from the Roman era is obtained at about 120 meters of length below Cologne.
Whoever visits Cologne doesn't come by the cathedral.
About 157 meters the two towers run into the sky and make it the second highest church building in Europe.
But only a few visitors who amaze the two filigree church towers realize that there is a lot to discover under the cathedral.
Rainer Schulze is an expert on Cologne's underworld.
The service center of Cologne Tourism is a meeting point for its guided tours directly at the Cathedral.
The tour begins unspectacular: "We start in the underground garage," says Schulze.
In the seventy years, the city fathers wanted a car-friendly city, and so the rest of the old city walls remained just what was not too big.
Most of the users of the parking house are therefore also passing through the Roman remains today and only cancel their car.
But if you look more closely, in the park deck D2 discover an archaeological focal point separated by metal grid.
There are about five meters of high ruins from large hand-plate stones.
"There are remnants of the Roman city wall built after Christ in the second half of the first century," said Schulze.
Before it goes back to the daylight, shoulder leaves the participants on the upper parking plane another look into a dark, 15 meter deep shaft.
This is the well of the old dome, which, unfortunately, is hardly perceived.
The next station of the tour is the pretorium, and here the participants get down to the depth again.
We are experiencing the office of the most powerful man north of the Alps, the CCAA president.
What CCAA means, a visitor wants to know.
"The abbreviation stands for" Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium, "which means, in good German," the city of Roman right and the city of Agrippinenser, founded under Emperor Claudius in the place of the old age for the Empire cult. "
And the pretorium is the former state hall palace, the power center of the Roman Empire on the Rhine.
From the front room of the exhibition a tunnel access to the Roman drainage channel, which is preserved here at about 120 meters length.
"You can walk a piece along the so-called Cloaca Maxima if you want," Schulze encourages the guests.
A surprise still has a shoulder.
After getting the key at the box, he leads the group to a 16-metre deep, moving shaft.
"We are now in the Mikwe, a ritual Jewish bath," he explains.
The Jewish community built its bathroom deep into the ground to get to the groundwater, which was essential for the ritual laundry.
Up to today, at the lower end of the Mikwe, whose origins go down to the eighth century, different water levels are readable by changing levels of the Rhine.
The Mikwe will be part of an archaeological zone on the town hall, for which construction work is scheduled to begin shortly.
However, a few years will last until completion.
Bone almost chopped off: Reproduction of Rocker process
A bloody attack in the rock environment will be rerolled after over four years.
A trial for attempted assault, hazardous injury and damage to two 30-year-olds has begun in front of the Landgericht Frankfurt (Oder).
It is accompanied by strict security arrangements.
The defendants were sweeping for the recording.
They were supposed to have been active in the rock scene and heard of the Bandidos at that time.
In June 2009, the prosecutor claims to have stabbed and attacked three men in a car together with unknown associates in Finowfurt.
All the victims were severely injured, a man almost lost his leg.
The victims are supposed to have heard of Hells Angels' competing group.
One must have been a high-level member from Berlin.
Previously there was apparently a persecution hunt with several cars.
According to the accusation, it was about reverse fights and a demonstration of power.
The two defendants had been released in a first trial at the beginning of 2012.
A court speaker said then that it could not have been proven that the men had actually been involved in the bloody fake.
The perpetrators had worn masks and had not been recognized.
The Bundesgerichtshof revoked the judgment after revision of the prosecutor's office and revoked it for re-trial to the Landgericht.
One of the defendants is currently in open enforcement for another crime.
The start was mainly about the reconstruction of the processes in the night of the night.
As a witness, the Commissioner who was then investigating was invited.
In the centre were phone calls from the accused and other persons who had interviewed the police.
Hard is that Rocker is almost always following a law for her in court - and not testify.
That also applies to the victims.
In the first trial, only one of the victims had packed out.
Public Prosecutor Stefan Golfier from the Prosecutor Frankfurt (Oder) said on demand that new traces have emerged since the last trial.
The process will have eleven further negotiating days.
The dissemination company does not think
The night was long, the music was loud and the mood was good, but sometime it's going home.
Only: The hunger is noticeable in the bends of the people on the passenger and back seat.
Sure, it may be the one or other cocktail or scent responsible for it!
What's closer than chilling to the next drive-in to get a little bit of a favor?
I admit, I'm happy to join you when it's late at night or early in the morning at the fastfood holes.
A couple of fries, a coke, a burger - and then nothing like go home and go to bed!
But on the way home, the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco walkers are noticeable.
Because what needs to be missed when you get your fast food bags out of the car window?!
Especially on weekends, paper bags are discarded on road frames and parking spaces.
"Why?" I wonder.
Are people too stupid to take the bags home and to the next trash?
It's not just that the paperwork is changing the landscape.
The bags have already covered transport facilities such as headboards, causing accidents.
But not to think about this, said "dissemination company," probably doesn't even know what this word actually means.
When you are travelling more often in the evening, with a number of people in the car, you know how a backbank can look after celebrated nights: clothes, bottles and other garbage are tower there.
There would be a few bags more or less, but nothing - unlike the road where no one wants to trample on the rest of the food.
I already see the day when the cities and municipalities are going to be stupid - and the fastfood chains must demand for their bags.
Obama's withdrawal in health policy
After serious criticism yesterday President Obama made a revoker in his often repeated, clear promise: "If you like your health insurance, you can keep it."
After hundreds of thousands of their insurers received a notice, the Republicans announced to the President in the last few days that he cheated on the American public.
Yesterday, Obama relatified his original promise.
"The vast majority of citizens who have a working health insurance can keep them," he said at a speech in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports on the dismissals, Obama called on the Americans who received such communications to look into the free market for a new insurance.
Most citizens could thus receive better, broader health insurance at the same price or more favourable than predicted.
"You come a better offer," he said.
The government described it as a little surprising that the five percent of the population who have made insurance themselves had to look after another tariff, as their contract did not meet the new standards under the Affordable Care Act.
"I would like to say directly to these Americans that you deserve better," said Sebelius at a hearing in the Committee on Energy and Trade of the House of Representatives in Washington.
Sebelius, responsible for implementing the Affordable Care Act, stated that the launch of the online platform has been "miserable" since October.
"I am as frustrated and angry as everyone else," she said.
I'm determined to recover your trust.
This testimony from Sebelius to a person who was sitting behind her at yesterday's hearing in the House of Representatives was recorded after a dispute with the Republican Member Billy Long from Missouri, which was about whether she should be obliged to participate in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long Sebelius repeatedly stressed the question of why the "architect" of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily abandoned a state-funded insurance to conclude a tariff for HealthCare.gov itself, which she now wanted to sell millions of Americans.
Government in Jerusalem does not confirm attack on Syrian Air Force Base
An American government officer who wanted to remain anonymous said on Thursday to the American news station CNN that Israeli fighters would have attacked an airforce base in Syrian Latakia a day earlier.
The aim was "missiles and related equipment," which the Israeli Government had feared had been destined for the Lebanese Hezbollah, according to CNN.
Syrian and Lebanese media as well as the Arab channel Al-Arabiya had previously reported that the base in the port city of Latakia had been shot the night from Wednesday to Thursday, and made Israelis responsible for it.
The Israeli TV station Channel 2 showed satellite images of the Latakia base, where Russian defense missiles of the type S-125 Newa and a battery of SA-3 missiles could be seen, which according to Channel 2 have a range of 35 kilometres and can transport explosives up to 70 kilograms.
Unsure The government in Jerusalem has officially not confirmed the attack.
However, the news agency Reuters quotes an also anonymous Israeli government officer with the words that he believes that Israel has carried out the attack, but is not sure.
A spokesperson from the Israeli Ministry of Defence said, "We do not comment on these reports."
The journalist Ron Ben-Yishai stressed in the daily newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth that the Syrian regime had tried to deliver soil-air missiles to Hisbollah earlier, partly successfully.
The Israeli Government had repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to supply Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons would mean crossing a "red line" which would follow a military response.
John Kerry explains in an unprecedented confession that the US spy had "unadequately gone too far"
John Kerry, with an unexpected confession, indicated a deviation of the US's defensive attitude towards its monitoring programmes by saying that spying had "gone unadequately" in certain cases.
The Foreign Minister also admitted that he, together with Barack Obama, was responsible for switching to "autopilot" when the explosive discoveries of the Whistleblower Edward Snowden about the NSA's spy activities became public.
Through the invisible information, the US government has come into a diplomatic storm of exhortation from its allies.
In a speech transmitted by video at the Open Government Conference in London, Kerry said: "The President and I, as well as others in the government, have learned about some things that have just passed by an autopilot, simply because the ability to do so existed, which goes back to the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War and, of course, to 11 September."
He then admitted, as the first high-level member of the US government, that the US spy had crossed a border, but also stressed that no rights had been abused.
He said, "In some cases this has gone too far."
The President is determined to create clarity and therefore is conducting a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel that there is abuse here.
I assure you that the rights of innocent persons in this process will not be affected.
However, Kerry insisted that the NSA was a power of good and that many lives had been saved by its surveillance operations.
He added: "We have to do with a new world in which people are willing to blow themselves up."
There is a radical extremism in the world that is determined to kill people, blow up the air and attack governments.
So what if you were able to catch it and stop it before it happens?
We have actually prevented plane crashes, attacks on buildings and the murder of people because we have experienced such plans in advance.
Meanwhile, US legislators will travel to Europe to disseminate concerns about the alleged American spying and convince Europeans of the need to continue working with the United States in anti-terror efforts, as the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said he spoke this week with representatives of the European Parliament and other people and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorist organisations because of the frustration of the National Security Agency's surveillance.
"It is very important for the national security interests of the United States that Europeans remain on board with regard to our joint efforts against terrorism," said Murphy, who is the first to sit in the Senate as a Democrat and is working as chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on External Relations and European Affairs, in an interview in Washington.
In addition, I am going to Europe to make it clear that we need to continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their worries about the NSA programmes.
Media reports, according to which the NSA recorded millions of telephone data in Europe, have burdened relations with some US allies, although the Head of Secret Service said this week that the reports were incorrect and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and exchanged with the United States.
Other disclosures quoted from Snowden's documents that the NSA had supervised the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other Heads of State worldwide.
The head of the National Secret Service, James Clapper, defended the spy of allies as necessary and stated that this was common on both sides.
In all the Tumult, Murphy said that his authority was preparing for the journey of the Congress to take place this year, and hoped that the delegation would include members from both parties and chambers.
The names of the other participating Members will be published in the next few days.
He said the exact route was still being prepared.
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the journey was to improve relations, he also said that there would be some "serious words."
He said that European governments should be honest with their people about the type of spy programmes they have been using for years.
"Although we can change our monitoring programmes and thus better protect the rights of Europeans, they also have to deal with the fact that we are not the only ones who are spying," Murphy said.
In the meantime, John Kerry is on a trip to the Middle East and Poland for the weekend to deal with the cruel about the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran as well as the US surveillance activities.
A persistent injury to the jump joint threatens to prevent the use of Nicolai Müller in the FSV Mainz 05 Bundesliga exit game at FC Augsburg.
Mainz begs an operation by Nicolai Müller.
Tomorrow he'll try to train with the crew.
So far, he was only able to do it individually.
"We will decide on his operation in the short term," said Coach Thomas Tuchel.
The 40-year-old hopes to have his best target protector with six matches.
Because the Mainzer must already refrain from the injured performances of Niki Zimling, Julian Baumgartlinger and Niko Bungert.
Australian appeals against prison penalty in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, who was sentenced to 15 days in Phuket because she had wrongly claimed to have been raped by a taxi driver, appealed against the judgment and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first found guilty by a provincial court in Phuket on 15 June, having made a false statement, after telling the Thai police that a local taxi driver raped her in the morning hours on Sunday, 10 June, while two other men arrested her.
Later, however, the footage of a video camera showed that she had safely reached her hotel after she had been separated from her Australian friend.
The police in Phuket interrogated Bamford for two days until she confessed to have figured out the story.
Until the trial, she was in custody on the ground.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a low-security prison on the edge of Phukets, instead of in a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former player of the Australian Rubgy League, who has turned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra with the request for help for his daughter.
Tunks told the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about the well-being of his daughter and wanted her back to Australia.
"Of course, we are very worried, but we hope that she will be home as soon as possible," said Tunks.
Bamford has appealed against the judgment and is against a deposit of 50,000 Baht on free foot.
In Australian reports it was read that in the meantime she is taking vacation in the resort Krabi in southern Thailand.
The court's voices were that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and had been warned that the appeal could also lead to a higher sentence of up to two years in a prison for adults.
However, it is also possible that after the recent murder of Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand could be endeavouring to improve its touristic image, and therefore it will be released.
