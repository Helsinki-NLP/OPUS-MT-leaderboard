The Prague Stock Exchange crashes down against business closures.
After the steep waste in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange was able to correct the losses.
The transactions with ČEZ's shares reached almost half of the normal daily business.
The Prague Stock Exchange started to break in from Monday at the beginning of the Tuesday business when it fell by another six percentage points.
This time, the reason for the break-in was on Wall Street.
In the Czech Republic, too, the response of the market to the result of the vote of the American House of Representatives which it had refused to support a stabilisation plan for the financial sector there.
Cases of shares in Asia
A dramatic case occurred on Tuesday the stock exchanges in Asia, although the indices were able to compensate part of the losses during the day.
The Hang Seng Stock Exchange Index in Hong Kong lost almost four percentage points during the business day, but was able to compete a part of the losses later, so the decrease decreased to about 2.5 per cent.
The index Hang Seng China Enterprises, which observes the movement of Chinese stock stock exchanges in Hong Kong, fell by 3.8 percent, in Shanghai the markets were closed.
The shares in Sydney's stock exchange lost more than five percent, but then reduced the losses to 4.3 percent.
The stock exchange in Taiwan fell by 3.6 per cent according to the index there.
"The timing for the rescue operation in the US is uncertain and will influence the financial markets worldwide," said the chief of the monetary authority in Hong Kong Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, although it belongs to China, determines its monetary policy itself, which is independent of the Chinese Central Bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are moving at the same level as those in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, American legislators should return to the negotiating table as soon as possible and adopt the draft financial support.
Otherwise, another country would be affected by the collapse.
A bloodbath of American shares
On Monday, the American House of Representatives rejected the plan for financial support for which up to 700 billion dollars (almost 12 trillion Kč) should be spent.
The legislators ignored President George Bush's call to support the plan.
Bush believes that the plan would regulate the fundamental causes of the financial crisis and thus help to stabilise the whole economy.
The American shares experienced a bloodbath on Monday, and the most important stock indices recorded the biggest collapse in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones Index fell by almost seven percent, a similar breakdown he had last recorded in 1987.
The index had already fallen before the vote, but there was hardly any evidence that the draft would not pass in the House of Members, the index experienced a free case.
Congress confesses: US government can pump $700 billion into the banks
The chief representatives of the American Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of agreement on financial assistance for the US financial system.
The vote will take place at the beginning of next week.
The American legislators achieved a breakthrough in discussions on the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of a financial contribution to the US financial system of 700 billion dollars (about 12 trillion kroner).
However, this is not yet a victory.
Congressmen still have to negotiate some details of the agreement before they may publish the final version of the law and vote on it.
The plan to support the financial system will be negotiated at the American Congress on Monday.
On Sunday, the chairman of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services, Barney Frank, said this to the Reuters Agency.
According to the Senate, different data could probably be voted on the plan at the earliest Wednesday.
Economists believe that a communication on the adoption of the plan should be the first important psychological factor for the revival of financial markets.
After that, however, there is a "harassment" due to the complicated mechanisms, as the markets could be helped in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made significant progress.
We have clarified our different views on how a package to stabilise the market should look, "said Nancy Pelosi to the Bloomberg Agency.
According to your words, a final vote could be held on Sunday.
Representatives of the legislators met with the American finance minister Henry Paulson on Sunday to give the government fund its final form.
This provides for the purchase of unsold mortgage assets by financial corporations that cause financial companies to fall into serious losses and jeopardise the stability of the entire system.
"We are at the forefront of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and which must also be effective on the market.
You have to continue the health plan, but I think we're at the target, "said Paulson.
A signal for Asia business
The global financial crisis is also clearly falling down in stock markets, which fall sharply.
According to the words of the Democratic Senator of Nevada, Harry Reid, the legislators were trying to reach a final agreement in the Congress before Sunday.
In fact, it wanted to reassure investors before transactions in Asian financial markets, which are located in the first time zone where a decision by the Congress could affect business on Monday.
However, it is not yet quite clear when both chambers of the American Congress will vote on the law, there is also uncertainty as to whether the negotiations in the last minute could not fail on a problem.
The legislators hope that it will be adopted in the next few days.
However, the law will have some changes.
The total amount intended to assist the system is to be divided into two parts.
The initial 350 billion dollars should be made available as soon as possible as President George Bush requested.
However, the Congress can block the distribution of the remaining money if it has the impression that the program does not fulfil its function, with another $100 billion and later the final $350 billion.
Bush appreciates progress in negotiations
Although the President has a veto right in this decision, the Congress can vote over his veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the programme, which was based on obtaining finance for purchasing bad mortgage securities whose value has fallen, has remained, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are no longer able to repay their mortgages.
"We've worked everything out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the law on Sunday, the Senate then on Monday, "said the Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
The American President Bush was also satisfied with the progress.
His spokesperson Tony Fratto said Bush was satisfied with the progress made on Saturday and "appreciate the efforts on both sides to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy."
Restriction of golden parachutes
The President of the Banking Committee of the Senate Christopher Dodd, the leading negotiator, alleged that the legislators had agreed on a responsibility for the money programme, the protection of taxpayers against losses, the conclusion of benefits and a timetable for financing the plan.
The new law also aims to restrict the so-called golden parachutes for directors of companies involved in the programme and to set up a committee to supervise the Fund.
I want the Ministry of Finance to lead this.
"We have worked very hard on this and achieved a great progress towards an agreement that works and is important for the market and for all Americans," said Paulson.
The plan also expects a help for house owners who have problems with repayment of their mortgage.
The government should negotiate new rates of mortgages that it purchases, with the aim of reducing the monthly costs for debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological Help
The proposed plan is a good idea, according to the main economy of Patria Finance David Marek, but implementation will be very difficult.
"This is because you do not know what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets are purchased.
This will be crucial for how the financial sector and the government share the losses between themselves, "said Marek to the server iHNed.cz. this week
In Marek's view, whether the plan is adopted now or at the beginning of next week is not decisive.
"It is much more important that the Congressmen agree to support the plan and that they adopt it as soon as possible.
The psychological importance of the agreement on adoption is at this moment the most important, "Marek stressed.
Duell on knife's cut: MP3 player against phones.
We advise you on your choice
While almost every cell phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can phone yet.
So, of course, it looks like it's better to buy just one phone.
In spite of all, there are enough reasons why you should join a self-employed player.
The choice depends entirely on the type of use and the rights of the future owner.
Certainly one buys hard for a great expensive record player at home to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
Once such musical innovations do not appear on LPs, and from a qualitative point of view there is no objective reason for this.
However, if you have LPs with Art Rock, Jazz or Blues in the shelf, you probably dream of at least one of them.
So it is also simplified with music on trips, i.e. with compressed music - music in MP3 format.
There are price and quality categories here too.
For one, it may not be acceptable to spend eight thousand crowns for a player, but also a Pink Floyd fan is probably hard to handle headphones for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes between which there is enough space for everyone.
The selection is widespread.
The lifetime of the batteries is also crucial.
Some good music players can play much more than just music, but what mobile phones can do, they don't even create indicative ways.
No modern device is as universal as the phone.
In addition to the primary functions, telephone and simsen, it can reflect music and videos, record both, it has once a better, once a worse photo device and may also navigate.
And if you still include the smartphones and communicators, you have almost a small computer in your pocket.
It's a little miracle, because no fridge can barbecue and no TV can photograph.
But the universality of the phones also brings disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your phone, however, the more frequent you will have to reload it.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy-saving ones.
Only a few phones can play music longer than ten-twelve hours, mostly it is much less.
In this respect, music players (especially the simplest) are much more powerful.
Therefore, you should expect the cheap phones not to be able to play more than a few hours of music.
If you make a phone call from time to time, you'd rather buy another charger for the office for safety - this also applies to more expensive devices.
In MP3 players you will not have this problem, even the less good will last at least 9 hours uninterrupted operation with one loading.
Another problem is if you want to overplay the music on your cell phone.
Unfortunately, only a small part of the devices has a USB finish, and not every mobile phone can be connected directly to a PC without any special software.
Of course, you can overplay the music directly to a memory medium, but only a few card reading devices are finished without reduction with the tiny memory cards used in mobile phones.
For players you do not need any special software except for exceptions (iPod).
You only need to feed the device via USB port with music from your PC.
Most mobile phones and players themselves create a music library, ordered by the name of the interpreter, the title of the album, the genre or, for example, the evaluation by the user.
Some devices only form the tree structure of the address directory, similar to the Windows Explorer, some can both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, intelligent phones with operating system).
Players are easier to use, mobile phones can be more
When selecting a specific device, you should explore in particular the life of the battery, storage capacity, quality and type of sound and, of course, the operating comfort.
If music is for you especially scenes and hear it every day only for a short time, for example, in the tram, then any cell phone that plays MP3 files is enough.
What really almost every cell phone can do.
You don't have to control any music formats a cell phone or player can process.
MP3 creates all, and most of the music you get will be just in this format.
The format is one of the most widely used, and also most devices can play music in the WMA format.
Less common is AAC (a format that Apple and its iPods use).
Better phones also allow the purchase of music online.
You only need to call the relevant pages of a provider (or another provider) via mobile internet, and you can buy a song or album.
This service can already be a striking argument in itself for why a music phone should be set up.
Unfortunately, the offer of the providers is bad and is mostly limited to fast radio hits.
The prices are not the lowest either.
However, it is generally assumed that this kind of sale of music (whether via GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most of the cell phones carry them.
If you want to listen to something, grab the phone in the jacket bag while the player is forgotten at home.
However, it is important whether you carry headphones or at least a wireless free speech device.
If not, you can rely on the integrated speaker that has almost every cell phone, but only the least MP3 player.
The biggest advantage of the music mobile will be in the price for many people.
The cheapest costs usually less than three thousand crowns.
For three and four thousand crowns you get a very decent walkman.
The biggest handicap will be for most people that there are no normal headphones there.
The best and technically most mature phones with a 3.5 mm opening for normal headphones cost up to fifteen thousand crowns.
The advantage of the player lies in the easy operation.
The easiest - and not necessarily cheapest (see selection) player can really serve anyone.
A minimum of functions, the similarity of the operation with the previously normal cassette recorder or, for example, the record player is obvious.
It does not threaten collision in the form of an incorrect mobile internet and a subsequent horrifying invoice for data transmission.
Which device should you grab now?
Also the cheapest phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable storage media (type M2, microSD etc.).
Even if you buy a corresponding card, two thousand crowns are sufficient.
Attention, though.
For the basic models, only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are usually supported.
Only the most expensive can also read 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy a cheap MP3 player, then grab Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on capacity (max. 2 GB), you don't have to put more than 1100 kroner on the table.
If you belong to the more demanding listeners, take more specialized phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have separate operating buttons for MP3, and so the operating comfort comes to one single MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, whose mobile phones from the Walkman series have the same user interface as the individual MP3 players sold.
The same services in the same price category of up to four thousand crowns, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours) offer you MP3 players of the above manufacturers.
The first virtual provider will come to the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe.
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite mature, the Czech suppliers offer virtually all services as they are offered by their partners in Western Europe.
Nevertheless, there is something missing here - a virtual provider who forces the classic at lower prices.
Maybe this one won't wait long.
We have often reported on Mobil.cz that the Czech mobile service providers are working on the most expensive in Europe at all.
This also confirmed by the Telecommunications Authority ČT, which pointed out that the price for a SMS is higher here than in the rest of the European Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the area of regulation of roaming charges, it is likely that there is a paradoxical situation - SMS from abroad will be cheaper for some customers of the Czech mobile service providers than home.
Why are prices in the Czech Republic so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that really makes a battle statement.
Perhaps it sounds paradox, but in the Czech Republic there are three mobile networks and a penetration of far more than 100%.
On the other hand, mobile telephony providers are happy to hamper on the fact that there is extremely much competition in the Czech market.
The President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Authority Pavel Dvořák, who had often expressed in the past that there was no room for another provider in the Czech Republic.
It is likely that a classic provider with its own network will no longer have very many opportunities (by the way, it would probably hardly find frequencies).
But there is another possibility - a virtual provider.
It was precisely the entry of virtual providers to the mobile market that led to a significant price reduction, which the classical mobile operators had to respond to.
Before the entry of such companies as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile on the UK market, there were similar voices as in the Czech Republic.
However, it has been shown that there is room for such providers and that they can really be successful.
By the way, you don't have to look for examples long.
In February we reported about the start of the virtual provider Mobilking in Poland.
In just a half year, this provider managed to gain more than 100 thousand customers and thus to become the fifth largest provider in the country.
The financial group Penta, which owns, among other things, U: fon in the Czech Republic, is behind Mobilking.
The advantage of virtual providers is to focus on a much more specific target group.
In order to function effectively, virtual providers need much less customers than a classic provider.
They do not need a relatively high cost for the construction, operation and maintenance of a mobile network.
In the world, virtual providers usually prosper themselves as low-cost companies - they offer cheap phone calls and SMS, but often accompanied by a less extensive service offer.
For example, Tesco Mobile offers SMS at least half cheaper than its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can also be quite a good chess to set on a non-cliché target group.
This provider is specifically targeted at men.
"Real guys choose Mobilking - the provider that they like and who they can trust," said David Seibert, the CEO of the Mobile Entertainment Company, the operator company of this virtual provider.
It is difficult to say whether a similar approach as in Poland could take foot in the Czech Republic as well.
The press spokesman of Vodafone Miroslav Čepický also doubts: "The Czech market is relatively small for a market segment on which most virtual providers are based.
In addition, it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the supply of services. "
In Czechoslovakia, the mobile telephony providers mean
However, it is almost certain that if a virtual mobile service provider conquers the Czech Republic, this will not be mobile king.
"Although we are talking about an expansion of this successful project, the negotiations in the Czech Republic do not look particularly hopeful.
Mobilking will be more likely to enter the market in other countries of our region, "says a telephone call for Mobil.cz Jana Studničková, press lecturer of the financial group Penta.
Indirectly, it confirmed that the current mobile telephony providers in the Czech Republic are not particularly inclined to do so.
On the contrary, they are trying to do everything to ensure that no potential competitor is created.
Their interest in launching a virtual mobile service provider has for a long time shown the GTS Novera group, which wants to take another step to become a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the field of corporate customers.
"We have a great interest in offering our customers not only fixed network services but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner, the better.
We have negotiated this possibility repeatedly with all Czech mobile telephony providers.
With some of them, we have already been able to achieve negotiation progress, "said the press spokesman of the Pavel Kaidl Group.
Maybe better times are coming now.
Non-official information shows that the first virtual provider may be expected by the end of the year.
But so far this is surrounded by an inescapable wall of silence.
"At this moment we do not assume that there is room for a full virtual provider in the Czech Republic.
The Czech market has a wide range of features compared to other markets.
So far, no subject has addressed us with a complex and serious project in this area, "says his explanation for Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sršeç from the press department of Telefónica O2.
The specification of the Czech market also points to other suppliers.
The press preacher of T-Mobile Martina Kemrová adds rarely to the statement of O2: "We have not yet found a viable and both sides of the project that could be built on."
And it adds: "In the network of T-Mobile will hardly show up a virtual provider by the end of the year.
At this moment we should already have a concrete offer to think in the short term. "
Vodafone focuses more on fulfilling the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický says: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual providers, especially in the area of sharing costs and infrastructure.
This is exactly what we regard as the best from the point of view of our customers.
The main strategy of Vodafone in this area lies in the search for a partner to build a shared network for a fast mobile internet. "
The responsible authorities - with the suppliers hand in hand
The behaviour of mobile broadcasters is easy to understand, another provider was called more competition, this would lead to decreasing prices and thus also to a decrease in profits.
So why should such a competitor be facilitated to enter the market?
The fact that the suppliers can draw on a string when it comes to something also demonstrates the long way back and forth around the emergence of U: fon.
The most likely pressure in the direction of ČT was at the moment, when U: fon came to the market, from the company T-Mobile.
This also demonstrates the information available to the public from the ČT web pages.
Now, however, you are right: fon as an argument why you should not allow a virtual provider.
Martina Kemrová said: "The field of competition of the mobile communications market was also recently strengthened by the entry of a fourth mobile service provider.
Taking into account the character of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is clear that a new operator would make high demands on the market itself and, above all, on its services. "
However, in view of this approach by the mobile broadcasters, the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory authorities is surprising.
It is not only about the attitude of ČT which, unfortunately, in the Czech Republic - unlike the United Kingdom and other highly developed countries - does not have the competence to intervene in economic competition.
It is exclusively owned by the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (ÚOHS).
This, however, referred to this whole problem's very typical attitude.
"The entry into the market of a virtual mobile service provider would be possible after a contract between a mobile service provider and a virtual provider has been concluded through the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
No such contract has been concluded so far, as the offer of potential stakeholders was probably not sufficiently interesting for the classic suppliers, "so in his reply to our question Kristián Chalupa from the ÚOHS External Relations Department.
Representatives of the suppliers would not surprise such a wording.
This is more than worrying by an authority that represents consumer interests and, among other things, is to ensure that no one misuses its position on the market.
In particular, when Kristián Chalupa adds: "In abroad, where virtual providers work perfectly normally, it is to be observed that their entry into the market has contributed to a price reduction in mobile telephone services."
However, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market and a price reduction are probably not one of the interests of ÚOHS.
It is really shocking in this case that the three mobile telephony providers are almost already touching together, resulting from their reactions.
The question of whether this is really just a coincidence is obvious.
Just as the absolute same gas price at the gas stations is certainly only a coincidence and the result of a tough competition.
"The Authority has not detected any evidence in this case indicating any action directed against competition, and therefore it has no reason to intervene in any way in the matter.
None of the suppliers have a dominant position on the market, so they do not have the appropriate increased responsibility for acting on the market.
The necessary instruments for opening the mobile market to virtual providers are likely to be missing also by the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority, "said Chalupa in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many controversial points.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets, prepared by ČT, after which telecommunications is a single market from the point of view of economic competition.
In such a market, of course, none of the Czech mobile broadcasters have a dominant position.
However, some legal experts offer a different view - for the entry of a virtual provider to the market, the approval of the network operator is always necessary.
And the mobile telephony provider has the monopoly for its network - logical - for its network.
This means that it necessarily takes a dominant position in a particular segment.
However, even if you do not agree with this argument, it should at least be a warning for the ÚOHS that three mobile broadcasters are acting alike.
Complaints from a number of interested parties (including the above-mentioned company GTS Novera) show that they face very similar obstacles in negotiations with all suppliers.
The deflection of responsibility to the ČT is then a fairly common trick in telecommunications services, with which the ÚOHS distances from the whole matter.
This was already observed in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, the newly adopted Novelle of the Telecommunications Act failed to enforce the extension of the competences of ČT to the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although a number of experts had promised to improve the situation.
The representatives of the ÚOHS need to know that too well, but they probably have different interests.
It's okay if no one looks
The functioning of any pseudo-virtual provider, of which there are more than one in the Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
It is companies that issue their own price lists for mobile telecommunications services, but they are only partially public.
They are usually companies that operate in the field of multilevel marketing.
Own mobile telephone services, for example, offer Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others.
The price lists of these companies usually only come to selected ones.
The joke of the case is that the company acts as a classic company customer compared to the operator who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As a major customer, he will receive special offers (and other offers).
The problem is that the business conditions of all Czech mobile service providers prohibit a similar resale.
"If there are cases that you describe, then it may be a violation of the contractual conditions that we will then deal with, which may lead to an end to cooperation with the relevant society," Martina Kemrová replied to our question on this issue.
However, it is quite unlikely that such a thing does not speak around the responsibility of the mobile service providers.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned, it may be thousands of customers.
However, no operator is opposed to such an approach.
In fact, they do not have negligible profits from the activities of these companies, at the same time, in contrast to the actual virtual providers, they are not affected by the actual official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický points to possible problems: "The law allows such types of speculation, despite all, the services of these companies are only used by a very small percentage of customers.
They also have to accept that the SIM card does not run on their phone's name, so they cannot have full access to it like the normal customers of the mobile service providers. "
But that alone should be the least strange thing for the ČT.
In addition, another question opens up for the ÚOHS.
Do mobile telephony providers face up to such an approach, why are they blocking themselves against a virtual provider?
It should be added that the ÚOHS has quite strong competences to detect such activities, and if it does not want it, it does not have to satisfy itself with the statement by the suppliers that they do not know about it and their business conditions would prohibit it.
When Czech Republic is no longer the most expensive
As has been emphasised several times in the text, the entry of virtual providers into the market led to a significant fall in the price of the various services.
In practice, in all countries where virtual providers have been created, classical suppliers have tried to prevent their emergence practically more or less.
The arguments they used were virtually identical - a too small or too much saturated market, problems in the quality of services, etc.
However, in the highly developed countries, the regulatory bodies have just intervened in these moments, which did not attempt to protect the interests of mobile service providers but their customers.
Whether through formal measures or non-formal pressure, they achieved that the first virtual operator was created, and this followed further.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies are throwing up the whole case like a hot potato.
On the basis of our experience, we cannot get rid of the impression that unclarity in competences in these cases is more than favourable.
But let's not throw the curtain into the grain.
If the background information is correct and soon a virtual provider appears, the Czech mobile market may soon be moving again.
If a provider allows the creation of a virtual mobile service provider, the ÚOHS will not remain inactive when it comes to rejecting other interested parties (to discriminate against them).
And the Czechs will finally not make more expensive calls than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech hymn has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech national hymn.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented the new recordings of the national hymn where is my home country at a holiday of Czech nationality.
The hymne was newly recorded by the Orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - with a male or female solo song, in chorus and in an instrument version.
Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka took over the vocabulary.
The editors of the hymn versions are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz server you can listen to all four versions.
For Bělohlávek, the Czech national song is one of the most beautiful hymns.
Already before, he had told the Czech broadcasting that he has chosen for the solo variants singers with young, representative voices that are marked and popular.
"From the beginning, I have tried to keep a clear diction with both and then with the choir, so that the text can be understood well so that there can be consistency," the conductor said.
The Czech national hymn will commence its 175 anniversary next year.
The song Kde domov mīj first appeared in 1834 on the stage of the standing theater in the original Czech piece Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl, the music came from František Škroup.
It became popular, and people took it spontaneously.
The first string of the song became an organic part of the national hymn after the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
One of the seven state symbols remained after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
How does the "new" hymne sound
Prague transport companies also transport on Wednesday on a chip for the first time
Wednesday, October 1, 2008, will enter the history of the Prague transport companies as a date when the first passengers to enter a metro, tram or bus will carry an electronic coupon in their pocket instead of a paper ticket.
These can currently buy about a hundred thousand people who own the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can buy a 30-day, 90-day or annual coupon (valid from 1 January 2009) and play it on their chip card at the same time, in the information centres and branches of the transport companies at the Muzeum, Mřstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
The coupons have been available on the website of the transport companies www.dpp.cz since yesterday.
The service was used by more than four hundred customers in the afternoon.
Those who use the Internet sale can really forget the output window in the subway stations where they had to wait regularly in long snakes for their paper tickets.
They buy the coupon via the Internet, it is played on the Opencard in one of the thirteen branches of the city library.
"At these places the traveller is also available a switch with trained staff, who advises interested parties to purchase the Internet and also plays the coupon on the map," says the spokesperson of the project Martin Opatrný.
In addition to the libraries, the electronic coupons can also be played on the Opencard on self-operating machines, which are mounted in some metro vestibüls.
What do these machines look like?
They are red, remembering driving tickets, the passengers may have already noticed in the subway stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Currently there are five of them in the city, but until the end of the year it will be eighty," Opatrný adds.
The coupon controls a machine instead of the driver
The operation of the machines that will work tomorrow is simple.
You just have to enter the chip card, and the previously acquired coupon plays on its own.
The electronic coupons will apply from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in the surrounding area.
So in the suburbs and on the bus lines with the numbers 300 to 499, with which, in particular, the inhabitants of the municipalities of the Central Bohemia region enter the capital.
"In the trains that are part of the Prague integrated traffic, the train accompanying readers have the means to check the duration of the coupons by time and zone," explains Filip Drápal from the Ropid organisation the driving licence control. This organisation sets up the roadmap for the Prague transport companies.
The suburban buses have card reading equipment at the crate at the driver's.
When entering, the chip card must not only be displayed with the driver, but the Opencard must be placed in a marked place on the side of the box.
This means that the driver controls the validity of the coupons played.
"If a passenger wants to check the validity of the coupons played, nothing is easier than asking the driver for this information," Drápal said.
A passenger who does not drive with suburban buses and no longer knows when the coupon's validity ends, can go back to the self-operating machines where the coupons are played on the card.
Here the information on the validity of its documents is displayed on the display of the device.
The South demanded a referendum from the United States
In 1945 the Sudetendeutsche had requested the assignment of the Bohemian Forest to the United States.
This is reflected in a letter stored in the collections of the South Bohemian scientific library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to at least live under the auspices of the United States of America.
With such a wish, some groups of Sudetendeutsche should have turned to the US President in 1945.
This is reflected, among other things, in a letter which has been preserved in a private archive and which is now stored in the collections of the South Bohemia scientific library.
The Germans of Krumau ask the American President not to allow him to return to Czechoslovakia the "Sudetengaus," which was taken on the basis of the Munich Convention of Hitler.
"We have understood the situation correctly and really want to be sure that the American units do not enter German territory as oppressors and enemies, but as a liberator," it says in a letter that is signed with the words "people who are the destiny of the South's heart."
Since the connection to Czechoslovakia leaves the South German - aware of the Czech national character - suspect that it would expect brutality, negligence, incomprehension, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American President to take over the Bohemian forest for today and forever.
"We cannot believe that, without taking account of the view of a quarter million inhabitants of this area, you are speaking to a state that is foreign to us, who is suppressing and attempting to eliminate minorities and has not contributed anything to the victory of the Allies," is read in the letter.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is allegedly the fear of vengeance of the "Czech oppressors."
If the President of the United States doubts about the reconciliation of the Bohemian Forest Germans, it would be enough if he initiated a popular decision in Bohemmerwaldgau on whether the inhabitants would become part of the United States or live under the United States's guardian rule.
Although the text of the letter may sound somewhat naive in today's knowledge of the post-war history, it seems to some magazines to draw a good picture of the expectations of the Sudeten German at that time.
Even though the Bohemian Germans had to at least realize that they would negotiate their deportation from the Republic, only a few of them conceived such a possibility at all.
Some expected the United States and the United Kingdom to negotiate some sort of autonomy for the South.
Others thought they could just stay in Czechoslovakia.
It also confirms the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who comes from Budweis.
He was used in the war as a Budweiser German at the Navy on the Baltic Sea.
When he came to British prisoner at the end of the war and he was taken to a war prisoner camp to Holstein, dozens of other Bohemian Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
"They thought if they came home, the Czech would come to them," said Chalupa.
None of the German prisoners of war who had lived in Czechoslovakia before the war believed that they would expel him from the Republic on the basis of the Beneš decrees.
Don't you think - then pay!
An emotional campaign is addressed to drivers
Dear action on safety on the streets in Czech history.
The emotional media campaign, which the Ministry of Transport wants to launch on Wednesday, could also be characterised.
The authority of Minister Aleš řebíček promises to take drivers of dangerous behaviour behind the steering wheel.
The campaign for 150 million crowns will run on television, radio, cinema, Internet, but also on flyers.
She's supposed to take the drivers from too fast driving and alcohol on the wheel.
And they also remembered to be on the belt before the ride.
The campaign aims in particular to talk to young drivers, motorcycle drivers, pedestrians and, not least, professional drivers in conscience.
And what is shown in the spots?
Especially stories of people who appeal to emotions.
This also shows the "bloody" slogan of the entire campaign:
Don't you think - then pay!
The words "don't think" are on a label in large letters.
And in a leak, the word "pay."
This is supposed to mean that you can pay for a moment of ignorance with your own life.
The spots will "shock" the spectators by 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where you can see quite normal images with drastic recordings of accident victims.
It promises that the number of accidents and the number of road deaths on the Czech roads will fall.
The spots were compiled by the Euro RSCG agency.
Sugar bread and whistle for the drivers
"For drivers, the motto sugar bread and whistle applies.
Sugar bread means that when they travel for example in red, they save time.
The whistle then is the threat of a punishment or an accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk, "said the transport psychologist of the hospital Na Homolce Martin Kořán.
And that is why information campaigns are needed in the press and, above all, negative advertising, the psychologist believes.
In his view, even less effective are tables that make drivers aware of a danger.
"If you set up a static table that warns against a danger, it will probably flow with the surroundings soon, and the drivers will no longer perceive it," says Kořán.
Olmert would return almost all occupied areas in exchange for peace
The chairman of the provisional Israeli government, Ehud Olmert, has expressed his support for the return of virtually all areas occupied in 1967, including Jordan, East Jerusalem and Golan heights, if peace can be concluded with Palestine and Syria in exchange for this.
He emphasized this in an interview printed on Monday by the newspaper Jediot Achronot.
"We need to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) areas, if not all," said Olmert to the newspaper.
"We will keep a certain percentage of these areas, but we will have to resign to the Palestinians a similar percentage (Israeli territories) because there will be no peace without this," he added.
He acknowledged that a possible return would include East Jerusalem.
"The one who wants security in Jerusalem and, above all, does not want tractors or bulldozers to roll over his legs, as it happened to one of my best friends, will have to refrain from a part of Jerusalem," said Olmert in accusation of two attacks in the city in July, where several people were killed and dozens of people were injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the temples and sacred and historic places" which lie on the territory of the Old Town.
"The one who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work, "he further confirmed.
deduction from the Golan heights
Olmert expressed his support for the withdrawal of Israel from the Golan heights, which he believes is an essential condition for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Syria.
But this would also require some efforts on the part of Damascus.
"My proposal is not to make peace alone with Syria on the basis of a withdrawal from the Golan heights," said Olmert.
"The Syrians only know too well what they have to refrain from getting the Golan heights back.
They will have to refrain from their current relationship with Iran; they will have to refrain from their relationship with the (Shitic) Hisbollah movement; they will have to refrain from the constant support they grant to the terrorism of the (Shitic) Hamas movement, the terrorist network of Al-Khaida and the Jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq, "the Prime Minister put forward concrete proposals.
Questions about the accident: Are stewards on the bus illegal?
The law doesn't know them, in a distance bus the walk is not allowed
In connection with the tragic accident of a bus of the Student Agency in the vicinity of the Italian Padua, the question arises whether stewards and travellers can walk along the bus during the journey.
"If we wanted to comply strictly and formally with the law, the activity of a steward is contrary to the law on road transport," said the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
The accident, which killed a twenty-two-year-old stewardess last week, was probably caused by the driver of the truck who crossed the bus.
The young woman sat at this moment for all the misfortune next to the driver, on the least safe place in the car, although she had two more seats available.
However, a bus can also have an accident or slow down sharply at the moment where the Steward offers coffee or newspapers.
It also plays a role whether the bus is equipped with standing seats for the vehicle letter.
If this is not planned on the bus, the travellers must sit.
Student Agency's long-distance buses have no standing places, which the director of the company, Radim Jančura, confirmed against Aktuálně.cz.
"We discussed this with the Ministry, and this did not first agree to the movement of travellers.
Later, this was withdrawn, and we reached a consensus that travellers may go to the toilet during the ride, if they have their seat, "he announced his position.
The law doesn't know any Steward
"There is no clear legal interpretation for the role of a steward - no legislation describes this role.
However, there is no legal provision which prohibits the carrier from providing services.
The law on road transport only knows the concept of vehicle companions, but its rights and obligations are not defined, "the spokesman of the Ministry of Hanzelka clearly adds.
On the other hand, the director of the Road Vehicles Department of the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorný, believes that the law covers this problem retroactively.
"It is important whether the bus also has standing spaces in the product authorisation.
That is all, "he emphasises.
Buses are divided into urban buses, where there are standing places and the maximum speed is limited, bus buses with standing places and a higher allowed speed and distance bus without standing spaces with the highest permissible speed and seats equipped with safety belts.
As in the plane, the expert says
The BESIP Traffic Safety Expert Jaroslav Hořín sees no fundamental problem in the movement of stewards on board a bus.
"In the case of a liquid mode, the situation is similar to the service on board an aeroplane.
Even here is not sure when turbulence comes, and the stewardess can hit his head. "
"However, if a bus brakes sharp, then naturally the laws of physics apply.
Just like in the city bus or a tram.
The safety of the stewards must be clarified by means of internal rules, "he says and also believes that this issue is not fully solved from the point of view of the law.
Jančura is ready to delete the services
Student Agency is the only bus company that offers services to Stewards.
The company employs about two hundred people in this function.
The Director does not consider its profession to be risky even after the accident.
"But as soon as I get the impression that the job of the steward is risky, I will delete it.
Coffee and newspapers can be received by travellers on arrival.
That would also reduce costs, "he says.
As an interest in security, the director of Asiana Alexej Litvin is founded on the lack of Stewards in his bus. However, his company operates only a fraction of lines compared to Student Agency.
"We have no stewardess, but we have been fighting from the beginning.
Sooner or later, this ends with some fatal accident, "he had not spoken for Týden.cz quite a year ago.
That was an incredible tragedy.
A young stewardess from the region of Pilsen, who had worked for society for two years, was injured in the accident of a bus to Naples.
The Slovenian truck was probably turned off without blinking off the front strip and had blocked the bus's ride.
The driver of the bus tried to avoid a sharp maneuver, but collided with the right front part with the truck.
Jančura argues that the two seats had been sold for the stewards.
"These places cannot be reserved for remote connections, they are blocked."
Company wants to sue truck drivers.
With compensation for the young woman's family, the Agency will not wait for the court judgment, but also expects a financial compensation from the guilty.
A change of law?
Not in sight
A more precise regulation of the movement of stewards on board a bus could bring to a legal regime which is already working on a thirty-headed team of experts from the Ministry of Transport for over a year.
"However, this has not yet reached a concrete conclusion.
Busses are also not necessarily on the agenda, rather the point system, the maximum speed on the motorway and the use of mobile phones during the journey, "says Fachmann Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of the stewards to be something that could significantly jeopardise the safety of travellers," Hanzelka said, with the control of the safety of buses in the competence of the police and the labour protection authorities.
Düsseldorf hopes rest on Frankfurt
In large words, the letter of the WestLB Board to the staff of the House does not lack.
By merging units of the Düsseldorf money institution with the Frankfurter Deka Bank, "the central capital market house of the savings bank financial group" could be created, it is stated in the letter published on Monday.
WestLB introduced a "competence block" with sustainable profitability into such a business.
And at all, such a link could be the decisive starting point for further alliances in the national banking sector.
This is how it reads when a board wants to demonstrate its ability to act in a difficult time.
Because WestLB is still under enormous pressure.
Not only by the European Commission, but also by the Federal Institute of Financial Services Supervision, which has recently been clarified by the North Rhine-Westphalian Government, pressing time to find a future solution.
As always, a link between the Deca-Bank, which is familiar with savings bank customers because of their investment funds, and WestLB has been talking for some time - also on the Frankfurter side.
Although Deca-Bank-Chef Franz Waas has informed in the submission of the six-year figures at the end of August, in a merger of the house on the Mainzer Landstraße with a Landesbank, such as Helaba or WestLB, he sees no sense.
However, the Board of Directors of the Deca, which is each held by the Landesbanken and the Sparkassenverbände, has instructed the Board of Directors to hold discussions with WestLB on joint business activities.
It could be the capital market business or parts of it.
The conversations have just begun, so it's called at the financial place.
Deca-Bank, with its 3000 employees among the more important employers at the Frankfurt financial square, is not the first time talking about consolidation in the savings bank sector.
In 2003, it looked like the deca bank could merge with the Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba.
However, nothing came from this threesome.
The plan had hardly become public, the Hessische Landesregierung opposed Helaba's participation in it.
The other two houses didn't come together.
The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz went instead to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
But there have always been ideas about a connection between Deka Bank and Landesbanken.
Last but not least, Günther Merl, President of the Helaba Board, had expressed his opposition to plan games about meeting with his house.
However, regardless of this, it seems to be mature to realise that a collapse of the different public sector houses is in need.
After the Landtag election in Bavaria is over, BayernLB could first connect with the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg.
For the Helaba, this is not necessarily a good news.
If the pressure rises to further mergers, she goes on and on to the partners.
In the south, she would be more junior partners, although she has so far passed the financial crisis much better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
A meeting with West LB in turn, the Sparkassen- und Giroverband Hessen-Thüringen, which is involved with 85 percent of the Helaba, has set a line at the beginning of the year.
In any case, the Nord LB.
However, such geostrategic considerations are only one side.
On the other hand, the question is how the different business models of the individual houses fit together.
In June, Merl expressed the decisive question of the business model to ensure the future of the Landesbanken, which had not yet been answered by the Deutsche Sparkassen- und Giroverband.
In the end there could also be a dismantling of the West LB, although it is not self-evident there.
In the letter of the board of directors there, it is also mentioned that a "overall solution" for the House is in any case sought.
As this can be done with the merging of individual units with the deca bank, it will still be shown.
The second Week End is known as "Italian Week End"
For Elena it's the first, for Luca already the third or fourth time.
But this time, Elena is with us as his girlfriend, and he says everything is different.
Behind them, at the five-litre beer barrel of the emperor brand, stands a massive built bear and proves to the approximately 200 octoberfest travelers, which deep tones can produce his throat.
Elena's gonna give Luca a punch, then a kiss.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here, the bus park next to Puorta Nuova train station, four buses start this evening at 23.45, "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra," expected arrival at 6.30.
Three buses are reserved mainly for the Italians, and only Brazilians travel on a bus.
In a corner of the parking lot the South Americans already sing next to their flag, they celebrated already in the night.
And so loud, Marco Guarda says it's nothing for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with fur food and glasses with wide silver irons, belongs to the buses.
For five years they've been going to the Oktoberfest, three tours alone this year.
Night, day-to-day on the Wiesn, back at 10: 30.
Overnight stay would only mean unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
75 Euros cost the trip, the welcome drink with emperor beer, a faithful to the Bavarian purity bid, the health insurance and the German-speaking tour guide - Marco has visited a language course in Frankfurt - including.
And already the buses roll into the night, on the Autostrada direction "Brennero."
There's no beer, not yet.
Soon it will be quiet on the bus, the travelers will sleep.
All right, they're gonna need their powers.
In Brixen and in wooden churches, where also some other buses with Italian badges on the motorway 8 will take another break just before Munich.
Finally, when Marcos group arrives at the parking lot near the Theresienwiese at half-seven in the early morning, there are already 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others are gathering, Marco is holding a final speech, explaining the attack plan.
First, put on the yellow cap.
On that there is left "Oktoberfest," in fracture, next to the Internet address of Marcos travel agency: "conoscersiviaggiando.it."
Second, "When the doors go up to the beer tent, it's running!" Marco calls in the morning.
"Run!" Run and occupy the seats in the rear part of the tent.
"Not in front, or we will block, and not all yellow mouths on the same benches, in space!"
The measure, crying Marco, cost 8.25 euros.
And don't forget drinking money.
"The security officers show that we're doing well!
As soon as you leave, they will be gone! "
Thirdly, "Tonight find point half eleven again here!" understood?
And it's going to the Wiesn.
On the way, a yellow cape binds to the trees, signs and even to the electoral poster of a large Bavarian People's Party.
You want to be armed for the retreat.
It is the second Weekly End known as "Italian Weekly End."
There are no precise figures; there are 50 000 people on the way through the Alps and entering the beer cents, 10% of all visitors should have travelled extra from Italy this weekend.
The Munich police are strengthened by seven South Tyrol police officers, and Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which holds a national statistics in which the Italians in front of British (about 60 operations) and Austrian (about 80) with about 200 medical services are the first place.
The courtyard is particularly popular with Italians.
Sleepless nights for creditors of the Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system was relatively stable, Bundesfinanzminister Peer Steinbrück emphasised only in the past week.
How good that the politician used the word "relative" and also influenced the fact that the German banking sector was not spared from crisis developments.
Because it came in the weekend now.
The Munich real-estate financier Hypo Real Estate (HRE) listed in Dax receives a billion credit from a German bank consortium to protect itself from the turbulence in the markets.
A person familiar with the situation said Reuters on Monday that the loan aid amounted to up to 35 billion euros.
The Hypo Real Estate had only to make a profit on the part that it also took advantage of.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
Background is loss with the daughter Depfa.
According to a newspaper report on long-term projects for which he has provided money, the State financier had refunded itself extremely in the short term - which is no longer possible due to the distrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's cash reserve had decreased by 95 percent to 2.37 million euros, and the equity ratio had also fallen slightly from 1.6% to 1.45%.
Current revenues and net revenues from financial transactions had fallen to zero compared to the previous year, the revenues from subscriptions to claims and certain securities and the dissolution of reserves in the credit business decreased by more than 70 per cent to EUR 5 million.
Only thanks to higher revenues from recoveries of downstream settlement costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa Group as well as from the reimbursement of interest according to the tax regime and from the business provision for group companies, the yield reduction was still moderate by around 16 per cent.
After its privatisation in 1990, the former State financier initially speculated on commercial real estate credits that had then been distributed to Aareal Bank.
Since there was too little money in classical state financing, the Depfa had then strengthened its involvement in infrastructure projects and in the financing of Community projects of private investors and the State (private public partnership, PPP) and internationally diversified.
On the value of the daughter, Hypo Real Estate must now make depreciation which will have a "significant material effect" on the group's profit and loss account, it is quite undetermined.
The fact is that the dividend has been deleted.
It had already been reduced by two thirds for 2007.
Hypo Real Estate has been a major State and infrastructure financier since the Depfa acquisition.
It is more dependent than other institutions on refinancing on the interbank market as it has no customer deposits.
With the collapse of the American Investment Bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the lending among the banks has been largely defeated as the banks are holding their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs a part - about 50 billion euros - of the Depfa's short-term credit portfolio for refinancing annually.
According to Hypo Real Estate's announcement, the group's financing needs are covered by the loan at foreseeable time and the company is "shielded from the influence of the currently largely ineffective international money markets."
From other sources, it is said that thanks to the funds, the refinancing was secured by the end of 2009.
The HRE Chairman Georg Funke stated, on the other hand, that the Hypo Real Estate Group would no longer have to take advantage of the money markets at the foreseeable time.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Institute for Financial Services Supervision (BaFin) are assuming that the market capacity of Hypo Real Estate Group is now secured.
This is for shareholders and creditors of the bank to hope.
But given the dynamics and uncertainties of the crisis, there is no certainty.
It is not even unthinkable that funding should not be fully used.
But the opposite is not to wear out.
After the late Sunday evening of the meeting to the bank was still before the bankruptcy, the at least provisional rescue could not calm the minds.
The share rate breaks down by 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
On the other hand, the borrowing rates are quite good.
If the priority debt is barely moving, the rates of rebate bonds are more clearly adhered to.
These are mainly the bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and, understandably, the maturity beyond 2009.
Sounds of hypothetical real-estate bonds earlier a speculative investment alternative, their value must be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system after the sharpening of the banking crisis and the institution itself, which had first taken over the Depfa.
As long as the NCBs, governments and less affected commercial banks are still ready to support the system, it can be assumed that pensions are refunded in a timely manner.
Or, however, what is currently barely expected to happen is that the financial crisis will be overcome over the next 15 months.
However, in view of the reports which are overwhelming with the sub-nationalisation, the likelihood of security has now become only a legitimate hope.
This should mainly prepare long-term creditors some sleepless nights with the decision whether to separate themselves from their commitments.
Short-term investors may nevertheless use a final sentence to make a statement of losses for future deduction tax payments on exchange profits later years.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento Box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, is supposed to introduce herself to the Tachibana High School on the first day of school, the girls start to cuddle: The Germans are totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from Mangas - in the new exchange log she tells about Japan.
"The first school day in Japan.
I was excited.
I had bammel before school.
I live on the edge of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and drive the train to Tachibana High School for 40 minutes.
I had to find the way alone. Fortunately, I haven't lost my way.
The beginning of teaching seems not as strict at the Tachibana as at our home in Lower Saxony.
The students enter from 8 o'clock until 20 o'clock before 9 o'clock a short round of meetings with the teacher, the 'home room'.
But before the class started, I was about to introduce myself.
I'm not even the guy who likes to talk to people, even a class of 40 pupils.
Because I haven't had a school uniform yet, I've put on an old skirt of my host mother, including blouse, blue knees and black leather shoes.
So in this elevator I stood in front of the pult and tried to say everything right: 'Sayonara Where she Sylvana...' - my name is Sylvana, come from Germany and have a week's birthday.
At that moment, I was very glad that I had started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class have all cheated, cheeked and waxed and I have heard the word "Kawaii."
I knew that from my manga.
It belongs to the survival of Japanese girls and means "cute, sweet."
Then I'd be hugged to my place quickly.
The girl next to me smiled pretty wide, she thought it was an honor that the exchange student should sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was pretty quiet, but when the gong dangled, I was really disturbed.
Everyone talked confused and cliced and asked me holes in my stomach - it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
In the break, all of them packed out their Bentos.
My guest mother had made me such a lunchbox - that's something different than the noble German break bread.
I had rice with herbs, little sausage, salad made of cucumbers and algae, fruit and some kind of meat in the tofu antel.
Usually I don't know what I eat here in Japan.
Things look strange and taste completely new.
It says everything is really delicious.
Well, except for the salted plums, maybe, brrrr!
The Bentos are not just lunch at Japanese schools.
It sometimes happens that a girl gives a boy a self-prepared bento, which she then makes especially artificially - in the hope to get to know the boy closer to the pause.
That's what I read in my Manga comics.
I'm excited if I can watch this, too.
"Why Japan?" my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to Tokyo for a year.
I always said:
"Because it fascinates me."
After all, I've been reading manga's for years.
And in order to understand the comics and the culture in it, I started to learn a little Japanese.
So for me, it was quite clear that I had to travel here sometime.
Because I also have a faible for tradition, sitting and customs.
And you put great value on them here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is rigorous, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I haven't felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen. "
Also rats have feelings
A rat or a sheep flies at risk means that she also feels fear?
Neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced: many animals also have feelings.
Only how can you check if they feel the same thing if they act like us?
In the Internet magazine "Edge," contributions from famous scientists have been published for several years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents selected answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other conditions of consciousness without me or anyone else being able to prove this so far where we cannot even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case we must at least hope that all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, as soon as we turn to other species and cut questions of sensation or generally of consciousness, we enter imbalances because the hardware is not consistent.
When a rat is in danger, she does the same thing as many other animals: she stands dead, escapes or attacks.
People are acting alike, from which some scientists rely on comparable subjective experiences.
I do not believe in that, however.
Two aspects of brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to that of animals.
On the one hand, the almost always associated circuits with human consciousness include the prefrontal cortex (due to its participation in the short-term memory and the execution / control functions).
This broad region is much more developed in humans than in the other primates and seems to be completely missing in other creatures.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal Cortex, including the knowledge of who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is reason to assume that man is even different from the other primate.
Another dramatic characteristic should lie in the linguistic nature of man: since such a large part of his experience is linked to language, it often says that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if consciousness does not depend on language, it would certainly affect it so that animal consciousness, as it may be, probably very much differs from most of our consciousness states.
Therefore, it is difficult to determine how consciousness may look in other animals.
If it can be analyzed, as something internal and subjective, neither measure nor, because of the special hardware, on the basis of our own experience, his research presents us with major problems.
Most of my speeches refer to the content of conscious experience, but there is also another aspect of consciousness which is likely to be more easily accessible in science.
One could investigate the consciousness processes of animals without regard to their content, and that is exactly what happens in studies on the short-term memory of primates, especially in the example of visualization.
But in this approach, which Christof Koch and Francis Crick followed, one rather relates to the neural correlation of consciousness than to the causal mechanisms: both may be identical or not.
Interestingly, this approach also underlines the importance of the pre-frontal Cortex for the emergence of visualisation.
Now what is the result of the feelings?
I refer them back to the fact that an emotional system like that of fear is activated in a brain conscious of its own activity.
So what we call "fear" is the mental condition in which we are in when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, like physical reactions) demonstrates working memory.
In this way, feelings are closely linked to the regions of the Cortex, which distinguish primates and in particular people.
Associated with linguistic nature there are fine degrees of sensation, because with the help of words and grammar we can differentiate and categorize conditions to attribute them to others alongside ourselves.
On the other hand, Antonio Damasio believes that sensations from more primitive activities in the cortex and brain strain are similar to Jaak Pankseep, which is more focused on the brain strain.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it could certainly be involved in cross-genital sensations.
In theory, I cannot contradict it, but I think it is unclear.
Pankseep argues what appears in rats and people such as fear, probably also feels like this in both cases: how can one verify whether rats and people feel the same thing when they act alike?
A sheep escapes in danger if she also feels fear?
In my eyes, just behavioural behaviour cannot prove livelihood.
Although the neural comparison continues to help: rats and humans have similar brain strains, sheep not even a brain.
But is the brain strain responsible for feelings?
And even if you could prove this to people, how did you want to prove it to rats?
I think rats and other mammals, perhaps even sheep (who knows?), have feelings.
But I don't know how to prove that.
And because their feelings are probably fundamentally different from ours (as human consciousness is based on specific circuits and language), I prefer to explore emotional behaviour rather than the emotional feelings of rats.
In any case, progress at the neural level is triggering, provided that the same thing is measured in rats and humans.
How I do not explore language and consciousness in rats, if not feelings, I do not know if they exist.
You may think this is short-sighted, but I prefer to move forward than running constantly against a wall.
I'm just a practical emotionalist.
Uefa President Platini: grace deadline for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik said that the preparations will soon be placed under the direct responsibility of President and Prime Minister.
"The government sees Uefa's decision in Bordeaux as a proof of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organise the EM together with Poland," said Wasjunik.
"But this is not amnesty for our country.
Work has just begun and there is still much to do in both countries. "
In the timetable for the construction or conversion of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, the two hosts are following.
Perhaps even the number of EM stages is reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste time anymore.
We must now work at maximum speed, "said Ukrainian federal President Grigorij Surkis.
"The UEFA will keep an eye on us all the time."
An even more radical step was decided in Poland.
According to numerous scandals, the leadership of the Polish PZPN Association has been suspended by the National Olympic Committee and replaced by the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission had met at the request of Sports Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is "the serious danger that the PZPN is unable to act according to the rules," said Drzewiecki of the Polish news agency PAP.
"We have assured Uefa President Michel Platini in a letter that the preparation for the EM 2012 will not suffer."
Several first ligists had been convicted only in the last season because of manipulation, and finally even the Ligastart had to be postponed in the short term.
Reverend Dennis Quaid beats back
She wanted to promote a new movie, talk about privates - and now has trouble with the ex: Hollywood-Star Meg Ryan outed her fierce Dennis Quaid as a marrier.
He's ashamed - and he's beating back.
Late Rosenkrieg at the ex-couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors now have an unpleasant dispute - in all public.
Meg Ryan had said in an interview with the US magazine InStyle last week for the first time on the reasons for the failure of marriage: "Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, and that was very painful."
The extent of the fraud did not reveal them until after the divorce.
The reason for the soul striptease was Ryan's press work for her new film "The Women" - the story of a marriage break is told.
Dennis Quaids's response to his outing as an unfaithful husband was clear: "Monstrous" is it, the 54-year-old of the "New York Daily News" said that "Meg repeatedly returns and seals the history of our relationship."
It is also "regrettable" that the 16-year-old son Jack again "is" publicly reminded of the pain and restoration that means divorce for each child. "
While Ryan has lived alone since the divorce, Quaid is remarried and recently became a father of twins.
And so close his admissions with the silence: "My life is going on.
I appreciate the happiness that I have a wonderful family that is doing well. "
Prices for flight tickets and hotels fall
In the first half of 2008 flights and nights were cheaper in Europe than in the previous year.
According to a recent study in Germany, flights have even become up to 50 per cent cheaper.
Flights and nights in hotels have become cheaper again - this is the result of a study by the American Express travel and financial service provider.
The company analysed its accounting data from the first half of 2008 and found a significant fall in the second quarter following an increase in prices in the first quarter.
After the prices on the hotel market have been rising for years, the nights have already been approved in many places.
From January to March, prices rose by an average of 6.9 per cent compared to 2007 in 41 out of 48 European cities studied.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 per cent lower than in the previous year.
The most obvious trend had been in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than one year ago.
As a reason for this American Express sees the weak dollar course that led to a "decreasing travel loss of American tourists."
Moreover, financial sites such as Frankfurt or London are more affected by the fall in hotel prices than industrial sites such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, the hotel prices even hold the record in Europe with an increase of 26.3 per cent.
The trend in the first quarter also showed up:
Due to the Kerosin depreciation, travellers in the economy class had to pay on average 7.1 percent more than in 2007, fuel intensive long-distance flights even got up to 29.2 percent more expensive.
From April to June, prices for economic air tickets fell by 12.5 per cent on average compared to the previous quarter, but in the business and first class the price changes were much lower.
In Germany, prices fell even more than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices had increased by 11.9 per cent, and in the second quarter they fell by 23.6 per cent.
According to the study, German domestic flights have even halved prices.
The reason for the collapse of prices is, on the one hand, the declining economic growth, the company explains.
The demand in many segments of the air travel market brockels.
On the other hand, the open sky agreement liberalising air traffic between the United States and Europe increases competition.
Signs of the tense situation are the removal of unprofitable routes at airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that had declared bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - 24 airlines alone in Europe.
HSV hits Gladbach 1: 0
With a gate and simple methods, the Hamburg SV table guide becomes.
At the Borussia, Luhukay continues to fail to find a working eleven.
By Kristoffer Klein enlarge breaklanding for National Players Marko Marin.
The Gladbacher came into play late and failed with a lifter to the latte.
His message was precise, she was persuasive about his lips.
He just knew he was right.
"We need the second gate," said Hermann Rieger in the Cabinet of the Hamburger Arena.
Much was not done in the catacombs, the half-time break had ended and most of them sat back on their seats.
Rieger was almost three decades of physiotherapist of the HSV, he enjoys a higher reputation than some disguised actor.
And so his request was also heard in a responsible place.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nicked and lifted his thumbs with approval.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg's chief trainer Martin Jol.
His order will have been similar: Here with gate two!
Implementation was abstained.
"There wasn't everything to look at today," Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhardt too would have wanted it "more relaxed."
The 1: 0 (1: 0) Hamburger have been thanks to the headball hit of Mladen Petric (11.); and the fact that very weak Gladbacher could not hurt the weak hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," Martin Jol merged.
The Hamburg SV will be 121 years old on Monday.
The spectators celebrated themselves on Saturday afternoon, the blue sky over the arena and the lightning table on the video wave, which identified their association as a class prime.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to arrange this," said Marcell Jansen.
He realizes that the tabular intermediate product is more unpredictable than the dominance of his HSV.
The team with its late-bound access - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the TorProtector Petric, as well as the Jansen recruited by FC Bavaria - is not able to shine yet.
"We need more flair and more dribblings," asked Jol.
After the abstention of the vote
There's fear on Wall Street.
First news of the failure of the rescue package allowed Dow Jones to break in at times by 700 points.
That was the biggest point loss within a day in his history.
Later, the Dow caught something again.
At 20: 30 the world's most important barometer recorded at 10.579 counters with a minus of five percent.
The Nasdaq Technology Exchange was less than seven per cent at 1548 points.
The largest loser was at that time in the Dow American Express, which borrowed nearly 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of about 12 percent.
No title could be won.
The shares of the bank Goldman Sachs gave up by almost ten percent.
Only a few days ago, Large Investor Warren Buffett had participated in the company.
The rescue plan is intended to provide funds for the purchase of so-called lazy mortgage papers.
However, the sum should not be paid on one stroke but progressively.
In return, the State should receive stock-exchange notes from financial corporations that could be redeemed in the event of the appropriate exchange rate development in order to reduce the burden on the state fund.

Dark matter influences flight of space songs
For years a mysterious phenomenon in research has led to counseling: Dark matter influences the speed of space songs during so-called swing-by manoeuvre.
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity Albert Einstein could not be quite right.
Almost 18 years the space probe "Ulysses" flew through space.
Because of freezing fuel pipes soon, you are now threatening the cold.
Among scientists, a mysterious phenomenon has been causing confusion for years - the Swing-by anomaly.
The Swing-by is a flight manoeuvre of space songs in which they receive additional momentum in the gravity field of a sky body, such as the earth.
This allows the songs to save a lot of fuel.
The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the Sun's probe Ulysses.
However, what the researchers have wondered about for years: the missiles do not behave 100% as expected by the old gravitational law.
Instead, there are irregularities at speed.
The songs become unexpected faster or slower.
So far, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
They baptized him Swing by anomaly.
Some experts fear that even Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, which describes the attractiveness of matter by a curvature of space, might not be quite right.
The American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study from Princeton still firmly believes that Einstein did not wrong, and tries to explain the Swing-by anomaly by means of the so-called dark matter that astronomers have made up in the universe.
"Responsible for the anomaly could be dark matter that could also be very close to the earth," he writes.
Space researchers have only known about the existence of the dark matter for about ten years.
It obviously assumes a attraction whose effect on other celestial bodies can be observed.
On the other hand, it itself is completely invisible, that is, it sends and reflects no electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to the calculations of the scientists, the dark matter accounts for a fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, the tourists who were dragged into Egypt should be free again, as the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed.
The kidnappers from Sudan had requested several million euro ransom.
In the event of a shooting before the release, six hostages were supposed to have been killed.
In the south of Egypt, five Germans were kidnapped.
Solvency money negotiations are already under way.
Germans always get into the sight of kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
The European tourists who are dragged away in the Sahara seem to be free.
This reported the Egyptian state television, the Arab TV station Al-Arabija and Italian media consistent.
The Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release according to reports from the Italian TV station Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been released.
We are checking their health status, "said Frattini.
The five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian as well as their eight Egyptian companions were well and safe, the Egyptian state television reported.
The 19 participants of a desert expedition should already be on their way to Cairo.
The background of a shooting before the release of the hostages remains unclear: according to an Egyptian security officer, the kidnappers had been ready to end the kidnapping before the Sudanese army was surprised to kill six of the kidnappers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed to a ransom, "said the official.
It was "only about taking the hostages in reception," when suddenly "this surprise" came.
Sudanese soldiers had shot six of the kidnappers on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt and arrested two of them.
The hostages had requested a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money should be transferred by the German wife to one of the hostages.
The daily newspaper "El Masri El Jom" reported, calling for a German mediator, delaying the release of hostages because the kidnappers feared their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers want to release the female hostages after payment of the ransom.
The men should be arrested until the kidnappers have a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo rejected an opinion on the report.
Abuse of the stepfather "led to suicide"
The many years of abuse by her stepfather has led a woman to kill himself, has been reported to a court.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians, Cornwall, received a six-year prison sentence after having confessed to eight cases of sexual abuse.
The Tribunal in Truro learned that he regularly tied his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle as she was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession, "I feel responsible for her death."
The court found that Mrs Randle killed herself in her house in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007 at the age of 34.
When she was a child in Coventry, Trerise had tied her up and tied her eyes before performing sexual acts, while her mother was gone to work in a hostel.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s and he moved back to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, the court found that Mrs Randle, who worked a large part of her time voluntarily for the National Trust, was persecuted by abuse that had been committed to her twice a week.
Attorney Ramsay Quaife told the court that friends had said that Ms. Randle, who had been an eager surfer and cyclist, had been "emotionally dead" since 2006 and "abandoned her life"
In April 2007, her real father Terrance Randle found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
It is assumed that she killed herself by choking herself with a plastic bag.
Mr Randle confronted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a confession letter that ended like this: "I used to tie her up and tie her eyes."
"I didn't make her sexually.
I feel responsible for her death. "
Judge Christopher Elwen said to tears: "They are an extremely strange fetisher and for her victim it must have been frightening, especially since she was only seven.
This unhappy story ends with the victim's suicide.
Worse is the fact that it is very unlikely that the case would have ended in court if it hadn't done so. "
He added: "I take note of the effects, according to the description of Stephanie's father and mother, on her daughter over the years.
Otherwise, she would have been clearly a promising, successful and happy young woman. "
Officials responsible for lost data are accused
The BBC has learned that the cabinet officer who had lost strictly confidential documents in a train in June will be accused in accordance with the "Public Security Act."
The man was seconded by the Ministry of Defence when he lost two extremely confidential documents in a train to Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
It is the weakest prosecution within the law and there is no indication of criminal intention.
BBC defense correspondent Frank Gardner said the action was a surprise for many in Whitehall.
He said, "You would have thought that this would be dealt with internally by the Ministry of Defence and the Cabinet."
The staff member whose name cannot be mentioned shall be accused in accordance with paragraph 8.1 of the Law, the clause dealing with the safe storage of information.
The Royal Public Prosecutor recommended that the official be charged by the Metropolitan Police for the most sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Secret Service Committee.
The documents he submitted contained classified assessments on Al-Quaida and the capacities of the Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was taken from his house to a secret place.
Housing companies look at B & B costs
British housing companies could be in the house after rescuing Bradford and Bingley Bank costs of more than £80 million.
The government provided £14 billion to protect the deposits of Bradford & Bingley's 2.6 million customers.
The interest on this loan is paid by all companies that receive money from investors, including the 59 construction companies
The Director-General of the Association of Housing Construction Companies (BSA), Adrian Coles, said it was "intolerable" that companies and their members would have to pay.
The 14 billion loan will ultimately be repaid when Bradford & Bingley's loans have been withdrawn.
But the interest accrued in the meantime will be counted each year on the 700 financial companies that take on deposits.
The financial compensation programme, compared to the BBC, confirmed that the 59 housing companies were included in this number.
It is bitter that those institutions that have been cautious are now called on to take on some of the costs of those institutions that were far less cautious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It said that each company would have to pay in relation to the deposits it would hold and that companies would have to pay around 18% of the costs together.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that interest on the loan will be GBP 450 million in 2009.
This means that companies must obtain £81 million for the interest of the first year.
Adrian Coles, the Director-General of the Association of Housing Construction companies, informed the BBC that he thought this was unfair.
It is bitter that those institutions that have been cautious during the real estate recovery are now called upon to bear some of the costs of those institutions that were far less cautious.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since the existence of the records in 1945.
"We will observe all aspects of this matter over the next few weeks to see what alternatives there are to protect housing companies and their members from potentially significant costs."
Interest due in 2009 shall cover the seven months from the end of September of this year until the end of March.
In 2010 interest will be due for a full year and that could be almost twice as much.
Since construction companies are two-sided organisations without shareholders, their members will have to pay for the costs either by higher fees or lower interest on savings accounts.
Milk gets five pence per litre more expensive
The people on Jersey are faced with having to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that it will raise the wholesale price of its milk by another five pence per litre from Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two-pence increase in February, and comes after investigations have been carried out by an advisory company.
Retailers should decide themselves whether they want to pass the price increase on to their customers.
Before the increase in prices in February, the wholesale price of Jersey milk was last changed in 2002.
Former Prime Minister of Bangladesh is denied bail
A court in Bangladesh has rejected a warrant from former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, which means that she could be arrested if she returns to the country.
Their defenders said that the court refused to have blackmailed bail on the charge of 50 million Taka ($729.700) by a businessman while she was a prime minister.
The case is one of several violent charges for corruption against them.
Sheikh Hasina's long political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released from deposit at the beginning of this month.
Sheikh Hasina should return to Bangladesh in the coming weeks, but her party, the Awami Alliance, demanded that the military-based transitional government first give her full freedom.
The correspondents say that, although their detention was granted to go abroad for medical treatment, it is not clear as part of their release whether they will be able to remain on free foot if they return to Bangladesh.
Their lawyers state that they will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court has rejected Sheikh Hasinas' warrant because it says that she does not have to receive a deposit, as she is already on detention abroad to be treated abroad," said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
We will file a complaint against the Supreme Court. "
Their lawyers claim that they need a deposit to return from abroad to the country to prepare themselves for the December elections.
It is expected that Sheikh Hasina will return home after October 17th, said an Awami Alliance party chairman on Sunday.
She was imprisoned last year after the army-supported transitional government had taken over the power, but had been released from prison in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all charges against themselves.
Fears of the Anti-Polio Initiative in Afghanistan
In the recent anti-police initiative in Afghanistan, almost 200 000 children have not been vaccinated because of violence linked to the Taliban, according to the United Nations.
The United Nations carried out a vaccination programme last week in six provinces.
However, they could not reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
According to a UN spokesman, this was the case despite the Taliban's promise not to attack or impede thousands of vaccinating personnel.
BskyB is losing action in the case of ITV
BskyB has lost its action against the decision of the Competition Commission to reduce its share of the competing ITV station.
The Competition Court has ordered BskyB to reduce its participation in ITV from 17.9% to below 7.5%.
The Commission had previously argued that the share of BskyB's distorts competition and allowed it to have an unfair influence on the ITV broadcast.
BskyB acquired its share in 2006 by successfully preventing NTL from buying ITV, now renamed Virgin Media.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported that BskyB had doubts about the independence of ITV to purchase the share of ITV, which led the Competition Commission to launch an investigation.
The Virgin Boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the Communication Office Ofcom voted against the purchase.
BskyB argued that the pressure to reduce its share of ITV was an inappropriate and excessive measure, in particular because BSkyB had announced that it would abandon its voting rights.
New investigation in the US Public Prosecutor's affair
The U.S. Attorney General has instructed a special investigator to deal with the dismissal of the nine US prosecutors in 2006.
The occasion was a report by the General Inspector of the Ministry of Justice, in which the actions of the administrative staff were criticized.
The report criticized the officials of the White House, legislators and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was driven by the fears that the lawyers had been suspended for political reasons.
The specialized investigator, Nora Dannehy, is now asked to clarify whether the officials questioned during the investigation have lied to the investigators in order to obstruct justice.
Serious allegations including criminal actions have not been fully investigated or clarified, said General Inspector Glenn Fine in his report.
The appeal of a special investigator with the power to force the witnesses to testify was one of his main recommendations.
The conflict began when the Ministry of Justice withdrew nine US prosecutors from their offices in December 2006.
At that time, the Ministry argued that the prosecutors would be dismissed due to weak employment services.
However, it was later found that the dismissed prosecutors had not been judged worse than many of their colleagues, which led many observers to consider the dismissal as politically motivated.
Some of these prosecutors were involved in the prosecution of high-level Republican Congressmen, while others had refused to investigate the accusations on election fraud by the Democrats.
US prosecutors are responsible for investigating and persecuting judicial cases for the government.
They may be dismissed at any time but may not be suspended for political reasons.
The then Head of the Ministry of Justice General Attorney General Alberto Gonzales was under fire for redundancies and finally settled his office.
A number of officials of the Ministry of Justice have also quit.
In particular, the report of the Inspector General has criticised the role of Gonzales by carrying the "main responsibility" for the redundancies, abandoning his leadership and showing "extraordinarily deprived" in the process.
Other officials, including the former chief advisor of President Bush Karl Rove, were criticised for the lack of cooperation with investigators.
Meat Loaf's epic song is to be honored
The Rockstar Meat Loaf is to be honored during the music award "Q Award" for his epic hymne "Bat Out Of Hell."
The singer, who next week in London will accept his special golden prize during the ceremony, said he was honored to be recognized.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of Meat Loafs Hitalbum from 1977.
"Coldplay" introduces the nominations for the award of this year after it has come into the closer selection in four categories.
The editor of the magazine "Q Magazine" Paul Rees said that there were some songs going beyond such materials as time and genre and "Bat Out Of Hell" is certainly one of them.
The song written by Jim Steinman required a strong voice delivered by Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental part that takes almost two minutes.
The song was released as a single in the United Kingdom in 1979 and has reached place 15 in the charts.
However, Meat Loafs "Bat Out Of Hell" spent about nine years in the charts and sold more than 40 million times worldwide.
Meat Loaf, whose true name is Marvin Lee Aday, has suffered from serious health problems in recent years. One of them was an operation in 2003 because of irregular heartbeat after he collapsed on stage.
In 2007 he had to cancel concerts due to an acute throat inflammation.
Later it became known that he had a cyst on his vocal band.
Obskure street in town, often forgotten and possibly to sell soon
New York City has thousands of main roads, only, side roads and other surroundings, some of which are famous and others are just comfortable.
Nevertheless, it is even difficult for experienced taxi drivers and long-standing locals to say where Extra Place is, simply because most have never heard of it.
This tiny road is located in the East Village and runs from First Street to the north between Bowery and Second Avenue, without reaching Second Street.
It is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and looks more like a dusty alley than an active transit road.
There are no street signs either.
It is practically impossible to find them on a standard road plan.
This road still has its admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, a construction company that recently built luxurious buildings on First Street.
It wants to replaster Extra Place to create a clean passage to the shops and boutiques that are expected in the new buildings.
Among the other worshippers is the long-standing neighborhood, who says it is fascinated by the short alley simply because it is one of the remnants of the past of the house block.
However, the city administration department, which is responsible for the protection and construction of the residential buildings and is responsible for the road, has no interest in obtaining them.
During a meeting of the Committee on Land Use of the Municipality Council this month, representatives of the city administration and Avalon Bay have drawn up a proposal for the purchase of the road by the construction company.
Nevertheless, the committee preferred the road to remain in the hands of the city, and asked for a new plan to be presented next month, according to Susan Stetzer, the county responsible in the council 3.
"Only very little space has remained in the city's possession and we want Extra Place to continue to belong to the city," she said.
"There could be offers on how to repair and operate the road, what could be done by Avalon, but we also want public access guaranteed."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that the small road should be replastered and set up seats that are intended, among other things, for a café to which the company wants to rent space.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was made public for the first time during the meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, a speaker from Avalon Bay, said that although the company wanted to use the road, it did not necessarily own it.
"The main concern of Avalon Bay is to renovate this decayed alley and make it a public meeting point," she said and added that the city had proposed the sale itself.
Seth Donlin, spokesman of the Department of Building Protection, said it was actually the city's wish to sell the street and stressed that the task of the department was rather to develop the real estate than to manage.
Compared to its colorful neighborhood The Bowery, Extra Place has maintained some of its historical impression.
Some believe that the road has received its name in 1802, when a large farm belonging to Philip Minthorne was divided between its numerous children and a narrow stripe country was not claimed by anyone.
The back door of the music club CBGB, the puncture monument that was closed in 2006, opened to the Extra Place and the street is probably most known as the scenes for the photo on the cover of Ramones's album "Rocket to Russia."
The patch was great, said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones who had taken the photo in November 1976.
The road was full of scrap, lumps and parts of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes.
Some residents, including the bloggers who write about the gentrification of the East Village, have rejected the idea of the sale of Extra Place, arguing that this public property, as modest as it is, should remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rare - a practically unchanged split of the city that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who operates the blog called "Jeremiah's disappearing New York" (subtitled "The Book of Appeal: A bitter nostalgic view of the dying city") published a part of the conversation of the city history about Extra Place, which was published in the magazine "The New Yorker" in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote at that time: "Extra Place is a small narrow sackgasse, which remains dark even during the day and is marked by roasted metal door of the warehouses, closed windows and rainy rocks flying weekly newspapers."
With a few exceptions, the road looked just like this one night.
A rat ran through the rear part of the road, not far from the door that led earlier to the CBGB, where today there is a more expensive clothing business.
Graffiti was seen on the walls and an empty beer bottle was on the ground not far from a fresh bundle of ranked newspapers.
Some passengers said they rarely thought about Extra Place, but suggested that the road could be polished.
Fields added that, in his opinion, some people underestimate the attraction of the road in their current state.
The best years of my life, he said, were in the places that were dark, wet and disgusting.
Debate on bilingual education: Education in English-language environment
In this edition of the "Education Watch" Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of candidates for twolanguage training.
Lance T. Izumi, head scientific staff in Kalifonic studies and head director in the field of education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book "Not as good as you think: Why the middle class needs a school selection."
Admitting the Hispanic voters is a complicated task.
Barrack Obama's proposals on education are a typical example of this.
Obama's electoral campaign mentioned that "the probability of afro-American and Hispanic pupils to complete school is lower than white pupils" - which is true.
In order to close this distance of performance, Obama's training plan specifically recommends a two-language transition phase in training for those who first learn English.
However, the question to Obama is whether its commitment to twin-language training, which focuses on teaching in languages other than English, contradicts its interest in reducing the gap in school services.
Let's take as an example "Sixth Street Prep," a primary school in Eastern Los Angeles.
The majority of pupils are Hispanic and come from low-income families.
More than one third of the students, many of whom have only recently been in the country, learn English.
Nevertheless, in 2008, amazing 100 percent of the fourth grade students passed the state audit in mathematics at a good level.
Also surprisingly, 93 per cent of children from the fourth year of school were assessed as well in the English exam.
This amazing success was achieved with other methods than those preferred by Obama.
The School Sixth Street focuses on review and exercise, on constant control of knowledge and a attitude that does not tolerate exceptions.
The school also practises the approach to training in an English-language environment. That's exactly the point that Obama should take into account, according to the school leader Linda Mikels.
This approach attaches importance to the almost exclusive use of English language in technical teaching.
Mrs Mikels, who rejects the idea of two-language education, said to me that the school would have a remarkable success with a student who had only come from Mexico shortly before. 12 months later one would enter the classroom and cannot recognize it.
"It works," she noticed, "it works for us."
Would Obama take a school like the Sixth Street Prep as a model for other schools with a large proportion of Latin American and other English learning students?
The school's services would make it easy to answer this question, but the educational positions within its own party (the national imaging associations have long supported the idea of two-language training) and its own consistent support for two-language training make predictions about Obama's response uncertain.
While he agrees with the point that immigrants should learn English, he has recently trivialized the subject by noting that people should stop worrying about the "only English" legislation.
Instead, he said, "I want you to make sure your child can speak Spanish."
If Obama actually wants to close the performance gap, he should carefully take into account educational models that work rather than despise and trivialize them.
The oil price is falling due to renewed fears about the economy
On Monday, the oil price is greatly affected by the fears that even the American rescue plan for the financial markets could not be enough to revive the economy.
The crude oil terminal transactions at the New York Trade Exchange fell by 7 percent to $99.80 per barrel in the morning session.
Since last Monday, the price has dropped by more than $20.
In the last two weeks, the freight markets have been shaken by both financial turbulence on Wall Street and by strong spinal storms in the Gulf of Mexico.
After the prices had reached their peak of $145.29 per barrel in July, they fell to almost $90 per barrel this month, and then again, as a result of the enormous uncertainty in the financial markets.
On Monday, investors were again concerned, although congressmen had announced that they had agreed on a rescue plan that should be the biggest in history.
This message was overwhelmed by new concerns that the financial crisis was still far from complete.
In the last chapter of the growing crisis, according to a government communication on Monday, the Citigroup is supposed to buy up the Wachovia Corporation's banking business.
In the meantime, Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalized the European financial group Fortis.
According to analysts at Barclays Capital, despite the tense negotiations that took place this weekend and led to a rescue plan, it seems that it has not succeeded in reviving the mood on the markets.
As the economic situation continues to deteriorate, demand for goods, including oil, is expected to fall further.
Analysts of the Deutsche Bank have written in a communication to investors that forecasts for global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates have become extremely uncertain.
We believe that they will continue to write that the goods markets will also be affected.
"From the perspective of goods markets, we are most concerned about the spread of the American virus worldwide, especially to China."
The Bank's analysts have corrected their expectations of oil consumption due to weak economic growth for the next year and reduced their forecasts of oil and gas prices for 2009 by 20%.
Team record set up by series in the second quarter
Interior defender Shaun Ellis thought he'd seen everything after he ran up more than anyone else in the Jets Tricot in the last eighteen and a half years.
Then on Sunday he saw the second quarter where the Jets turned a result-free game into a triumph.
"I've never seen anything like that," said Ellis.
After a sloppy game between the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals, which matched the bad weather, the second quarter began.
However, when the quarterback Brett Favres Pass arrived at Lavernues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, it marked the perfect start on a afternoon when their evolving cooperation made a huge step forward.
Favre found Coles in this neighborhood for two more touchdowns, which one time slipped out as an outside defender and the other time 10 seconds before the end of the half-life.
"I didn't make a big effort," says Coles about the passports that went to Coles.
"He's a superplayer.
Our vote has voted, no matter what people think. "
While Favre and Coles were playing captures, the defense took quarterback Kurt Warner apart.
Outside defender Darrelle Revis took off an injured throw and turned it into a 32-yard touchdown.
Libero Erik Smith came to another passport and caught him.
Linebacker David Bowens then caused a loss of Warner.
The last ball loss, forced by Bowens, was probably the most crazy one.
The Cardinal had conquered the ball with 10 seconds left in the game when the Jets reconquered the ball and Jay Feely turned a 20 yard shot to 34 to 0 lead.
These were most of the points that the Jets had ever achieved in a quarter.
When he was asked to describe the madness, Erik Mangini, the coach of the Jets, replied "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
On the answers both, because the Jets allowed 21 points in the third quarter without achieving one, Mangini said, "Believe me, I enjoyed the second quarter more than the third.
A lot of points have been achieved in a short time. "
Heavy burning breath beats its world record
Haile Gebrselassie from Ethiopia has once again shown why some think he is the best long-distance runner ever after he broke his own record in Berlin on Sunday and became the first person who reached the distance of 42.2 kilometers in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With the victory on the flat course in 2: 03: 59, Gebrselassie improved his previous result of 2: 04: 26 by 27 seconds, which he had reached last year in Berlin.
Gebrselastie, 35, has thus established his 26th world record in his versatile career, in which he has reached at least one world championship title or set up a world record on every route from one kilometre to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassia left out the Olympic marathon in Beijing, for fear that in the aftermath, the air pollution could exacerbate its asthma problems.
Instead, he signed up for the competition in Berlin.
In almost ideal conditions - at sunset and 9 degrees at the start and 13 degrees at the target - there is an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Since the last 10 years, the record time for marathon has fallen by more than 2 minutes since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil in 1998 in Berlin with the result 2: 06: 05.
After his victory on Sunday, Gebrselassie announced to the press that he had seizures in his woods two weeks ago and therefore couldn't practice a week ago.
Obviously he refreshed after a break and came back not roasted.
"I'm so happy," he said to reporters.
"Everything went perfectly.
I started the training again a week ago and I had some concerns today, but at the end of what was great. "
He was criticized for it - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's rivals from East Africa - that he orchestrated his races overly, avoids many world best marathon stars in general, rely too much on the racing leaders, as if it were a railway race, and puts world records over the competition.
But this criticism is hardly harmful to the size of Gebrselassies as long-distance runners.
Along with four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselassie had reached the center of the route in 1: 02: 04.
Two elite operatives from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi continued to challenge burning ashes after the Tempomachers had left behind.
A little more than three miles before finish, Gebrselassie has made his last appearance to separate himself from Kwambai, who arrived second in 2: 05: 36 and thus improved his best time by almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi became third in 2: 07: 48.
In women, Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakhstan and now Germans, completed a significant year by showing the seventh fastest result of all times with 2: 19: 19.
The world record of 2: 15: 25 holds Paul Radcliff from Britain.
In the last spring, the 36-year-old Mikitenko had won the London Marathon in 2: 24: 14.
She missed the games in Beijing because of problems described as spinal injury. However, she recovered to win in Berlin and improve her best time in her third marathon by five minutes.
She sent her run by leaving a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners only, but after 30 kilometres.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia became second in 2: 21: 31, while Helena Kiprop from Kenya arrived third in 2: 25: 01.
The pride and the strain in the life of the black population, in a city of very special kind
Hidden between the eruptions of the leisure parks in the area of Orlando, a few miles away from the glittering, loud and gigantic driveway, lies a quiet city in which pride and complications of the African-American culture emerge.
Eatonville, the first completely black city in the country and the hometown of Zora Neale Hurstons, is no longer as easy to describe as Hurston did in 1935: "the city with 5 lakes, three crocketplaces, 300 brown hats, 300 good swims, more than enough guavas, 2 schools and no prison."
Nowadays it's a pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to remember the most famous author of Harlem Renaissance.
And yet, and remains the city that describes it - and which made it a tourist destination by taking it into the Florida Travel Guide, which was produced at the time of depression by the Federal Writer Project - is in many respects a place of very special kind.
Eatonville is as independent, divorced and private as in the 1930s when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused to share their true thoughts with the white man who "knows so little about us that he does not know what he is missing."
Even today, in a year in which a black presidential canton, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open conversation on racial relationships, many here are still tired of being watched by externals.
"We are very concerned about how our story is told," said Hortense Jones, 59, from birth to a inhabitants of the city and community member of the oldest church of the city.
It must be true. "
Eatonville was long defined as a paradox of triumph and battle.
It is both a historical example of the black movement and a municipality of nearly 2,400 inhabitants, in which the poverty rate is twice as high as the national average.
It is, on the one hand, a highlight of literature and, on the other hand, an example of the - sometimes condemned, sometimes praised - black culture of the rural south which has its roots in the American slavery.
It is not surprising that people here are both proud and on the hat.
And so rightly, the concerns about Eatonville's image actually started with Zora, as everyone here calls Hurston.
She presented her hometown to the world in books that came from the heart and were written in Mundart, like "Mules and Men" (1953) and "Their eyes were watching God" (1973)
Five paragraphs in the Floridarijeführer changed the city, which is very close to Route 77, a road that leads through the often forgotten center of Floridas, to the scenes of black history and human drama.
Frech as Oskar, both in real life and in literature, led Hurston readers to the store of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then turned to more private affairs.
"Apart from the road to the left," she wrote, "the brown-white modern school is located, with its custom gardens and playgrounds that Howard Miller always cares about, although he can hardly read and write."
She also mentioned the new man of Widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "Sells drinks of any kind and whatever - fits with hours."
In just a few hundred words, Hurston connected Eatonville with self-government, but also with analphabetism, second marriage and sex.
This was certainly not a guide.
In fact, this was not a portrait that was appreciated by everyone.
"Zora described things as they were," said the 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the Johnson girls who lived in Hurston by quoting the men who sang songs about their beauty that were full of sexual inspirations.
She added, "Some people didn't like this."
They still remember Hurtson as a vibrant excentrician who returned regularly after her family had moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, 77, remembered that when Hurston came into town, she did this mostly without warning, in a noisy Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants, in a city that, even today, imagines something about her honorable clothing style.
According to Mr Franklin, most of the inhabitants were fascinated, while many they despised.
"People were always happy to see Zora," said Mr. Franklin.
But "she never stayed too long," he added while he was shining in his chair, on a backward terrace looking at the Sabelia lake, in which Hurston was probably baptized.
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books abused.
Along with most of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten it.
Although she was once a famous author, a contemporary wife Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived in an anonymous grave.
In Eatonville there was no big memorial celebration, no public reading in great style.
"I don't think they understood their contribution in the world or their inheritance in the least," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows," a biography about Hurston published in 2003.
The turn came in the 1980s.
Orange County authorities wanted to put a five-way motorway through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the slow two-pillar main road of the municipality.
Orlando's suburbs had already pushed motorway 4 through the western edge of the city.
The proposal was presented when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult phase in his history.
Among other things, forced integration had put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the municipality.
In the 1950s, the fight against racial interference brought hatred to the Community.
"In this time a bunch of white boys often came and they threw oranges and stuff on the people sitting away," said Mr Franklin.
"There was even once a woman who was killed.
They threw a water melon out of the car. "
In 1955 Hurston questioned in a letter to Orlando Sentinel the requirement of the Supreme Court to force integration by calling its decision in the case of Brown against the school council "insulting rather than respecting my race."
The population nowadays says that although the abolition of racial separation was positive in some respects, it weakened group cohesion in Eatonville and the self-consciousness of its young people.
"Black children were used to being embraced - I remember - they embraced his teacher in the morning and they embraced his teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director of the non-profit group to protect the Eatonville community.
This could be maintained for so long, she added until teachers and students no longer came from the same place.
"They did not embrace their white teacher, because he was a white teacher - I mean there is a cultural gap," said Mrs Nathiri.
However, the citizens' rights have contributed to the creation of space for further Zora Neale Hurstons - black authors, actors and artists who put themselves above prejudices, as they did, with a positive self-consciousness and statements such as: "How can anyone refuse the joy of my society!
I don't understand. "
In 1975, the writer Alice Walker went on his way to Hurston's nameless grave and began to fight for the revival of her glory.
Five years later, a highly praised Hurston biography by Robert E. Hemenway was found in the book shelves, and again made it part of the American literature cannon.
The distance project came exactly at a time when Eatonville's most famous daughter once again stood in the light of the public.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbours saw her as a savior.
The municipality started planning a Hurston festival in 1988 to show what the district could destroy with the construction of the motorway.
Thousands of fans came to the opening ceremony two years later, and every January many come back for the celebration.
A few years later, the district turned away from its road construction plans.
"The plans of a five-way highway revived the city, accelerated the whole thing at peak speed, woke real citizens' pride," said Mrs Nathiri.
Mrs. Boyd said it a little easier: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the remote road project has contributed to a change in the city's self-image.
There were more and more riots, like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been going to church since 1993, and local people began to reappreciate the past.
Eatonville was included in the country-wide historical register in 1998.
In 2006, a new stumbling library (of course named after Hurston) opened on the newly planted and decorated Kennedy Boulevard.
Nowadays Eatonville is still a special feature in Florida: only 6 miles from Orlandos city centre can it sometimes feel like a backgate in the summer rain, as small as it was at the time when it was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(It's 90% black today.)
Outsiders looking for the history of Eatonvilles and its meaning are often still treated with caution.
For most interviews an authorisation is necessary in advance and certain things - like the wall painting of Eatonville's oldest church, which was painted by a white man and represents black men in field work - must not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Mrs Jones, a brave, self-conscious teacher with a preference for dark red, are still afraid that their shielded community is misunderstood.
And yet, at the same time when the Hurston Festival grew bigger, an increased degree of home pride was also born.
Especially young people tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw their entire race: beautiful, with all its problems, neither worse nor better and as proud, creative and hard, silly and mixed as any other group of races and peoples in America.
It is the sincere love of this city that one can hear in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, the 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who intends to return to Eatonville after college to work in the city administration or the police that he thinks might need some help.
And even the youngsters, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven-year-old twins from Winter Park, have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people who go through here alone will think:" Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others, "said Alondra Kenon the other day on a Sunday after the church.
"But if you actually stop and look at your story for a moment, it's a very beautiful city."
Here in New York, you speak fluent financial Latin.
At first sight nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan kept away from the newspaper stands and the huge TV screens at Times Square, they wouldn't even notice that they were in the middle of a debakel.
They would never believe that over their heads, in the shoes-like offices with the glass facades, bankers and hedge fund managers who have the monopoly in New York, daily have the worst horror working day since the 1929 stock exchange crash.
The suppliers are still pushing with loud clapping the metal teaspoons along civic steps and transport tablets that are loaded with muffins for breakfast sessions.
Latino's still sneaking around between apartments, how human pack animals load around the 50 built T-shirts hanging on a yoke-like rod on their shoulders.
Office employees are still waiting for the civic rising dining stations on their breakfast bagel and it is still impossible to get a yellow taxi on a weekday between 16 and 19 o'clock.
It didn't feel like a crisis at all until I decided to open a new savings account on Thursday afternoon because of all the world's breakdowns.
Although I had decided to put my mandatory course on the quiet late afternoon in my JP Morgan Chase tribal branch, about 20 people were already standing snake.
Not to the money switches to withdraw or deposit money, but to the customer service switch where stem customers order checkbooks, tourists ask for the way to Macy's store and where new customers open accounts.
Most of them before me, I learned later from Starr, my "personal bank with license," stood for the same reason as I snake.
However, unlike me, they had already removed their savings from smaller banks, in places from where they pendulated, like New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had money from so-called trifts (a bit similar to a building park fund), cooperative banks and those local savings banks that only have branches in one state, and say they treat their customers like family.
Last year, 15 of these banks were silent and silent.
In the last few days Washington Mutual, a bank with assets of $327 billion, passed into bankruptcy administration and as last Friday New York travels home over the weekend, Wachovia, another bank that owns savings of $440 billion, was looking for a rescuing buyer.
In fear of another collapse, the office and shop employees brought before me their cash to a bank that is considered safe port, a bank responsible for most rescue purchases on Wall Street.
Very normal New Yorkers have been flowing in the past few weeks.
A woman who made a phone call in my Chinese tribal supermarket took so much confidentiality into reference to Lehman Brothers, the bankruptcy of the bank and their deprived chairman, Dick Fuld, as if she was laughing at a cowardly colleague.
And Lyn, the 50-year-old uniformed concierge of my residential block has come from our usual entertainment topics about Brad and Angelina and my food delivery.
"I now have all my savings in money market funds" she told me after my visit to the bank.
"I've changed, I'm not taking any more risk."
Muslim tombs are shattered in the course of the right-hand circle in Austria
Heinz-Christian Strache, a left-wing member of the Austrian right-wing Liberal Party of Austria, and Filip Dewinter, a member of the Belgian right-wing Pertei Vlaam's interest, take part in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday 17 January 2008 to represent the organisation "cities against Islamization."
They wear signs in the style of traffic signs on which a mosque is pictured, streamed with a red line.
The police accuse the right extremists of the grave violation at a Muslim cemetery in Austria, that same weekend at the extremist right-wing parties recorded significant gains in the election of the country's parliament.
In the night from Friday to this morning more than 90 graves were severely damaged at the cemetery in Traun near Linz in a, according to the police, organized action.
The perpetrators put Jewish symbols like the David Star on some of the graves, but the criminals think this is an attempt to hide the motive of extremists driven by hatred on Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is in any way related to the elections.
A spokesman of the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shocked" about the news of the grave violation that took place when the religious month of the Muslim Ramadan is inclined to end.
At the same time, there is a round of conscience research in Austria after the country slipped to the right in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The FPÖ and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, the two far-right parties who received almost 30% of the votes, joined in their campaign for a strict anti-immigrant law and some of their voices were criticised by opponents as aliens.
Heinz-Christian Strache, chairman of the FPÖ, who won 18% of the votes, advocated a ban on copper pigeons and Burkas and even made his addiction to food that is generally linked to Islam.
At his last sound in Vienna, he spoke of a "European Brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties want to prohibit the construction of mosques and minarets with the argument that these political symbols are continuous Islamisation of Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses that have been carried out immediately after the election and which say that the extreme rights of the most political block in the country are, indicate that this new development is based on young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Foreign travel perimeter for Gary Glitter
Gary Glitter, the Glam-Rockstar, who was convicted of child sexual abuse, was forbidden to travel to France and Spain in court.
Judges imposed a six-month lock on Glitter after informing the controlling authorities that he wanted to travel to Spain via France.
The police in Kent were given last Thursday to impose a foreign travel barrier after submitting evidence to the judges of Glitter's prosecution for the sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, the real name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford District Court in Kent, but was represented by Corker Binning.
The Court's spokesman said: "On Thursday 25 September, the police asked Kent at the Ashford District Court to prevent Mr Paul Glad from travelling abroad to France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Gadd was not personally present. "
According to the register of sexual offences, Glitter, 64, informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad.
He must inform the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
He must also notify the police seven days before his planned departure.
Failure to notify the authorities could lead to a five-year prison sentence.
The police in Kent said she wouldn't discuss individual cases or Glitter's possible location in the country.
A spokeswoman from Kent's police unit said, "The police in Kent will do everything necessary to protect children in this country and abroad."
"We believe it is easier to control someone who is in the United Kingdom because we have a comprehensive system to effectively prevent any potential risks."
"It is the primary concern of the police in Kent to protect the inhabitants of Kents and we work closely together to monitor the behaviour of registered sexual offences in the country to minimise any risk that might exist for the population.
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse of two girls aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok, where he was scheduled to take a flight to London.
But he said he didn't feel well and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not let him through the passport control and he flew to Hong Kong for some time.
The Chinese authorities also refused to enter and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and border officers insisted that he would return to Britain.
Finally, he arrived at terminal 3 in Heathrow on August 22 and remained there while his attorney David Corker went to Uxbridge District Court in West London, since Scotland Yard had successfully asked for permission to ask that he be registered as a sexual offender.
Glitter had previously been detained in the United Kingdom for 4 months in 1999 for possession of pictures of child abuse.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, Minister of Interior Jacqui Smith is calm and satisfied that glitter was prevented from travelling to France and Spain.
"I receive the Master behind the stage to hold his character," Günter Brauer, photographer.
No suits, no balls, no costumes for the show.
The nature of the great flame dancers that do not focus on concentration and dedicate themselves to interpretation to get a relaxed appearance as a woman or as a man.
Artists on the one hand
Personality on the other hand
I look in private life, in those moments that are strange for the audience, I know when I can find the kind of personality-typical gesture, the depth of a stolen look or express strength of the hands that are worried because they will not enter the stage.
In his project 'Flamenco-people', the German photographer Günter Bauer presents varied theatralics of some scenes on the stage with singers, dancers and guitarists. From this page he was still little known for the artists.
With this proposal, the photographer creates a special icon of the flame code representation at different levels.
The exhibition, which is part of the programme of the month of photography of the Flamenco, 'reflects the international importance of Flamenco, which is growing from day to day,' explains the artist and makes it clear that 'Flamenco-people' can be any human being, but when you look at the photos, the viewer notices that there are no typical pictures of artists on stage.
Very normal people on the portraits are artists who are able to convey passion, sadness, joy on stage and thus move the audience.
In order to hold the personality of these artists, you don't have to take pictures on the stage.
Their personality and character are in their hearts.
What I was interested in was to create a personal atmosphere that would allow me to hold the characters of the biggest flame comesters with the photocamera. '
Bauer, inspired by the festival 'Cante de las Minas', took a long journey in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a digital camera.
Thanks to the image sorting function of the camera and the existing material, images were created that remembered classical photography.
The use of various stylistic means destroys the classic basis of the image, giving the image modernity and the idea of how the Bauer Flamenco understands: 'Music with traditional roots that change and surprise each day'.
This is not only the dance, the song or the instrument game itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, who with his art seduces the audience.
The search for the essential, for a certain thing that becomes visible in the form of hearing, being, was and was the fastest goal of this work presented in the next time in the gallery of El Fotómata.
Known personalities in Flamenco among them Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others are among the narrow selection of nearly seventy artists photographed.
The project became an anthology of the Flamenco and will soon appear as a book, with all the portraits from the exhibition.
Bauer's passion to the portraits led him to take this idea again two years ago and to realize it as a 'portrait of the veterans of sport' ('SportART project').
Although the concepts of the project 'Flamenco-people' are different, the photographer gives me very much to photograph the people, to get to know them and to put me in their livelihood, whether for a short moment or for a longer time.
I think that in the field of photography, the portrait is the most difficult species.
You meet or encounter people, personalities you sometimes don't know, or they leave you alone for a few minutes to take a photo.
Apart from these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas. '
The collection of the portraits of the Flamencos of today with the title 'Flamenco-people' is exhibited in the gallery of El Fotómata, which is located in the street with the name la calle de la Mata and runs parallel to the street la Alameda de Hércules. You can visit the exhibition until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the Roma he just writes is "a rabies."
He does not yet know where the action of the novel is taking place and what it is about, but Mario Vargas Llosa is trying to carry on the project he is working on, a novel with the protagonist Roger Casemant, a national from Ireland who lived 20 years in the Congo and moved to the Amazon area.
Yesterday, during his presence at the Festival Hay Festival Segovia, the preferred Nobel Prize winner admitted that the project with which he is engaged is' a rage 'and' everything indicates that he should not write the novel '.
"If I had thought, I would not have done it, but I will do it and hope to end the novel sometime," so he closed his participation in the festival, where the ideas, thoughts and words were exchanged. Within the four days he saw hundreds of writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people who were in Segovia.
The author of 'La ciudad y los perros' was one of the most outstanding personalities at the third festival and made forecasts.
Vargas Llosa, who won the premium of the Hay Festival and gave its voice to most of the attendants, is compared to the old edition of 'Our mutual friend' and is seen in the theater Juan Bravo.
He was presented by Félix Romeo and found that he had a audience in front of himself, which noticed that the Peruvian who has a wonderful memory and a great sense of humour had not given enough time to go through everything again: how his vocation to literature was created from "extraordinary adventures', from 'joy in reading' and from 'more humor than before'; as he writes and 'disciplin' to complement 'the lack of inspiration, and Alecandro, which are the foundations of his work with documentations, numerous corrections and overworks that he makes; as Faulkner, and Alecutor Vygo, which are the foundations of his own.
The Hispanic American novel writer acknowledged that there is no way to measure and how to know whether books change life, 'but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, a fugitive experience', Vargas Llosa stressed who claims that it produces' effects' and 'brings people even more apart', so I asked the writers' not to abandon ease 'and' the responsibility 'for his profession'.
At the party in Pozoblanco the weather did not play: bullfights fell partially.
After the announced bullfighters found that the ground of the place was in bad condition, the bullfighter party with which the festival was to be completed in Pozoblanco was moved to yesterday morning.
Thus, with the consent of Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, the organiser decided to postpone the bullfighter party.
So the festival of the unconstant weather was suspended, so two out of three celebrations could not take place.
On Saturday, it rained, which is why the second planned bullfighter feast could not be celebrated.
The Matadore group consisted of José Luis Moreno, Curro Días and Juan Bautista, who graduated from time to time.
That's how there was a party only on Friday.
The winner there was Daniel Luque, who cut three ears and triumphed after which he had left the passage with pleasure and aesthetics.
On the same evening, Alejandro Talavante met two horns and an ear of the bull, which had succeeded him more by galopying than by his bullfighting art.
And even worse was El July, who went through the Arena de Los Llanos without difficulty, but also without glory.
After having fought so badly, a large part of the audience reacted in his second fight with Buh calls.
In Álava, two people wanted to avoid the control of their car, which was loaded with two thousand kilos of Haschisch.
Tomorrow, five minutes before ten.
Traffic control in Ertzaintza, in the city area of Armiñon (Álava).
Two policemen asked the drivers of the car to stop, and then they took the escape.
It looked like they didn't have to stop with the charge of more than two thousand kilos of haschisch.
The police chased them and arrested one of the drivers, the man who is 28 years old, known as A. A. J., as the Ministry of the Interior of the Basque State informed.
The arrested person was accused of drug trafficking and counterfeiting of official documents.
The incident occurred when the officials of the transport police of the Álava region had already completed traffic control on the N-1 and passed through the city area of Armiñon.
They decided to stop a car to carry out the route control. The driver did not follow the instructions, suddenly increased the speed and tried to avoid the control.
The police started the persecution until the car stopped at the edge after a few kilometres. At the moment, the drivers got out of the car to flee over a road to a forest area.
The police of the city of Ertzaintza finally picked up one of the two. In the car, an Iveco Daily, the drug dealers transported 2,178 kilos of Haschisch, which was seized by the police.
The front part of the car was loaded with Haschisch bundles, which were later led to the precise laboratory analysis and to weigh the bundle to other police services.
In addition, the officials found that the identification mark was' double ', so it was not consistent with the identification mark indicated in the vehicle documents, and therefore an additional arrest for counterfeiting official documents was carried out.
The police of the city of Ertzaintza continue the investigation to conduct the arrest of the second suspect who, as already mentioned, could escape, but also to detect the origin of the seized drugs.
The 28-year-old A. A. J. was taken to a police station for interrogation and will be presented to the warden in the next few hours.
Actor Heather Locklear was arrested for driving under the effect of an unknown drug.
The actress Heather Locklear, known by the role of Amanda from the series "Melrose Place," was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) because of driving under the effect of an unknown drug.
A witness had observed how she tried to get out of her parks in Montecito in a rather strange way, spokesmen of the traffic police of California reported to the magazine 'People'.
The witness explained in detail that Locklear 'after 4: 30 pm pushed Gaspedal and made a lot of noise by trying to move her car back or forth out of the parks, and when she drove backwards, she caught a few times on her sunglasses'.
A little later the witness saw that the actress probably didn't know at first that Locklear stopped on a nearby street and left the car.
The witness was the person who notified the emergency service because she was afraid of Locklears' life.
When the police came, they found the actress sitting in her car, standing across the street, blocking traffic.
'She seemed to be unoriented ', which is why they brought the police into a special drug and alcohol center to make a test.
According to a police speaker, the actress showed itself cooperative, excessive alcohol consumption was excluded from the first moment. 'Follow the first observations of the officials, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of an unknown drug', said the speaker.
Locklear was arrested under the suspicion of driving under the influence of an indefinite substance that could not be determined and brought into local detention by 7: 00.
Two months ago Locklaer was released after a treatment from the Arizona clinic where she was treated against anxiety and depression.
Llamazares insists that the Andalusian United Left Association will be responsible for the Silva case.
Gaspar Llamazares, the main coordinator of the VL and members of the United Left, today assured that the regional association for education will be the one who will meet the decision in the case of the former Council for Youth and Sport of the City Hall in Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who had resigned last week after he was accused of doing business with family members.
'In such cases, I am a great federalist, and the Andalusian organization will be the one who has to take responsibility for this, 'Llamazares pointed out the way the party has to do with the one who has been sitting as a council in the council of Seville so far.
Nevertheless, the president of the VL defended the need for 'transparency' in the possible investigations of the violations of the rules that Silva could have begun: 'The VL always insisted that such cases should be given maximum transparency'.
With regard to this issue, he stressed that education has a strict ethical code for all public offices.
'Sangre de mayo': Heroes book by Garci
Inspired by 'Episodios Nacionales' by Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Carci in 'Sangre de mayo' represents the revised version of the famous rebellion of the Spaniards against the French. This is a wonderful film in the film, with about 15 million euro investment for the screenings.
In this way, the Cineast has tried to "present a lot of personalities and social analysis," which he always admired at the works of the famous novel writer, today Carci explained at the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the beginning of a long list of the performers.
"Sangre de mayo" with a film length of more than two and a half hours, this Friday will be presented in cinemas and later shown on the Telemadrid channel as a four-hour mini series.
José Luis Garci, a great fan of the literature of Galdós, assured that thanks to this screening work his' childhood dream 'was fulfilled. This was due to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him three years ago by the autonomous community of Madrid to film a memorial film for the second century celebration in Madrid on 2 November. In particular, because history is based on' Episodios Nacionales', he accepted the assignment.
The total contribution of 15 million made by the autonomous community of Madrid for screening, as he added, offers Garci the 'unique possibility' with the help of decorations and corresponding clothing the image of 'confused Spain, who chose the wrong leader for the struggle because the struggle for independence and under the rule of the Ferdinand of VII had been reversed'.
However, the Cineast regrets that the financing could not be expected, like in 'Alatriste' or 'Los fantasmas de Goya' (twice as high as in 'Sangre de mayo'), so some scenes from the script with Horacio Valcárcel, with which Garci worked almost all his career, could not be turned.
For this reason, Garci, who was also director of film in 'Volver a empezar', has contributed through his usual work: he stood up on the stage with the actors with whom you first have to try before you start turning and for those who had not made casting, he appeared "humiliating 'and providing respect,' a part of the job of the director of film is to provide help in theater and cinema to know what is happening in the cinema industry in which you work. '
Many performers he meets in 'Sangre de mayo' have to repeat before his camera, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, Oscar candidate in four nominations (of which he won one), believes and assured that none of the three candidates representing Spain this year before the Academy of Hollywood is a young generation of Spanish film graphy. Neither 'Sangre de mayo', nor 'Siete mesas de billar francés' nor, finally, the selected film 'Los girasoles ciegos'.
For this movie Garci doesn't expect awards.
'At the beginning you think you're working for the descendants, later you notice that it's only for money, and now you're happy when you've produced another movie, 'Garci explains after more than 30 years of work.
Isabel Bayón recalls the memory of the dancer from Seville Tórtola Valencia
A flame dancer from Seville deserves a dancer who also comes from Seville.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia: her father was Catalan (Florence Tórtola Ferrer) and the mother of Andalusia (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), she was born in the district of Triana and when she was three years old, her family moved to London.
She was a dancer and expert in oriental dancing.
She had an exciting life, she was one of the first fighters for the emancipation of the woman, such as Isadora Ducan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist, vegetarian, and set herself up for the abolition of the corset, which restricted the free female movement.
The life of this woman, who left her traces in the dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe in the time between the wars, fascinated Isabel Bayón.
'I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she suggested this role to me, which seemed impossible to me. '
"We're not trying to tell about her life without preserving her esprit," said the flame dancer.
Your dance bases have helped me a lot in Flamenco.
The 'dance of the butterfly' seemed to me like Guajira, or 'dance of the snake' like Tango.
Her dance was sensible and I was told that my dance is also in this aesthetic area, 'she claims.
The stage expects two extraordinary cooperation: with Miguel Poveda, who will sing again for Isabel in one of their performances, as he did in 'La puerta abierta'; and with Flamenco Master Matilde Coral, who, exceptionally, wanted to work with one of their ex-pupils.
'Matilde plays Tórtola, a very mature personality.
I am happy because she agreed to participate in my work, and I feel very honored. '
The stage also expects the musical composition and the guitarist Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, with the song of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; with the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the Viola of Rafa el Viola and the collaboration with the actor Juanfra Júarez, he 'takes over the role of the companion of the artists who were divas who he always fell in love with.'
In this work one also tells in a certain way about the life of this woman, who became known in as far-reaching places as India, the United States or Russia and also throughout Europe, although she has normally lived in London.
'I wanted to recall her, because I think she is one of the women who have an enormous influence on a particular epoch and whose works no longer have any more, and for that reason, 'says Bayón.
The show takes place today at 20: 30 at the Lope de Vega Theater.
The publication of the book 'Diario de un poeta recién casado' also includes the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of 'Diario de un poeta recién casado' in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), in a place where Juan Ramón Jiménez married in 1916 Zenobia, offers an appropriate atmosphere to carry out planned activities on behalf of the Andalusian Council for Culture to celebrate the 'Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' (2006-2008). The goal is to remember the fifty anniversary of the award of the literature novel prize and the death date of the two.
Thus, the 'Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' is completed with the new edition of this work, with the international congress which takes place in New York, with the restoration of the house museum of Juan Ramón Jiménez-Zenobia and with the hiking exhibition 'Juan Ramón Jiménez:' Aquel chopo de luz ', which was opened in May and after which it was in different places in Andalusia, New York reached now and was presented during the international congress.
The Andalusian Council for Culture has also received hundreds of copies of 'Diario de un poeta recién casado', published by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Pacobo Pérez-Enciso. The aim is to make the person and work of the Andalusian world poet more known.
The US can't imagine without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God creates perfect personalities.
Paul Newman was one of them. '
This sentence comes from the actress Sally Field, who worked with him in 'sensation reporter', and from the then prevailing idea of the American cinema, which was abandoned, came from all over America to Newman with his enthusiastic performance and followed her.
Look what it cost to give him the Oscar.
And when he withdrew in 2007.
And he knew he was very sick.
Still, it was a big hit for everyone.
"What one sometimes feels is far more than one expression, and now I have lost a great friend," said Robert Redford crying, "my life and my country were the greatest threats of his life."
No one was afraid not to make himself ridiculous or to exaggerate.
As the 'father' of the cinema and the country of the fathers, he died in a sad moment when fear of terrorists and the market collapse, where the defeated self-esteem of the Americans is in the hopeless search for reasons to get dignity back.
If in this hard time without virtue only a few people can be admired, you don't necessarily have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all he almost embodied a platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official enemy of Richard Nixon and suffered, like various losses, both profits: from the foundation, which committed himself to the fight against drugs and in honor of his son from the first marriage that died of overdose, was founded up to its own brand of homemade and organic products.
All of this is a gift for the country in which it cost him a lot of effort to enforce itself against a deadly diet culture.
A wide wave of surprise beats haushoch over Hollywood to take account of nationalities and nationality.
The last James Bond, the English Daniel Craig, confirmed that not only one man died, but the whole era.
The English director Sam Mendes, film director and Oscar prize winner, said that work with Newman was no more or less than the top of his career.
Russell Crowe, the evil boy who came from Australia, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
'We have left the greatest of us all ', confirmed George Clooney, perhaps one of few who trusted to live today as Paul Newman lived: getting high demands on righteousness, a responsible private life, far away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even possible in today's media jungle.
But there's someone who's trying, and Paul Newman was an example of that.
He divorced once and was married to Joanne Woodward for fifty years, who he was faithful to, although there were certainly many possibilities not to be.
"Why should I eat a hamburger on the street when I have filet at home?" he used to joke himself.
In heaven he will be proud that on earth his daughters have the same opinion as his fans, which is not necessarily common in America.
"Of all the great roles he played, he was not so proud as those of the faithful spouse, the loving father, the attentive grandfather and the philanthropist," they say.
For the Olympic Games, the streets in Madrid are lacking.
Yes, the dream of many of us is to organise some Olympic disciplines in Madrid, after the failure for 2012, it may be 2016.
But I wonder, are we prepared for this?
Yes, we follow the example of the old streets, I say it's not true!
She was called the perfect road, and my assessment is that she was the worst road with everything there was.
Of course, this is a lot of nonsense if you were to observe the evaluation and I could check it out, it would clearly not have been done.
But, let's go through everything from the beginning.
This nonsense begins with the ticket ethanol that allows you to go first.
It doesn't seem bad to me either, but if they already let you go, then they should give you everything (including chip to avoid the stops on the street).
I don't think so.
Here they only let you get the ticket (the first nonsense that consists of going there only for that reason) and (after an infinite queue) there is the surprise! The T-shirt was only in the size 'S' (a second nonsense because I need the size XL)
Where do we live?
Or is it so that after the crisis only small, much cheaper shirts were decided to buy from less fabric?
All right, things like these are a little bit compared to the days on the street.
Apart from the fact that you have to go very early to get the chip, there is already a waiting line of at least 15 minutes and, furthermore, you have to leave the backpack.
The waiting has taken more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible in the case of a road where 11 000 people are expected.
Finally, as it was expected, the road began and we had not left our back bags behind, even if it had succeeded once, but it would be more difficult to retrieve it.
In addition, in these 40 minutes waiting for rain, it appeared to be tempted to organize a people's rebellion and attack the house.
I think tomorrow will certainly have some 500 people pneumonia and some like me will not even appear in time for the classification because of this chip that I have received, I can already think that the outcome was badly stamped.
Of course, if you asked me about a perfect street, that road would never come to me.
So I think we're gonna dream of a city that is well prepared for the Olympic Games for a long time
Microsoft looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the 'Emerging Technology Conference', organized by MIT, Microsoft has presented the progress of the new image recognition system and the human interaction, a creature of artificial intelligence without much intelligence, which is capable of doing some primitive tasks, such as ordering a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, this is a route plan to move on the company's campus). The system is aware of what it hears during entertainment.
Thanks to a camera and a form and facial recognition system, this' receptionist 'can see how many people in the room are, who they are and even remember how they were dressed, it can listen and understand the key words of their entertainment.
It can also arrange the attendants after the conversations into the groups.
In the presentation video, 'the receptionist' notices a third person, but she understands that this person is not belonging to the group that leads to her conversation, and that neither is a company employee.
She asks if the person wants to visit someone here and replies that she will listen soon.
Everything without the blue screenshot
Impressive
This is certainly the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example, on the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week they spoke very overwhelmingly about Microsoft's strategy change.
Windows 7 will be faster and not have so many connected programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if the computers were equipped with the most necessary, instead of filling them with the commercial garbage, they would work five times faster. Human, Steven, that will only be for the wives.
Everything is only a finding when you consider that Microsoft added one or other function and 'Extras' in Windows versions.
The change in direction is worthwhile
Microsoft is right, the operating system is gradually losing importance, just like the software.
When Google Chrom appeared on the network, it was part of the theory that it was the first step of Google to compete with Windows.
Many indicated that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system, as an indispensable part, will always be necessary so that hardware and software can work simultaneously.
The operating system fulfils the function that can be compared with the function of his wife or husband when it comes to informing his mother-in-law.
That's right.
The system will never disappear, but you have to think of his' death ', not as an absolute, but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is confirmation of this idea.
People pay less attention to the operating system every time, more to the web browser.
The computer is only started to run the Firefox, the Explorer or Chrome and every day we spend more time surfing than in the surroundings of the 'windows'.
What is half of the computer applications for?
Less is more
And Windows 7 must be compact, much compact than Vista.
lighter, not too much, less complicated.
Microsofts's interest is more to integrate its online services, which can eventually become the alternative to Google.
In reality, they need it, without doubt. I bring a small example of it.
The photo of this place I took in Redmond, in one of the recovery rooms for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month.
On the refreshment drink machine a sign is attached: 'Your search. Our future'. It prints a request to use your own tool for online search.
In 2006, an independent study concluded that the 66% of the employees of Microsoft, Google, used for online research.
By the way, last week it was also confirmed that the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was delayed.
It will not appear at the beginning, but at the end of 2009, rather even in 2010.
Microsoft is looking for the possibility to bring Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 to the mark at the same time.
Every day the phone turns into a computer.
The Android and the iPhon are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso had it in Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio had this brand in 'Blood Diamond' by Edward Zwick, just like Al Pacino in 'The Pate' by Francis Ford Coppola. At the same time it belongs to the clothing of a well-built priest.
When we start counting the countless stars performances, we can return to the image of a very powerful man, with a spicy beard that had raised heavy weights in a hiking circus.
Basically, this is a typical male t-shirt made of cotton, poor and tailored.
The English speakers call it tank. However, Lle Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles exceeds all other brands.
First, because of his great name, although it is called in the narrow circle 'Marcel'. The legend tells that the name creation is connected to sport and comes from the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
'La Marcel 'surprises all because of its excellent cotton, because of its distinctive Unisex cut and characterizes itself by a small Belgian flag (hardly visible) that has these T-shirts as a detail on the neck cut.
And attention, the Belgian company is not only focused on the production of 'tanks'.
You also have college sweatshirts, boxer retro, cardigans and cashmere, panties made of cotton, T-shirts with stripes, babies, mini shorts
Modeled and comfortable underwear.
Although, it's a shame to use them as underwear.
You're very attractive.
'I want to be a young mother; I don't worry about the candidate '
Her great performance with her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Mónica Cruz is tremendous, but full of joy.
At present, the siblings Gruz take their new activity in fashion very seriously.
For Mónica this means much more than for some pretty and rich girls who keep their reputation.
She was in Paris at the promotion of the Mango company, then moved her residence and also made the presentation of the most important prizes in the fashion sponsored by the Spanish fashion house.
Merciful and shy, winner on the short lines.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection for this autumn / winter season that my sister Penélope and I designed for Mango, and also visited the presentation of the second edition of 'Mango Fashion Awards' and took part in the dinner for Valentine's honor.
A very intensive working time, which is at the same time exciting.
You work for the Spanish house, what is the basis of your new collection for the fourth season for Mango?
My sister, as well as I, are fascinated by the cinema of the 50s and 60s; there we find many ideas.
Gladly I go through a city and watch women dress up, how they combine their garments, I do that often.
Dancer, actress and fashion designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, but finally, everything happens in one and these areas have many common features.
Since I was little, I was excited about the clothes; I always wanted to go to my grandmother to roll around in my aunt's garments and see her clothes.
That was great, almost better than going to a leisure park.
Later, as a dancer, I always tried to watch the clothes.
You know, we dancers like it so much to have our own style in class and at the samples to look into the mirror and feel good about it.
As an actress, when you get the costume, you get into the real actress role.
Finally, everything is connected, it is so, much respect for the costume designer and their professionalism.
Recently you became 30, didn't you fall into any crisis?
Oh, yeah.
I feel better than ever, like thirty-year-old, I feel good.
I think the woman gets mature, has experience and can enjoy life with fewer mistakes.
I'm not afraid of my biological watch.
I've done the things that I've been trying to do since I was little and that has given me a lot of inner pleasure.
So, you're thinking about becoming a mother, aren't you?
For a long time I have known that I am becoming a mother because I want to be my body and I want to be a young mother; I don't want to miss it.
As far as the candidate is concerned, I'm not worried.
I will give my child great feelings of happiness and raise it with much love.
As far as film art is concerned, you will keep in mind the work you took part in and the work you were filmed last year.
That's exactly what I want them to be presented to the public.
I, as a woman coming from the theater, am very impatient and uncalm and I want everything at once, which, of course, cannot be immediately.
I very much wish that 'La última hora' and 'En busca de la tumba de Cristo' should be listed for the first time.
Let's see how they like you
A couple of days ago, you showed up on the run with Naomi Campbell, right?
All right, don't say that.
It's not like I went on the run to model.
Naomi Campbell, which I have known for some time, has just called me and invited me to attend a parade for the charity event of her organization 'Women for a better world' and the clothes we show. I know that two garments from our collection were auctioned for Mango to collect the money for Naomis NGO.
People don't know Naomi's good heart.
A lot of things are being told about her. I, as the one she knows, would tell you they're not right.
Nevertheless, I will support this good thing that she is involved in.
She asked me to take part in the parade for this generous thing, but if she comes and asks me to make a hand stand, I will do that too.
In order to support women in the Third World, whatever is necessary.
Drivers who can be reversed due to alcohol levels will have to install the 'alcolock'.
The authority orders that the driver who had three official penalties for the alcohol level installed this system in his car, which forbids him to start the car in drunk condition. If he is alcoholized, then the car will not start.
The initiative was announced last month in June and is now part of the report of the prosecutor-general. According to her, it is a pilot project that will last for a year.
The purpose is to rehabilitate the driver, which is why he receives a course for the retraining of transport behaviour.
In addition to the Attorney General, the Ministry of Transport and the Foundation of the Technical Institute for the Safety of Automobiles will participate in this process.
According to statistics, between 30-75% of the drivers who were displayed more than once due to driving under alcohol flow, returned to tax.
The 'alcolock' would prevent this because it is connected to a system connected to the car, it measures the alcoholic content in the breathed air and prevents car start when the driver has done an alcohol test; or if an alcohol concentration is detected that is higher than permitted.
It costs more than 1 000 euros, the costs are borne by the person who imposes the penalty.
In this context, a study carried out in the USA in 2007 has shown that cars equipped with these devices already prevent up to 65% of the regulatory infringements in the first year following its introduction.
In Spain, it is expected that 115 lives could be saved every year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to tackle this behaviour before it becomes a crime.
And in order to facilitate their implementation, legislative reform can be implemented by the ordinary way, and yet a reform of the basic law is required which is necessary for the law enforcement process.
The equipment is still not available in any business in the Spanish markets, although it has already been installed in some commercial vehicles and public transport vehicles.
The House of Members will vote tomorrow because of the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, which proposes to install this system in school buses, which has already been done in France.
In Mexico and without 'peep-toes'
With British punctuality, at 5: 40 pm, at the time provided by the program, next to the presidential hangars of Benito Juárez de México DF airport, the plane of the Spanish Air Force, traveled with the Prince and Principal of Asturias.
The sun went down, but her beams still forced her to use the hand as a parasite to see the royal couple who came out of the plane.
Directly on the Gangway: the Spanish Ambassador and other authorities
A few hours before that, I had asked a taxi driver on the street whether he knew that the prince and the princes of Asturias visited the city to formalize the official journey.
- Ah, very good, so, you can't take people at this time at the airport you're from here or whatever
No, she's the Spaniard, but she lived here for a couple of years.
-Oh, very good.
But the Mexican press knows exactly who the Prince and the princes of Asturias are and knows the importance of the journey.
There are many who are waiting in the Hangar of the airport and on the red carpet, including military protection of 27 Navy soldiers who deliver honorary salves.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in navy blue, and she, the prince, with long hair woven from the wind, without ordinary 'peep-toes', maybe she was told that a thunderstorm is expected in DF.
Before they enter the hall, they smile and are prepared for the photographers in which the official followers are waiting.
At the door of the hotel where they are housed, one of the four largest in the city, waiting for them a Mexican TV reporter who likes to joke.
The best premium of fashion
Probably there was no more suitable place in the world than Paris to present a premium of fashion and there was probably no much outstanding fashion designer and bonvivants than Valentino.
Mango presents the second edition of the fashion contest 'el Bóton-Mango Fashion Adwards' for the promotion and international increase of young people.
This is awarded with a cash price of 300 000 euros.
Ayer Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, saw her drawings yesterday in the window of the Mango branch at Boulevard Haussmann Number 54 in Paris and almost wept because of the emotional excitement.
By the way, this is the second largest business of the company in Europe and has recently been opened. It offers a sales surface of 1 335 m ².
The largest business is in London.
So many events have happened that are linked to thanking fashion designer Valentino for his jury presidency in the competition. Everything ended with a luxury dinner in Opera National de Paris.
In the surroundings of many famous people, the board of directors organized by Mango seemed to be spectacular.
Nati, with the heavy heart that was broken by pain because recently his brother died, ripped together. He dressed the suit from the fashion house and had some jewelry from ELAH that was breathtaking. He held himself on the arm of his son Luis, who is almost two meters tall and accompanied Valentino at dinner, to his honor.
Andik, the owner and master of the house Mango, welcomed the guests and was such a cavalier, so he ended up with the baron of red shield without jackets, because jackets they borrowed the ladies.
Mónica Cruz, has rushed to business and had a pants and a shirt that she modeled herself, and at dinner she wore a long, black sexy dress. At a night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us a hall for ballet samples, so she got excited, remembered the old times, grabbed a rod and made a kind of grand ply.
Inés Sastre did not join the walk through the palace's premises, but before that she showed us the photos of her son on the phone.
The next morning we were able to look forward to the presence of Oliver Martínez, a personality that always produces a stormy enthusiasm, and to Jon Travolta, who, after his arrival (with his own sheets and towels) at Hotel Internacional in Paris, asked in advance to have a room without smell.
The stars under the sternful heaven of Paris.
Oh, la la, that's life.
1001 Counsellor against Stress
There is not a thousand, but one more way to forget chaotic our racial everyday life.
And even if there are few, everyone is gathered in a book in which it says how to relax. The book comes into the bookshops on 30 September.
The alarm is a punishment when it rings at 7: 00 in the morning, but even worse the idea appears to come back into the hectic rhythm which requires the current life to come in.
The office is called the tension and the computer that leads to the back pain.
The stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there is not one and not two methods to fight daily eradication and the problems that are turned off from the working world.
However, the number increases, no more and no less than 1001.
In addition to yoga positions, classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott in the book presents the entire list of possibilities that are adapted to the taste and time of each individual.
The work against the stress means' 1001 possibilities to relax 'and so comes the tranquillity that the book brings into the bookshops of the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
Those who think it is impossible to reach peace in areas such as work by means of personal contacts, this handbook contradicts such faith.
In addition, the methods are offered how to stay in contact with nature or the 100% natural recipes that lead to relaxation.
If the adrenaline in your veins is no longer high to restore the balance of the body and the stress has become a problem, then the moment has come to sit down on the sofa, turn off the brain and focus on reading.
Talking in sleep
Some children speak at night
I mean not those who wake up and tell us something that happened the day before, but the children who speak during sleep.
When it happens to you for the first time, in the best case, you will be frightened, but in reality, it does not matter.
This is a positive sleep disorder called talking in sleep.
It is quite common, especially among children and adolescents.
Certainly, more than one of you was told that you spoke at night.
This phenomenon may occur occasionally (once in life, for example during high fever), or regularly (every day, once a week, once a month), the next day the child cannot remember anything.
There is no reason that causes this appearance.
Often, connections are sought with other phenomena in sleep, such as nightmares, panic fear at night, enuresis noctura (bed nights), speaking in sleep sought, but there is no reason for it.
As we have mentioned earlier, it can be very high fiber, stress situations or overdemand.
In any case, this is a bit of an explored phenomenon.
The frequency with which it occurs is very variable.
It may be that you speak quietly in individual words, whisper or it can be quite the opposite (screaming, crying, long discussions).
In cases where the statement is very intense, it is recommended to observe the child and be advised by a specialist to check whether there is a problem causing fear and thus occurring.
We have said that it is a positive disorder, so it is not treated whether it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, with the sleep apnoea or with the stress).
What you can do is carry out a series of simple prevention measures:
Try not to mourn the child before sleeping.
So, select quiet game for the child and avoid stressful television programs that are horrible and something too wild.
Relaxation methods can be used to help the nervous children who are recommended for relaxation to get a certain inner tranquility.
This will help the child to sleep.
When speaking happens in sleep, try to keep quiet.
Remember that it's harmless for the child and the next day it won't remember what happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake it up.
This is useless, because the child is unconscious, so you will rip it out of sleep.
Although the child speaks, it sleeps, so it rests.
Remember, when it turns out to be afraid of a couple of appearances, it is recommended to be advised or to find out what reason the child is afraid of.
If they understand what it says (which is not so common), the child does not put pressure on to conduct an interrogation and obtain more information.
You will not be able to achieve anything with this, because when the child sleeps, it is unconscious and cannot think about it.
Besides, you will hear what it says, but you will not know what it dreams and why it says that, therefore they will be careful with the interpretation of information and the conclusions that you draw from it.
Maybe, it doesn't tell the kid you hear this at night and know his secrets.
Not even a joke.
That causes a lot of fear.
So don't worry, it's nothing bad, it's a moment that takes just a few minutes.
Fire houses... finally.
After a long thirst track, Illhäusern is finally back on the field on a successful course.
Without great effort, the yellow-black people played numerous torches and managed to implement one of them and thus win the game.
The pace of this encounter, at which the attackers had difficulty showing their skills, was not very high.
After a first attack by the guest captain Kauffmann, whose remote shot was close to passing the angle, Illhäusern should easily dominate the game, and it succeeded, alternately, first with a remote shot, then brain with a high pass, and Romain with a shot with the pedestrian to challenge Denmark's defense.
The opponent team blocked in the middle of the field and only passed through the vibrant Riahi at the top of the storm.
The beginning of the second half should be decisive with two first riahi and temporal fighting torches, and immediately thereafter with the first gate for the fire houses by Marais, which was exactly right to take a ball that had been rejected in a first attempt by theft.
However, the Illusional tornado should not be able to enjoy his happiness long and be sent to the bank about 12 minutes later, making his crew comrades have to continue playing in number.
Denmark, however, did not know how to exploit this and did not face any major problems of an Ilhaesian elf, which only withdrew a little bit to "compose" their defense, except in the very last seconds of the game, where the ball was very close to the latte after a great mess.
Sarkozy hits angry fishermen
Before he flies to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy is going to take another stop to Brittany.
In view of the resolute attitude of fishermen, which blocked access to several Breton and Normandy ports on Monday, the French President decided to arrive at the port of Guilvinec on Tuesday morning in the Finistère to meet their representatives there.
The latter promised to receive it 'with a constructive spirit' and hope that it would come with 'concrete proposals'.
The President's visit takes place at the same time as a general meeting of the crisis committee, founded by the Breton fishermen, to enforce measures in view of the extreme rise in the diesel price, which has reached an average record value of over 1.14 euros per litre.
According to the press spokesman of Elyséepalast David Martinon, 'the President will discuss with them possible solutions to help their companies become competitive again and to secure the working conditions and the pay of seafarers'.
Sarkozy is expected by the fishermen with determination.
On Tuesday morning, they led to the Morbihan and Calvado's protest marches, which caused stops of almost ten kilometers of length.
Quiberon's sailing port was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-île did not break down.
The peninsula Quiberon was demarcated with a lock.
Already on Monday the sailors gave expression to their determination by burning tyres and pallets from early morning before the fuel depots of the ports of Brest and Lorient, while being held in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc demonstrations.
The movement extended to other ports of the Atlantic Coast and the English Channel, such as Sables d'Olonnes, in Vendée, where the fish cutter did not exit, or Le Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the manoeuvre of the commercial vessels.
In the evening, the fishermen of Turballe and Croisic in Loire-Atlantique dissolved the blockade of the important total refinery in Donges.
Those from Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the meeting to be held at the Ministry on Wednesday before deciding on possible measures.
In fact, the Guilvinec crisis committee must decide on the reactions to the movement and its participation in the discussion planned in the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some Bretonic fishermen do not want to be represented by the responsible national fisheries committee who did not support their movement.
'The strike will continue ', because' the fishermen will not give up at any point 'and' do not want to go to Paris', for example Liliane Cariou, President of the Lorient Fisheries Committee, announced.
The professional fishermen who do not pay taxes on diesel currently cost the litre about 50 cents, but they believe that the profitability limit of a boat can only be reached with diesel for less than 30 cents per litre.
Paul Newman the Wonderful
The unforgettable actor from 'Butch Cassidy and the Kid' died at the age of 83 from the consequences of cancer in his house in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford, and Sam Mendes also said goodbye to Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery forecasts for 2008
This year, despite the threatening recession, the Brazilian aircraft manufacturer expects 215 aircraft to be delivered to the world economy.
Embraer, the fourth largest aircraft manufacturer in the world, complies with its delivery forecasts for 2008 with 215 aircraft delivered, confirmed its President Fredrico Fleury Curacao.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer hopes much from the Chinese market, especially for its planes of size from 30 to 120 seats.
So far Embraer has delivered 41 machines to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider delivering more than 15% of its assets
According to the Sunday issue of the Financial Times, the insurance company American International Group, which was financially supported by the American Monetary Authority, is considering giving more than 15% of its assets to repay the $85 billion he had been charged with.
AIG is prepared to control the sale of a large part of its business, beyond their life insurance at international level and their age benefits in the United States.
According to FT, the board of directors met on Sunday evening to check possible sales.
No confirmation was obtained with the AIG.
One of the assets that AIG might be separated from is its International Lease Financial Corp. airline leasing branch, its 59% share in the reinsurer Transatlantic Holdings, its real estate assets and its investments in the private equity, the FT further explains.
As regards these sales, no final decision was taken, FT continues.
AIG must make sales as soon as possible to repay the loans over 85 billion it has granted the Federal Reserve, including the risk that the US authorities will receive 80% of their capital and the current shareholders will be lost in the same way.
Analysis Historical Paris of the meeting Historical Tomorrow-Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange reported on Monday, after the representative chamber had rejected Paulson's plan to rescue the banks, a historical case of the courses: Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a loss of almost 800 points that has never been known before, and the Nasday 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) has dropped by 777.68 points to 10.365.45 points.
With regard to the points, the strongest case of his history (684,81 points) was recorded before September 17, 2001, the day of the trade decline after the terrorist attacks of September 11.
According to the final final figures, Nasdag index, mainly technology related, fell by 199,61 points to 1,983,73 and the widespread Index Standard & Poors 500 by 8.81% (106,85 points) to 1,106,55 points.
After the unexpected rejection of the plan for the rescue of banks by the Chamber of Representatives, which was to allow again some stability on the markets, Wall Street collapsed, which was already hit at the beginning of the quarter.
With 228 votes against and 205 against, the MEPs refused Mr Paulson's financial secretary the funds he had asked for.
Almost two of three Republicans rejected his plan.
'Here a bad picture is being put into circulation, which is the Congress as unable to adopt a plan, 'said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"This shows how much the market counted on this plan," she added, and fears that a project adopted in several days will be too late. "
'If the project is actually condemned to fail (...), it will quickly be the task of the Fed (the American Central Bank, Anm. d. Red.) and other central banks to get the crisis under control, which would limit the credit conditions even more ', Brian Bethune, Chief of Economy at Global Insight warned.
And Miss Piegza emphasized, with the feeling of extreme urgency even more, that every day that perverts, brings the ruin of a financial company 'in the United States'.
After Washington Mutual's bankruptcy on Friday, the American authorities planned the purchase of Wachovia's banking business by its competitor Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis suddenly accelerated and thus led to emergency measures for banks in the United Kingdom, in the Benelux countries, Iceland and Germany, a sign that markets' not only a American but a global crisis' were added to the FTN Financial analyst.
The market for basic goods has grown greatly.
The revenues of the state fund within 10 years have fallen from 3.632% to 3.827% on Friday evening and revenues within 30 years from 4.161% to 4.357% last night.
Obama, winner by points in the first television duel
The first debate of the two candidates for the White House on Friday followed another to find out who was the winner, John McCain or Barack Obama.
As expected, the QGs proclaimed their own victory in this television duel, which should be pursued by one third of the American families for both Republicans and Democrats.
The political analyst David Gergen appreciates that John McCain's performance, although quite apparent, was not 'brilliant' enough to allow him to stop his decline in the electoral questions five weeks before the presidential elections.
The Gallup Institute, of which an opinion survey was published on Saturday, says that Obama is ahead with five points (49% to 44% for McCain), believes that the Democrat clearly makes the better figure.
Obama's still unresolved voters, that is to say those on whom it is now, came out with 39% as a winner from the surveys, while according to a CBS survey, 25% of them saw McCain as a winner.
Obama should be able to confirm his leadership on Thursday with the good performance expected by his competitor Joseph Biden in the first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin,
'It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
She has good instincts' but warned Bill Clinton this weekend.
The seventy-year-old McCain did not cease to put his undeniable experience in the field of foreign policy in the forefront, with a clear emphasis on the 'naivity' of his opponent on these issues, which were at the heart of this first television duel.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that..." he stressed several times.
"I do not believe that Senator Obama has the necessary experience and knowledge to become president," he also assured.
A point of attack which has been preached in the Republican election spots since yesterday.
Obama himself stressed that he represents the future.
He spoke briefly and accurately without having to get out of the version.
He put his ability at the forefront to make good decisions and to renew the image that the world has of the United States.
'McCain has still not understood, Obama has already ', this weekend a democratic election campaign against which the Republicans were accused of not having captured the full extent of the crisis that is loaded on the' American from the street '.
'During the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot of things to say about me, but nothing about you ', yesterday Obama pranked 20,000 people who had gathered in streaming rain at a election event in North Carolina.
He did not even mention the words' medium-sized 'or' workers'. 'The financial crisis gives Obama, which the Americans consider most appropriate to save the economy even at the edge of the abyss, a clear advantage.
"Next week could be a crucial turning point," yesterday the influential democratic senator Charles Schumer estimated.
The democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of Clinton's government, compared the 'good economic instincts' of Obama with those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the democratic candidate, the current crisis is' the final part of an eight-year economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain '.
After reiterating that he would probably even reduce the taxes for 95% of the Americans despite the fluctuations on Wall Street, the Senator of Illinois pointed out that the creation of a possible energy independence of the country and the promotion of renewable energies, together with the introduction of a health insurance system, had top priority for him.
McCain, on the other hand, wanted to build a plant of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
The two candidates were attentive to the questions that were raised on the plan to save the financial market over $700 billion (€470 billion), which was adopted by the Congress last night and extremely unpopular with the people.
'Have you noticed that a choice took place in Minsk? '
Young people and opposition demonstrated Sunday evening at the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
A few hundred white Russians gathered on Sunday evening since the closing of the electoral premises in the market place of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of the parliamentary elections.
Although no result had been announced, many young people had come to demonstrate against Alexander Lukachenko's power: "The dictator should resign."
Some admit that they didn't vote at all: 'What does that mean if they do with my voice anyway what they want', says a young man.
They do not believe that the regime that has shown itself in the best light to foreign observers in order to resume negotiations with the European Union is willing to make a democratic turn.
The sanctions, including the non-sharing of visas for 40 leading white Russian individuals and the creation of certain assets, could be abolished if these elections were considered clean by observers.
According to the opposition, they weren't.
'We were excluded from the electoral commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the counting ', regretted Juri Potemkin, the press spokesman of the Union of democratic forces, a heterogeneous merger of twelve parties.
This is a cosmetic change, emphasising Alexander Milinkievich, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-Europe movement, because it is important who counts the votes, and with us that is the executive.
If Members of the opposition move into Parliament, then because they were appointed and not elected.
But their entry into Parliament can mean broadcasting time on television, meetings in the regions and legislative proposals. '
The opposition is therefore guilty of interfering in the political game, because dialogue with the European Union must be opened.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, comes into a crisis and we do not reform, we are at risk of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
Well, we want to be independent.
The opposition fears that the European Organisation for Security and Cooperation, which has followed the election process, does not recognise the election as valid.
It stresses that the numbers of voters appear too high and that the extension of the vote in advance (26% of Minsk voters) has paved the way for any kind of manipulation.
'Have you noticed that a choice has taken place?, the leader of the Social Democrats asks Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners who were released in August this year.
No one was in the polls.
And there will be no more than five members of the opposition in Parliament, those who are most likely to be in line with the ideas of the government. '
The silence of the night falls back over the octoberplatz.
On television, President Lukachenko and the members of the Central Electoral Commission congratulate them on their success.
Discussion - From the blood that became safe again
Hema-Quebec celebrated yesterday the 10th anniversary of her foundation, and her president, Dr. Francine Décary, had every reason to be pleased because Hema-Quebec has become one of the safest and most efficient blood banks in the world.
And above all, it recovered the public's trust, which had been severely shaken by the scandal of infected blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As you know, the national blood reserves managed by the blood donation service of the Canadian Red Cross during the 1980s were contaminated with HI virus and hepatitis C virus.
In view of this tragedy and the dissatisfaction of the public, the Government of Canada launched in February 1994 a public investigation initiated by Judge Horace Krever to bring light to the circumstances that had led to such tragedy and to draw up guidelines to prevent a new disaster of this kind.
While Judge Krever was still hesitating to submit his report, several provinces then put a committee on the legs whose aim was to develop a new system for the management of blood preserves in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee completed this mission.
According to the reports of Gélineau and Krever, two blood banks were established in Canada: Hema-Quebec, responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian blood company to supply the other provinces and the two territories.
'1998, when Hema-Quebec started her work, barely 38% of people had confidence in the blood preservation system in Quebec, remember Dr. Décary.
The situation was discouraging.
Through the enormous efforts to improve the safety of blood preserves and through the work in this field over the following years, we have recovered public confidence ', she says, before she is proud to stress that in early 2008, almost 94% of Quebec's population had confidence in Hema-Quebec.
However, Dr. Décary retains consciousness that 'trust is something extremely fragile'.
Since its creation on 28 September 1998 Hema-Quebec has acted in accordance with the principle of caution.
At this time we experienced the emergence of numerous cases of human form of bovine insanity in Europe, a new type of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, this woman who has been in charge since the foundation of 1998.
'And we didn't have any idea if this disease could be transmitted over the blood.
So we referred to one of the main guidelines of the reports by Krever and Gélineau, according to which exclusion measures are applied if you do not know this and if a disease is only progressing slowly, as is apparently the case with Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease, which is expressed by a degeneration of the brain, which inevitably leads to death.
So in April 1999, no blood was taken from people who had stayed in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
Well, a few years ago, there was no doubt that this disease was transmitted over the blood.
So this event has shown us that the principle of caution that we applied has quite a sense.
In 1999, a much more precise HIV detection technique appeared on the market: Nucleic acid tests (NST) that enable the presence of the virus itself to be demonstrated directly in the donor's blood, and not that of the antibodies against the virus, as was the case in the tests used so far.
The NST enabled to reduce the incubation time that takes place between the time when the person was infected and when the first viruses can be demonstrated by our techniques in the blood, the specialist explains.
This time could be reduced to less than one week.
Thus, the risk that certain donors could be infected without knowing, and one could not recognise this was significantly reduced.
These improvements made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of transmitting AIDS through a blood transfusion.
Nowadays, one in 12 million people is at risk of getting HIV-infected blood.
'In other words, this means that you have to distribute 12 million blood preserves before someone gets HIV.
Since Hema-Quebec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood preserves every year, it would take more than 24 years before a case occurs where HIV was transferred through a blood preserve.
I think you can feel comfortable today when you get a blood transfusion or prescribe it to restore health, "says Hema-Quebec's chief of directors.
'Our challenge for the next ten years is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogen can get into the system.
Only last year on the island of Réunion has the Chikungunya virus emerged, which, as well as the Westnil virus, is transmitted through insects through the blood.
We need to monitor continuously ', Dr. Décary continues, before she stresses that Hema-Quebec must also provide adequate supplies in addition to a safe supply.
'The need is increasing because the population is ageing.
As cancer control treatments are more aggressive, patients often need new red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also has an impact on the blood donor network, which on average accounts for only 3% of Quebecs population suitable for blood donation. '
In doing so, every healthy person who is 18 years or older and meets the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, i.e. six times a year.
On average, 14% of the people who provide their blood are not accepted because, for example, they are infected with AIDS or malaria, and those who have travelled to a country where malaria has spread are excluded from blood donation for a year.
'With these 3% we can get an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Lack of supplies are very rare.
But you have to renew the members of this donor network when they get older and can no longer donate blood.
It's hard to convince people to donate blood, but above all to keep them and make them become regular donors.
Life is so hectic these days that you rarely find time to spend an hour donating blood, 'regrets Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of 297 million dollars, Hema-Quebec delivers not only blood preserves, but also human tissues, including bone transplants, heart valves, eyeballs and skin, which is almost exclusively used in severe burns.
These tissues are investigated, processed and frozen before being deposited at Hema-Quebec, which also manages the only public Nabelschnurblutbank Quebecs.
In the umbrella, which was previously considered as biomedical waste, there is rich blood in stem cells that can serve to treat serious diseases such as leukaemia.
'A few weeks ago we celebrated the deployment of our thousands of navels' blood sample, and we plan to decrease more than a thousand a year.
"We should probably start making it available for transplants at the beginning of next year," Dr. Décary further explains which describes this program of navel cuttings as very popular.
'Many mothers are convinced not to have access to it 'because Hema-Quebec lacks the means to offer this complex and costly program in all hospitals Quebecs.
Soccer - Impact in the semifinals
Montreal Impact yesterday, thanks to a 3 to 1 victory (4 to 3 with all gates) against the Sounders from Seattle at the second and deciding the game of the quarter final series in the Saputo Stadium, where the overall ratio counted, qualified for the semifinal round of the excretion games of the first League of the USL.
The middle field player Antonio Ribeiro shot the decisive gate in the nineteenth minute of the game.
After a first half-time without gate both for the one and for the other side, the middle field players David Testo and Rocco Plancentino landed the other matches for the formation Montreals.
Roger Levesque was the only one who stood up to Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Let us remember that at the first game of the pre-and replay series on Friday Impact the Starfire Complex in Tukwila had introduced a 2 to 1 defeat in a suburb of Seattles.
In the semi-finals, Impact will be measured with the Whitecaps from Vancouver.
On Saturday evening, Thunder was able to compensate a 3 to 1 deficit in Minnesota by a 4 to 3 win, but the Whitecaps moved into the semi-final round with a total ratio of 5 to 4.
Impact will probably have to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the game series are set today.
In short - Siegestor by Kovalev
The number one trio of the Canadian team is ready to attack the season.
Last night, the unit formed from Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrej Kostitsyn ran the attack on the Panther from Florida with a storm fire, which led to a 3 to 2 victory.
Kostitsyn, the star of the encounter, shot a gate, Plekanec delivered two templates and Kovalev turned a pass in this victory game, the fourth of the Tricolore into six preparatory games.
Kovalev achieved the victory by shooting the only gate of the whole shooting.
'I'm not ready yet, the Russian warned.
I need another game to make me feel comfortable. "
'In the first half of the year, he was too much on it, noted Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he liked the end of the game.
He received a stormy applause. '
Charest sets to the north
The Prime Minister does not exclude the opening of elections before the end of the year.
As soon as the General Assembly of the Liberal Party was completed, Jean Charest went to Jean-Talon in Quebec yesterday, where the new Minister for Health Yves Bolduc (left) tries to be elected in today's partial election.
"Move the course of our last great border to the north ': this is the long-term goal that Jean Charest presented yesterday with visual means at the General Assembly of the Liberal Party of Quebecs in Levis, following all the guidelines.
During his lecture a kind of picture mill was projected behind him.
On three giant screens, spectacular images of hydroelectric plants, mines, Quebec in 'Google Maps', maps, etc.
Large funds as during the electoral period.
By the way, against the press, the Prime Minister refused to exclude that he would hold the elections this autumn, even if he had assumed that his calendar was very full.
The 'Nord' plan is the fourth element of a 'vision' which the Prime Minister allegedly has for Quebec, namely the 'new economic area' which provides for an agreement with France on labour, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Although it has been mentioned in recent speeches by the Prime Minister, the opening up of the north - the northern area on the 49th latitude - has never been the subject of a presentation.
However, the Prime Minister limited itself to explaining why the north was' a jewel with enormous potential 'but did not mention a date, no investment amounts or precise priorities for the forthcoming projects.
Only a few views on what could be more worked on: in particular water energy, the forest, but especially the mining sector, promoted by the growth of emerging countries and the renewal of public infrastructures.
According to Mr Charests, the north owns' nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds'.
This' area is twice as large as France 'is close to us, is in Quebec.
It is not just close to us, it is within us, he stressed how to show clearly that he is seeking to achieve a national founder's dream.
Quebec has grown very much by its connection to the north, he stressed: the road to gold in Abitibi, the technique Quebecs, the James Bay.
"It belongs to us, it is our future," he added after he had put in a theatral break to look at the giant map behind him.
The north, 70% of the Quebecs area, includes part of Labrador with which Quebec has always asked, said the Prime Minister to the press.
'This is a traditional attitude that was pursued by all governments.
There is a border line where there has been no agreement for a very long time when the opportunity is offered I will take this position on behalf of the government again, 'he said.
In addition, "with climate change we need to rethink our vision from the north," he explained and spoke about the North West passage, which will be viable all year round due to the ice melting.
Against this new geopolitical background, the Prime Minister believes that it is precisely a duty to occupy this area.
And the inhabitants of the area, the native people and the inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the government of Quebec would be very careful with them and that they would benefit from this project, especially the boys.
Two former ministers of various parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pekist Member of Ungava), have already started discussions with about thirty communities.
A ministerial committee headed by Benoît Pelletier, where Julie Boulet (transport and land resources) occupies an important place, has taken up the work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a large assembly, 'not necessarily a summit', but an opportunity to 'create a common vision'.
Nordic development will, moreover, be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The North plan will be 'discussed, regulated and environmentally friendly', he promised.
Jean Charest described this' vision 'as being a continuation of those of the Liberal Prime Minister who were in office before him.
'Like the Liberals who were in office before us, we have rethought to turn the challenges into new growth and development chances.
By the way, this was one of the constantly raised issues of the weekend, which was opened on Friday with a great cocktail party to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the acquisition of party leadership by Jean Lesage.
One of the decisions adopted is to rename Beauharnois's power plant to Adélard Godbout dam.
'By Godbout, who created Hydro-Quebec, through reading that has reached the silent revolution and the nationalisation of water electricity, to Bourassa, who has made the James Bay, our party always knew to determine the future, 'said Jean Charest.
He referred to another, this time conservative project, namely the 'Roads to the North' programme by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
With regard to the project hydroelectric dust dam Eastmain1a-Ruper, Mr Charest stressed that its launch was planned for 2012.
'This remains among us, but I intend to be there ', he entrusted his party members to what caused by those applause storms.
In fact, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008 and certainly also in 2009, has not yet excluded the possibility of holding a choice this autumn, which is possible from the law.
He emphasised, however, that his calendar is full, especially because of a mission of the Chinese CommunityCouncil and a summit between Quebec and New York.
The General Assembly of the weekend provided the Liberal Head of the Party a platform of nationalist plans, in particular the objectives of the Constitution, which were adopted without delay: the PLQ calls in particular for the recognition of the 'special Quebecs' in the Constitution.
It also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Council of Canadian broadcasting and telecommunications and to have a veto on the decisions taken in Quebec.
From the opposition, the guidelines of the North Plan were included with scepticism.
The chief of the Québécois Party, Pauline Marois, has reiterated the policy of developing the North-du-Quebec, which was introduced by the government of Landry in 2001.
According to her, when she came to power in 2003, the liberal government did not apply it.
If she had done so, 'if we were already much further today', Mrs Marois judged by her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the election is taking place today) Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ has agreed to support the adoption by the government of a North plan.
"But what we want is that this is not just a big idea," said the party leader Sébastien Proulx in representation for Mario Dumont, who comes back from the holiday today.
Letter - A deprived country
Mr Vic Toews, ex-Minister of Justice (which irony) in Harper's Cabinet, allowed himself last summer to say about Louise Arbour that it was a 'disgrace' for Canada.
This woman, who has led a non-ending struggle for justice and deserves all our admiration to cover so with shame, says as much about the people around the Prime Minister as about Stephen Parker himself.
We are dealing here with a government which, as the only one from all the countries concerned, did not bring home its landman who was captured in the concentration camp of Guantanamo.
A government that doesn't even take into account that Omar Khadr was still a youth when things happened that were accused of him.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, breaks its word and causes a child soldier to die under inhuman conditions.
The only one that gets down to a court parody to assess the defendant's guilt.
Let us remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the association of Canadian lawyers are calling for Omar Khadr to be brought home so that he can get a fair trial in Canada.
It is precisely this government that closes eyes to torture: it does not interest them much that a young adult after so many years of suffering will surely be broken for ever.
We are not yet aware of this, but we are experiencing a mysterious circumcision of our rights, our freedom and our 'democracy', this word that Harper is constantly carrying out like a flag and that sounds so unspeakable from his mouth.
The time has come, therefore, when there is no morality: one may arbitrarily abuse, torture and lock up a Canadian citizen, according to the good thinking of a Head of Government, which has so far only been supported by the minority (may he be fully a minority after 14 October...).
Many voters believe that they will find their salvation in a party preaching virtue, law and order, but they do not see that this government has deceived itself of what was the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr Toews, lies in this loosening, and nowhere else.
Free Opinion - The Orwell Speech of Barrick Gold
In its edition of 17 September, Le Devoir published a letter from Patrick J. Garver, Deputy Director-General of the Canadian Goldmine Barrick Gold.
This confirms, and pursues an orthodox logic, that the world's largest gold-winning company sought an assault against three authors and a small medieval publisher, with the aim of opening a 'public transparent debate'.
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, then they do not judge about the truth, especially not in the case of envy lawsuits, but about the law.
As expected, this fundamental difference has been completely concealed by Mr Garver.
Because for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate is to ruin anyone who dares to represent one of their opposed opinions.
No matter how the process goes, the authors and the publisher of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defence and fight with very uneven weapons against an army of lawyers paid out of the almost inexhaustible bags of the gold mine.
Tactic in these unequal struggles is, moreover, often to ruin the defenders in order to force a consensual arrangement that makes the opposite dead and, moreover, scares off anyone who dares to deal with the question again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she should have presented her view of things in front of the public opinion.
Contrary to what has been done in many of the countries where Barrick Gold works, debates are usually carried out in Canada through the exchange of ideas and not through clubs.
So it would have been enough if the gold mine had published its books and files and opened a real debate through the newspapers, media, publications and the financing of independent audit teams that could have brought light on this issue.
But Barrick Gold seems to have no confidence in public opinion and wipes aside the petitions and letters to support the authors of Noir Canada with a hand movement.
Could Mr Garver perhaps explain how he can ask for a 'public' debate at the same time, while ignoring the views of this public?
It seems that this word in the world of the Vice-President only includes the generously paid lawyers, and not the community of all Canadians; a very narrow view of the concept.
In a democracy, self-destitute has the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold doesn't understand - or doesn't want to understand - is that the public who supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada does this especially because it rejects the brutal attitude of the gold mine.
This public is willing to listen to and judge Barrick, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not in a framework that many perceive as a troublesome lawsuit (during the 'public debate' Barrick Gold has just made a claim to the authors of Noir Canada, in which it asks them not to use this term anymore...).
Apart from the surreal speech by Mr Garver, the Barrick Gold complaint is a direct attack on freedom to academic research and the truth finding which is fundamental to any democratic society.
It completely denies the right to quote credible sources and to discuss facts and interpretations that form the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible in a country like Canada to explore and discuss issues that do not like the rich companies of the world, who else can do that?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could lead it by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
She has a right to answer.
The university environment to which we belong for a long time has been able to deal with debates and disagreements and to resolve conflicts.
The disproportionate complaint by Barrick Gold clearly shows that, unlike what she claims, it has no desire for a transparent debate.
This is a loss for the university world, as well as for the public debate, and it is time for governments to take measures that restrict this kind of unjustified actions.
Rescue action for the Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans understand
The Bush administration and the senior congressmen, Republicans and Democrats have finally reached agreement yesterday on the most extensive economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 30s.
The new version of the plan of over $700 billion to stop the financial crisis that has been shaking Wall Street for months still needs to be accepted by the two congress chambers.
The main contents are: better control of Members of Parliament over the practical application of the plan, new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of the public funds used, new resources to reduce the number of houses arrested due to residual payments, as well as the right to monitor the salaries paid to the managers of the supported companies.
The American financial secretary Henry Paulson, the President of the Nancy Pelosi Chamber of Representatives, and the representative of the Republicans, Senator Judd Gregg, announced yesterday, a few minutes after midnight, the good news, after a two-day negotiating marathon.
"We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be market-effective," said Bush's representative, Henry Paulson.
"Everything happened to protect the real economy and the American people from the crisis on Wall Street," said the Democrat.
'This is the fundamental point: If we do not, the trauma, chaos and unrest in the daily life of the Americans will be enormous, 'said Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had accelerated over the last two hours, for fear of the impact that a new failure would have had on the mood of investors.
The deadline that had been agreed was the opening of the market this morning.
The two American presidential candidates who only took part late in the negotiations showed themselves to be more supportive of the agreement but did not fail to express their dissatisfaction about the need to meet them in this extreme way.
The democratic Senator Barrack Obama insisted on the addition of certain consent to agreement, in particular those which should enable owners to keep their houses, and those that concern the salaries of the senior employees of the companies rescued by the State.
'If you ask taxpayers to take extraordinary measures because of the lack of responsibility of certain people, that is nothing you could congratulate yourself on.
But these measures are necessary ', he explained on the American television broadcasters.
When he was asked on another station whether he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent John McCain replied: 'I would like to know the details first, but I hope so.
'The guideline I have read shows that this is one thing that we will all have to digest, and that we will be able to move forward with.
The option to do nothing is simply not acceptable ', he said.
The $700 billion plan is aimed at using the money of taxpayers
It comes 14 months after a crisis, triggered by the placing of a real estate bubble, which initially led to the collapse of the risk-bearing mortgage credits (subprime) before it extended to further forms of broader bonds (PCAA), and ultimately led to a freezing of financial power and the ruin of banks and money institutions.
It was a group of Republican Members who failed the first attempt to reach agreement last week.
Since the Democrats have accepted that certain 'toxic' assets of societies should only be secured and not purchased by the government, one believes that the sackgasse will escape.
In order to close the viewpoints for everyone in the Congress, an order has also been added which states that if the government should make losses with this programme within five years, it will then be able to raise new taxes in order to recover its capital invested.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first sum of 250 billion, which can be added to another 100 billion if the President considers it necessary.
The payment of further 350 billion must be adopted in a renewed vote by the Congress.
In return for his help, Washington receives shares in the supported companies that provide him with dividends in the event of gains and can sell it again when the storm has passed.
The Federal Government will have the possibility to retain the custody procedures relating to the dwellings linked to the real estate credits covered by this plan and to set deadlines for repayment and repayment paid to the executive employees of the companies concerned.
The developers of the plan would like the Chamber of Members to vote on him today and the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will get green light.
In fact, yesterday there were further votes against this project, both from the Republicans and from the Democrats.
"Clearly Washington does not understand us," said Republican Scott Garett, member of the Chamber's Financial Commission, to his voters.
'Yes, we have a big financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not those who are asking taxpayers for cash. '
The democratic MEP Brad Sherman, head of a group in the Congress called 'the Kaucus of Skeptics', represents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred excellent economic professors, including three Nobel prize winners, have written to us to inform us: we ask the Congress not to be pressured, and to carefully consider the way to go," he said yesterday.
At the same time, we in Europe again received proof that this is a global crisis.
At an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis Banking Group for €11.2 billion (USD 16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg was necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it would not buy up its competitor, which is in great difficulty since it lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion US dollars) in the crisis due to the risk of real estate credits in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the twenty largest European banks and the ten largest insurers.
'This is not a lost money, said yesterday the Dutch Minister for Finance, Wouter Bos.
In order to compensate, we have a right to vote and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what the savings and households appreciate, now that uncertain times are announcing. '
During this time, on the other hand, the British Government was just about to renounce another bank under threat from the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all current loans at Bank Bradford and Bringley, of which over 41 billion (75.5 billion US dollars) from real estate credits.
The Spanish Bank Santander announced yesterday that it would purchase the branches and the bank's customer accounts.
After Northern Rock, Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank that the British government has to rule since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (19252008) - Death of an engaged icon
His beauty with the azurblue eyes was his trumpet for a long time, no one would say his weakness.
Did the American actor get rid of the narcissist mirror with the charming smile?
Yes and no.
His affection, his sensitivity and an obvious talent have probably also kept him away from a power position that brings the truly horrible monsters to the world.
But what a big permanent explanation!
Paul Newman died on Friday at the age of 83 on the consequences of lung cancer on his ranch in Connecticut remains one of the last icons of the American cinema of his golden years.
He was less monumental than Brando, which he was similar to and for which he was a kind of rival on the canvas for a long time, more carefully in his play, certainly also more fragile, but also as an apostle of freedom and the explosion of dramaturgical conventions.
Mixed blood often produces wonderful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 as the son of a German Jew and a Hungarian mother.
His European roots should be one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without excessive ego, the ultimate quality mark.
For in him a whole country that was in love with the self-made man reflected in the fighters who were injured in the war in the Pacific, who studied acting art in Yale at the beginning of the 50s and then visited the Actor's Studio in New York before he had success at the theatre, on television and soon also in the cinema.
This man, who fought for civil rights, was also the driver who became in 1979 at the 24-hour race of Mans Second, and also a sex symbol, although he lived in a preview training together with the actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
With him also disappears the unknown facets of this mysterious, restrained, committed and overwhelming star to the glamour of the showbusiness, whose mystery one will never fully solve.
A decent man in the pure sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newmans spent the cinema owners this weekend in Taumel, while all his big roles were played on the dark screen of the memories.
More than half a century of American film art in constant change is moving forward with him.
The charming cowboy from "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) again pushes himself into memory, and the young man who rejects his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) to The Cat on the hot sheet roof, which was filmed in 1958 by Tennessee Williams.
A much shorter remembrance (1990) is awakened to his sensible Lord Bridge, who at his high age is disturbed by a wedding that did not fulfil all their promises.
There were so many other Paul Newmans in history.
This criminal, stormy, violent and unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano from Someone Up There Likes Me (A Hand Full of Dirt) by Robert Wise, a role that was intended for James Dean, whose death was resumed and Newman announced correctly in 1956.
This sympathetic ganove in the amazing The Sting (Der Clou), which was awarded with the Oskar for the best film in 1973.
As a bitter and vengeful billiard player in the wonderful The Hustler of Robert Rossen (1961),
This face through times, that was him.
Still him.
In his CV, epoch is united.
Young people know him mainly from the film Slap Shot of George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, the little orthodox coach of an ice hockey team.
His fans found him in The Hudsucker proxy of the Coen brothers in 1994.
With a final role in 2003 as a Pate of the Irish Mafia in Road to Perdition of Sam Mendes, the circle closed.
In contrast to several cinematographer who have withdrawn from the film world early enough, Newman should remain in the saddle for a long time, and betray Hollywood, his fortune, his prunk and his concessions.
The French film maker Bertrand Tavernier saw him, not without humor, as a living challenge to the 'underplay' when he assessed his far too expressive achievements.
The Metier was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman, which the roles were just flying to for a long time.
However, he played rarely Sunnyboys as an outsider: neurotics, alcoholic, fiasco or desperate, with whose perfect representation he reflected his deflection and his enlightenment.
As director, Newman revealed unknown pages of his true delicate sensitivity.
His Rachel, Rachel of 1968 (after the novel of Canadian Margaret Laurence) with his wife Joanne Woodward in the main role, drew a fine female portrait full of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott by an overdose, devoted his film to Harry and Son in 1984, a work full of affection and sadness.
In the flooding of honours that happened yesterday over Newman, his close friend and former armored friend Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said extremely: 'His presence has improved my life and this country.'
Generosity and joy of life were essential characteristics of the deceased actor.
Apart from his legendary career, there is a great defender of civil rights, environmental protection and independent cinema, a opponent of Hollywoods abduction.
We may have seen him with the foot in shells full of vinaigrette, standing in sauces, pastries or other foods, and thought this was quite tastless, even though we found it still funny at the beginning.
The profits from his sales nevertheless fled into his foundation for children in distress.
Instead of resting on his myth, Newman committed himself until the shot.
He left his five daughters a letter with these sentences: 'Always and to the end your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was an honor to be here. "
And for us it was an honor to be able to pursue the life of such an intelligent and generous American actor.
A prominent citizen, in the closest and broadest sense.
What was produced in the invoice factory of supplement & amp; Co.?
On October 8, the negotiations in the criminal proceedings against János and his associates begin.
The defendant is accused, in particular, of participation in organised crime, and of gross negligible damage and business fraud, and of other criminal acts, including document falsification.
According to the Public Prosecutor, the funds set out in the alerts were used for their own purposes, while the services provided were often documented with counterfeit invoices.
State funds and grants from the self-government - a total of HUF 65 million - are partly to be transferred to the Fiatal Baloldal organisation, partly to the private funds of individuals.
As the investigating authorities announced, fictive invoices were submitted in order to raise the tendering funds and the associations should not have fulfilled their obligations either.
According to the prosecution, most of the bills were forged.
The bills were bought on the market by Józsefváros, the round seals were made in Kiskunhalas.
The decision on which companies the invoices are to be issued was decided on that tour north of the Plattensee to which István Lados was sent by János.
In the course of this "exploration tour," Lados was supposed to explore pensions and restaurants.
He asked for invoices on consumption to be able to issue invoices for the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, and the self-administration of Budapest later.
These invoices should have been manipulated by the majority of István Lados and his compassionate, András. According to our information, the latter should have been responsible for the constitution of the relevant reports.
One of the goals of Lados' "exploratory tour" was a beer site.
As can be seen from two surcharges and cos issued in 2003, the gastronomy operation is supposed to have managed the ninety-headed group of the Biztos Pont Egypesület Association.
Now, however, the head of the company indicates that such a large group would not have fit into the local at once.
Another invoice, issued in the summer of 2002 at the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, later known as Egypt a Harmadik Évezredért, also showed serious form and content errors.
In a bed in Badacsonytomaj, which has only three rooms and can not accommodate more than ten people at the same time, 130 guests should have stayed.
The fantasy of the bills was apparently no limit when it was about the Pigal Kft., a gastronomy operation in which accounting documents of the customers Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá according to the prosecutor didn't appear at all.
As Managing Director Győző Farkas informed the hvg.hu, he was immediately aware that it was counterfeit documents when documents were submitted to him by the Public Prosecutor during an interrogation.
"Our company name and control number were misplaced on the stamp."
And further: Apart from formality errors, the fact that the operation should have accommodated a hundred people after having a total of eleven rooms that are impossible to provide space for so many people was also wrong.
The restaurant was not in service for a long time.
The embodied counterfeiters have also refused to verify that the Budapester travel agency they took in sight only offers travel abroad, and so they have indicated Hungary's travel on the cash account, which also contradicted the company's accounting practice.
In addition, as it became known in the course of the investigation, they also mentioned VAT on invoices, although travel agency services related to a country outside the EU are VAT-free.
The total amount of VAT was incorrect on four invoices issued by the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, since the operation instead of 25 only 15 per cent VAT is charged, and the employees only issue mechanical invoices, but the falsified documents were hand-written.
Another error which was undermined by the "accounting holders" was that in one case "goods transport" had been declared as a performance provided, although this was not offered by the company specialised in investment advice, the Public Prosecutor informed.
Further malformalities - false invoice format, false stamp - were due to the fact that the invoices issued to Egypt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, as well as to XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont could be disclosed as forgery.
Likewise, in the case of Ravenna Bt. and the sports camp Kunfehértó, whose Managing Director ordered never to issue the bills.
Another "mistake" has been undergone the counterfeiters at the HIB Kft. from Nyíregyháza: this society was just in resolution at the time (2001) when the Fiatal Városért Egypesület group was supposed to have eaten there - the massageman therefore indicated that the bills had not been issued itself.
Consciously fake
The other group of accounting officers are people who were well aware that they had to make fictitious bills.
At the request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, the Foundation Esély Budapestért Alapítvány has issued bills for the Foundation Egypt a Harmadik Évezredért, amounting to approximately HUF 4 million.
According to the prosecution, the managing director of the Collab Kft. was persuaded by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, to issue the fictional bills.
The Biogate Kft., which is currently in liquidation, is also expected to have worked with the supplement and Co.: In 2003, the GmbH will have provided the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány Foundation, as well as the clubs Atlasz Egyesület and Vörösfenyő Egypesület with falsified invoices for the total value of HUF 5 million that related to unprovided services.
However, there was also little payment traffic as the invoices were cancelled immediately after the issue, which the parties concerned have forgotten to note in their documents.
The third group of accounting officers shall comprise persons directly linked to the accused.
One of them is Iván Kubatov, the postman of the Ukrainian manager of the Delta Trió Kft, a fuel and vehicle trading company established in Budapest but not detectable there.
This company is expected to have issued several invoices on the sale of computer components for the total value of HUF in the period from October to December 2005.
According to the Investigation Authority, the Cash Investment Kft. from Kiskunhalas, which has been in liquidation since 14 September 2005, is expected to have acted as a buyer of these invoices.
The company's managing director was a Romanian company to which the company documents should also be sent by Iván Kubatov between 2002 and 2005.
According to our information, Kubatov has been able to issue bills on behalf of the GmbH. to the associations Atlasz and Hoppá, as well as to Egypt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány and have cashed their countervalue itself.
The companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and the Jos-Investment Bt. are to have been founded from Romanian Maurers on Iván Kubatov's explicit wish.
In fact, none of these companies were active, however, according to the accused of lack of orders.
However, he was able to benefit from the companies: at the request of his composer, the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who was responsible for preparing the company's founding documents, he issued invoices on behalf of the companies to the associations associated with the contract, such as Atlasz and Y-Generáció.
In total, Kubatov will have issued 15 bills of the total value of HUF 14.2 million on behalf of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade to the organizations.
The Public Prosecutor assumes that Kubatov could have deposited 10% of the bill and VAT.
Kubatov is even supposed to have misused the company Szi-Beri Bt. for the issue of fictional invoices - in this case the invoices were attached to the applications of Biztos Pont.
The company Y-Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért submitted their applications to the non-profit organization of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány ("TMA") in January 2006.
Both of them received 500,000 forint each, but they did not benefit from these amounts.
To cover this, they have submitted five fictive bills to TMA by the Works Team Kft..
By the way, these invoices were ensured during the search of the office of Árpád Kemecsei in the Ministry of Education.
In the negotiations, some accused are now counted with a confession of the procedure of counterfeiting, as they have already been settled before the prosecution.
A sensation could be if the main defendant János decides to grant a comprehensive confession.
His information so far was less detailed, and although he had already pledged to report on everything on several occasions, his confession remains.
So the question remains open whether this is in his interest, whether the Socialists have completed a pact with him regarding the compensation of the majority of the damage caused by HUF 50 million and whether the surcharge is willing to take responsibility in return.
However, it is quite possible that the surcharge now plays the "offended" after his requests for relief of imprisonment and house arrest had encountered deaf ears.
While other criminals who have done far greater damage to economic offences and have not paid for them are on free foot, or at least under house arrest, this possibility remains forbidden.
The psychology of the surrender - or why we are willing to pay more
In auctions, buyers tend to spend more and thus overestimate the error offered.
Neurologers and economists at the University of New York have now managed to discover the neurological-economic foundations of this well-known and apparently irrational behaviour.
According to a study published in the "Science" magazine, people do not want to give themselves into a competition, such as an auction on eBay, and are therefore willing to pay even too high prices.
The researchers have tried to explore the neurological scheme of this "game" with experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers should play lotto while the other participated in one playful action - in both cases the active brain regions of the volunteers were examined using functional magnetic resonance (fMRI).
In both games the participants were able to win money, but an increased activity of the Striatum, a complex below the brains, was measured in the losers of the auction, where the exaggeration of the opponent plays an essential role.
In addition to many other functions, this brain region is responsible for the "self-rewarding" of the nervous system.
The researchers therefore considered that the price increase could be explained by avoiding an overreaction of the strip.
In order to underpin their thesis, economists in the research group have recruited additional research into the pursuit of money.
In this case, three groups should participate against a partner under different conditions.
The control group was informed of the true value of the product and then made their efforts.
Another group was also promised $15 reward, in case they came out of the game as a winner.
The third group received 15 dollars before the auction, which were also lost in the event of a lost game.
So the difference between the two groups was only that the emphasis on one was on winning, while on the other was on losing.
However, as evidence of the hypothesis expressed by Neurologen, the members of the "against losing" group were willing to make higher efforts than those in the control / profit group.
"These results cannot be derived from any previous economic theory.
In fact, the behaviour observed at auctions so far has only been justified by the joy of gaining or avoiding risks.
The contradiction between these two theories was dissolved thanks to the imaging neurological processes, so we now have a third statement ready "- said Andrew Schotter, Professor of the Economics Faculty of the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When to visit the doctor?
In the world, around half a billion people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is listed among the leading causes of death.
The number of infected people is estimated to be hundreds of thousands in this country, but only seven thousand are treated, which is because patients often do not know that they are infected.
Hepatitis is the collective concept of infectious liver disease caused by various viruses.
The symptoms are often similar - liver inflammation and yellowing are common, but the pathogens and diseases differ.
Depending on pathogens, hepatitis B, C and D, the virus can be transmitted by blood and other body fluids (such as sperm, digestion secret or spicy).
In any case, travellers are recommended to vaccinate against viruses A and B, there is no vaccine against virus C.
Symptoms of hepatitis A are shown approximately two to three weeks after consumption of the contaminated food and are generally accompanied by discomfort, weakness, abdominal pain and fracture.
After that, the yellowish occurs on the skin and in the eyes, the chair becomes bright, the urine dark, and recovery can take up to two-three weeks.
About 1 million people die of hepatitis B every year, far more severe diseases such as liver cancer and liver cirrhosis.
The main reason for this is that estimates suggest that only every ten infected person is in drug-free treatment.
Hepatitis C may also have serious consequences: untreated may lead to liver cirrhosis and liver cancer.
Most infected people do not even know about their disease, as the pathogen destroys the liver cells homely - in many cases the first symptoms show after 20-30 years.
Therefore, temporary prevention, such as regular checks, is indispensable.
There are three groups where this disease occurs more frequently: those who had undergone a blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts, and tattoos.
Currently, the number of chronic hepatitis C patients worldwide is estimated at 200 million.
Since the disease is already detectable in a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to visit the physician at the first signs of unknown origin.
Recently recognized, the disease is healing, the virus can be eradicated, causing the risk of infection and preventing the emergence of cancer.
The 30th of September is the World Day of Hepatitis, for the first time organised in 2004 by patients' representations worldwide.
The aim of the action is to raise awareness of these chronic liver inflammation caused by viruses, their emergence and the importance of early detection.
Do believers have less pain?
As recent research results show that religious faith seems like a kind of "painkillers," which should have already facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University have carried out an interesting experiment: it was examined how faith in God influenced the sense of pain of man, reported the British magazine "Telegraph."
In the rather bizarre investigation, 12 faithful and athlests each received electric shocks, while they studied a painting of the Mother of God.
As the results showed, the faithful were able to eliminate most of the pain.
With a brain scanning technology, it was even demonstrated that the Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain that was responsible for pain control.
The study was the first in a research project in which, alongside scientists, philosopher and theologists from different departments of the university also participate.
During the test, the subjects were tied to the left hand of the electric shock.
The participants were asked to focus heavily on two paintings: one picture of God's mother, painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and another Leonardo da Vinci's "Lady with the Hermelin."
The researchers hoped that the face of the Virgin Mary among the faithful would create a kind of religious trance, while she chose da Vinci's image because it was hardly different from the other painting and felt reassuring.
The experimental subjects spent half an hour in a MRI scanner, and at this time received a total of 20 electric shocks in four stages, while they should either look at the religious or the other painting.
The Catholics reported that they felt "safe" at the sight of the Mother of God, as if they were "cared" and they felt "peace and peace."
During the consideration of the religious painting they reported over 12% less pain than when they had Leonardo's work in mind.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who also took part in the attempt, said that you could also produce similar effects with other, highly active images even among the athlests, you just need to find the corresponding photo.
"We need to find a picture that triggers very positive feelings, such as a mother or a father," says the psychologist.
The Anglican bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of research.
"Practicing faith should change our personality, and also in many cases," says Wright.
According to these excellent results, only the question remains what effect a Madonna picture Leonardos or another comparable painter would have on the pain regulation of the faithful.
Would the high-quality Virgin Maria achieve even better results?
You are what you tell about yourself
At its 10th birthday, Google can say with fog and right: it is found in the people's pockets as through their heads in the sky: she knows where people have spent their holidays, to which doctors they go, and what they move.
And so still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of Google's managing directors.
In the direction of sceptics that are plagued by Orwellsche Horrorvisionen, he makes sense: these would just ignore the essence of Web 2.0.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Schmidt recently said that the main objective of Google is to collect even more personal data about the users and thus get closer to the original objective of the company, according to which it wanted to arrange "all information of this world."
Schmidt explained that after ten years of world-changing work Google is still only at the beginning of the information collection.
Asked for the status quo in five years, Schmidt said: he wanted Google to be able to answer questions like "What am I supposed to do tomorrow?" or "What job really fits me?" but software programs are not yet able to do so because they don't know enough about the users.
Not all Internet users are aware that in their Internet searches the search concepts will be registered, as well as the IP addresses from which they have been searched, and the visited pages.
For example, the "Personalized Search" introduced two years ago allows the visitor to store his own search and later use it, so that the hits can be generated much more precisely later, and based on the same logic also the so-called "recommendations" with which the system recommends tailored products and services due to previous preferences.
However, users are wondering what happens in the event of a data abuse - "When you look at what I do" - some people are worried about the Google data monopoly.
In most cases, however, it is rather the potential power represented by the company, which acts as an excitement, and less the guilt or fear of punishment, the pursuit of freedom or the desire to oppose the power encountered by many Internet users.
However, it is a proven fact that the search terms are not only stored, but also passed on to third parties, and in these cases there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet user.
A parade example of this was recent action against paedophilia in Brazil, in which Google provided the Brazilian government with information collected by the community site called "Orkut," which also enabled the paedophilia to be identified.
However, personal rights-related users could still breathe in May when Google, together with the Civil Rights Organization EFF, successfully went against the FBI in court: so Google can also be forced to issue information to the FBI on a secret request in the future with no point of the Constitution.
(However, the Federal Government has successfully produced the publication of 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms, referring to the Youth Protection Act adopted years ago, but it has been withdrawn from the list of individual users, or from their web and search term lists to two months ago.)
So Google's image remains controversial: those who hate to publish their personal data because they fear the loss of their private and intimacy through the use of Google services, the company eats with the disgrace due to the conservative companies.
However, the American "Geek culture," which is present in many countries and invites enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users, the next generation of "cool entrepreneurs" in them, unlike Microsoft, which is thanks to Windows market leader, even if both fight for the same goal.
One possible reason for this is that Google does not demand any identification codes for its users, unlike Microsoft, and provides its services free of charge, so that an open, constantly updated source code and program package seems to be far more attractive, younger and cooler than the official practices of the software giant.
On the other hand, the geeks are looking through the problematic relationship between personal rights and the Internet - a relationship which has been centred on in particular in recent years thanks to the term "Web 2.0."
The "Web 2.0" is about nothing but collaboration, speaking, the users deliberately leave traces and use the available communication channels, and even though the dimensions are individually different, the main thing remains to show themselves publicly.
An average youth can simultaneously manage its profile on several community sports - from Facebook via Xanga, it can connect through other services, such as Twitter, or music services such as last.fm, and can eventually involve all of this in a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. In addition, they can lead blogs that automatically represent the latest photogaleria that are geasted on Flickr or Picasa.
And a number of other examples prove: when looking at the party photos last night, the girlfriend will soon find out who her unfaithful friend enjoyed, or the employee will be dismissed because in his blog he only makes too honest his trouble about corporate management - one is sure: the term "privacy" has now been completely reinterpreted.
Whoever lives an online life is what he reveals from himself - in such a way, you could formulate the basis behind the behavior of today's youth.
And who tries to keep something secret, or even handle the Google monopoly, can like to do it - like with Scroogle, a tool that does access Google's search engine, but deliberately leaves no traces.
Not a few people deliberately do not register on community pages so that they are not detectable, but also the online applications of Google, such as text processing and graphic tools and RSS feeds, can be handled with alternative versions that are not bound to huge server parks and therefore not generate the best possible profile from the user.
However, the public opinion waits for Google to show its true face.
With its current value of USD 156 billion, the company is even ahead of IBM (USD 140 billion), Intel (USD 124 billion) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion), the advertising areas of AdWords / AdSense threaten the revenues of advertising agencies, and the increasingly faster introduced services not only cause head breaks, but also other software developers.
Critical viewers, however, also find the worrying counterpole: For example, the group management has completely rejected a protest by the employees after the company's fees were doubled, and the management also said that the multiple tasting of the employees is too expensive. However, this seems to be quite mild to suggest that Google even went to the knee in 2006 before the Chinese government and agreed to an agreement that all the regimecritical hits, or those who violate good taste, would be filtered out.
The Group's internal rules say that no new service is requested in advance, but only if it is already available. Nevertheless, the events of the coming months and years could be reversed somewhat again: while some think that Google's book and magazine scans or archiving projects are now taking the view that the company will soon have to deal with the Supreme Court, others are rather concerned about the "Health" system that enables the creation of a complete health profile based on findings, doctors and problems.
And the fact that Google is building a genetic database, the next generation of Sci-Fi authors already provides the substance - like "Scroogled," the famous novel of Cory Doctorow describes a future in best orthodox manuscripts in which a person is appalling thanks to Google's data.
Two young people help the double killer of Ózd to eliminate trace
In connection with the double murder of Ózd, the police have now interrogated two young people who are suspected of having helped with the removal of the traces, the spokesman of the police commissioner Borsod informed on Tuesday.
The young people were steadfast and are currently being charged with the aid.
According to information from the MTI news agency, these are two girls who defend themselves freely.
Aid is threatened with an imprisonment of up to five years.
The suspect of the double murder of Ózd, a 23-year-old local man, was arrested on Sunday.
The man is under urgent suspicion of having deliberately murdered several people out of money.
The investigation showed that the 23-year-old had owed a larger amount of money to a 53-year-old.
But the suspect did not want to pay his debt, so he attracted his creditor to a place in Ózd last Wednesday, where he murdered him and his nine-year-old daughter.
According to the MTI, the man has planned the action of a long hand - this also proves the fact that he committed the murders with a weapon hidden at the crime scene.
Together with experts, the police are now investigating the murder weapon and the circumstances of their use.
Warsaw Stock Exchange Sets Purchase Offer for Prague Stock Exchange
About 200 million euros, or 5 billion Czech krones, have offered the Warsaw Stock Exchange for the 100% purchase of the stock packages of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, reaffirmed the offer made by Poland despite the fact that they were previously excluded from the Czechs as potential owners of their stock exchange.
That's why the Warsaw Stock Exchange belongs entirely to the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish State, but they want to sell more than 60% of the papers in the coming months.
According to the Czech newspaper "E15," Poland's offers include the highest purchase price ever offered for the Prague Stock Exchange.
As the newspaper reports, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the German Stock Exchange have so far made offers.
Petr Koblic, head of the Prague Stock Exchange last week said that all the interested parties would probably be the worst new owner of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, and he did not exclude that this could even lead to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague stock exchange to 5-10 billion kroner.
According to the shareholders' agreements, 90% of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the Patria Finance Investment Bank with a 25% stake, followed by the Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 and the Tiger Holding Four S.A.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the perspective of European newspapers
On Tuesday, in their comments on the ever-increasing international financial crisis, some leading European newspapers already spoke of "the second 11 September."
The global financial disaster we have thanked the President of the United States, said about "La Repubblica" - the President had not even been able to get behind his own party for the draft law, which should bring some relief into the scary situation...
Instead of a "new Pearl Harbor," as the billionaire investor Warren Buffett called it, it would be more appropriate to speak of a "second 11 September."
Parts of the press in Madrid also locate the sin buck in Washington.
According to the "El Mundo," the lack of political leadership is due to the fact that the world economy is now at the edge of the collapse.
The American financial system is increasingly threatening to collapse, and the whole world will suffer from it.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but after the vote in the Congress, it threatens Washington to have no political means of crisis management.
The world economy is in the air, just at a time when one of the biggest transformations of the history of capitalism takes place.
One can no longer ignore the threat, such as the Geneva "day scoreboard."
While some states could still provide their money institutions with rescue packages and save banks with taxpayers' money from bankruptcy.
However, if a domino effect is triggered and there are even more banks going down, then no further financial injections, nor any other emergency measures will help.
In the long term, EU Member States would have to jump over their shadows and centralize control over the money markets.
On Monday alone, more than EUR 100 billion were paid out to weakening money institutions, the Vienna recalls "The Standard." Furthermore, the newspaper continues to be more and more realistic that, according to the Americans, European taxpayers would now have to take a little deeper into their pockets to get out of the crisis.
So far, the EU has not seriously dealt with the crisis that is now fading like a tsunami over the old continent.
Although the "saviors" do not have to "wrestle" with several hundred billion euros immediately, it would be advisable to state in which case it would be reasonable to touch the money of taxpayers in order to avoid even greater damage.
Intelligent car imitates the flight of the hummel
What would be the best method for developing new accident prevention technologies if not to imitate the barrier sensors from nature?
For example, the bees.
At the CEATEC in Japan, an amazing project was presented in which the Nissan engineers of lobsters were inspired in the creation of new accident avoidance systems.
In cooperation with Tokyo University Nissan has built the biomimetic system of the type BR23C controlled by autobotters, a mini-car equipped with the characteristics of bees, with the aim of supporting the development of a system that avoids any collisions.
In the flight each bee forms its own, oval "private area," which is very similar to our own "protective shield," said Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for technology PR and research development, at the exhibition.
The composite eye of the bee, which can be seen in every direction and in an angle of more than 300 degrees, plays an important role.
In order to imitate the function of the composite eye, researchers seized the idea of the laser-controlled distance meter.
This identifies obstacles before the BR23C in a face field of 180 degrees within 2 meters, calculates their distances and sends signals to the microprocessor, which immediately initiates the collision avoidance process.
The obstacle is recorded in second fractions, and the autobutter immediately changes the course, similar to the movement of bees, by turning the tyres around the corresponding angle.
Unlike previous systems, this manoeuvre takes place in an instinct manner.
"If it were not, the autopilot could not respond quickly enough to avoid the obstacles," said Toshiyuki Andoh, Head of the Mobility Laboratory and the autopilot project.
The system must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the most inner and vulnerable part of the shield - a layer that is currently considered inevitable within the accident.
The whole process must reflect the behaviour of bees when they avoid other bees.
And this has to run in the fraction of a second.
However, as opposed to the bees, it can not go up, down, or even diagonal - it can only be two-dimensional, only in the direction of the reversibility of the tyres.
While there are infinitely many possibilities for the bees here to avoid other bees, the researchers were able to use only the rotating movement, or acceleration and degradation at the car robot.
The BR23C contains lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and more energy efficient and therefore have a longer lifetime than conventional lithium ion batteries.
Andoh explained that it was about the instinctive, intelligent reaction, and less about the processing of the data, and even less about the ability to store it.
This device only has to process some inputs per second and react accordingly to them.
It does not have to save them, or produce an intuitive, logical reaction by means of previous manoeuvres, so that it constantly only uses a handful of KB memory.
There is no need for gigabyte and megabyte-heavy memories.
This is the first step in the development of immediate collision prevention technology, which according to Nissan will be in production in the next ten years.
A further application could find the technology in GPS satellite navigation by deliberately directing the driver around obstacles and thus leading him to the goal.
A name for the sinful child
Now the written version of the 700 billion dollar heavy rescue package is available, which will be applied in several stages and will aim to purchase the bad loans of the banks.
In the first passage, half of the money is to be spent.
At a meeting which ended Saturday after midnight, the East Coast, the Congressmen, after several days of debates on an agreement on the 700 billion dollar heavy rescue package, reported to Reuters.
"We have made significant progress," said Nancy Pelosi, President of democracy in the American House of Representatives, and said that the agreement should only be put to paper.
The compromise reached on the rescue package supported both presidential candidates - Barack Obama and John McCain.
Minister of Finance Henry Paulson said that the programme will be effective and it will be efficient, but one has to do more. According to Pelosi, this is not about saving the Wall Street, but about tearing the rudder of the economy.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of Asian markets, so, Washington time Sunday 8: 00 (Central European time Monday 2: 00), but did not trigger a flight of altitude on the stock exchanges.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will first vote on the 2008 draft law on stabilising the economy, and then the Senate will be on the line.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday night, and the White House also welcomed the news of the agreement.
We are satisfied with the progress made at night and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilise our markets and protect our economy, said Tony Fratto, speaker of the White House.
However, the programme differs from the Bush administration's initial recommendation that the $700 billion should be spent at once for the purchase of cowardly, borrowed securities.
In a first instalment, a maximum of half of the 700 billion amount is to be spent, with 250 billion available immediately after the Congress is expected to vote on the Causa on Monday. This sum is to be spent on the purchase of credit-burdened bad securities, and the further $100 billion is to be decided by the President.
The programme is reviewed by a separate Commission, which also belongs to the President of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the 700 billion depends on a further decision of the Congress.
Under the law, the Ministry of Finance may also apply a combined tactics: it can purchase poor loans, mortgages and mortgages, or other "toxic" loans at the same time.
As reported by the competent persons of the Ministry, purchases can be made in both an auction and directly.
The law enables the companies concerned to participate in an insurance programme in which the Ministry of Finance guarantees the alarming funds, and to pay the companies corresponding fees to the expected damage.
Henry Paulsen said: The law defines the necessary funds so that up to 700 billion dollars can be made available as an emergency aid to the American financial system, whether it is for the large-scale purchase of bad funds, their insurance, or the avoidance of a system risk caused by the collapse of a larger financial institution.
We take the necessary steps to be ready to introduce the law as soon as it has been signed, says Paulson.
However, the leaders of the banks in difficulty and now designated for state aid can expect that their finishes, which are called Salopp "Golden Handshake" in the overseas line, are reduced by the government.
There will only be a reduction in salaries in certain cases and these reductions will depend on how the Ministry of Finance will help each other.
The reduction essentially means that when the Ministry purchases in auction, the "Golden Handshake" is taxed, unless the paid head of the bank is transferred to the pension.
In the event of a direct purchase of lousy loans, the government will take aggressive action to ensure that management salaries are not exaggerated.
The picture also includes that the existing Golden Handshake treaties are not changed - the restrictions relate only to new agreements so that more people participate in the programme.
This is the first case in American history that reductions in management salaries are regulated by law, the Democrat Barney Frank, Chairman of the Financial Committee, commented on the measure.
The State gains shareholding rights in participating banks so that the risk to taxpayers decreases as they can also participate as soon as the economy and thus the rescued bank are getting better.
The draft law provides that the President will have to present a proposal to the Congress over the next five years on how taxpayers should recover their lost money from the financial sector.
There were, however, sceptics on both sides who expressed their doubts about the plan.
This is not what the American citizens expect us to do, the plan does not protect the money of taxpayers, according to the California Republican Darrell Issa.
His colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, said that the measures were driven by the same people who are also responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continued to rise
Like the Central Statistical Office, domestic sales prices rose by 0.1 per cent in August 2008 compared to the previous month, and compared to August 2007, by 12.9 per cent.
Export prices were 1.1 per cent higher than those in July 2008 and fell by 3.9 per cent compared to previous year's prices.
Due to price changes in the domestic and export sectors, production prices were 0.7% higher than in the previous month and 3.2% higher than in 2007.
Domestic sales prices have only slightly increased compared to the previous month, i.e. by 0.1 per cent.
The sales prices of the manufacturing industry also increased little - 0.1 per cent - since July.
The biggest price increase in August 2008 was for leather products (2.8 per cent) - mainly for bags and belts - here the increase was 4.6 per cent, and for footwear prices rose by 2.5 per cent.
Higher prices for plastics and chemical commodities significantly increased prices for chemicals and production (1.6 per cent).
A fall in prices was recorded in crude oil processing (1.4 per cent), in electrical and technical equipment (0.9 per cent) and in wood processing (0.1 per cent).
Prices in paper production, publishing and printing remained unchanged.
In other branches of the manufacturing industry, a price increase was measured between 0.2 and 0.9 per cent.
In the major domestic markets in industry, such as electricity, gas, steam and water supply, prices increased by 0.3 per cent in August, mainly as a result of the increase in gas prices introduced on 1 July.
If the domestic sales markets of the manufacturing industry are taken into account in the annual comparison, prices in crude oil processing have increased most (32.4 per cent).
In the metal processing sector, a 13.2% increase was observed, while the increase in the production of food, beverages and tobacco was 11%.
A fall in prices was observed in the textile industry (2.5 per cent) and in electrical and technical equipment (0.3 per cent).
The level of depreciation in the other manufacturing industries ranged from 0.6 to 9.1 per cent.
Overall, prices in manufacturing industry climbed by 10.2 per cent last year.
Prices for electricity, gas, steam and water rose by 18.7 per cent compared to the previous year.
On the domestic market, the highest price increase in the investment goods sector was recorded in August (0.7 per cent).
In the consumer goods production sectors, prices rose by 0.3 per cent, while in the energy and further processing sectors they remained the same as in the previous month.
The largest price increase in August 2008 was observed in the energy and reuse sector compared to the 2007 comparison period (16.8 per cent).
A price increase of 6.8 per cent has been recorded in consumer goods sectors, with a price reduction of 1.4 per cent in investment goods.
The export prices of the industry measured in Forint increased by 1.1 per cent in August compared to the previous month, but there was a decrease of 3.9 per cent in the annual comparison.
The domestic currency was weakened by 1.7 per cent compared to the euro, the dollar by 7.1 per cent, and compared to the course of August 2007, it became 7.5 per cent compared to the euro, even by 15.9 per cent.
No more visa to the USA from 2009?
Kinga Göncz sees good opportunities for the US-Hungarian visa agreement to enter into force on 12 January, as the Foreign Minister explained in front of the representatives of the Hungarian community in Chicago.
In their view, "now only depends on the timely introduction of the electronic immigration or control system in the overseas countries."
However, it also stressed that there will be no entry permit in the new system, but tourists would have to register in advance.
The leader of Hungarian diplomacy is currently conducting negotiations in Washington.
She meets Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, who will give her the "middle-earning cross with star" of the Republic of Hungary, and she also talks with the foreign political advisors of the Democratic Barack Obama and the Republican presidential candidate John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain support rescue package for banks
Barack Obama and John McCain, the two presidential candidates of the great American parties, pledged their support for the $700 billion heavy rescue package for banks on Sunday, but there are also politicians who demand the resignation of the Minister of Finance.
The Congress and government representatives announced that they have reached an agreement on the bank rescue package on Sunday morning after the days of Marathon's discussions.
The Wall Street crisis, as well as the emergence of the frozen credit market, became the key issues of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain - both claim to be better than the respective opponent to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
After recent surveys, Obama was able to further expand his leadership thanks to the economic topics, while McCains Hoch, who gave him the presentation of Vice-President candidate Sarah Palin after the Republican Convention, melted to it.
At a campaign event in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that the Congress will adopt the 700 billion dollar heavy package quickly.
He emphasised that the plan also includes the passages of consumer protection that it has supported.
"We need to act now, and it is responsible (...) - your jobs, your savings, whole industries, and the stability of the entire economy is threatened," he said before 35,000 spectators.
He did not fail to call McCain's economic vision "obsolet."
In an interview given to ABC, McCain said: "We will all have a hard time to kick (...) but nonstun is certainly not an alternative."
The Republican Senator said that the plan also requires the establishment of a control commission for the Minister of Finance, as well as the limitation of the arrangements for top managers - something that he had insisted on.
The CBS told Obama that McCain had not played a definitive role in the negotiations, but he, Obama, who was in contact with the minister.
On Sunday, the speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, informed us that the House of Representatives is likely to vote on the draft law on Monday.
Press review of the German-speaking area
The right camp is intact, only the voters were more confident within the camp - so commented "The Mirror" the weak performance of the CSU in Bavaria.
In Austria, Haider and Co are ready to rule to prevent a red-black coalition.
The mirror (mirrors)
In the online edition of the German news magazine located on the left, Franz Walter analyzes the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article "Bayern's Revolution destroys its fathers."
According to the famous politologist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber-Duo took over his office.
The Christian Social have renewed Bavaria for decades - now the modern citizens are turning away from them.
The epoch break is at the same time a problem of Christian democracy, as is Angela Merkel.
It was not surprising that the CSU's disaster came to an end on Sunday, but it was quite exactly ten years ago: the unequivocal hegemony of a state party.
For ten years ago, 1998, the CSU has reached 47.7 percent and has been falling below the fifty percent brand since the fifties.
This was repeated three years ago at the 2005 Bundestag elections, so still in the much quoted Stoiber era.
The modernization consistently operated by the CSU in the Federal Republic has finally destroyed their own mothers and fathers.
Sociologists had already predicted this 40 years ago, but in this case it was considerably estimated at the pace. However, without any effect, secularization, educational success, the admission of East and North German to the prosperous regions of Bavaria could not remain faithful to CSU voters.
Modernisation always goes hand in hand with option propagation, and that has political consequences.
The right camp is intact - only the voters within the camp became more critical and self-sufficient.
It is noticeable that in recent weeks the classical civil groups have expressed the greatest distance to the CSU: the free professions, the commercial citizenship and voters with graduation such as university graduation.
Here, CSU support fell to less than 40 percent.
The press (diepresse.com)
The Conservative Vienna Daily Newspaper reports in its "Who with whom? Parteichefs withholding in coalition issues" titled articles on the chaotic internal political situation in Austria after the new elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits SPÖ's interference in internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open to conversations in all directions, while the Greens do not yet want to set up a coalition.
The new elections are over, and now everything is about the coalition; in the debates on public television, the party leaders hardly looked in their cards.
SPÖ Chief Werner Faymann reaffirmed his desire to negotiate with the OPP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is very well possible - in some Länder and in the social partnership this is already the case.
The question of whether he could introduce himself to a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current head of the ÖVP as a vice chancellor, left Faymann open.
As he said, the voters would have chosen the bowl-molterer course.
Repeat this direction would not be possible.
However, Molterer has responded carefully to red offers.
The cooperation could not be fruitful, he said, if Faymann tries to interfere in internal concerns of the ÖVP.
Whether his party is in opposition or in the coalition, it is currently completely open, and these issues should be discussed internally by ÖVP.
BZÖ Chief Jörg Haider appeared open in all directions.
"To prevent red-black, we are ready to assume government responsibility," says Haider.
Járóka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be interrupted
Today, the European Summit on Equal Opportunities has begun in Paris, which is being held today by the EU Presidency of France.
In its speech to the plenary, Lívia Járóka, Member of the European People's Party of Fidesz, drew particular attention to the segregation of education, as this is one of the most serious violations of law affecting Roma children, and this is also the main obstacle to their application.
The High Level Conference was opened by French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, Xavier Bertrand, on behalf of the French Presidency, and Vladimir Spidla, Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among the participants were representatives of governments, European social partners, as well as the most important European legal and civil organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
As the press office of the Members of the European Parliament of the Fidesz reports, Járóka has pointed out that, in addition to discrimination in job search, Roma would be displaced from the labour market primarily because of their low level of education.
"The vast majority of Roma young people do not have secondary education, and thanks to poor primary education, only a small part of them can graduate in higher education."
Furthermore, Járóka stressed that education was a fundamental human right that would play a key role in the creation of other human rights.
Investments in early education of Roma children could strengthen the economy of the EU Member States.
The MEPs believe it is important that this link be made aware of as broad a circle as possible - i.e. Roma and non-Roma.
Because the sooner a Roma student starts school, the greater its chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market, and through income and turnover tax they contribute to national expenditure.
"As citizens of the Union, Roma must be guaranteed the right to high-quality education - poor and segregated education must be stopped" said Lívia Járóka.
As the honourable Member said, a common, objective and action-oriented approach of the European Union is necessary to accelerate the deegregation process in the education sector, and it is essential that the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives are properly respected.
"We need to break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation, and unemployment and give Roma children the democratic opportunity to contribute to the future of Europe as fully qualified citizens," Járóka called for.
Since the Berlin Congress last year, the summit has been organised annually with the aim of creating a unique forum for the advance of the objectives of equal opportunities and freedom of discrimination at European and national levels, in the sense of the European Year of Equal Opportunities.
CSU: Mercy in time
At the end of October the fate of the fallen Duos Huber-Beckstein will be decided
In spite of the debris of the election, no heads have yet been rolled, at the top of the Bavarian CSU the human resources debates have been delayed.
Parteichef Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Beckstein remain in their offices, the question is only how long this grace lasts.
The fate of the Tandem after the catastrophic 17% loss of vote is decided at the last October weekend at the extraordinary party day.
The well-trained duo, however, already made it look through that it does not want to stick on their seats.
This is what they want to enforce the angry group and the party base, which called for personal consequences one day after the "Bavarian tsunami" in view of the loss of absolute majority.
Five years ago, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, the Christian Social Union reached 60.7 percent. Now, one year after the coup against Stoiber, they were able to secure only 43.4 percent of the votes.
For 46 years, CSU was a "sole government" in Bavaria, which generated 18 percent of German GDP.
Although the Conservatives remain the decisive force in the southern federal state which is also important for the Hungarian economy, they will have to rule in a coalition in the future.
As the first sign of the partially internal restructuring, the potential successor Hubers, Vice President and Federal Minister Horst Seehofer will also be involved in the exploratory team, which leads with the liberal FDP, or the right-wing "free voters" exploratory talks on a possible Munich coalition.
An irony of fate is that with the list "Free voters," those Gabriele Pauli comes into the legislature whose anti-fabric appearance used the Huber-Beckstein Duo first to conquer the target politician without mercy.
The CSU leadership now focuses all its forces on the stabilisation of Beckstein.
In this transition process, Stoiber, who has so far pulled the threads out of the background, will play an active role. The former Prime Minister and CSU President called the "bitter day of his political career" on September 28.
On Monday, Huber made a few poisonous comments towards CDU - he believes the CSU would have deserved much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a signal to the CDU and hence to Angela Merkel.
If the CSU, which has also contributed a great deal to success at national level in 2005, is not restored with a common force, Merkel cannot become a Chancellor after the Bundestag elections in September 2009.
Merkel, who has not made a heal of her disappointment over the fiasco, believes that the terrain loss of the CSU will not have a negative impact on the great coalition in Berlin.
However, what is relative is that the wounded CSU will not be easier to rule, and the crisis of the Social Democrats continues.
With 18.6 percent, the SPD has achieved its best result in Bavaria since 1946.
Lukashenko opposition: 110-0
In the elections on Sunday, no member of the opposition came to the Ukrainian Parliament.
Russian observers believe that this is due to prosperity and stability in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but the OECD presumes that there are legal inconsistencies in the counting of votes.
The OECD, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognise the elections.
Although the legislature of the 10 million inhabitants of the country has come out for decades without opposition. Nevertheless, the counterparty gathered under the name of "United Democratic Forces" (ODS) before yesterday's elections has been seriously hoping that Lukashenko, who was already renewing his presidential mandate for the fourth time during the unclean elections and thanks to a constitutional change in 2006, would "allow some of the opposition members in Parliament this time."
Therefore, the ODS even distanced from the previously planned boycots.
Ukraine is becoming economically dependent on Russia's increasing prices for gas imports. In order to reduce price increases, it has even received loans, and it has also agreed to sell Beltransgas, the owner of the country's leading gas pipeline, to the Russians. In the context of the expectations of the opposition, therefore, the hope was that Ukraine wanted to improve its relationship with the EU, after Lukashenko and other high-level politicians had been granted a ban on entry into the EU because of the anti-democratic system.
A temporary relaxation was achieved by the OECD election evaluation report, in which the emphasis was rather on positive movements rather than on the shortcomings - such as the exclusion of a third of the opposition candidates from the elections.
However, the OECD's rapid report criticized the campaign on Monday - so opposition people may not appear in the press - and in particular the fact that the opposition was not allowed to be present in the counting of votes.
Despite all this, the opposition can recognise an improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been put on the loose foot, and Minsk is even ready for smaller confrontations with Moscow by continuing to refuse to recognise the independence of the separating Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abchasia, although Russia, with which Ukraine is a federal state on paper, has been considered independent for a month.
"We have taken two steps forward and one backwards, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," said Alexander Milinkevich to our paper.
In the view of the opposition candidate of the 2006 presidential elections, a continuation is desirable, although "the powerful have been afraid to leave only one opposition in Parliament."
The opposition is not planning protest measures in view of the results, but rather trying to clarify the need for economic reform for voters.
"We have many problems here - the opposition newspapers must be printed in Russia, the local authorities put us in the way of the distribution of stones, but yet I see that more and more people support change, even the elderly," Milinkevich said in an impression that not even the most supported shift of the pensioners is in agreement with the Lukashenko regime, whose only merit is the production of social security.
"Thanks to the country's debt and the increase in the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time until the" social security "which is called for to be crushed to the silence of a cemetery," Milinkevich said.
Unlike opposition politicians, Russian observers have described the elections as democratic.
Sergej Lebedev, Head of the Mission of the Community of Independent States, said to the news agency Ria Novosti: "People believe the deeds and not the words." The lack of opposition is therefore a proof of the maturity of the white Russian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on breakfast will be made before work"
For the first time in the history of the Palazzo Chigi there are rotating doors for the entrances and exits of officials.
As of today, the measure will come into force against those slumbers who stamp first and then go coffee drinks during working time.
The new anti-faulpelz law was presented today by Renato Brunetta, Minister for Public Administration and Mauro Masi, Secretary-General of the Council of Ministers.
">" Rotable doors are a means of increasing labour efficiency through a higher attendance rate and more services, "said Minister Brunetta.
"Now a new era of responsibility and transparency begins.
This is reformism, "Brunetta reiterates.
With the Palazzo Chigi the establishment ends in all the buildings of the Bureau of the Council of Ministers.
Masi says: "The choice of the rotating doors is also of great symbolic value."
There was no resistance from officials, the Secretary-General assured: "This process was supported by all, cooperation came from all sides."
All in all, there is no more breakfast during working time; no more coffee or croissant.
Brunettas says with a smile about this: "A good cappuccino at 7 o'clock seems miraculous."
At a meeting of the Supreme Committee of Public Administration (Scuola Superiore della Pubblica Amministrazione)
from Rome, the Minister announces that "within three months, the absence of officials has been reduced to 50%, i.e. 60,000 more people per year are present at work."
It adds that it is necessary to strengthen the efficiency of the Italian public administration
"their wage dynamics - according to the Minister - have been twice as large in the last 8-10 years as the private sector and far above the inflation rate."
Meanwhile, thousands of officials have gathered together to counteract the Brunetta decree in the context of the vocation supported by Codacons.
"While the Minister of Public Service is profiling with figures about lower absences in work - as the Consumer Centre writes - the people of the 'active faulpelze' are constantly growing.
In fact, thousands of correct and valuable civil servants of the public service have gathered together to explain the war to the unlawful standards of the decree. "
In particular, the Regional Administrative Court (TAR) is fighting for additional financial compensation for work-related illness, including the planned extension of the obligatory house arrest of the sick worker during which checks can be made and other aspects of the Minister's innovations are contested.
Napolitano: "Prevention of accidents at work is crucial"
Every day, there are 2500 accidents at work in Italy, three people die and 27 remain invalid for life.
For 2007, the Inail data (Istituto nazionale contro gli infortuni sul lavoro) confirm that the fatal accidents at work were about 1200.
These figures show the seriousness of a phenomenon, which causes almost twice as many deaths as caused by murders.
Today, the Anmil (Associazione Nazionale Mutilati e Invalii del Lavoro) will take the 58th National Day for the victims of accidents at work in all provinces of Italy in order to draw the attention of social institutions and media to this dramatic situation.
"The worrying data distributed by Anmil and the tragic news of these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at work is." The President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano confirms in his communication to the President of the Amil (Associazione nazionale mutilati ed invalii del lavoro) Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses its "great appreciation of the constant commitment to preventing jobs, protecting the injured workers, supporting the families of the victims and raising awareness of public opinion."
"A disgraceful" basta "has arisen on this; understandably, in the case of tragedies that, in terms of their size, trigger some wiring in the media and public participation. However, everyday reality often confronts us with dramatic events that can even repeat in their own dynamics."
Napolitano does not conceal that "there is certainly a resource problem: it must be invested decisively in education and information."
A particular importance has been attached to the numerous initiatives for a more direct awareness in the school framework by young people who are nourishing for work.
It is our duty to draw attention to this phenomenon and not to distract it from its social seriousness. It is necessary to put into effect and improve a legislative standard.
On the other hand, the President of the Chamber of Gianfranco Fini has emphasized "how the phenomenon of labour-related deaths is an urgent social emergency which insults all of us and forces all institutions to work on determined rules that aim to put an end to the problem."
"The data of accidents at work seem to signal a slight improvement, but this does not exclude the fact that the number of work-related deaths is far too high," emphasises the President of Anmil, Pietro Mercandelli.
"We do not want this" positive trend "to mean less attention. That is exactly what causes the tragedy at the end."
"How do you believe that you are basically doing too little to counter the phenomenon of accidents? You can fight against it through various actions.
We believe that stronger controls and inspections are necessary - so Mercandelli - but also stronger measures to clarify the workers who are already starting at school. "
"A further effort is needed - he added - in terms of communication and awareness of public opinion.
But above all, a greater sense of responsibility from employers to a phenomenon which is a social emergency is required. "
Mercandelli also insisted on "the progressive deterioration of the protection of the victims of accidents at work" and called on the "abolition of the social system that we have been fighting against in recent years."
"The aim is therefore to give the worker a guarantee to insurance so that the fate of the victim of an accident at work is not dependent on voluntary or random donations decided by a legislator at the time."
Mp3 player under charges: risk of hearing damage
Loud music over a longer period of time with portable music devices, such as Mp3 players, can lead to permanent hearing damage.
This is what the European Commission reports, which quotes the opinion of the Csrseri (Scientific Committee on the current and recently identified health risks) of the EU in a report published today in Brussels.
"From the report - it says in a note - it becomes clear that 5-10% of those who hear music with portable music equipment for at least five years a week over an hour a day risk the permanent loss of their hearing."
"I am concerned that such a large number of young people, who usually put portable music devices and mobile phones on a high volume, will be hearing without knowing it irrevocably damaging," said Meglena Kuneva.
"The scientific findings - so it is said by the European Union - show a clear risk that urges rapid action.
What really matters is to raise consumer awareness and make this information public.
In view of these scientific findings, we need to re-examine the existing control systems so that they are fully effective and take steps with the new technology. "
Brussels had commissioned the independent scientific committee in view of the widespread use of portable musical equipment among young people.
"The scientists - thus concluding the EU Communication - confirm that the European Commission is too concerned and that, together with the other EU members and stakeholders, the necessary measures will now be examined to better protect children and young people from the noise that comes from portable musical equipment and similar equipment."
There is already a European standard that limits the level of noise from portable music devices to 100 dB. The concern about the damage that could result from excessive noise.
It is very possible to limit these damage to solutions such as the reduction of the volume and the length of the noise exposure.
In its report, the Eu's Scientific Committee points out that when users of portable music devices hear only five hours a week (louder than 89 decibel) music so that the legal limits are already exceeded in relation to the maximum noise level at the workplace.
Those who cross this border risk the complete loss of hearing within five years.
This therefore affects 5-10% of users of such devices, whose number can be estimated at between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Roma, Alemanno gives the launch to the "Commission for the Future of the Capital"
We're starting today, in March it's supposed to be over, in June it's taking stock.
This is the course established by the chapter for the work of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome." This morning the Commission met in the new seat behind the Caracalla therms.
In six months, President Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will prepare the guidelines for Rome.
As soon as the project is completed, the City Council and the Municipality Council will assess the analyses and projects to be able to present the strategic plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the capitol and Supreme Mayor Gianni Alemanno in June.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural opinions are represented in it," - emphasises Alemanno. "It will present proposals for a development plan for Rome, whose political leaders remain the city and the municipal council.
There is no redistribution of responsibilities, only the will to have a place where you can develop a large project for Rome.
In March, its task will be ended and the Commission will resolve again, as such a project must have a timely end point.
In June - as the Supreme Mayor announces - we will present the strategic plan in which we will use the work done by the Commission. "
Those who question the Commission's competence, because their opinion is not binding, say Alemanno: "Everything depends on the work that the Commission will do and on the quality of its proposals.
If, as in France, the Attali Commission provides qualitative results - and this will certainly be the case in Rome - then its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics deals with everyday problems and emergencies that occur from time to time.
We, on the other hand, want to have a longer period to work seriously with in a deeper perspective on the development of Rome and the future of the city. "
The Supreme Mayor of Rome attaches great importance to clarifying the following: "This Commission is neither a useless facility nor a wreck: it is absolutely free, it will not cost the Roman citizens a cent and it will make us think. It will employ the best heads of the capital."
According to Alemanno, "it is necessary to have a strategic plan that is neither hermetic nor static to allow our city a quality leap - which it really needs - and thus to take a joint step into the future."
A future, such as the Supreme Mayor of Rome, which "will not only be confined to the current local borders but will look much further," not only as regards the role of Rome as a metropolitan and political capital of Italy, but also as the future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean. "
Obama - the first anti-American President? Here a statement
A well-known American politician, who is much about being considered independent, wrote: "Barack Obama becomes the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who dictated by his decisions, the US economy, and had relations with the enemy Islam (and still does this as a private man today). "
The attacks against Obama are becoming more and more severe, right now that the elections are approaching.
A lady from Miami wrote on an Internet page: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama is very naughty: he thinks he will receive the highest office of a nation that has seen two black governors and five black senators! "
However, these attacks do not actually have much to say; they are racist attacks and they do not answer the electoral question: will he be a good president? And then there are also the surveys; all say that Obama will win with a great advance.
Even in this case, there are people who speak with the heart and not with the head.
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the deepest south of the United States, has written in its editorial: only in the electoral cabin will we probably know who the real American patriot will give his voice.
Here comes a mindset from the United States, which has been hid until the last time.
"Say what you want, then we will decide who we will make our cross for, whether for Obama or for McCain."
There are people who swear: if Obama wins, we will emigrate from America.
Something you never heard before - only now that the success of the black candidate seems so safe.
In any case, despite all these considerations, the final weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
1500 people were questioned: what mistakes has Bush made during his term of office? 89% have answered: the war in Iraq.
America is changing.
The nation lost 50000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent back home with a step into the ass.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers have lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack.
Nevertheless, Iraq remains for the majority of Bush's weaknesses.
The one who will take his place is facing a huge task.
USA. The financial collapse also leaves its traces with journalists: in the newspapers you can already feel the reductions. And many accuse the Internet, the "killer" of the press.
Five hundred American journalists were questioned by the PEW Research Center about their situation and their mental control about the future.
Today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
Nevertheless, they did not express any real concern about the general credibility of the information relating to those responsible.
They don't feel as lonely as they used to be.
The problem for the American journalists is the money.
The 2008 crisis is a crisis for these journalists of an economic model that has been destroyed.
In addition, the major problems arising from the reductions to the Newsroom, that is, the space in which the editors work to compile the newspaper.
This is a problem that needs to be resolved - as the journalists interviewed - if you want to prevent traditional journalism from shrinking significantly, as the large audience understands it.
A clear but complicated pessimism today meets the American journalist.
Six out of ten journalists and executive seniors in the press believe that journalism is on the wrong track at national level.
In the local area, the executives are even 65%.
Printed versus Broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to imagine the direction of the web.
The most important publishing groups are the way to the Internet, which is seen by many as the "killer" of the press.
The "economic pressure" that journalists feel has risen by up to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists have admitted to want to join the new technology, hoping "they bring something good for journalism."
The biggest crack exists in American journalism today between the head editors of the newsroom and the reporters who work for them.
56% of the head editors at national level are sure, their reporters share their values with them, while they are only 23% at local level.
Some think it has to do with "safety at work."
The managers who are afraid to lose their work within three years are 47% at national level.
The journalists are 30%.
The topic of "safe work" in the team (our "editors," Anm.d. Red.) is always a topical topic in the USA.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation, as the United States is, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio and TV broadcasters and Internet operators, employers offer as they like and so it will be a question of take it or leave it.
The editors get very often very high wages, but the editor can sometimes only get EUR 10000 per month, including pension and insurance funds.
As far as vacation is concerned, it is complicated: a certain amount of days in the first year, so and so many after the third, to finally reach 15 holidays after a certain number of years.
But the American journalists, as they admit themselves, often become "sick" over the course of the year.
It's a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: COURT IN THE ROOM: DANILO COPPOLA PLEAKED IN GROTTAFERRATA
The President of the second Chamber of Criminal Tribunal in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the request of the real estate broker, who had asked to be moved from Grottaferrata to Rome.
It is determined against Coppola for bankruptcy in the context of the investigation of the counter-agreement in the case of the acquisition of Unipol-Bnl..
In the course of the trial against him during the last week, his release from the house arrest was converted into a residence obligation in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella had asked to allow the real estate broker to be moved from the provincial city to an apartment in the capital.
According to the court, such referrals (against which the prosecutor had spoken) could give him the opportunity to influence his society and to get to him probative evidence.
The elite is in danger
The phenomenon was revealed a few days ago when the Chamber of Representatives voted against the White House's 700 billion dollar savings package: a large part of the Americans was and is more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This confirms yesterday's edition of the New York Times, which reports how the crisis in the run evolves the Republican Party, which is increasingly divided into its old and moderate East Coast soul, which always favoured the state institutions and the business community and those neo-conservative who are hostile to "those in Washington" and the financial world and, for example, wins voters in the south and center of the states.
This part of the party owes its rise v. a. to the voice of the one I mentioned above.
However, this example mentioned just now is only a small part of the major changes that the current economic earthquake announces or even represents: not only in the United States, also throughout the West, and perhaps beyond it will be affected by it.
Both in the states and in Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the long-feared events that are finally taking shape and coming to light under these new conditions.
The first of these phenomena is the new discovery, the unheard renaissance of the state in conjunction with a kind of renationalisation of the economy.
In fact, the crisis means a deterioration in banking and financial institutions which have close links to abroad and at the same time manage an enormous amount of private household assets that live in a single state.
This means a direct political problem for the governments: the way in which the families concerned are acting, which are also a huge electoral mass.
So the crisis appears economically global, but politically it is almost purely national.
Political internationalism seems to have been distracted and lost its right to speak: the illuminating proof of this has been given by the EU, which, due to its duplication in various national and international conflicts, does not find a common way.
Therefore, everyone is now expecting the intervention of their own state; rescue plans, new rules, and e.g. distribution of aid funds: since the crisis has become more and more serious, only the United States is in the economic situation to be saved without foreign aid.
In addition to the funds, they also have the legitimacy to use them: so two non-revaluable conditions - under certain circumstances - to which no international organisation or market will otherwise be able to rely in a similar way.
The new emphasis placed on the state-national element is, moreover, in perfect consistency with the growing importance that is recently brought into the economy with a closely related sector: territoriality.
Paradoxical is it now that we were so convinced that we have long entered a network of networks, in a realm of increasingly differentiated technologies, of intangible materials, that we must suddenly find out how our future will depend more and more on the essential material things: water, harvest and oil.
These can certainly all be transported from one place to the other of the world, but they are still at the outset connected with a narrow-written piece of earth - a territory.
Therefore, the person who has such a territory is in favour of another person who lives in an area without harvest, without water or with oil.
I now come to the second novelty, which, however, requires a short delay.
Whoever's territory, who's government, who's saying politics, says leadership.
In this sense, the financial crisis seems to create two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, there is the knowledge of the need for respected leaderships, that is, the need for someone who knows how to regulate things.
On the other hand, there is now a wave of enthusiasm over the existing guided tours, e.g. those of the economy, which have emerged as insufficient and full of shadow zones.
Finally, there is a deeper and in some respects still worrying aspect: a loss of confidence, an intolerance, an image of inconvenience, a feeling of distance, all of which is aimed at a whole class of managers of the Western countries.
It seems to be the conviction among large parts of the population that it is not only the actions of the social elite, but its ideological world, its Way of Life, its culture in the broadest sense of the word, whose salary is more and more stranger than ever.
The demand for leadership is therefore underground for a desperate but powerful movement of the demagogy of the leading class and the traditional political establishment. This manifests itself in unforeseen "revolts" of voters and in the unmediated reverse of the collective state of mind of the last time: starting with the rise of the Conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, over the collapse of the Labour Party in the UK, towards the rebellion of the American Members against Bush (and perhaps also the victory of the rights in Italy plays a role here).
One gains the impression that the old elite, its parties, their programs, but also its rites, magazines, intellectual creditors, some would say their format, more and more understanding problems, and therefore less representative of what is going on today in the lower social layers of the West and is being driven by the financial crisis even more and to overdimensionality.
In view of all of this, it would be simply excessive to speak of a "rebellion of masses."
But keeping your eyes wide open is certainly not.
The supersticker that lets up to walls
To defeat the forces of gravity thanks to an adhesive and to climb up walls like Superman.
This is the subject of four American research centres, one of which seems to have reached the target.
With a glue placed on an area of only 2.5 qcm, researchers managed to fix a 100 kg heavy body on a vertical wall.
The STUDIO - an American magazine has published the results of researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material found by the research team is a further development of the adhesives already used, which use a special carbon structure called carbon nanorubes.
"The adhesive principle can be introduced as a series of spaghetti-arranged pipes," explains Zhong Lin Wang from the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists have been inspired by the feet of the Geckos, which are covered by microscopic hardening, which give the animal a perfect stop.
The tests carried out with various materials such as glass Teflon and grinding paper have shown that the new adhesive is ten times stronger than the durability of the feet of the reptiles and at the same time "easily removes from the wall," says Liming Dai, researcher of the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Dayton.
"This material could be used as a prevailing adhesive," Liming Dai adds.
Like Spiderman on walls? Perhaps, but the researchers think more of a less fascinating benefit, such as the connection of electrical equipment, because the nanorecs are also heads of heat and electricity.
Other indications could fall within the area of space.
So for the moment, the superheroes still have to wait.
THE OTHER ART OF RESEARCH - also the University of Berkeley, California, dedicates itself to a new type of adhesive.
In an article of the American Chemical Society, California scientists present a adhesive of microfibres that cleanse themselves like hair by moving on a surface even from the dust and thus always preserve perfect liability.
Medicines: never take with fruit juice
Be careful with grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These beverages, which are consumed due to their refreshing quality and vitamin potency e.g. in the summer, can cause serious health damage when they are taken at the same time with certain vital medicines, as they can affect the absorption of these by the body in an extremely extreme way.
David Bailey, Professor of the University of Western Ontario in London, repeatedly points to the risk of packaged and fresh fruit juices in conjunction with drug intake. In the framework of the 236. Meetings of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia he once again took alert: it suffices to have a glass of apple, orange or grapefruit juice to reduce the absorption of certain vital medicines to the extent that they are practically eliminated and thus jeopardize the health of patients.
Grapefruit juice was already suspected to be responsible for increasing the effects of some medicines such as antibiotics, antiasthmatics, cardiovascular medicines, anxiolytic and neurological agents to toxic levels.
MEDIKAMENTE IN GEFAHR - The same agency of the medicine had warned doctors and patients in a report two years ago about the dangers of this mixture, and stressed that attention should be paid to what is being drunk in conjunction with medicines such as diazepan or metadone.
IT'S NOT SUPPLY - According to experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that can inhibit the medicines.
The list of active substances that are blocked by the fruit juices is long.
Therefore, the appeal of Michele Carruba, Director of the University Statale di Milano: "Such results are usually forwarded immediately to the various international manufacturers, which are so free to change consumer information.
It is therefore advisable to read the package leaflet always and, if there are still ambiguities, not to ask a pharmacist or a doctor, "emphasises the expert of the Ansa Agency.
Economic Nobel Prize goes to Paul Krugman
The economic noble prize is to the American Paul Krugman for his analysis of trade patterns and the location of economic activities.
The 55-year-old Krugman is a Neokeynesian who teaches at the University of Princeton and is known for his regular articles for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of Bush's economic and foreign policy.
A few months after the attacks of September 11, 2001, during the days of the Enron collapse, Krugman had claimed in a key article of the New York Times that this second event was more decisive for the history of the United States than the assassinations.
A prophecy which was given little polemics as an answer and which was held before the economist years later, but which today proves to be quite right.
"I am surprised and also shocked about how quickly the memory of the scandals in the context of the collapse of Enron or Worldcom disappeared from the public field," said Krugman at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "economist of great value," but also a banalist with a "very aggressive style that is particularly directed against the excessive liberalism of the Bush government."
Open Office, it appears the third version of the anti-Microsoft package
The day of publication of OpenOffice.org 3.0 has arrived; the Open Source Software gains a growing number of users, both at home and in the office, both under free-handed and in public administration as a free replacement for Microsoft's Office.
After a year of intensive work by the volunteer developers, which is supervised by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office is now presenting with some innovations to the audience: in addition to a revised and now Spartanese starting menu, it is now finally achieved a fundamental compatibility with Apple's operating system Mac OS x, as well as support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format, i.e. the latest standard ISO version.
Eight against was also considered the compatibility with Microsofts Office 2007, whose new formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx) can be read by OpenOffice.
Interesting are also some new features, such as those that allow to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, which, for example, facilitates sending via e-mail. This also includes the possibility to import PDF files in graphics processing modules while preserving the original appearance of the page.
For example, "hybrid" PDF files can now be generated which expand the typical graphics of the Adobe format to the elements of a table and text processing system.
Cooperation is one of the most improved elements of the applications: tables can now be processed in several hands by different users, avoiding conflicts in the event of changes; in the case of the text processing system, a questionnaire is allocated to each processor in order to guarantee a better correction procedure.
Some companies are about to publish various functions of OpenOffice on the Internet (on the cloud), while the final result will be published in the coming weeks.
The Italian version is available on the following link to the download: http: / / it.openoffice.org / download / 3.0.0 / download 300.html. Thus it follows the English version that has been on the mirrors since Friday.
Except for Windows and Mac OS, the program is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request you can send the installation CD to your home or office.
However, if the free movement of costs can be an incentive for the dissemination of the programme in private households, it is also particularly in the business area where OpenOffice could succeed in the big throw: at the end of the day, various public administration and schools have already moved to OpenOffice.
In fact, there is no lack of a training offer, which means optimal assistance for small and medium-sized enterprises, and thus even offers business prospects.
OpenOffice consists of five main components: Writer, the Word corresponding text setting program; Calc, the table program that aims to displace Excel; impress, to create presentations like with PowerPoint; Dbase to run databases instead of the known access; and finally Draw, a graphic module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads - a target that can be easily exceeded by 3 million and 600 thousand already.
Also tested coal positively and thus the fourth doping case
It opens up a new doping case mi framework of the previous Tour de France: it is the Austrian athlete Bernhard Kohl of the Gerolsteiner team, who is the third-class and winner of the triangle of the best climber.
The message published the daily newspaper L'Equipe on its website.
The 26-year-old Kohl of the Gerolsteiner team is the fourth driver who has been tested positively for Cera, the third-generation Epo. Previously, this was done with the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli as well as the German Stefan Schumacher.
The analyses from the blood samples of coal are one of those made in recent weeks by the laboratories Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter samples confirm the positive results on Cera, the Austrian will lose its third place and will be excluded from the races for two years.
The head of the French Antidoping Commission Pierre Bordry confirmed the positive Epotest, and, according to the Associated Press, also the Austrian controllers.
The 26-year-old Austrian went on the podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans and also claimed the tricot of the best climber for himself.
THEME IMPORTANT: THE NEW YORK TIMES QUEST: IS ITALY RASISIC?
Italy, "the only country of emigrants has recently become one of the preferred countries for immigrants," which are only accepted with contradictions.
Do this from the Belpaese a nation of racists? This is what the New York Times asks in a long article dedicated to the issue of racism in Italy and out of the case of the young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso, who was murdered in Milan a a month ago after he had stolen a pack of cookies.
The case shows what the Times call the "Paradox of the North": the northern regions are those in which "most integration and work opportunities" exist, yet "the highest degree of anti-immigration sentiments and the greatest support of the Lega North."
As a confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the Times invokes further episodes of intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
And not just this.
The new legislation introduced by the Lega against immigration and the accelerated expulsion of illegal immigrants is also referred to as a sign of climate change in Italy.
A movement which also underlines the Pope and the President of the State: "Giorgio Napolitano asked the Pope to cooperate in a meeting at the Quirinal for the fight against racism between the Church and the State."
Students victims of up to 900-Euro per room high rental prices
The housing market for students does not know any crises.
According to the last study of the Sunia, the rental company, a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"This phenomenon has already taken very serious trains. A whole range of students are thus losing their right to study, as their families are unable to support them at this level" - according to the Sunia responsible, Laura Mariani - "in these cities the great demand from students leads to a deformation of the market which has also damaged the other inhabitants.
In addition, most of the rental offers include a number of infringements: free contracts, missing registrations, no lease price limit, unauthorized leases.
For Sunia, there is a need for exceptional measures which result in a revision of taxation to lower rental prices.
With more detailed examination, it appears that in Milan a sleeping space is needed in the Brianza district, a single room begins at 650 euros (in the Bande Nere district) and ends with 800 euros in the Lambiate, Udine and Fiera district or even 900 euros in the Vittoria district.
In Florence, an average bedroom costs 350 / 400 Euro, one room 700.
In Bologna, where the students concentrate in the neighborhoods, 250 / 280 euros are for a sleeping space of noodles, 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, prices are around the university at about 600 euros for one single room, 450 for one bedroom in a double room.
Only a little deeper are the rentals in the quarters around the other universities of Rome: 550 Euro in Ostiense and Cinecittà.
Only those who spend money in external districts can save: 300 euros for one bedroom and 450 euros for one single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar quarters.
In Naples you need 300-450 euros for a sleeping place, for one room the price is between 400 and 600 euros in the most expensive quarters, the Poliklinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, one bedroom costs 250-350 euros, one single room at least 350 euros.
In the smallest cities, prices are lower, but they have a greater weight in the urban economy.
In the cities where the phenomenon of rent to non-European students is more frequent, such as Perugia, there is even another anomaly: a rent that is 25-30% above the average is demanded by foreign students.
Goodbye to the old cinema Paradiso - the cities close their historic cinemas
The historical cinemas close due to the favored multiplex cinemas.
"A city without cinoes is a blind city, like a face without eyes."
This picture of the director Giuseppe Tornatore describes with effect what is happening at the moment in the large urban centres of Italy, and also in the provinces.
The process of exclusion of cinemas, which began with the birth of the large multihall complex in the periphery, means long-term death for the cinema in the centre. A process that does not only appear irrevocable and irrevocable, but also bears the trains of a cultural crime.
Most of the people affected are historical places full of memories, "it is like losing a friend with which one has laid a piece of road full of emotions," said the director of the film "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso," who brought him the Oskar and the great price of Cannes 20 years ago. It is the history of a suburban cinema and its nostalgia, which consists of living in a well-lost cinema for ever.
The figures provided by Anec, the central trade association, speak a clear language: in the last five years the enormous amount of 316 traditional cinemas has had to close; this tune paid for most of the cinemas in the major cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Among the most affected regions are Emilia Romagna with 82 lost cinemas, followed by Tuscany with 44 and Lombardy with 41.
This demonstrates that the main guilty are the multiplex cinemas, because it is precisely these three regions in which the largest number of these modern cinemas has been registered: 195 in the last 5 years the Lombardy has introduced the lists, 81 are both in Tuscany and in Emilia Romagna.
"The business has evolved in an irrational way," said Paolo Protti, the president of the Anec, "it is useful that new structures are also emerging, but in the first place is the preservation of the already existing, because closing a hall in the city, not all his stem customers are willing to visit a multiplex cinema in the periphery instead of the old one.
And here there is still the lack of budget for the fund of the trade union of eight: the debt burden recorded by the State is about 10 million euros.
It is a disgrace from the ethical-moral point of view that the government does not respect existing laws.
In order to preserve the sector, between 16 and 18 million euros would be needed in the year. "
Interesting is the case of Bologna, the first Italian city, which has decided to protect them by an agreement between the municipality and the Anec because of the fears of the old cinemas; it is the first agreement of this kind in Italy, which aims to protect and support traditional cinemas, both in the historical centre and in the periphery.
The measures envisaged include tax advantages for cinematographic operators as well as benefits for the public with regard to urban transport: it will be possible to travel to the transport restricted areas of the centre and also to park at cheaper parking charges.
"It is a pleasant initiative," says Giuseppe Tornatore, "I hope that other cities will join our example and also develop new concepts.
Of course, we also need better audio and video equipment to be able to adjust to the superpower of the multiplex, because, finally, the audience of today is more demanding.
The defence of traditional cinema has always been an important subject to me: closing the "Supercinema" of Baghiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the crucial point that made me start the "Nuovo cinema Paradiso," even though I had played with the thought for 10 years.
For 25 years I have lived in Rome; when I pass by the Rialto or the Quirinale in the Via Nazionale, where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turn aside in order not to have to see the dust-covered posters.
The links between politics and 'Ndrangheta lead to the arrest of the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was prepared to adapt the decisions of the municipality to the interests of the Mafia group Piromalli.
The accusations of the Attorney General of the Antimafia Authority of Calabria against Mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his deputy Rosario Schiavone of the municipality of Gioia Tauro, who were arrested this morning for the conduct of mafia business.
In handcuffs, Gioacchino Piromalli, the older mediator between the clan and the public administration, as well as his nephew: the lawyer, who has the same name as the boss of the clan, had already been sentenced to a compensation sum of 10 million euros because of intercourse in criminal associations of the Mafia.
"Any kind of moral and legal standard is misleading," the lawyers write, "the two local administrations had decided to pay the lawyer Piromalli money for advisory activities."
"Thus it had been possible for the Mafia group - as judges say - to enter the town houses on an official way and to co-determine public administration policy."
The President of the Regional Committee of Calabria Agazio Loiero does not deny that in his region it is "anything but an exception to encounter links between local administrations and organised crime." "There are places where the concentration of the Mafia is greater than in others where such connections are practically inevitable.
But there are also local politicians who resist the pressure of 'Ndrangheta: heroes who receive a white vest.'
The arrests of this morning follow those of last July, with which the police of the Clan Piromalli were expelled.
Since the end of the last April the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, but the local politicians of their municipal offices had already been dismissed in 1991 - and also then because of the alleged links between organised crime and local administration.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, then mayor of Udc, was elected head of the midcourt coalition after the election of May 2006.
He cried scandal when the prefecture arranged the dissolution of the council.
He was interested in the vice-minister Marco Minniti, whom he drew up to invent everything for political and strategic reasons, but the judges explained in connection with the arrest warrant of this morning that the Piromalli clan had even dared to apply for an amendment to the A3 project.
From an interrogation in connection with the investigations on the case of Dal Torrione, the willingness to meet the wishes of an entrepreneur, who is known to be a representative of the large group around the piromalli - which made the public administration's actions identical to the interests of this clan. "
When the energy comes out of the waves, suddenly the big ones run up
It is a non-devastating source of money that covers over 70% of the planet's surface and only now seems to understand this the world's great energy planes.
Waves, currents and times are the new renewable energy sources that now all look at, and also seek to occupy, such as giants like Chevron.
The possibility of gaining energy from the movements of the sea has been considered and examined for 70 years; these studies have not accidentally intensified significantly since the first oil crisis.
When the price of oil was broken down around 1980, the idea of marine energy was gained, but now the environmental organisations and the increased oil price are pressing for new impetus in this sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of world energy needs could be covered by the energy generated by the ocean waves.
This would be equal to the double of the current energy produced by nuclear power stations.
In addition, the currents and tides were added.
Giant in the attack.
The first company that now focuses on marine energy is Enersis, who signed a contract for the construction of a power plant in the north of Portugal in 2005.
When this message was published, it seemed to be a revolutionary step.
Two years later, there are now more and more companies from the traditional energy industry that are focusing on marine energy production.
"Chevron examines these technologies" - as the speaker of a company known to the American giant in the Wall Street Journal - and weighs the possibility of working with us. "
This is about obtaining an authorisation from the American Energy Commission, which is necessary to launch a project off Alaska's coast.
This is a sign that is not too underestimating, for example, when we consider that in Alaska oil is still being promoted by the United States and President Bush recently launched the plans for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, the companies Verdana Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey who invest in the new industry are also unknown to the details, observers speak of increasing interest.
Even more improvisable technologies.
Experts are talking about a technology still in progress, not least because the final doubts of environmental protectors have not yet been resolved.
So far, projects such as those in Portugal and also Scotland have a rather small dimension and do not seem to cause any serious environmental problems.
However, in order to produce energy at a large scale, technologies with far greater environmental impact are needed.
There are various possibilities: Ocean Power uses a system of connected bows.
The push of the waves, which moves the bows up and down, is transformed into hydraulic pressure within the swimmer over pistons and cylinders.
This drives a turbine, which in turn operates a generator.
The power is then sent through underwater pipelines to the coast.
So far, there are four planned installations of this kind which are waiting only for the state approval. Some of the energy gained could also be used for military facilities.
However, Verδ Power already produces energy for a shopping warehouse and a parking lot using undersea turbines in the East River of New York.
The water movements during the tides drive the turbines that feed the generator through the resulting rotating movement.
According to Verdana, a long line of potential clients is already waiting for the necessary authorizations to use these energy sources.
First the waves, then the tides.
According to the Institute of Electricity Recovery Research, a particular interest deserves the potential that is in the times at present.
Although it is also an irregular phenomenon, the times are better predictable than wind currents, sunlight and also the waves, and therefore a more trustworthy source of electricity.
It is precisely the time energy that led states such as New York, Maine and Alaska as well as other coastal states to invest already 7.5 million dollars in 2008 - up to 35 million are already planned for 2009.
