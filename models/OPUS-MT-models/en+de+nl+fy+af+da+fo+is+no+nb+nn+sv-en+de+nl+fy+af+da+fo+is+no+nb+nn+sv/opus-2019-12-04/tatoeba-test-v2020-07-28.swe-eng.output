She's done too much work.
She's stubborn.
Give Tom a hand.
You wouldn't like Tom.
Does Tom know how you feel about him?
Tom wondered if what Mary said was true.
We'll never get along.
It is uncertain whether the letter ever came out or not.
We didn't do anything.
You lost your pen.
Are you going to lie in bed all day, or what?
Tom can't do that.
Tom crawled under the wire.
I didn't even know her name.
Are you really going to do that?
Give this to Tom.

I'm going like a penguin.
Have I forgotten anything?
You're longer than me.
Happy birthday.
I don't even want you here.
I like to go to new places and see new things.
I have to sit down.
Aren't we friends?
Her speech bored me.
I can't eat chocolate.
I think we should do as Tom suggests, unless someone else has a better proposal.

Do you understand?
I can only speak for myself.
Tell me what the problem is.

You should have liked it.
I got some more.
I'm using the computer.
Six were invited, the boy included.
Kate's cold.
I know you miss your family.
What was your plan?
Tom seems bored.
He's not mad.
There's no doubt who's being elected.
He got hurt.
Maybe I should find a new job or an interesting hobby to keep me motivated.
It's weird.
Have you read the story about the ring trilogin?
I'm a man now.
Greek is not an easy language.
Thank you for taking care of my dog.
She advocated equality.
What are you looking at?
They died young.
Stop talking to me.
Greetings to you, my brother-in-law.

I was just teasing.
Stay down.
You weren't here then.
Here comes Tom.

We're different.
Get back in the van.
She helped the old man across the way.
Nobody's too old to learn.
I would do anything for love.
Two men with ski masks went into the bank.
This book belongs to the school library.
None of it was real.
There must be a pattern.
It hurts to have to say this, but it's the truth.
Tom cheated on me.
Tom's helping.
One morning he saw a cute girl.
This tree is not even close to being the highest in the sock.
Let me take a look.
Tom wants our help.
Time's up.
My father's healthy.
We can save a lot of lives.
If you don't have any money, you'll be fine without it.
I'm afraid to go home.
Just say it.
The healing word suddenly filled me with new power.
Put the cake on the table.
I know you're angry.
Do you need anything?
I want a couple of gloves.
That's exactly what I needed.
I'm from Brazil.
I'm already late.
Even Mom knows about it.
He should have done it already.
Room service, please.
Who were you talking to?
The boy grabbed the cat's tail.
How do you know?
I got a lot of mosquitoes.
I'm unemployed.
This medicine will cure your cold.
Does this remind you of someone?
I'd like to talk to Tom between four eyes.
He's gonna fall for temptation.
Teven isn't working.
I can explain that.
She's acting like a child.
What does it look like?
Mary thinks she has superpowers.
I know all this.
Everyone needs to know.
After the stop, the train accelerated quickly.
What did that mean?
Who do you want to talk to?
No one has asked you to agree, but you can at least accept that there are people who have opinions other than you?
Tom dropped the book.
I'm the best.
English is hard, isn't it?
I can go to school in ten minutes.
Are you ready now?
She couldn't imagine seeing him again.
Even during working hours, I pay for my Internet dependency.
I never thought it would be so hard to create an iPad app.
You weren't gone long.
Both Magdalena and Ania are from Poland.
I can't get down to town.
At least it wasn't boring.
Can you freeze it down?
Tom blinked with the lights.
Are you threatening me?
Tom's worried.
I used to like coming here.
This isn't a fish.
Maybe Tom and Mary didn't do what everyone says they did.
No one here is called that.
It's time to go.
All three men smiled.
Come and sit down.
That must be good enough.
Tom made his parents happy.
Tom needs me.
My engine saw is broken.
You think she's pretty, don't you?
He lived a simple life.
This is gonna take years.
I spelled the word wrong.
I don't like this book.
A octopus has ten arms.
She didn't come before two.
I am.
That was very good.
Come talk to me.
He took care of the baby.
Leave me alone!
Never had I seen such a peaceful vision.
Tom's fast.
Of the Finnish countries, around 4.9 per cent are Finnish ventiles, that is, people with Swedish as a mother tongue.
Unfortunately, Tom got away with it.
What is the difference between American and British English?
I'll read the book.
I made the wedding cake.
Use a scalpel, not an axe.
Could you write down the link to that site?
She was adding a picture.
The walls in the old house weren't straight.
Where is she?
It feels really good.
Why do you like it?
What would you say if you were in this situation?
Give me three weeks.
The driver turned the wheel to the right.
I'm in the wind.
Tom said he didn't eat meat.

At home, I discovered the break-in.
The cat has two ears.
Not really.
You don't even like chocolate.
She likes singing.

Give Sami a kiss.
Are they in love with each other?
Which is your favorite fast food restaurant?
Tom won't stay.
I'll do it.
We have to find it.
What's missing?
I can do it myself!
Don't worry.
She paid seven percent interest on the loan.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to kick you.
Can I think about it?
When did you see Tom?
It's not important!
Strange things happened on her birthday.
