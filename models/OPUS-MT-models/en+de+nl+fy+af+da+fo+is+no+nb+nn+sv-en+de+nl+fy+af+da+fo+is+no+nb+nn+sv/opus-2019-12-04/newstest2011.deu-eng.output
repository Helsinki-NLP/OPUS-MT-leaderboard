What is she supposed to do, the ČSSD? The Czech Social Democrats in Prague know neither Voldemort nor the "conditioner."
The new councillors of the capital from the ČSSD series will obviously have to overcome certain language barriers in order to understand their old-new ODS colleagues in the Prague Council and in the city representation at all.
The newspaper Aktuálně.cz has once "knocked off" members of the new Council from ČSSD, as they dominate the notorious snake that has been borrowed in in recent years where today's coalition partners in Prague were on the roar.
The coded vocabulary introduced by the Prague political elite in the refined era of Supreme Mayor Pavel Bém is denied some of the most famous actors, situations and Causae.
Surprisingly, it appeared that the new Councils are somewhat in the dark regarding these new terms.
At least they say so.
"Who's Voldemort?"
"I don't know."
"I am more of a newcomer in Prague's politics," Lukáš Kaucký, the new counsellor for culture, responded to the test of the "Pate word treasure."
But also the Councilwoman Karel Březina - a political veteran - responded in the same way.
For example, on the term "Golfloch."
"This is the only expression of those you present to me here that I use every once in a while."
"Otherwise, I don't like snake much."
From the vocabulary published by the journal Aktuálně.cz this year in June before the election congress of the ODS, the editor outlined six terms, especially those which are notoriously linked to the Prague Magistrate.
The Social Democrats should define the terms "Voldemort," "Great Prague Golfloch," "into the conditionery," "Stiernacken," "Verrat der Hauptstadt" and "Bleached."
Three Prague counsellors agreed to the test, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, the future head of the Prague School - promised his participation in the conversation first, but then didn't even take the hearing.
The fifth council lord, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test from the beginning.
"I don't care about these things and how the bourgeois Democrats talk about each other, I don't judge them."
"For me it is important how we understand ourselves in our programmes," he contended.
As has already been pointed out, Lukáš Kaucký had allegedly not recognized in the above headline that the speech was made by the influential entrepreneur and friend of the former mayor Bém, Roman Janoušek.
The term "Voldemort" says nothing to Kaucky, and the only term he correctly made during the test was "the greatest Prague Golfloch."
"This is the Blanka tunnel," says Kaucký, but added to security: "But I know that more from the newspaper."
And silly, "I'm gonna have to take a language course."
The "Golfloch" is then designed not only by Matador Karel Březina but also by the Lord of the Council for Environmental Affairs Lukáš Plachý as a tunnel Blanka.
However, both Social Democrats also know who the term Voldemort stands for and Lukáš Plachý even knows where this figure can be found and what it means to "go to the bakery."
"I think that is to go into some Prague gastronomy business," Plachý is pretty close to the puzzle solution when you know that this is the seat of Janoušek's companies.
In accordance with Březina, however, he insists that he should have created this knowledge from the newspaper rather than that this word would be his own.
According to the test participants, there does not seem to be a similar embodied snake among the Socialists.
"I also asked my colleagues, but obviously there is no such thing with us."
"We call ourselves by name, back and forth we also use shorts or nicknames," says the president of the Prague ČSSD Petr Hulínský - by his party owners salopp "Hulda."
"In school I was called Bříza (Birke), but I don't know if my colleagues call me that too," Karel Březina tells us his nickname.
The newspaper Deník Aktuálně.cz has tried the name and see there - it works.
Ratsherr Weinert is kind to the party owners of the "Grandpa" or less friendly to "Old" the representative of Miroslav Poche, who pointed out before the elections by means of a party sponsorship, is called by some colleagues "Igráček" (known Czech Lego figure).
That is the only thing that the Social Democrats allow in their domestic language.
Hulínský does not like to call him Hulda, but Deník Aktuálně.cz registered another top name of the Prague president.
His nickname "Doctor of Gummiknoppel Rights" is allegedly related to Petr Hulínský acquiring his title Doctor juris at the Bratislaver Police Academy.
The government wants to stop the torture of "witches" and issued a brochure
Women who are stamped into witches in Burkina Faso usually have some common social features.
They belong more to the older generation, they do not find work - for example for health reasons, they are vacant and have no children.
If one of these women becomes "witch," she is severely isolated so that she cannot become dangerous to the rest of the village.
"Men are rarely affected by this fate."
"Young and healthy women also remain spared because they are helping and giving birth to children," a nurse describes the situation that took care of more than one hundred women who were thrown out by their communities in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso in a special home.
The local government now decided to tackle this abnormal "social measure."
And for this reason issued a brochure to stop the "witch persecution."
But the thing has a hook.
"More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso cannot read," the newspaper pointed to the dilemma of written enlightenment.
But to be accused of witchcraft is also common in other African countries.
In Ghana, the neighbouring country of Burkina Faso, the 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahová was tortured to death by three women and two men - they poured them over with petroleum and simply lit them.
The BBC server also reported about this incident.
However, the perpetrators claimed that the matter would have been just a coincidence of unfortunate circumstances.
According to their version, oil was flammated, which is used for ritual salvation.
After the group tried to "scratch a bad spirit" out of the woman.
The isolation of "witches" supports people here without regard to their education.
"The standard" quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: "Fressers of human souls are a danger earlier than today," he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso is at least trying to disarm the witch hunt, the Gambian President has properly mixed up with the President himself last year.
"After the death of his aunt, President Johya Jammeh escaped a monstrous witch hunt, as they allegedly had a share of their death and would now try to kill the president himself through black magic."
"To this end, he called for help from the nearby Guinea to the women and men who were electively captured by the President in the presence of police, soldiers and the bodyguard of the President by force from Gambian villages and brought them to the presidential farm in Kanilai," said Amnesty International in its report.
On the farm, the incarcerated people were forced to drink an absud of plants with hallucinogenic effect, which also caused intestine and kidney problems.
Two of the arrested people did not survive the stay on the farm.
Only due to international pressure were the nearly thousands of prisoners released.
A tenant from Bakala: He is heated in the oven - still pays higher rent
An older undersized man is leaving the client center of the company RPG Byty of the "Kohlebaron" Zdeněk Bakala, the largest private owner of rentals in the Czech Republic.
Under the arm a folder with three new lease contracts for three apartments: for the own and the apartments of his daughters and his son, who is just holding a prison sentence.
All three were just increased in the context of the so-called "deregulation" the rent.
Instead of 3500 kroner monthly rent, the son is to hit next year for a 2-room apartment with kitchen of the second category 4100 kroner.
"And there is not even floating hot water in the apartment and you need to heat in a simple coal oven," he tips upset with his finger on the new lease contract of the son to which he has a power to sign.
"But what - I signed," he explains half wrong and half resigned.
The BytyOKD.cz Civil Association, which called the new lease terms "inaccurate and inmoral," advises the tenants simply not to sign the new contracts and to wait until 7 December, in which they intend to publish a guide on how to deal with such contracts.
But the man just waves.
"One says this, the other that," he makes a dark face.
The Ostrava region is thus becoming a major "deregulation laboratory."
After New Year, this deregulation is ahead of most rentals in the Czech Republic, whose tenants do not yet pay a market fair rent.
Aktuálně.cz therefore decided to visit this "laboratory" personally.
The RPG waiting room in Havířov is one of four in the Ostrava region and already nine o'clock in the morning on this Tuesday.
Right next to the door, the bodyguards are on a security agency and a call device with her.
"Rent 2011," a special keyboard lights on the touchscreen.
Shortly tipped and already the device spits out a number note.
We have hardly deciphered the number "157" and already peep it on the big display on the ceiling of the waiting room.
Half a second later, you're on your way.
A little later an older couple enters the waiting room to ask for the rent, but the storm in the waiting room obviously does not apply to the new rent at all.
Most people are here to solve the usual problems - repair applications, insurance matters and similar.
From mid-November, in the region of Ostrava, the envelopes are flattering with the new lease contracts most tenants of the total 44,000 apartments of the RPG portfolio into the mailboxes.
The RPG Byty proposes an increase of about 15 to 38 percent in the letters.
The special switch for the new rentals in the client center has been opened since 18 November.
"The action runs a little over a week, which means that this is only the beginning," the ladies behind the switch hesitate after a moment when the "client" becomes a journalist.
The deregulation and Bakala's former miners' apartments are a fierce topic.
Before the elections, President Lubomír Zaorálek of the Ostrava parliament had taken up this subject quite lauthals, no wonder that today the newspapers are full of it.
"Twenty years I want a new floor from them."
"Not even a behest. WC glasses could change them," the man mentioned at the outset gets air.
To date, according to the employees, pensioners are mainly at the switch to make sure that they really receive the promised rental reduction that RPG promises them when they sign the special offer in time.
In the benefit of a half-reduced February lease, the other tenants who sign the new lease contract will also enter into service until 15 December.
So far, however, "deregulation switch" in Havířov is everything but overloaded by questions.
"Of yesterday's 360 clients were only about 40 to 50 of the rent in 2011 because of here," the shield officers estimate.
RPG offers individual rental agreements on both its websites and wall tables where it seems necessary.
However, if the rental parties do not agree on the new rent, it is determined by an independent court.
"This should not be a threat, but is understood as information on the only possible and completely legitimate legal approach," RPG explains on its websites.
"Nobody goes to court here," says one of the employees of RPG Byty and a man on the street in front of the client center gives her at least partially right.
"I have 13.000 (crowns) pension, of which 5,000 remain for food, where should I take the money for a court dispute," he says.
Then the staff will be insecure.
"Let's see."
"Mr. Zaorálek tells them about the media, they should not sign and so people are still waiting," gives them to think.
The regulated rent ends in most of the Czech Republic at New Year 2011 and according to RPG Byty, the rental increase is an economic necessity.
"The existing amount of the rent is not even sufficient to maintain the housing fund," argues Pavel Klimeš, the director of the housing portfolio of the company RPG Byty and - precisely the negligence of the housing fund criticised by the housed tenants is the main reason for the rental increase.
While RPG was able to invest four billion in the apartments in the years between 2005 and 2010, it was expected to be 5.2 billion in the four years from 2011 to 2014.
On the large-format LCD display on the ceiling opposite the polster saddles in the waiting room of Havířov, a few red light information is constantly emerging.
"The 2011 rental increases by 15% and less relate to 31 200 apartments, i.e. more than 90% of RPG's apartments."
"Always means a maximum of 7.50 CZK per square meter per month," is to be read on the LCD monitor.
Only 400 apartments from the RPG portfolio increase the rent by 38 percent.
"In these cases, the increase in extremely low rental prices of 19,66 CZK per square meter," argues RPG.
With 2600 apartments, the rent will remain at the same level next year.
RPG Byty promises that the deregulation does not drive the rentals to the high, but gradually takes place within four and eight years.
What more - the company imposes another obligation: all the revenues from the rental increase (see chart) the company wants to put back in the apartments, especially in heat savings - in new windows and in the heat insulation.
But, above all, they should benefit those who sign the agreement on the increase in rent.
The architects saw - the office also includes a kindergarten
The office building Avriopoint in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch.Design.
But who would expect a mini garden here, with everything that belongs to it: colorful walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys and even a mini-parking on the outdoor terrace.
This kindergarten has been available to the employees of Arch.Design since last year.
The architecture and projection office Arch.Design, from which the Ateliers originate a whole series of renowned bronze buildings, calculated from the first designs for the new building Avriopoint with the premises for its company mini garden.
In a wise perspective, because most of his 90 employees are at the baby tree age and the company is interested in returning to their work as soon as possible.
Together with the possibility to work shortly, the kindergarten is another bonus that Arch.Design has to offer to its employees in the concept of its social programme.
The construction engineers have thus made it easier to put their demanding profession and child care under one hat.
The Minikindergarten is an original idea of the employees of Arch.Design and with the support of the management they managed to gain funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs for their project.
The operational mini-garden is financed by the Human Resources and Employment Policy Operations Programme from the European Social Fund and from the Czech Republic's State budget.
This funding (grants of CZK 2.8 million) enabled the necessary facilities and facilities to be purchased and for the duration of 2 years qualified staff and the operation provided.
After the use of the funding (2 years), the company Arch.Design is obliged to continue running the Minikindergarten for another 3 years at its own cost.
The preparation of this project took a whole year, with the company Economy Rating providing effective assistance in the application process.
The children take care of fully qualified staff - a nurse and a kindergarten teacher, the kindergarten can visit children without age restrictions, although most of them are over three years old.
And since this is a mini-kindergarten, only 5 children may be present at the same time, but the day varies over several children.
The kindergarten operation is flexible to suit the needs of parents, the children of all employees have the same rights in terms of the use of the kindergarten - without regard to the company hierarchy and their respective position.
Although it is individual education and care, the content of the programme in the mini-kindergarten is nevertheless comparable to the framework programme of pre-school education.
The children are not only playing here, especially they are offered excellent lessons - from basic knowledge to pre-school lessons, and they also learn English.
The classroom is not only equipped with toys and creative games, but also with a computer available to children.
What more - the presence of small children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive business environment.
The parents can take a look at the children at any time and thus avoid the stress when the children are taken late from a far away kindergarten.
The parents therefore use their working time more productive.
No wonder that there are also natural and loyal employer / employee relationships here.
Arch.Design thus enrolled among the Czech companies which offer significant benefits in recruiting new employees, which are family friendly and through such programs strengthen their personnel marketing.
A bone house also fascinates after 100 years. Look at the interiors of Gaudi
The roof mutates like the back of a prehistoric oak, the stairs like the spine of a dinosaurer and the balconies are ripped up fish mills.
This is the Casa Batlló of Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
Of the local inhabitants, the house with its organic forms received the nickname "Bone House."
Organic shapes, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, cachel fragments and mosaics, memorizing facades and all current soft lines, all these are typical features for the youth style of Antonio Gaudi.
The façade of the house plays with traumatic lines, delicate colors and textures that remind of nature and creatures.
Only when you look more closely, you notice that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm and perception of order.
In the night, the whole facade is even more plastic, dramatic and the special illumination strengthens the shine of the colours.
The same vibrant lines and sloppy shapes also dominate the interior of the house.
Wavelshaped wood copies the window frames, rails, decorative elements of doors, even eye holes and bars.
The house Batlló in the district of Eixample on the lively shopping street Passeig de Grácia No. 43 was created by the conversion of a house from 1877, the architect Emilio Sala Cortese.
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrial Josep Batlló, originally insisted on the demolition of the old and the construction of a completely new building, but ultimately he agreed to the idea of Gaudís for an unusual and also cheaper reconstruction.
The casa Batlló rental house, however, did not design Antoni Gaudí alone.
He worked with the architect Josep Maria Jujol.
The decorations for the representative apartment of the real estate owner and also the use of mosaics on the facade were created on its grid.
However, many other artists and artists also cooperated in the design of the facade.
The joint work on the designs for the Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fruitful cooperation between Jujola and Gaudí.
Thus Jujol also participated in the construction of Gaudís Haus Casa Milá in the Park Güell, where there are also other works of Antoni Gaudí.
Shortly after his completion, the house was given by the local residents of its organic forms because of the nickname "Bone House."
Others in turn called it the special window opening mechanism because of the "similar house."
It is also said that the sword of the Holy Georg, the Patron of Catalonia, is displayed at the top of the building.
But also other picturesque elements symbolize hidden religious motives.
Gaudí designed for the house a unique central heating system with ventilation channels and typical fireplace.
Something bizarre already mutates her 45-degree inclination.
In his work Gaudí consistently ignored all the construction regulations then and could not be misled by them.
Before the construction began, he collected the corresponding construction permit from the city, but the information he provided about the planned reconstruction was so vague that the city fathers were so discouraged two years later at the time of completion that they demanded remediation.
Among other things, the council rulers also insisted that the construction with its pillars even entered the public pedestrian.
However, there were no further amendments, on the contrary - only fifteen days after the urgency of the district, Josep Batlló submitted a request to authorise the rental of the two highest floors of the House - and it was promptly granted to him.
The house owner himself moved into the lower floors.
In the gallery on the 2nd floor there was a social salon, on the third floor there were the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment.
The ground floor was parted to a jewelry store.
The entire six-storey building runs through a staircase up to the roof terrace.
All right angles and straight lines were removed by the basic elements of the conversion and replaced by curved and swung walls.
Gaudí also worked with a modern concept of interconnection of spaces.
The social part can be completely connected by opening the door doors and thus a larger society could easily talk without having to refrain from a certain degree of intimacy in more confidential conversations.
The house also received a rather unusual roof and two other floors by Gaudi's reconstruction except a new facade.
Also impressive is Gaudi's game with the light as well as the blue and white glazed hairs with which the courtyard is dressed and the lights.
The game of these two colors gives a maximum amount of light to all floors of the house.
At the same time he simply made the principle useful that white reflects the light better than dark colors that absorb the sunlight on the contrary.
The House Casa Batlló, which was included in the World Heritage List of Unesco in 2005, can visit everyone today.
The most spacious and spacious apartment is made available to the public on the first floor.
The house owners decided only in the year to take this step and this on the occasion of the 150.birthday of the famous Creator.
When it was found that this was a fairly beneficial business, the visits were maintained, yes they were also extended to other common and the roof floor rooms, including the roof terrace.
However, the price for visiting the monument is not a paperwork, it is 16.50 euros, students, pensioners, groups and owners of tourist cards receive 20 percent discount.
This amount exceeds the entry prices for other Gaudí buildings in the city.
Anyone who wants to get to know the real atmosphere of the house with his dragon towers should try to make friends with one of the residents and visit him at home.
The right mattress and the right bed rust? Women have different wishes than men
Not the most amazing bed dream, but the quality of the bed area - so mattress and rust make the good bed out.
However, these must be harmoniously complemented in order to meet the wishes of the specific user.
Many things play a role in the selection - weight, size, state of health and not least the sex of the sleeper.
Also important is the interior in which mattresses and rust have to be subordinated.
Typical example?
In a weekend house where it is not regularly healed, latexmattresses are not well suited as they need much longer to "warm."
In addition, they are significantly harder than usual polyurethane mattresses.
And - they should be used regularly.
Because if they do not have enough ventilation channels in the core and are still on a fixed plate, moisture is on: it is not excluded that they form under their mould.
In the election, of course, it also matters what you are used to.
Those who have been abroad for a long time, where very high mattresses with soft layer are common, will be hard to get used to a low mattress with hard surface.
"Probably all the hockey players who came back from the NHL have complained to me that they can't sleep right here anymore."
"For their sliced shoulders, heels and hips they simply need a soft layer of visco foam (Memory Foam - a form memory polymer)."
"Among other things, I recommend these people with diabetes who suffer from a nervous system disorder so that they can receive the" information "from the joints and the skin badly," explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in polster furniture.
That's why I bought many ice hockey players years ago, but also other customers these mattresses with Visco foam (Memory Foam).
"Today this is no longer a problem, because such mattresses include the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico."
And you don't necessarily have to be a famous hockey player to appreciate the benefits of the Visco foam.
This "miracle" actually works very easily.
The foam optimizes its hardness and shape according to the absorbed heat, otherwise, it sends to the warm body.
Nowhere it presses, in the night you don't roll around like after a heavy fight.
You just sleep a lot better.
The viscoolastic foam also provides protection against decubitus (wound fire).
When choosing the mattress size one should still add to the body size the length of the soils, i.e. about 21 to 34 cm.
Man like woman, who is 180 cm tall, needs a 210 to 220 cm long bed.
Each sleeper should be available at least 90 cm wide, so together 180 cm.
For single beds, for example for single beds, 120 to 140 cm are mounted.
Half the comfort and also for any visitors.
Otherwise, the following array applies to the ideal bed width: "If you lie on your back, there should be enough space for the slightly angled arms," says Ing. Helena Prokopová, the tendermaster of the polsters and spacecraft who has been devoted for years to the problem of healthy sleep and ergonomics of furniture and also to specialised schools.
With a double bed, everyone needs a separate rust and his own mattress, but watch out for shopping, so that the mattresses are also equal.
Otherwise, there is nothing left but to assemble the rust at different heights and this is not possible at all bedrooms.
Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with spring skeleton 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters should be removed from the shape layer and the fine polster.
"With the hand or when you put the feathers in no way," Helena Prokopová warns.
Each mattress requires a special rust type.
All-padded beds with mattress and base like combined siam twins have nothing to look for in the bedroom.
These mattresses cannot be lifted and the reference cannot be washed, which is already happening and given today.
And as one loses between 0.2 and 0.75 litres of sweat in one night, it is clear that after five to seven years the mattress is slowly becoming a giant (and stuffed sieve).
This is why professionals reject advertising logans who promise a lifetime of up to 25 years, even life-long warranty in mattresses.
Every thing has her if and but.
And that is why a practical advice from the dealers: when mattresses of 120 or 140 cm wide, you should not shy the hygiene of the washable, removable loads, yet it is advisable to use a mattress saver that you can easily remove and wash.
Even though mattress coatings are usually made with round zipper today, so that you get two half (extremely important for the washing process and the washing machine size!), the manipulation with larger mattresses, especially performed alone, often like the uneven struggle between David and Goliath.
Do they have a fixed plate in bed instead of a roast?
Get it out!
Or maximum for a bed for unloved guests and for one night.
They should also use the plate with ventilation holes (unless already in it) and mattresses with spring skeleton and 15 cm minimum height with so-called pockets and fine pads.
Polyurethane mattresses do not belong to such a base.
For non-adjustable latex roast with 14 to 18 spring bearings (lamellas), latex or sandwich mattresses are suitable (possibly also combinations of latex and cocoa), always pay rosts with a larger number of latex bearings, i.e. 28 and more spring bearings, with lordosis support in the latex spine area and the possibility to regulate the latex hardening.
On adjustable lamellas are no mattresses with spring skeleton, as they do not respond to ergonomic adjustment.
In addition to the setting of the stiffs of the feathers, special flexible shoulder modules are also offered.
This is a special attachment of the spring bearings which allows the spring bearings to be pressed in or even inverted in such a way that they allow the punctual sinking of the sleeper's shoulder.
One important thing for men with broad shoulders.
There are even mattress manufacturers who have begun to use soft zones for the shoulder range in "master mattresses."
Also the ladies are thought - they are given these soft zones in the hip.
For the most demanding customers, point-elastic wings (lattoflex) or rust with point-elastic contact pads with so-called multitorsion fitting are intended.
The pressure is distributed to several points, reducing the voltage.
But - when you use a bad (too big and filling) cushion to the right mattress and rust, most benefits are lost again.
Here too, a fog line: the head pillow should support the head, its tips should only reach the shoulders so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
Ideal therefore appears a 50 x 60 cm big pillow, like the Scandinavians, for example.
In the side position the head pillow (along with the shoulder discharge zone in the rust or soft zone in the mattress) should offset the shoulder height.
Something has our modern mattresses have in common with the first (with hay filled) straw bags.
Modern manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials or at least their mixtures.
The new spell word "Bio" is also used in mattresses.
Instead of petroleum raw materials, it is used for the production of polyurethane foams increasingly natural oils - for example ricinus and soya oil.
Soya is probably used by all known producers.
"Bio is called mattresses, which consist of materials of pure natural origin," explains Petr Vašíček by the company Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are also used in the manufacture of mattress supplies - one of the first was Aloe Vera.
However, microcapsules can also be used to spread fresh forest or lavender scent while sleeping.
Here too, you make a difference between man and wife.
While a "cooling" plant extract from birch leaves is used in men to allow the mattress connection to absorb the heat and cool the body, the loads for women have "warming" effect.
Extracts from red peppers stimulate the circulation of blood, so the weaker sex gets warm when sleeping.
What about today's favourites?
Mattresses made of cold foam (it has larger pores with destroyed cell structure and is therefore breathing more active than commercial polyurethane and also much more flexible).
The combination of the different stiffs (hardness) of cold and visco foams creates more zone mattresses that know exactly where their heads, hips and heels are.
However, for a high-quality mattress you have 7000 crowns and more to grab.
However, health rates are usually charged with lower VAT, as they are considered to be medical devices.
As the first Czech company, Gumotex was granted this advantage.
You can see saving the mattress and the rust is not that easy.
Occasionally there are special offers from manufacturers and dealers who offer two mattresses at the price of one.
The Magniflex brand offers the duofreeze mattress with a stamped Visco foam memory for 11.990 CZK.
The second one gets free of charge.
It was the material tempure that introduced the era of viscoleastic foam materials with open cell structure and high density at almost cosmic speed.
No wonder they were developed for the NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to enormous overburdens at the start.
Tempur is soft in heat, in a cool environment it restrains itself.
Thus it adapts perfectly to the human body and distributes the body pressure optimally.
It is therefore not only ideal to prevent pressure fire, but generally increases sleep comfort.
Viscoolastic foam materials are used not only for mattresses but also for other health products, such as special footpads to facilitate legs and vessels.
For example, local manufacturers use the foam materials Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
More and more parents want human surveillance devices to control the kids
The fear of their own children is growing, and so more and more parents are considering monitoring them by GPS.
The system originally invented for the capture of cars can as well locate people, which would also be helpful in such cases as recently when the nine-year-old Anička Janatková disappeared.
The device is currently about as large as a cigarette box but it should not be bigger than a bracelet watch soon.
Many people have put the case of the disappeared Anička into fear and terror and thus keep them looking for means and ways to protect their children better.
Also for the price of damaging their privacy.
"We strive to say to everyone that this is not a question of spying around, but of an effective means of reducing the likelihood of tragedy," Petr Pilin of the company Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of GPS locators on the Czech market.
"I admit that there may be abuse of such devices in individual cases, for example if you put it in someone's pocket without knowing about it, but we didn't have a case like that so far."
"Most customers really buy it for security reasons," Pilin adds.
In his opinion, however, the child should always know what purpose the "box" serves and how to use it in an emergency.
However, child psychologist Dana Bočková points out that if a child does not like to wear such a thing, it simply loses his.
"Even very small children show great creativity when it comes to losing certain things deliberately if they don't want to be controlled."
"In the beginning the phones raised great expectations with parents, but they can be turned off as easily as these new surveillance devices," says Mrs Bočková.
In their opinion, it is also controversial whether such an institution actually helps in the event of an attack.
"In the case of planned abductions, the kidnapper practically always controls whether the child has any electronics that could be located with it."
"Today it's the phone."
"If such monitoring devices were to be used more widely, they would also be looking for them, as their sale would surely be accompanied by massive advertising."
"In these cases the police criminals are always one step ahead," the psychologist says.
However, it recognises that similar devices can be helpful in a sudden attack by a pedophile.
According to Roberta Čech from the company RC Monitoring, which offers location services both for automobiles and for people, the existence of such a device can help even if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
"The device can be adjusted in such a way that it reports the respective position at certain intervals."
"Even if it was destroyed immediately, at least the last position of the person concerned is available."
"In the case of more expensive devices, even an inclination knife is integrated, that is, if you fall and remain unmovable, the device instantly sends a warning indicating the position," says Mr Čech.
In his opinion, similar services could also provide intelligent mobile phones with navigation, only one needs to play a special software.
The problem of the current locating devices is that this is either about equipment in string box size that resembles trailers or about smaller phones.
There's always a risk of losing them.
Mr Pilin from the Macro Because, according to the fact, it is tested in the present equipment that looks like normal digital aluminums.
"This has the advantage that the possible attacker does not have to recognise that it is a monitoring or location device at all.
"Or he will not know until after a certain period of time what the police will give a forward of time," he adds.
No matter in which direction the development goes - to bracelets or trailers, the same technology is always used as in the vehicle location.
So to combine the location function using the GPS system (as with the Navi in the car) and the function of a mobile phone that reports the current position.
The army has so many flames that you could wrap up all of the Czech Republic but only hold you for two years
The Czech army has purchased 445 kilometers of lightning, with explosives.
In the year before, the Ministry of Defense had already delivered 224 kilometers of lightning to the army camps.
It is reassuring to know that the armed forces have provided for 225 years.
The problem is only the durability of the ignition cutter - two, but not more than four years.
The army bought the ignition cut from the STV Group, a.s. for lepic 40 million crowns.
In his justification for purchasing this huge amount of lightning, the MF DNES team replied that the soldiers would be consumed annually to the 60 kilometers of ignition.
According to the armeepyrotechnicians' research, MF DNES referred to it, this statement shows that the entire army has to carry out an extremely intensive pyrotechnic training every year - from all the generals and officers of the Army Command, to the secretary women.
Minister of Defence Alexandr Vondra and Army General Vlastimil Picek are not excluded.
Only in this way could the significant annual consumption of 60 kilometres of ignition cranes be partly justified.
By the way, this length corresponds to 25,000 detonations.
But this would also be enough for these army stocks for more than ten years.
However, if the old rule of experts still applies that for training every new professional soldier is completely sufficient two metres of lightning, then the army has created a reassuring stock for the 225 years already mentioned, even in view of the increased need of pioneering and special units.
In doing so, soldiers of the Rapid Operation Brigade recently complained to Defense Minister Vondra that they had almost no more cartridges for hand firearms, so that shooting exercises of the missing funds are severely limited because of the lack of funds.
To be silent about the lack of underpants.
"I don't understand why they buy from us such lots of flames."
But this is ultimately their decision, they will already know what they need. "
"For us, the army is a good customer we want to meet as a dealer as far as possible," says the sales manager of the STV Group Jan Děcký.
Jan Pejšek, the spokesman of the Ministry of Defence, founded the purchase of hundreds of kilometres of ignition by the fact that the army had covered with this "ammunition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děcký of the STV Group only speaks of a four-year period of use of the antenna and police and army pyrotechnicians only of two years.
"In the case of perfect storage, the four years mentioned may also be possible," one of them admits, but wants to remain unnamed in order not to be accused of criticism of the army as a soldier.
After the end of the period of use, any ammunition must be thoroughly tested whether it is still reliable and does not endanger the lives of the soldiers.
These tests are not for free, but they cost more money.
Another argument of the Ministry of Defence is the volume discount for the 445 kilometers of ignition.
"They cost us sixty percent less than last year's delivery of 244 kilometres," spokesman Pejšek tells us the position of the purchasers of the Ministry of Defence.
Only for comparison: The annual consumption of fireworks from the police's pyrotechnicians, liquidating the ammunition from the Second World War or the Soviet Brotherhood has for a few years hardly exceeded 1,500 meters.
And the police always order only the quantities of this ammo that they can consume before the end of the use period.
Even because of the safety of pyrotechnicians, it also opens up the possibility of more flexible purchases of more modern and thus also reliable ignition cutters.
The Ministry of Defence has enormous problems with the liquidation of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from times of the Warsaw Treaty, when the two hundred thousand capitals of the Czechoslovakian People's Army were preparing for their campaign to the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnicians, MF DNES addressed, the Czech armed forces are expecting the same problem in the liquidation of hundreds of kilometres of old ignition that they have purchased today so "cheap."
Up to today I have found the contacts that I have won thanks to the competition
The victorious placement in the competition "Small Entrepreneurs of the Year" has helped Lukáš Pytloun to sell the franchises of his hotel.
The winner of the last year's competition "Small Entrepreneurs of the Year" was Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec.
The story of his success looks like a movie scenario.
Lukáš Pytloun liked to travel.
Only abroad became aware of the lack of good accommodation at reasonable prices in Liberec.
From the savings of his holiday work abroad and using a bank loan he created a bond house with five apartments.
If you remember that he was a university student at the time in the sixth semester, this was certainly a brave undertaking.
"The price-quality ratio at that time annoyed me and so I tried to do something about it," says Lukáš Pytloun.
He rented the first reconstructed apartment to foreign workers.
He immediately invested all the profits back into the house, which he then changed step by step to the pension with 54 beds.
Since then, he has been able to open four pensions, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all accommodation categories in Liberec for only seven years.
The most comfortable of them until recently was the four-star hotel "Pytloun Design Hotel."
This year another first-class hotel was added.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, which we sold our franchise concept and other interested parties at the franchise of the Pytloun hotels have already reported," says the entrepreneur number one of last year.
"A large proportion of this license sale for the operation of hotels had just the victory in the competition" Entrepreneurs of the year, "added Mr Pytloun acknowledging.
The victory has brought him greater acquaintance, yes popularity in Liberec and surroundings.
"People recognized me on the street, often they even congratulated me afterwards and I have to say that did really well," he remembers.
I really recommend to all those who want to create something to participate in this competition.
You don't have to win at once either, any visibility is good.
He says that until today he has benefited from the contacts and acquaintances to which otherwise it would not have come at all.
"With some people I met thanks to the competition, I have to keep regular business relationships so far."
In his opinion, the glory associated with success also falls down a little on each of his employees.
And that's where he's got the seventy.
"I note with them greater loyalty and pride that they are part of something that will be granted general recognition."
I see this not only as a personal success, no, that is the result of the good work of all of us. "
"My name is just a little in the foreground," says Lukáš Pytloun.
I wish my successor a more calm year than we had in Farmet
The victory seuphory was quickly replaced by the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to his intensity, Farmet has the worst behind him.
Karel Žárský, the company owner of Farmet, received the prize for the first rank of the competition Vodafone Company of the year last year.
At that time, the jury appreciated the efforts he made from the small tool building in Česká Skalice to put a company out of the ground, making hundreds of millions of sales.
"I can say that this appreciation encourages not only myself, but also all my employees and has strengthened our self-consciousness in the fight with competition," says the previous year's winner.
At the beginning of the company history of Farmet was the effort to do something useful.
And then when the state offered his father Karel Žárský as a compensation for the property seized by the Communists a small workshop to the cargo, he did not hesitate for long, left his career in the company where he was employed until then, and founded with a few comrades of his father's own company to manufacture plastic winds.
Shortly later, they began to focus on vegetable oil presses.
Within 18 years they have become the largest manufacturer of automatic pressing throughout Central Europe.
But only through the success of the competition and its mediation it has also entered the consciousness of the non-professional public.
"Not only that our customers now perceive the Farmet brand significantly more intensively, our foreign partners also began to work with a company that has achieved the greatest success in their country," says Karel Žárský.
The last year, however, was not only in the sign of the victory seuphory at Farmet.
The assessment was based on the company's economic results in 2008 and part of 2009.
And just 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of tool construction products.
The crisis, which at that time shook the citizens even less, but above all businesses, just reached their peak - many companies were forced to cancel their investment projects and to restrict the purchase of new facilities and technologies.
"Of course, we could not miss this situation."
"The sales decreased by 40 percent, we had to reduce production and even take redundancies," explains Karel Žárský
A viable company sometimes also needs to take such unpopular measures.
But it succeeded in getting the situation under control and keeping the company in the black numbers, even if it had less profits than before the crisis.
For one, the company was not willing to cancel - in investment in research and development.
"From the grant we built a research and training centre, we strengthened our presentation at international fairs and gained main prices at domestic exhibitions," says Žīárský.
Everything shows that we have overcome the crisis.
Turnover is growing again and with them also the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner a great deal of joy in victory - but in a more quiet atmosphere," Karel Žárský says.
An opinion survey cleaned up with insane rules
The opinion survey on the "absurdity of the year" is part of entrepreneurship competition for the fourth time.
Some insane regulations have already managed to get out of the world.
With regard to the doubtful winner of the next year of the opinion survey "absurdity of the year", the obligation to create documents on the Internet was extended.
Thus, more than one third of non-four thousand voting entrepreneurs decided.
Thus, the social security administration requested a paper extract from the trade register, even if the official could have called it through two mouse clicks.
This is now changing thanks to the opinion survey.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require extracts from the trade register in the future in the case of checks on social security payers," the spokeswoman of ČSSZ Jana Buraňová introduced.
The purpose and purpose of the opinion survey "Absurdity of the Year" is to take all the rules and instructions under the loops, to meet the entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic and to remove the insinuators.
This is already part of an entrepreneurial competition this year for the fourth time, which is organised by the Czech Economic Newspaper (HN) and is pleased to see growing popularity in the public.
Last year, when the three thousand people took part in the vote, there were four thousand this year.
No wonder, because there are still a lot of legal obligations that only serve to hinder business activity.
"For example, as regards the number of income tax forms, we take a leading role in the world," Karel Havlíček noted by the association of small and medium-sized enterprises and business operators in the Czech Republic.
The simplification of entrepreneurship has been the proclaimed goal of all governments in recent years.
However, compared to the world, the situation in the Czech Republic has hardly improved.
According to the World Bank, in terms of business conditions, the Czech Republic takes the 74th rank, with an eight-posted position compared to the previous year.
The competition absurdity of the year was first announced in the year and plays each year according to the same scenario.
Everyone can report administrative and bureaucratic nonsense from April to the end of the competition at the end of September.
For registration, the website address www.firmaroku.cz. The competition organiser seeks seven candidates for the "antiprize" and leaves the public to vote on the Internet on the websites www.firmaroku.cz / absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
It wins the absurdity that gets most votes.
With regard to this year's opinion survey, more than a hundred, more specifically 105 meaningless rules and orders have already been notified.
The tips are not only from entrepreneurs but also from professional associations and journalists.
Among the nominated "finalists" of the competition are, for example, provisions that maintenance vehicles for motorways and highways must pay toll or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets must be provided every two years.
The list of this year's "Seven" is published on the pages of the competition.
The opening of the competition at the Prague Wenzelsplatz at the beginning of November is part of an event where people of political and public life regularly participate.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, the director of the association of small or medium-sized enterprises and commercial operators of the Czech Republic and Petr Kužel, the President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic at the peak of the competition with the party.
"Where the State throws the entrepreneurs into the legs, there can be no real economic recovery, so my aim is to lift at least thirty paragraphs every year that are still unnecessarily difficult for the entrepreneurs today," Martin Kocourek, Minister for Industry and Trade, announced.
The efforts to get insane orders out of the world show effect.
In 2007, people most interrupted the obligation imposed on entrepreneurs to report three days in advance to the Commercial Office at the place of their permanent establishment to the intention to drive with an exhibition stand to an exhibition or to a church.
This obligation was cancelled by a novel of the commercial law.
The obligation to receive the second largest number of votes in 2007 - the obligation to report service journeys of employees up to 30 days - was abolished by the law on them so-called "Green Card."
And - all good things are three:
For the absurdity of the year 2009, the regulation imposed on physiotherapists to have a mirror, a refrigerator and two passenger waves in the speaking room was chosen.
This regulation has been somewhat reduced by the Ministry of Health this year - the cooling system has fallen away.
A new category appreciates socially responsible companies
Assessment criteria are humanitarian, environmental, educational or sports projects
A novelty in this year's fifth year of competition of the economic newspaper (HN) is the category "Responsible Company of the Year 2010."
The fundamental idea of this competition is to promote sensible and fair entrepreneurs.
"We want to support companies that are aware of the environmental impact of your business and support socially responsible initiatives," says Patrik Bartholdy, the regional manager of the Vodafon mobile phone company, the competitor and guarantor of this competition, as well as the competition "Rebell of the Year."
For the first year of this particular subcategory of the main competition Vodafon company of the year, companies were registered for which success is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each one of them is extremely inspiring and evil enough fabric for an independent article.
Although they differ diametrically with regard to the subject of their activities, their efforts nevertheless have a common denominator - support and consideration.
This is, for example, about disabled people, because of personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from all over the Czech Republic, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera also appeared, which promotes the creation of non-formal sports teams among its employees, who then participate in numerous tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice region is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main sponsor of a foundation fund for disabled children for seventeen years.
A paper factory from Poděbrady also provides an exemplary care for its healthcare disabled employees, representing 70 percent of their staff, for which it was recognised as the "responsible company of the region of Mittelböhmen"; in the competition of Vodafone company of the year, it occupied the third rank within this region.
In the Olomouc region, the Accounting Company MiRyz Soft, which introduced, among other things, a floating and also reduced working time to an average of 35 hours per week, without a proportionate wage reduction.
The jury also honored the fact that the company purchases mainly from Czech manufacturers, supports citizens' initiatives in their surroundings and works according to environmentally friendly principles.
"We strive to recycle as much as possible to minimise the impact of our business and administration on the environment," explains her Managing Director Miluše Ryznarová.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the region Ústí nad Labem in turn is located in the health of its employees and therefore it has created them to all notebooks ergonomic chairs and keyboards, it also promotes home work with its employees and uses cartering services offered by a home-protected workshop in company operations.
"In addition, we support the Foundation" People in distress, "which provides concrete help to the local Roma community," says Ondřej Suchý, the representative of the company.
Last but not least, the activities of the cleaning company "Praní a čištění" from the Karlsbader region, which contributes its employees in the form of extra bonuses to their pension insurance.
"We provide our employees with contributions to food, the way to work, the increase of their qualifications and the holiday," says Josef Strapáč from the construction company Czasch from Bruntál, the winner in the Mährisch-Schlesisch Region.
For the category of responsible company of the year, all districts finalists of the competition Vodafon company of the year were automatically registered, which answered the questions of the questionnaire submitted and sent it to the organizer by 15 August.
Wrong or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were excluded from the evaluation by the organiser.
"If the representatives of the competing companies left the questions unanswered, they were excluded from the competition" Responsible Company of the Year, "but in the main competition Vodafone Company of the year they were not disqualified."
"A separate application only to this competition is not possible as it is only a subcategory of the main competition company of the year," explains Karel Goldman from the organizing agency Bison & Rose.
Pilsner Ground Fund - arrests of the police in a public tender
In the building of the ground fund in Pilsen, the anti-corruption police have been arrested in the last few days.
The local media entrepreneur and real estate dealer Luboš G. was taken away from the detectives in gloves.
It allegedly attempted to manipulate a current public competition on the settlement of refund claims in such a way that the land offered in competition belonged to a specific interested party.
He said that Luboš G. paid half a million for it.
"At that time, I can only confirm that the police are persecuting a person for the crime of fraud in public competition," said Antonie Zelená, the head of the Pilsner Public Prosecutor of the "Právo" newspaper, "she could not give any further details regarding the ongoing investigations.
24 hours later, the 46-year-old entrepreneur was released from the police again.
In the way it could manipulate public competition, it can only be speculated in the light of the limited official information.
The spokesperson of the Land Fund Lubomír Černá referred to the relevant question by Právo that the police had actually taken arrests in the Pilsner branch of the Land Fund and this during a public competition.
"It was about a client, and it was about one of our employees," she concrete.
According to the public competition, Ms Černá had the correct designation of "invitation to offer claims for transfer of land under the Land Act" and would take place in cases where several applicants show interest in the land offered.
"These persons offer, within the framework of the call, a higher value of their entitlements to be reimbursed by the transfer than the value of the land collected."
"In accordance with the entitlements offered, the order of the potential acquirers shall be determined and the ground fund shall then transfer the property to the person with the highest offer," explains the spokesperson of the fund.
Luboš G. apparently provided information on who had entered the request and since he was a legitimate person, since he had purchased a number of claims for reimbursement, he offered a property interest that he would withdraw from the competition.
Obviously against a fat discovery.
That would also be a sufficient explanation for why he had such a large amount of money in his arrest.
Luboš G. had already had too good contacts with the Pilsner Bodenfonds in the past.
He also played a role in the Causa of the former head of the soil fund Václav Sankota, which was punishable by criminal law, because he issued land in replacement refunds to which site decisions had already been made on construction projects.
At that time, for example, Luboš G. also acquired land intended for the construction of public roads, at the place where the construction of the admission magistrale to the business area of Borské pole was planned.
Later he exchanged this very favorable with the magistrate against a house directly in the historic centre of the city, which exceeded the value of the land.
At the time the town hall had to give small children's heart in order not to jeopardize the construction project by blocking the land.
Households' housing costs rise by a few hundreds per month
From January onwards, households will have to expect not only higher costs for all energy types, but also higher water and sewage charges, and for district heating and some places the rent is also growing.
Families will have to draw several hundred crowns from the wallet every month from January.
Electricity will cost up to 4.6 per cent, gas will cost 2 per cent and more, in some cities you will have to pay up to a tenth more for water supplies and in some places also cost district heating.
The household costs a few hundred more dollars per year only for the electricity depreciation.
The strong electricity prices have been reduced by all major suppliers, so it is due to the significant promotion of electricity generation from renewable sources, including photovoltaic systems.
While gas is only getting moderately more expensive, it is exactly what people need to heat the most and have the highest consumption.
Here too, we can expect a few hundred crowns more per year.
While electricity and gas are becoming more expensive throughout the Czech Republic, the prices for district heating vary from city to city.
Above all, larger places plan price increases.
For example, households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové will have to pay more than 50 crowns per month from January, and more than 1000 crowns per year to pay families in Liberec.
The inhabitants of Prague again threaten 9 percent higher water and sewage charges in case the city increases infrastructure rent.
If the rent doesn't change, it's only 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague is still one of the lowest compared to the whole of the Czech Republic.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already one of the highest, water and sewage charges should rise by 7.4 per cent.
For example, large increases in rental prices are expected in 140,000 rentals, where the so-called rental regulation will lapse from January.
For example, the home company CPI Byty, which owns 2500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem, plans to increase the rental by 100 percent from January.
If you disagree with this increase in rent, the company wants to play a judicial role.
Regular rentals, which are still paid in almost 300,000 apartments today, are expected to rise by more than 10 percent next year.
Czech children are drunk with Fernet and Rum beer is out - it just seems too slow
Fernet, rum and vodka, exceptionally a good whiskey that the father was stolen from the house bar.
These are the beverages after which drunk Czech teenagers under fifteen most often need to be treated as emergency.
No exception are children who have to sleep in the hospital repeatedly.
This is reflected in the experience of doctors confronted with similar cases in the reception of the children's departments of clinics.
"Beer or wine are completely out of fashion because it just takes too long to be drunk."
"Today's trend is clearly hard alcohol," said Právo Luděk Pelikán, the head of the children's department in the medieval Bohemia clinic Hořovice.
"Whisky, if it succeeds to remove a bottle from the house bar to the father, and if not, then at least Fernet or vodka.
"Vodka has the advantage that you can mix it with Juice, then he doesn't smell so strong," explains the chief doctor.
The spokesperson of the Faculty Hospital Motol Eva Jurinová gives him the right.
"The most common thing is about Fernet or rum."
"This is today's alcohol trend, especially at primary schools."
"Unicularly, it was also about Slibowitz, which was taken from home," Mrs Jurinová suggested.
According to Chief Pelikán, thirteen or fourteen-year-old drinkers in hospital occupation have not yet been a derogation.
Before the hospital in Hořovice, where he worked this year, he worked for ten years at the paediatric department of the hospital Motol, where the rescue cars delivered drowned pupils from near and far.
"A girl had to be hospital four times."
"Her career began at 12 years, when she was first delivered with 3.5 promille of alcohol in the blood and in combination with" Extase, "the doctor described a particularly serious case.
"She was in the exhibition site in Holešovice at some dance party."
"The interesting thing about it was that her mother didn't seem strange that her daughter didn't come home 48 hours," wonders the chief.
It is precisely the lack of interest of parents or their incredible tolerance in attacking their own rivers that is considered one of the main causes of growing child alcoholism.
According to experts there is no real dependence in the true sense of the word in children.
"Alcoholism is a long-standing chronic dependence on alcohol and all related phenomena, and this is not the case for these children."
For those who enjoy alcohol repeatedly, it is usually a negative family-social background characteristic, "says Chief Expert Pelikán.
According to the spokeswoman of Motol Hospital, Mrs Jurinová, about forty drunk children were deployed in the local Department of Child and Youth Medicine until mid-November.
However, only cases of severe alcohol poisoning requiring hospital stay are included in the statistics.
Drunk children who are brought home after ambulance treatment by parents or, where appropriate, by the police are not registered.
Apart from the cases where children have only one bottle of liquor in the school bank, Mr Pelikán believes that there are three amplitudes of year, which are 100% abandoned: Walpurgisnacht, New Year's Eve and the end of the year.
"The latter for two reasons - either for sorrow for bad testimony or for joy on vacation."
"In the Walpurgisnacht I have already experienced seven drunk children at once in the recording," emphasises Dr. Pelikán.
A drunk child spending the night under medical supervision is paradoxically better on it than a child who has only an unpleasant cat to fight the next day.
The headaches in the morning following, which are caused by dehydration and glucose deficiency, can be distributed in the hospital with a fluid-donating infusion of glucose and nutrients missing to the organism.
"They are clearly better at it, because after the" wonderful "experience in the evening, they wake up with good mood without hurt anywhere."
"They are just a little confused about where they are," Dr. Pelikán admits, sometimes destroying the patient's good mood by telling them the costs that they will cost the treatment.
Because the transport with the rescue car and the night in an emergency bed come well and would like to get to a few thousand crowns.
"Sometimes I used this as a educational tool when I predicted directly to the children at the visit, which has cost their drunkenness and that it can happen that they have to work all the holidays to earn the money for one of these feathers," Dr. Pelikán added.
In his opinion, however, the sickness funds do not act according to regression procedures to request the costs necessary for the healing of the drowning children from parents.
Two training planes L-159 in foreign hands for the first time - in Spain
Two light combat aircraft L-159 of a total of five that the Czech Ministry of Defence exchanged against the transport plane Casa C-295M flew to the Spanish city of Seville on Tuesday, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS resides.
It is the first time that machines of this type are owned by a foreign army.
They have so far only been seen abroad at manoeuvres or flight shows.
This is about the flight-able twin version L-159T1 operated by the Czech army.
The remaining three aircraft are one-seat L-159.
These are currently preserved in the Aero Vodochody, the intermediary of this business - the company Omnipol - took over it last week.
When expediting the aircraft physically from Vodochody, Jan Pejšek, speaker of the Ministry of Defense, is not known yet.
The one-sided aircraft L-159 were separated from long-term aeroplanes without further deposits and investments from the Ministry's site.
"The double-sitting L-159T1 were exchanged in current state and appearance," Pejšek said Právo newspaper.
He added that the army would not have to get out without two-seat combat aircraft, as the Ministry of Defence signed a 200-million contract with Aero Vodochody on the conversion of four superfluous L-159 to the two-seat version in May 2009.
A new plane took over the army in July, the second will take over it by the end of this year.
According to Pejšek, EADS has committed itself to enforcing the aircraft in the equipment of one of the NATO countries.
"The Treaty states that the company EADS is the recipient of aircraft L-159 and is intended to serve to train pilot NATO countries.
"It is therefore the responsibility of the recipient, in what way he realizes the matter," Pejšek introduced.
The economic newspaper (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish Government has no interest in the L-159.
The exchange trade of five L-159 against a transport plane Casa and the purchase of other aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns had been approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
The Ministry of Defence had not then signed a tender procedure for the purchase, but addressed EADS directly.
The Defence Office then argued that this exchange would support the future export of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought Aero 72 machines from which she only uses 24, the rest she wanted to sell.
By the way, the purchase of the airplanes Casa is also likely to have a legal aftermath.
The European Commission brought the Czech Ministry of Defence to the European Court of Justice, because it should have selected the aircraft on the basis of a whole European call for tenders and had to do so by responding to a single manufacturer.
The army has already taken over three aircraft Casa, the last is to land at Kbely Airport within 14 days.
A longer Zeigefinger than ring finger means a lower risk of cancer
Men whose finger is longer than the ring finger are obviously at a lower risk of suffering from prostate cancer.
This is the surprising result of a study published on Wednesday by the British Journal of Cancer.
This is supposed to be related to the mirror of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that the relative length of the fingers can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer, especially for men up to sixty," said the co-autorin of the study, Ros Eeles, professor at the cancer research institute at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help to determine which men should undergo a prostate cancer test, especially if genetic risks or other risk factors exist, such as family health burdens, Mrs Eeles added.
In the period 1994-2009, she followed with her colleagues in Britain more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer, but at the same time 3,000 healthy men.
With more than half of the participants in the study, the right hand drawing finger was shorter than the ring finger.
For these men, the probability of prostate cancer was the same as for 19 percent of those men whose ring and drawing fingers were equal.
However, in men whose finger was longer than the ring finger, this risk decreased by 33 per cent, and in men up to 60 per cent by 87 per cent.
The ratio of the length of the two fingers mentioned, which are already in prenatal age, clearly reflects the different levels of gender hormones that the child was exposed to in the womb.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer pointer finger.
Previous research revealed that the testosterone is accelerating the growth of prostate cancer.
Václav Pačes, the leading Czech geneticist and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences, said ČTK that he was well known for this study, yet he does not consider the relationship between finger length and cancer risk to be "fully proven."
Czech Republic in snow - D1 and D5 are locked
Just like the majority of Europe, the Czech Republic is also under a snow blanket on Thursday morning.
On the streets and walking roads is mostly fixed snow, the winter service workers were many places all night on axis.
The D5 motorway between kilometres 89 and 90 in the direction of Rozvadov is blocked by some accidents of trucks and cars and also the D1 at Brno in the direction of Prague.
This said Novinky.CZ of the Dispatchers of the Central Auto Moto Club (ÚAMK).
A truck crashed at kilometers 91, two trucks collapsed at kilometers 93, and there were injuries in this accident.
Also a few cars are in the street tomb.
There are also problems at kilometres 185 of the D1 motorway towards Prague.
Here too, two trucks collapsed.
Drivers should drive right behind Brno at kilometers 190 or over Brno and drive at kilometers 182 to Kývalka.
Because there are kilometers of stops.
There was an accident on the D11, and it happened at the same time at the entrance to Prague.
In Prague itself is a several centimeters thick snow blanket and the thermometer shows minus seven degrees Celsius.
Autokolons, for example, form in the Prosek district, also the Štěrboholská road is completely blocked.
The safest means of transport is definitely the Metro.
The trams run with delays, for example on the line between Karlsplatz and Friedensplatz.
At 8: 00 in the morning, the Prague crisis team meets.
There are also problems with the railroad and the airport.
The Czech State Railway had to cancel seven fast-train connections due to snow defects.
There are problems for example on the route Prague - Kralupy or also Prague - Beroun.
Travellers should be informed of the current situation.
The Airport Ruzyně has been closed since Wednesday 11: 00 a.m. to 5: 00 a.m. in the morning.
Most roads in southern Morocco are only available with increased caution.
Around Vyškov are three adjacent roads completely inaccessible, in the vicinity of Brno there are occasional snowboards and in the vicinity of Blansko you are forced to use snowboards on some higher roads.
One of the most affected areas is Výškov.
There are still three streets completely locked: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and Šaratice - Milešovice.
Here too, you will have to use snow feathers for sneezing.
When they return to operation, it is not possible to estimate it until now.
In the region of Hodonín, caution is required in the area of white carpats.
On the streets, which can only be scattered with inert scratches for nature protection reasons, is a up to five centimeters thick snow blanket, ČTK led.
In the Czech Republic, snow fell from two to ten centimeters, most in northern Bohemia - at times up to 18 centimeters.
In the Mährisch-Schlesisch region, up to 15 centimeters of new snow fell.
In the Czech Republic, however, it stops cutting slowly.
American soldiers have a new "intelligent weapon."
The American troops have used for the first time in Afghanistan a new "intelligent" weapon known only under their code name XM-25.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon will influence the conflict there with the Taliban and postpone the relationship of power to its advantage.
The new weapon is like a super-precise gun.
Their projectiles are distracted to the target by laser with a hit security of just a few meters.
The special shots of caliber 25 mm, designed for this rifle and containing highly explosive explosives, work practically as small grenades.
The shots can be programmed in such a way that they can explode at any point of their ballistic airline, not only when they hit the target.
That means you can use them against an enemy hiding behind a barrier - a wall or in a shelter.
Because from above it is usually not protected, so the murderous steel splitting rain from above can easily put it out of battle.
According to Richard Audett, who participated in the development of the XM-25, the new combat weapon is the first infantry weapon that uses "intelligent" technologies.
"The soldier basically goes on like this: he visibly the target and sends out a laser beam that determines the distance, he wins a precise point of vision after which he corrects the angle of elevation, then he only needs to push down.
"Let's say they measured 543 m."
"When you press, the gun charges up and shoots the gun at the distance of 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters.
400 jobs are being moved
Fujitsu Group relocates its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 employees will be transferred to the Astro Park by the previous office building at the Marienbader Square in Bad Homburg.
The Japanese group Fujitsu relocates its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the industry giant specialised in computers and maintenance on Wednesday, 400 women and men will be moved to the Astro Park in July next year from the previous office building at the Marienbader square in Bad Homburg, which is a major office complex on the Lyoner street in the Frankfurter district of Niederrad.
A spokesperson from Fujitsu explained that in the medium term, there should be another 100 jobs of the group, which had so far been distributed to the region.
The rental offer had been extremely attractive, and the large-scale offices in the Astro Park would be better off to the workplace of the employees.
Fujitsu had also been a tenant in Bad Homburg.
The responsible managing director Bernd Wagner said, "With Frankfurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure."
Excellent connection to the airport is particularly important for a global company such as Fujitsu.
The recent move of an important company within the region yesterday highlighted joy among the winners and disappointment among the losers.
Frankfurter Economic Descriptor Markus Frank (CDU) said that a "Global Player" had been won again.
This is a "great location knowledge."
Fujitsu passes to the city, the settlement is an important stimulus for Niederrad.
The Bad Homburger Supreme Mayor Michael Korwisi (The Greens) regretted Fujitsu's decision.
The city had been informed early by the management of the plan.
"We have, of course, offered our help to the company," said Korwisi.
The friendly contacts, however, could not have changed the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the property at the Marienbader place.
In the end, economic reasons would have given rise to rash.
Now it is about preventing a long distance in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building will be cooperative."
The house used by Fujitsu so far at the Rathausplatz and the adjacent "Small Vertical" belonged to the most controversial projects of the Kurstadt with the rest of the buildings at the Marienbader Square ten years ago.
As a joint project of the city and a private project developer between the railway station and the town hall, a new city tree was created, which led to criticism both because of the massive construction of the areas used previously as a parking lot and the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment consultancy and credit rating company Feri, the software manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, and the computer manufacturer Fujitsu, who was then associated with Siemens, took the houses.
The building used by Fujitsu was acquired in 2006 by the Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen Group together with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and sold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid a year later.
The Fujitsu conquer in Tokyo is the third largest IT provider in the world.
He provides companies for example computers and servers and also provides the necessary service.
The establishment in the Rhein-Main area is one of the largest in Germany, but much more employees count in Fujitsu in Munich.
From Bad Homburg, the subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions takes place in Frankfurt-Niederrad, the other subsidiaries at this site are supposed to be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
For this, 7000 square meters were rented in the Astro Park office building.
In the twenty-year-old complex - the name plays on its star-shaped base rice - the Central Association of Electro-Technology and Electronics Industry has its seat.
Amazon blocks server - threats against Assange
Wikileaks are increasingly in trouble.
The Internet service provider Amazon has banished the disclosure platform from its servers.
Perhaps there is political pressure behind it after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomats.
Wikileaks founder Assange is allegedly staying in England.
The Wikileaks discovering platform is increasingly under attack in the United States.
Internet activists lost access to their previous American server and are now looking for an Internet home in Europe.
The prominent American Senator Joe Lieberman called other countries and companies to the boycott of Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol's capture lists, is supposed to stay in Britain according to a newspaper report.
"Wikileaks displaced by Amazon servers."
"Freie Rede im Land der Freien," announced the discovery activists by short news service Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the Internet company Amazon had banished the Wikileaks documents from its servers.
The Internet activists had taken advantage of the Amazon Web Service (AWS) in order to manage the high numbers of access to the documents when the secret diplomatic depots were published.
Per Twitter Wikileaks continued to say: "Fine - our dollars are now spent to employ people in Europe."
If Amazon has such a problem with freedom of speech, "they should stop selling books."
Amazon had stopped using its servers by Wikileaks after staff of Senator Joe Lieberman had recruited investigations, the TV station CNN reported on the Liebermans office.
The chairman of the Senate Committee on Home Protection had threatened Amazon with a boycott, the British "Guardian."
"I wish that Amazon would have taken this measure earlier in view of previous publications of classified information by Wikileaks," said the senator.
Lieberman therefore called on the platform to refuse to use servers in other countries.
"Wikileaks' illegal, monstrous and unscrupulous action jeopardises our national security and endangers life around the globe," was said in a message from the unpartially senator.
"No responsible company - whether American or foreign - should help Wikileaks to disseminate stolen material."
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is sought by the Swedish authorities for suspected rape, is on the Interpol flag list.
According to a report from the London newspaper "The Independent," the 39-year-old Australian in the United Kingdom holds up, the exact location is Scotland Yard known.
The Internet activist has always called the investigation in Sweden as an intrigue of his opponents.
Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London there were threats.
"There were even calls for a murder of Julian Assange."
Hrafnsson said that Assange was quite afraid of his safety.
The Wikileaks founder will therefore continue to hide.
Hrafnsson apparently responded to statements from North America.
In America, the former Republican Governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, had called for the person responsible for the Wikileaks disclosures to be charged and executed for betrayal.
In Canada, an advisor of Heads of Government Stephen Harper - obviously ironically - said on television that Assange should be "killed" and Obama could "use a drone."
Between the White House and Assange there was a battle exchange.
The spokesman of American President Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange had demanded the resignation of Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton if she was responsible for recent emerging spy calls for diplomats.
"I'm not sure why we're taking care of a guy with a website," Gibbs said.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than its one website."
The American government is now putting the protection of its databases in full on the test stand.
As a special representative, the Deputy Director of the Centre for Anti-Terror Measures, Russell Travers, was appointed, the White House informed.
Travers was responsible for developing "necessary structural reforms" which had become necessary after the disclosure of the message reports by Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to check the ways in which the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The American government also announced that it would want to ensure the safety of dissidents and activists if they were put at risk by the Wikileaks publication.
"We have done everything we can to get in touch with them," said Foreign Minister Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if necessary."
The Ice University
At the Gelato University at Bologna, ice conditioners are prepared for better seasons.
The three-day basic course for future gelatieri has the largest opening and visitors from all over the world.
Where did the whole ice come from?
From the Gelataio and from the Gelataio.
The gelatiere, in German something old of the ice conditioner, produces the cream according to all the rules of Italian ice maker art.
The gelataio takes the ice cream out of the fridge with a spit, then pulls it into the waffle and then sells it.
To know that, you don't have to drive to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But whoever wants to know more about ice cream, he does not pass the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The Ice University set up the manufacturer of ice machines in 2003 so that the ice cream from its machines can meet the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future gelatieri has the largest opening and visitors from all over the world.
However, there are also multi-day special courses around chocolate ice cream and internships in the house's own ice diele.
Some people dream in the midlife crisis of a new career, others just dare themselves on the smooth ice of their vague desires.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, art teacher from California, loves the slow food movement and wants to offer a European quality product in the country of industrial ice cream.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant and after years wants to put something in a nervous job.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice diel in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars - and the Canadian housewife Julia comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari first explains the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream to participants.
Not only good taste is crucial, but also the silk delicacy and good consistency.
Luciano does not forget the soap of the national and even southern superstructure during his training: "Italian gelato is simply the best - and then there is still a lot of romance."
The first step to manufacture seems quite simple.
Luciano kicks the basic ingredients milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilisers into a large mixer that heats everything up to 85 degrees with an electronic program and then cools immediately to four degrees.
Then he turns a hooker on the machine, and out comes a pasteurised white base cream, base for all milk varieties.
Immediately the teacher is disturbed with questions: Can you only produce ice cream with natural substances without stabilizer?
How can you let your own experimental lust run free?
Luciano warns to get lost from the spirit of time.
Anyone who speaks of ice cream "only from natural ingredients," may still have used stabilizers - usually a natural product, such as guarcore flour from the guarbeans.
Of course you can make ice without a stabilizer, but it needs to be sold within a day, otherwise it sucks together, and the customer bites on loud ice grains.
Certain variations on the base mass are allowed.
It's getting more exciting with the flavors.
For the taste in the ice, Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients purchased in the fruit department or in the sweets of the supermarket.
There are also powder and paste.
"The suppliers will all try to give you dozens of aromatized additives."
"But you should just experiment."
Either with the fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or just with the ice cream from the white base mass that becomes yellow cream with eggs and cocoa powder as the basis for all possible chocolate seductions.
Now the trainees are allowed to use the ice machines.
Luciano makes it four different types of vanilla, chocolate, mocca and hazelnut ice cream - with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla claoma or other natural additives.
The same experiment also undergoes the fruit ice varieties.
More flavourings, more fruit puree - tasteful is not necessarily better.
Haselnut ice doesn't necessarily taste any nicer when it contains more Haselnuts.
The most popular Kiwi ice is the working group that uses more fruits, less water and a little less stabilizer.
First a balanced mixture correctly highlight the taste of a gelato, says Luciano.
Ice production is a calculation task: If peaches are used with a lot of sugar, the sugar content must be reduced in the basic recipe.
An extra portion of sugar is needed for lemon ice.
Luciano produces a device to determine the sugar content of the fruit varieties (wines measure the oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, tables make the computer easier.
Making ice doesn't require as much physical use as before.
Not only helps the device for the automatic production of the base mass.
There is also a device in which the finished ice mixture is beaten creamly at the same time and cooled at minimum temperatures.
In spite of all automation, small pans will not be left out.
The Brazilian Gustavo and his curriculum colleagues are dressed up to the bottom with fruit pur when the superdimensional stabmixer gets him out of control.
"In every course," says Maestro Luciano, "it's just a matter of time until something like that happens."
Double-light controllers
The European Food Authority Efsa has been undermined by the industry experimenting with genetic plants.
This accusation is now formulated by the Expert Group on Testbiotech, which understands itself as an independent Institute for the Impact Assessment of Biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we documented it well," said Testbiotech Chief Christoph Then on Wednesday in Munich.
The head of the Efsa Group of Experts on Genetically Modified Plants, Harry Kuiper, and another Efsa Expert have been contracted for years with Ilsi Lobbyist Association.
It is paid by concerts like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper has contributed significantly to the Efsa testing rules for genetically modified plants and is in a clear conflict of interest, then criticized.
Efsa rules are, on the other hand, identical to Ilsi's position papers and thus withdraw the handwriting of the industry, which is actually to be controlled by the authority in the Italian Parma.
It is already the second time that test biotech brightens an interest collision.
For example, a high-level Efsa manager was recently without a requirement or transitional period to the Swiss agricultural group Syngenta - and had thus switched the sides.
The Central German Radio (MDR) had also recently revealed human links between the EU's controlling authority and industrial lobby, which has made the environmental federation, as well as EU parliamentarians, light-hearted.
Efsa does not, however, recognise any conflict of interest.
It is said in an opinion that all serious data are used, including those of industry, as long as they are of high technical quality.
The experts working for Efsa do not demand that they have no contacts with industry.
But you have to disclose them.
Kuiper gives his work to the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States.
This calls itself a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics, including for risk assessment for biotechnology without lobbying.
In this case, independent experts such as then criticise that genetically modified plants are currently being approved without any feed test in animals and that the reaction of genetically modified plants to environmental influences is not being tested.
"We want to know what, for example, genetically modified maize is doing on the field," says then.
Current practice is to test only isolated proteins, but not all the genetic plants, which do not deliver reliable results.
"If you're not looking for the risks, how are you supposed to find them?" then ask accusations.
That's how Angelika Hilbeck sees it.
The scientist has been researching genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Technical University of Zurich.
Industry is now increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists in this area, as in the United States.
There are therefore few researchers that are not linked to companies.
For companies critical studies are usually not published.
"Industry controls security research," Hilbeck claims.
The trace of the stones
Uli Gsell also cared about some, a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday evening he stood at Stuttgart train station, the Tuba on the back.
It was demo.
It's snowing.
The story is known: in September the excavators had been attracted and had started to cancel a large piece of the north wing.
The Stuttgart world was no longer the same: Zigthousands demonstrated against S21, the billionaire defeat of the station.
When it came to the construction stop, most of the wing was in ruins.
Broken in 6000, 7000 pieces.
Crailsheimer's mule lime, a soft coarse stone, built between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in East Filders, 43 years old.
He's secured some of the cracks.
"These stones are relics."
"You can't disappear."
He swarms: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and earthly."
When he quit one, he smelled like cigarette torture.
He doesn't know what he's going to do with the cracks yet.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
The trail of Stuttgart stones leads to a forest near Tübingen on a former ammunition depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen built his stone kingdom.
The 44-year-old is dealing with old rocks.
He bought all those who attacked at the Abort in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame for them to be painted as shotters or disappear in the landfill," he says in his office, a wooden bouquet that once was a waitress.
He said that he had been impressed and threatened when he was in the newspapers in September that he bought the remains of the northern wing from the breaker.
But he talked to the S-21 opponents for days.
And he told them that he couldn't do anything for the dismantling.
And if it happens, it would be the most useful thing if the stones were used.
Approximately 200 S-21 opponents then took one of the average 80 kilos of heavy quadrilars, unit price 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a memorial, but also in the hope to be able to give it back in a reconstruction.
500 tons had bought Rongen, 25 large trucks.
About half is still in the forest, the rest has been sold for a long time.
Garden owners, landscape gardens, house builders.
They had come from everywhere and dragged away what was able to carry the trunk and trailers.
The Stuttgarter stones of the attack have long transformed into "mauerle" or into restrictions on herbal prayers.
"Actually, this stone is nothing special," says Rongen.
"Wouldn't be the political component."
He walks into his trailer, takes a tour through his 20 hectares of great empire.
Jura he studied and dismissed, later biology, then he was interested in computers and finally became a rock dealer.
And stone lovers.
40,000 tons of stones he stores.
From all over Germany, he carries his treasures together.
He says he's the largest old rock dealer in the Republic.
He's braking.
There are artificial sandstones in the snow.
"They were once part of the Dresdner Marienbridge," he says.
Elbsandstein, yellow, warm, he swarms.
"My favorite stone."
It's going up through the woods.
He points to a bunch of red sandstone, formerly part of Karlsruher station.
Let's go.
"Beautiful Travertin."
The Quader once belonged to the Tribüne of the Stuttgart Neckarstadion.
Overall in the snow stones and stories, Cannstatter Travertin from the Stuttgart Police Bureau, red granite from the Dom St. Blasia, Tuff from Heilbronner Hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks about how the rocks used to be handcuffed and moved with simple bottles and ox cars, he becomes quite awesome.
"It would be a scandal to scatter something like that."
He hasn't become rich, not rich at all.
But 14 people are employed by the rock dealer today, and a sculptor, a smith, a glass bladder and a garden builder have settled themselves upstairs in the forest.
"We work hard, but it's satisfying," says the rest of us.
He'll have to go to Cologne soon.
There are also stones to save.
High-Potential talent struggle
There's a lot of trouble at the buffet.
16 students are pushing for salmon bread, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the Volkswagen have invited the engineering and design students to a workshop.
In some kind of idea competition, they are supposed to get to know VW developers about the car of the future - and at the same time Volkswagen.
In the competition around the smartest heads, many companies now go to the close fight and put, like VW, on co-operation with universities.
Your mission: recruiting the most talented graduates in the hearing rooms as soon as possible before they get to the labour market and are converted by others.
And since the universities do not give up any records of the achievements of their students, they try to delay and bind the exceptions in practical projects.
On the second day of the workshop at the TU Braunschweig, the car companies are throwing the talents.
A young lady from the staff department distributes ball writers, rubber bears and folders with VW logo.
She tells the hopeful young talents of internship programs and student jobs and shows them ways into the group.
Nico Selle of the TU Braunschweig supervises the project with VW.
He sees the benefits for both sides: "Students come into contact with industry and gather experience."
"VW can at the same time get to know students, look closer to interesting candidates and think about who would be in question as an employee."
Such cooperation, according to Selle, is not unusual.
New to be so offensive about the students.
"Otherwise, the focus was rather on the technical project," says Selle.
The struggle for the newly graduated will probably get even harder.
In many sectors, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large number of applicants.
However, they must be priced, and in particular they need highly skilled workers.
Particularly graduates from the engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the Association of German Engineers VDI, more than 40,000 engineers remained unoccupied in October.
And the so-called engineering gap will increase even more according to VDI forecasts.
For the audit and consultancy company KPMG, Roman Dykta is going to the talent hunt.
He organises extensive recruitment events such as the KPMG-Race, a kind of modern cutting hunt where participants need to find their way through GPS coordinates.
Eight promising students would like to send the company through the US next year.
In addition, participants can look at KPMG branches and get to know the company.
If you are allowed to join, you will decide in two selection rounds in advance.
Only the Crème de la Crème of the many candidates flies to the United States.
During the skin and stepping around the high potential at the universities, the guns are increasing according to dykta.
"We want to get out of the mass with the race."
"Only a simple sailing tower was too little for us."
For talent hunters dykta, the bill seems to go up.
"We have been in contact with all participants of a similar action last year."
"Some are just before their graduation and want to apply to us soon," he says.
In addition to the direct buelling at the campus, small and medium-sized enterprises also go to the Pirsch in a classic way at professional fairs.
"We are trying to reach graduates at specialized standards."
"About at the Intersolar," Sitha Stübe, personalised director of solar technology manufacturer Solarworld reports.
The Bonner company employs about 1500 employees in Germany.
Stoves know about the problem of young people.
At present, 35 posts are written out on the company's website.
"It's very difficult to occupy vacant positions right now."
"It takes a lot of time and money," she says.
Another way is to contact the university professors.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
"The professors provide evidence that we can do internships or write their diplomas."
Curious promotions are not announced by the solar specialist.
For this, the company tries to advertise for itself with other advantages: personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies and easy communication.
"A large group can often not offer this," says Personnel leader Stube.
Money doesn't play the main role in job search anymore.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good ascending opportunities are also crucial factors.
Solarworld played the 55th place among the 100 best employers in Germany in a study of the Great Place to Work Institute.
The Institute shall draw up an annual best list of German employers.
To this end, it asks staff how satisfied they are with their work and their work environment and looks at the framework conditions for employees.
Personnel leader Dübe hopes that the placement will also add points to the job seekers.
"I think that applicants are looking especially for external assessments of a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies who want to build a good reputation as employers with a long-term strategy.
He advises his customers to increase authenticity.
And that means, according to warriors, in particular internal measures.
"The best way to make themselves attractive as an employer leads over its own employees," he says.
In the industry jargon, the internal employer Branding is called employer brand formation within its own staff.
"satisfied employees are the best ambassadors."
If you treat your people well and identify them with the company, they would advertise for your employer with friends and acquaintances all by themselves.
"This is like a game with bands," says Krieger.
Obama stops new oil drilling
There will be no new oil drilling in the coming years off the coast of the U.S. state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico.
The Washington government has adopted a prohibition of this kind and thus finally revokes its previous plans.
New drilling is forbidden before the Atlantic coast.
This was announced by Interior Minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
The explosion of the drilling platform "Deepwater Horizon" in April is triggering the strict ban to be applied for at least the next five years.
Before the accident that killed eleven workers and led to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama had signalled his willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico on pressure from the opposition and industry.
The supporters want to reduce the US's dependence on oil supplies from abroad.
Those who bear responsibility for the devastating oil plague in the Gulf have not yet been finally clarified.
The British energy group BP is at the heart of criticism, which is faced with billions of demands.
An investigation commission on behalf of Obama is to present its results during December.
In October, Interior Minister Ken Salazar revoked the drill stop hanged after the explosion.
Several oil companies had applied for new drilling projects at the same time.
With tighter controls and stricter security rules, Obama and Salazar want to exclude a new disaster.
At present, the competent control authority, which had been subject to numerous claims of corruption, is being fundamentally reformed.
At the same time, Obama announced that he would close lucrative control gaps for the oil and gas companies.
The industry is now public warning that the amount of aid in the Gulf would be significantly lower by stricter regulation than before.
"The government's plans are the biggest brake for the growth of the oil and gas industry," is the result of a current industry survey by the consultant company BDO - still before the drilling ban of Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance also complains of the uncertainty in the industry: "No one knows exactly what will change with regulation."
Investments in new support projects would be postponed until further notice - at the expense of growth.
Ogoniland is burned
The water in the rivers is oil brown, it smells like at the gas station: billions of litres of crude oil have destroyed nature in the Nigerian Ogoniland.
People live from theft, corruption and illegal oil cooking.
Celestine Akpobari thinks it's good.
"Don't bother," the eco-activist calms the journalists: "You will still get enough oil sludge in front of the lens today."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has pursued the attempt to illuminate a boy who watches up to the chest in the water with his surrounding slings: In the rainbow-coloured water shine the scene seems almost pretty.
That under the surface of brown crude oil wadding is not to be seen.
She used to gather shrimp here, telling Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the trawling waters have been completely dead.
Five years ago, a bronze stone pipeline emitted the amount of crude oil into the huge moisture area.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo now have to roar six hours to get into fishing-keeping waters: the Ogoniland located in the heart of the Nigerdelta is considered to be one of the worst devastated regions in the world.
On the journey through the mangrove swamps passed by river runs, the whole extent of the engravation becomes evident.
Instead of light water, the motorboat wells up brown brown, who dives his hand into the water, pulling oily fingers out.
The roots of the mangrove bushes stretch like black lactose rods from the ground, sadly unites the palm palms that come together hang their weave.
Birds' warms, as usual in wetlands, are searched for forgiveness: as soon as the external border is silent, the splendid tranquillity spreads in the ancient paradise that smells like a gas station.
"What happens here is ecological warfare," says Celestine Akpobari dark: "We live in constant danger to health."
The war conciliation is appropriate.
The settlement area of the Ogoni is a battlefield that has been fought for decades: here more than 60 years ago, the first explorers from Europe, here in the 1980s, organized with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa the first resistance, here the Shell Group had to cease its production in 1993 because it became too dangerous for its oil worker.
Still today the company is refused to return to Ogoniland: while from the entire Deltareon of the three-fold size of Switzerland with more than 5000 drilling sources and 7000 kilometres pipelines are pumped daily more than two million barrels of black gold, the oil fields in Ogoniland are broken, too unstable is the situation of the group.
All a few hundred meters of steel sculptures like bizarre sculptures from the water: "Christbaumchen" the heads of the drilling holes are called far too tender.
They are up to 50 years old, most corroded to the mark.
Always break such a drill head apart, says Akpobari, then run a constant stream of crude oil into the water.
More than two billion litres have fled into the Delta ecosystem in 50 years, according to expert estimates: year by year, the amount of oil, as they pushed into the sea 21 years ago at the Havarie of the Supertanker "Exxon Valdez" before Alaska - one of the biggest environmental disasters in the history of humanity.
Those who are responsible for the persistent eco-GAU are being argued about this.
While Shell Group Sabotage and organised oil theft account for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmental protectors see borehouses and leaky pipelines as the main source of pollution.
In Nigeria, Shell set much lower safety standards than usual in the world, the US scientist Richard Steiner presented to the group in 2008: "The rate of defects on the lines alone is" by a number of times higher than elsewhere. "
In a place that looks from the distance like an abandoned, oil-milled workshop under free sky, appear from the mangroves: they are fragmented and to the neck of oil mill.
Under one of the many barrels that are partly connected with tubes, partly arbitrarily scattered on the site, a fire flashes: an illegal small refinery.
In the barrel the crude oil is heated over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, the head of the group.
First, gasoline penetrates through the pipes into the pipe, later truffles at the end of the line of kerosene and finally diesel.
So Michael and four employees produce up to four bottles of diesel of 300 litres daily: "That brings us 34,000 Naira" - about 22 dollars.
The participants use the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil state of Schwarzafrikas.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The illicit cookers can still underbid the low price of diesel with almost 40 euros per litre, because they get their raw material for free.
It comes from "bunkers," which cross the pipeline network through Ogoniland: this way, according to experts throughout the Nigerdelta, the country loses at least 16 million litres of crude oil daily.
However, only a disappearing small part of the provisional intermediate raw material is illegally processed: filling the lion's share of organised criminal networks, including politicians and senior military, in tankers and exacerbating it on the world market.
The debate, whether the environmental disaster is more due to the reversions of the population or the lax production method, considers Akpobari activist to be purely academic.
"If oil companies were not perceived as intruders and had they not destroyed the fishermen's livelihood so thoroughly, there would be neither sabotage nor theft or illegal refineries."
In the meantime, however, the relationship between the Ogoni and Shell was destroyed in such a way that only one deduction of the group would be in question: "Perhaps other nationalities such as the Chinese are more than better."
Michael gets nervous.
"Highest time for you to disappear," says the muscular oil man.
"Every minute the soldiers can come."
If the illicit oil editors are caught by the Special Unit of the Armed Forces, they are not threatened with arrest, but a painful lubrication.
The soldiers who are mainly from the country name also want to benefit from the raw material - as all Nigerians do.
"This damn stuff has brought our country to the dog in every respect," says Akpobari.
Investigators Discover Dangerous Bootholders in A380 Engines
The A380 seems to have a major security problem.
Investigators have discovered in the investigation of an emergency machine a possible bouncer that could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure."
The Qantas airline is now about to sue the engine manufacturer.
The passengers of the emergency Qantas Airbus at the beginning of November seemed to have known much more luck than so far: the Australian Air Safety Authority has identified a major safety problem in the engines of some A380 machines in its investigations - and now warns against a possible bootholder.
The potential defect would have serious consequences: in the case of an oil sludge compound it could produce fatigue rises and leaks, it was called in an opinion of the ATSB Authority published on this Thursday.
This could have led to "a catastrophic engine failure."
The engines produced by Rolls-Royce in 20 A380 series aircraft were affected.
Below is the Qantas Airbus, which had to land emergency in Singapore on November 4.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
It filed an appeal before an Australian federal court in Sydney to enable him to take further legal action against the company.
Qantas Chief Alan Joyce said his airline would demand compensation for the incident at the beginning of November.
At the fire of the engine, parts had dissolved and damaged the trailers.
Rolls-Royce made an oil fire cause the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines must now be replaced worldwide.
The Australian investigators announced that they would carry out further safety tests at the superjumbos equipped with the engines concerned.
The safety recommendation was the result of cooperation with Rolls-Royce, said ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan.
The safety problem had been considered sufficiently important to inform all concerned.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas machine, the airline had kept its A380 fleet on the ground for weeks.
Singapore Airlines left about three of his eleven A380 temporarily on the ground.
Lufthansa replaced the engine as a precautionary measure in an A380.
The double-stepped airplane is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
National snowfall triggers traffic chaos
Germany in white: Overnight snow has fallen almost all over the country.
On many roads, chaos, trains and flights fall out.
At least three people died in car accidents.
The winter frosts Germany: At eisive temperatures almost the whole Republic is snowed in the night to Thursday - which leads to traffic chaos in many places.
In the north and east there are 15 centimeters of thick snow.
On several motorways and many roads traffic is heavily restricted.
On the A7 at Flensburg the winter service was in permanent operation, but was not finished with the constantly new snow.
In addition, heavy beans fought over the Baltic Sea coast.
The Bundesamt für Schifffahrt und Hydrographie (BSH) is expected at the Ostseekküste Schleswig-Holsteins in the morning at storms with water levels of 1.2 meters above the normal level.
In Saxony, snowstores on motorways and federal roads caused considerable problems.
According to the weather center Meteomedia in Saxony Switzerland, therefore, alert level violet was announced - the highest level at all.
In part, there fell 30 centimeters of new snow, fresh and strong winds caused wounds.
There were several trucks and cars at night.
Also in Saxony-Anhalt, the police reported major disturbances on the streets.
On the A2 snow and wind led to increased traffic and congestion.
In Thuringia, the A4 and A9 were affected by the snow falls.
According to the German Railway, there are significant disturbances in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and the north of Bavaria.
The main problems are snow on the tracks, crashed trees on the tracks or destroyed top lines and distances.
In Saxony the distance from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped.
In the Thuringian Saalfeld an ICE had to stop his drive to Munich.
The 165 passengers were provided by firemen and rescue officers with wool covers, food and drinks on the train.
Snow winds fought over the streets.
At large German airports the snow winds lead to numerous flight failures.
Some cancellations have already been reported in Munich, according to a speaker from the flight information centre.
According to a Fraport spokesperson, 40 flights have already been cancelled in Frankfurt am Main.
The winter service is in permanent operation.
Although only a few stranded passengers are at the airport, they still have nearly 400 field beds.
There were accidents on many roads on Wednesday night.
In the evening, a truck driver was killed when he collapsed with a train on a railway crossing in Ostholstein.
The local leader was slightly injured.
In the vicinity of Nuremberg there was a similar accident due to snow-covered roads: a truck was also recorded here on a railway crossing because the vehicle stayed on the road.
The driver died.
In the train four passengers were injured - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was therefore blocked until morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after she had crossed with her car near Aschaffenburg on a smooth road.
But the meteorologists have a good news: although the snow will still be loose and powdered, it will trigger it with light beans.
But the wind will shrink.
Only the Baltic Sea is searched by fast and storming winds.
However, it remains very cold - locally up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for their twin towers
The Deutsche Bank wants to separate itself from its trademark: According to a newspaper report, the money house buyers are looking for the two office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
Up to 500 million euros the property could invest.
Just now the Deutsche Bank has made its group seat pretty: the twin storms in the Frankfurter banking district have been modernised and the bankers have now been allowed to return to their old jobs.
But now, the financial corporation seems to want to recover the cost of renovation - and is looking for a buyer for the two high houses, as the "Financial Times Germany" writes in calling for a spokesperson.
The speaker did not mention the reasons for the proposed sale.
"We always check whether it makes more sense to own or sell properties and then rent back," he said.
This means that Germany's largest credit institution returns its headquarters already after a short period of time.
The bank had only taken over the double towers in mid-2007 for 272 million euros from the investors of a home-owned fund and then restored it in an effort.
The energy conversion shrinks the data according to around 200 million euros.
I think a sale would bring a lot of money to the bank.
According to industry experts, the value of the towers of the newspaper, which have now been renamed Greentowers, is estimated at around 500 million euros.
Whether the buildings are sold again to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor, the spokesman said at present remain open.
Thousands of grief for dead buddy
More than 10,000 people have thought in New Zealand of the scattered mountains, who were declared dead after several explosions in a mine.
Still, the bodies could not be kept because the safety situation in the accident shaft is still precarious.
Nearly two weeks ago, there was a massive explosion in the Pike River Mine near Greymouth City.
29 miners aged between 17 and 62 have been wasted under the ground.
A probe had been dropped into the accident shaft but had not discovered any traces of survivors.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and subsequent explosions, no rescue forces could be reduced for safety reasons.
After the second heavy detonation, the authorities and experts had assumed that there would be no chance of survival for the pal.
The bodies could not be preserved so far.
Now family and friends with a remembrance remembered the dead.
Tens of thousands of people had gathered on the New Zealand Southern Island in Greymouth at sunshine.
For two minutes, they were floating.
In honour of the scattered mountain guides, 29 tables were set on which helmets, lamps and the names of the pals were seen.
Pictures and personal objects, including garments and surfing boards, also found their place here.
In front of the country's government buildings, the flags wounded half-mast.
New Zealand had hoped that the mountain guards would "come back from the depths of the earth" to the surface, the New Zealand Prime Minister John Key said to the participants of the memorial celebration.
"But they never came home."
He could not close with the death of his son until he had not seen his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was spoiled in the pit.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the victims, several foreign diplomats attended the memorial ceremony.
In the first explosion on November 19, the British and South African miners had also been wasted.
Rescue workers began to remove a fire inside the coal mining plant on the southern island of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gases have been pushed off, it will begin to cool down the glowing temperatures inside the mine, police president Gary Knowles said to journalists.
Fuck you, warrior!
Does Splatter fit for the art cinema?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn relocates the old genre boundaries with his fighter Epos "Walhalla Rising."
What audience did the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think about when he drew "Walhalla Rising"?
A prisoner of Viking warriors with just one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his torment, and with almost superhuman forces rigidly turns his opponents - sounds ideal for young male spectators looking for bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to use rabic killing methods and rip his enemies out of the living body once he has a bad mood.
On the other hand, Einauge, as he is actually called, says nothing about the whole movie, and the other figures can not be pulled to one or two sentences or a few painful death screams.
Otherwise it is swept and swallowed in the scary beautiful hills of Scotland, which the Viking world offers the scenes of about a thousand years ago.
Ideal more for adult cineasts with interest in existentialism and very quiet cameras.
It's nice if a movie has several target groups, only a shame if they exclude each other.
Regisseur Winding Refn has been regarded as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino since his wild and stylish drug dealer trilogy, but refuses to make his works more humor to the mainstream or a little less brutality accessible to the Arthouse.
Most art cinema friends are expected to be discouraged from the splashing brain mass and the intestines around.
The action fans will die at the latest in a time of boredom when one eye breaks up for freely interpretable reasons with a troop of violent Christian missionaries by ship to Jerusalem and a eternity is stuck in flute and fog before the team apparently arrives in America and continues to remain silent there.
So no wonder that "Walhalla Rising" did not find a cinema lease in Germany and now only appeared on DVD.
This is particularly a pity because of the magnificent images, but also because behind the pretentious to bloody facade a sometimes exciting piece of cinema that deserves some attention.
This film is not about dialogue or a stringent act, it's all the atmosphere, a film-made fever dream.
And there is no way out of this for the spectator.
Refn barely gains him a moment of relaxation and grabs him with his eisive images and the dark Trance-like soundtrack slowly to the throat, but especially with the incredible hatred that strikes him out of the hearts of the figures.
Only a little blonde boy, who is faithful to one eye, saves himself something like innocence, all others are driven by anger.
Most of the one-eyed hero whose motives are never explained, but who eventually becomes enemies and temporary allies to become a warrior of hell, possibly the ambassador of the devil himself.
It means devastating, but perhaps only for the lost.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that one can hate and admire to annoy, excitement and astonishment.
An experience.
Reliable earthquake
The IAEA has new references to a secret nuclear programme in Syria.
However, the country is opposed to taking a position on this - it still allows for controls.
At midnight from 5 to 6 September 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighters attack a mysterious, cuffy-shaped building in Syria.
It is located on the shore of Euphrat; the next major city, 30 kilometres away, is Dair as-Saur.
Her name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) when it comes to the reactor that Syria allegedly built with the help of North Korea in the Quader, hidden in a valley that goes off the electricity.
According to a letter from the CIA of the U.S. Foreign Secret Service from the end of April 2008, the reactor in the vicinity of El Kibar would have been well suited to produce plutonium - from which nuclear weapons could be built.
For other purposes, the technique from the 1950s is hardly sufficient.
The CIA performed a video presentation with unsharp satellite images.
By computer animation, she blinded where the components of the reactor were supposed to have been before the destruction, which was a reduced copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon nuclear centre.
She also presented photos showing the building from nearby or even the interior.
The reactor had stood just before the start of the operation, it was said, but was not yet equipped with burns.
Today, more than three years after the bombardment, is hardly known more than then, yes, the puzzles became rather bigger over time.
The former US President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that the CIA was pretty sure before the attack that Syria built a reactor in el-Kibar, but hardly saw any evidence that there was an active nuclear weapon program in the country.
Some intelligence officers in Europe prefer to be more careful and only speak of a "alleged reactor," even if they think the CIA presentation is "plausible."
They lack hard evidence, as well as the IAEA.
Asked how sure he was to have a reactor in front of him, a high UN diplomat answered only lapidar that the IAEA had "enough material to ask questions."
Although the Syrians quickly moved away from the shooting of the alleged "unused military building," the Syrians planned the site thoroughly.
However, in June 2008, an IAEA team under the former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen was found in el-Kibar traces of uranium produced by humans.
In addition, via a Member State, the IAEA received satellite images of commercial providers from the time immediately after the attack which is expected to be more meaningful than those presented by the CIA.
However, these recordings are not available on the market because the unknown contractor - perhaps Israel - has purchased them exclusively.
The IAEA cannot therefore verify its authenticity independently.
Syria has always insisted on never running a secret nuclear programme or building a reactor.
The uranium came from the Israeli weapons, said Damascus.
However, the IAEA rejected this as unlikely after analysis of the particles.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss it - as well as the satellite images.
It also denies controllers a second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the ruins of the bombed building.
But also Israel is silent.
"We will never comment," recently the Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who was at the time of the attack, confirmed the official position.
Thus, the investigation of the case has been unsuccessful since June 2008 and "evolves increasingly into a serious problem of credibility for the Authority," as a high Western diplomat admits at the IAEA's headquarters in Vienna - finally, a serious violation of the Nuclear Weapons Blocking Treaty is in the area under which the IAEA is guarding.
The IAEA seems to see three other facilities that are supposed to be "functional" in connection with the alleged reactor - and are still in existence.
The inspectors have not so far revealed which installations are involved or what function they have or what makes them appear suspicious.
According to information from the South German newspaper, they are referred to as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah internally at the IAEA, in turn derived from nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these places and made a building complex at Masyaf on satellite images, which is most likely one of the suspicious objects.
It may be located in or directly next to a military base - precisely with this reason, Syria refuses to access the three locations of the IAEA.
In Vienna it is said that the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA is prescribed by the US to delay military facilities.
Because the nuclear detectives had become aware of the facilities through a tip from the U.S. Secret Service.
The IAEA has indications, including satellite photographs, that between the three places and the Quader were transported to and from the Euphrat material.
A high Western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the plants could be "related to fuel production."
However, there are "no indications of sensitive activities," i.e. uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is operated with uranium which is not enriched.
But where the uranium should have come from and where the plutonium for the bomb should be separated later, on these central questions there are at least plausible assumptions.
It is also unclear whether debris that could contain valuable traces were stored in three places.
As if the hundreds of trucks had disappeared from the ground, no one wants information about where the shock stayed.
The salt mine al-Tibni, located just a few kilometres from el-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrat, which Syria has examined in 1998 for its suitability as a camp for radioactive waste, is considered unlikely to be the IAEA.
The former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley had recently contacted her in an analysis of satellite images for the renowned magazine Jane's Intelligence Review with the reactor.
Recording from the orbit, however, shows that Syria carried out earthquakes in the three suspicious places and removed large containers after the IAEA had requested access.
This can be a coincidence, but has hardly helped to eliminate the suspicion.
It is also stated in diplomatic circles that the IAEA has spent several months on developing a plan for inspections there, which should allow Syria to preserve any military secrets - only shows how much interest inspectors have.
However, Damascus also rejected this proposal.
Had Western diplomats in Vienna a year ago complained that the reactor was destroyed, so the matter did not have a high urgency, for example, US Ambassador Glyn Davies has been putting so-called "healthy" inspections into play for a few months, one of the strongest means that the Vienna nuclear authority has to enforce controls.
IAEA Chief Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "an option for which I am open in the future," yet he hesitates.
There is a high risk in this way: firstly, there is a need for a majority in the Governing Council of the IAEA, and some of the 35 countries represented there are nothing but an escalation.
On the other hand, as a diplomat gives: "What if they find nothing at the end?"
Love in times of war
Since Angelina Jolie started working on her still nameless government debut in summer, there's been trouble.
The script itself wrote them, a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man.
A lot more you don't know about it - but that's enough for trouble.
The rumor, the woman, a Muslim, remains persistent during the Yugoslavia war, falling in love with her Serbian rapist.
Bosnian women's associations have protested immediately, and some of the scheduled filming days in Sarajevo have been moved to Hungary in the short term.
In the meantime, the film has been turned off in Hungary and in postal production, but it is still protesting in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic from the organisation of female war victims wrote about the UN refugee aid work UNHCR to Jolie and demanded a meeting with the actress, has now reported a Bosnian newspaper - Jolie is even ambassador of the UN refugee aid work.
She is not diplomatic - she has offered women a meeting in Hungary weeks ago, but they rejected it.
The meeting had to take place in Bosnia, so Hasecic.
There were no love stories in rape camps, and Jolie's attitude to the victims was enough to tell her about the script.
According to your organisation, the United Nations refugee aid agency has recommended that Jolie be released as ambassador, the Guardian reports.
What exactly did Jolie write for scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which was able to read her script, has granted a rotation permit for Sarajevo after some time - it is not quite clear why Jolie did not come.
The young woman himself insists that she does not follow any political intentions with her film, has worked with a great deal of effort into the Yugoslavia conflict, wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give a voice to all the parties involved.
However, the content remains vague.
So a second synopsis of the film on the net, which then sounds quite different: The lovers knew in it already before an outbreak of war and meet again when they, a Bosnian Muslim, are dragged into a Serbian camp where he works as a guardian.
What sounds considerably different than the variant "rape victims are keen in torture."
That Jolies film actually begins before the war - so much is safe.
The pressure on them, according to Jolie, is "unfair and is based on misinformation."
Now, I think you can only give the hackers of Hollywood peace: by putting the script, like so many before, illegally on the grid.
Nothing like getting out of here
This evening it's finally going real round for the Irish.
No sign of deception.
For this, the home team dominates its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA too much.
The fans jolly of joy with strong loud music, they stumble with their feet.
The Bailey pub in the South Cork is buried because the players throw and meet table tennis balls over a three-metre distance in beer cup.
"Bierpong" calls itself the bizarre spectacle, winning there are 500 Euro win prize plus flight tickets to Las Vegas for the Bierpong World Championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy; this shouting drinking game and the restraining computer, that doesn't really fit together.
And yet the 26-year-old is trying to amuse himself to distract himself from the drilling question of what will bring the future.
His plan is not to play fun in Las Vegas, he will conduct application talks in New Zealand in January.
"I have a mold feeling," he says.
"It's so far away from home and yet I have no work there."
After all, his friend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "she had left, suck her wish job as an event manager, perhaps a good sign," says the young man and smiling.
Because of bad prospects at home, two of Tanner's three siblings have already sought their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a job as an IT consultant in London.
The boys go: Like the Tanners it looks on the island in many families.
100,000 Irish will probably leave the country in the near future, according to experts from the ESRI Institute of Economic and Social Research in Dublin.
By 2015 they even expect 200,000 emigrants.
For the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants a heavy loss.
Consideration of the forecasts, there is a wave of emigration similar to that of Ireland in the 1980s.
After a decade of recovery, which brought great prosperity to the Irish, Tristesse is now again spreading.
The economic crisis is particularly anxious for young, well-trained Irish people, for whom it was only a mountain.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd in the tree years.
Everyone was needed, there was money in the floods.
In the meantime, three out of ten women and men are under thirty without work.
In the Irish Times there are a lot of readers of young immigrants who complain: "Everything goes down in Ireland."
"There should be a rebellion against politicians and bankers - but who can, goes away and our country thus loses a whole generation."
"The last one will turn off the light."
Jura-Student Leanne Caulfield, President of the Irish Student Union, sees a darker future, because the government only operates eye wiping and offers young people no future prospects anymore.
"They reduce minimum wages, but they do not have a strategy to create new jobs," says the 20-year-old.
She observes how her associates hang from an unpaid internship to the next.
Her biggest concern, she says, is it to have to emigrate in four years.
"This thought is sad and depressing."
Men like Stephen McLarnon are trying to occupy the subject positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo," a trade fair offering a round service on work abroad.
"For job beginners, work abroad is a great opportunity to take the first steps on the career leadership," says the manager.
His website shows photos of surfers in Australia and snowboards in Canada.
The message is clear: working abroad is not a gallery service, but also brings freedom and fun.
How it feels to build something elsewhere, Seán O'Donovan knows for six months.
Because there was nothing to do for the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland, he is now working with 15 Irish colleagues on the construction in Germany.
In Gelsenkirchen, they're just pulling up a fashion house.
In January it will continue to Hannover or Berlin, to the next project.
His home sees O'Donovan rarely now, because he makes extra layers to pay off the credit for his home home.
"The situation is already a little crazy," he says, after a long time he first walks over the threshold of his house.
"I earn money in Germany for a house in Ireland where I am as good as never again."
He laughs a little shy and goes through cooled rooms.
The small house is located in a fine residential area with decorated gardens, in the entrances parking large, expensive cars.
Together with a sister, O'Donovan bought the house for €380,000 four years ago - 100 percent credit.
"It was crazy times, there was simple money without many questions," he says.
Is he afraid that the loan could go wrong?
O'Donovan thinks about it for a while, pour hot tea and say, "I have no children I have to feed and I am young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start again."
The construction engineer does not like the weeping complaint he often hears at the moment.
"No one needs to starve - our situation is far from as dramatic as in previous times here on the island," he says.
"Working abroad for a while, that's not the worst thing that can happen - maybe it just makes us feel Irish."
He laughs and then talks about his father who went to England in the last major economic crisis.
"After seven years he was back and life continued in Ireland, quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Let the future open and just see how it goes with life somewhere else.
A few years of work in London is already behind him, and why should it not go well for him and his girlfriend in New Zealand?
But one thing is still that worries him in these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He fears it could be a farewell party.
"Not too many emotions," he says and drinks a big drink of his beer.
"Goodbye, that sounds frightening."
"Let's call it an exit party, relaxed, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
The democatric routine
The democratic movement in Latin America is becoming stronger, as is the support of private companies.
Crime is a greater problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, Brazil's influence is greater than that of the United States.
The Latinobarómetro survey, conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively in The Economist, came to this conclusion.
This survey has been carried out regularly since 1995 and shows the change of opinion in this region.
Two facts are particularly evident in the September and October survey this year.
First of all, the good mood in Latin America
Secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its main institutions.
In many countries on the South American Pacific Coast, the democratic movement has increased sharply (see Table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy has grown by around 6% every year since 2002, the number of democrats increased from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
Even in Mexico, where the economy has recovered since the sharp collapse last year, such a trend is to be seen.
But only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the most populous countries in the region, are convinced democrats, which reduce the regional average (see Figure 2).
About 44% of respondents stated that they were satisfied with their country's democratic practice, as many as last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (Figure 3).
About 34% trust the Congress of their country and 45% of their government. Both values correspond to those of last year but show a significant increase compared to 2003 (17% and 24% respectively).
A decade ago, Latin America's economic crisis undermined efforts to increase democracy.
This continued during the World Economic Crisis, perhaps because the countries of Latin America experienced only a short recession phase and quickly recovered.
In addition, the poor were captured by a stronger social network.
(According to reports from the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America this week, the poverty rate in Latin America increased only slightly in 2009 and fell again by 32% this year.)
However, there are strong differences in mood between countries (see Figure 4).
Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of the divorcing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is reflected in a widespread approach to progress.
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more marked and violence has increased, this is less the case.
For the second time since the start of the survey, many respondents in Latin America have seen a greater problem in their country than in unemployment (see Figure 5).
About 31% say that either they themselves or a family member were victims of a crime last year, but compared to 38% last year, the values have fallen and thus reach the lowest level since 1995.
The increasing economic performance reflects greater support for the private and market economy: approximately 71% of respondents reported that the private sector is indispensable for development, 56% in 2007 (see Figure 6).
Approximately 58% stated that only the market economy can make progress in their country, compared with 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela have maintained this view (and 80% are for a private sector), although their left president, Hugo Chávez, has nationalized many private companies.
According to 19% of respondents (18% last year), Brazil has the largest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% last year).
The respondents in Mexico and most of the countries of Central America, however, see the most influential country in the United States, taking over this role in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua of Venezuela.
A ballot
No one expected the elections to be perfect in Haiti on 28 November.
But the facts exceeded the fears of the electoral helpers who hasten to help the land used.
Overcrowded electoral urns, several votes cast, election tickets in the ringstone, destroyed electoral premises and intimidations were only part of the problems.
Electoral offices opened with hours of delay.
Many Haitians, many of whom had become homeless through the earthquake in January, arose around looking for a choice.
Some finally gave up completely.
A dozen presidential candidates, including some suspected top riders, demanded the abolition of the election results due to alleged fraud.
There were partial violent protests throughout the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, head of the UN mission in Haiti, called the election "quite good in many respects."
According to a cautious statement by observers of the Organisation of American States and the Caribbean Community, "these irregularities, as serious as they may be, do not necessarily invalidate the process."
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral authority, which is allegedly committed to the unpopular divorced President René Préval and his candidate, Jude Célestin, will announce the provisional results on 7 December.
The expected selection is scheduled for January.
There's still hope for the election.
The two leading opposition candidates, the Rap musician Michel Martelly and the former First Lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial invalidity complaint.
If Jude Célestin, who has little or no consent among the voters, declares that the electorate is the winner of the election, this could cause problems.
Due to the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million of the earthquake victims are still living in tents, there was fears of low participation.
On the election day, many Haitians were prevented by lack of organization from voting.
Just before the election began, some 250,000 cards needed for election were not yet distributed.
There's a lot at stake.
The donor countries consider a legitimate, recognised government to be an important step in reconstruction of Haiti.
The Haitians themselves are the same opinion.
Heimlich in der Mitte
In the weeks after the sudden death of your husband, the President of Argentina, Cristina Fernández, experienced a wave of sympathy that triggered their popularity by 20 points to over 50%. This is the highest value since their election in 2007.
However, if this helps you to re-elect next year, it depends on whether the apparently saddened Cristina Fernández is more willing to compromise than her deceased husband, her predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
The signs of this are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, who also led economic policy after the election of his wife, often drafted budgets which did not fully take into account tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the presidential couple to spend the extra revenues according to their own good minds.
On the paper, the Fernández government lost the majority in the Congress last year.
But the opposition is divided and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on October 27 led to further fragments.
Some government critics from the ranks of the ruling peronists stood behind Cristina Fernández.
However, after chaotic meetings (where one parliamentarian struck another's face and others appointed the government of bribery), the Congress failed to adopt the 2011 budget.
"I will not discuss this," said the President.
The 2010 budget is now also applicable to next year, which gives the President even more opportunity to spend money according to his own good thinking.
The economy is hot: it is likely to grow by up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is 11.1%, but many private estimates - and wages requirements of the trade unions - drive the value to almost 30%.
Kirchner, who took over the office in 2003 when Argentina was shaken by economic crises, declared growth and poverty reduction to its main objectives and not the reduction of inflation.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, harassed the private sector and cleaned the National Institute for Statistics and Population INDEC, which then beautified official inflation statistics.
Can Fernández now take a more moderate path?
She has called on the private sector and the trade union leaders to talk.
And official statements say that wage increases are to be limited to 18% next year.
The high world market prices for Argentina's agricultural products have given the economy a strong momentum.
However, inflation undermined growth by a large devaluation in 2002.
It is possible that Cristina Fernández would like to reconnect to the rest of the world financially for this reason.
At the beginning of this year, the government entered into an agreement with securities holders who had refused the country's previous redebt in 2001.
Now Fernández seems to push for an agreement with the donors from the Paris Club, which it owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners had always rejected a review by the IMF, as usual elsewhere.
But last month, the Minister of Economic Affairs Amado Boudou announced that the fund will provide "technical support" in the creation of a new national consumer price index. It looks like this is the first step towards cleansing INDEC.
It is not known whether Fernández will be politically active after the end of her term of office without the support of her husband.
If so, it needs the support of the middle layer, which has largely enough of churchnerism.
When the Argentinians return from their summer holidays in March, the wave of sympathy that was brought to her will be defeated.
If she wants to win another choice, she has to decide whether she lifts many political decisions of her husband silently and quietly.
weak applause for China
Taiwanese voters are slowly approaching a closer connection to the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of his big brother beyond the seaweed?
On 27 November, more than 7.5 million voters, which are 70% of all voters, took part in choosing mayors and city councils in the five districts. This is considered to be a broad assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou.
By building ground-breaking business relationships, including a partial free trade agreement, Ma itself is a symbol for relations with the mainland. His policy has changed relations with the Chinese native country for the first time since 1949 permanently.
Ma passed the test, but only short.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) represents three of the five mayors, she received no majority.
Instead, the Democratic Progress Party (DPP), which advocates a greater independence of Taiwan, received almost 50% of the votes received by KMT 45%.
In a presidential election, this would have meant problems for Ma.
Since his election two years ago, his party's voting share has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP even moved into the city councils together with the KMT.
During the election there were the usual events in Taiwan, such as trucks convoy with crawlers, flags-swinging mass shifts and only sparsely dressed dancers.
There was even the mandatory, mysterious murder attempt.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan and honorary chairman of KMT held a speech on a KMT candidate on the eve of the election,
When a man shot into his face from the crowd, Lien was wounded and a surrounding spectator was killed.
Bizarre is not clear whether the shooter wanted to kill Lien or settle a fight with the candidate.
Regardless of this, Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, has affected the election and put the DPP into a bad light, which the KMT has given more voices.
Perhaps China was the biggest winner of the campaign.
It is noteworthy that relations with the mainland have not been discussed.
Instead, the candidates discussed plans for social housing and job creation.
The Taiwanese love their actual independence and reject China's military threat.
For this reason, KMT does not like to put its relations with the government in Beijing at the forefront.
But this time, the DPP avoided too much the anti-Chinese feelings.
It responded to the new consciousness that Taiwanese economy cannot survive without China.
On the one hand, it would like to be confirmed that the majority of Taiwanese are in favour of its China policy.
The Government of Beijing will continue to pursue its strategy to withdraw Taiwan from the Community with economic incentives.
China immediately sent a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment security and medical cooperation.
It certainly wants political integration, but the most important thing is first.
It would rather wait until after the 2012 presidential elections.
The DPP has now reinvented itself.
She was heavily weakened two years ago: former party leader Chen Shui-bian was in prison for corruption.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he strongly advocated absolute independence.
But under Tai's reign a new generation of moderate politicians developed and the DPP struggles for the voices of the professionals and the youth.
As a presidential candidate of the DPP, Tsai received great consent, such as Su Tseng-chang under Chen.
Your party is now doing everything it can to show that it is also able to establish close relations with Beijing.
Tsai is planning an idea muddle as a contact point between the DPP and China. However, this presupposes preferential discussions.
Tsai publicly stated that her party offered a "trustworthy alternative" to Mas faster approach to China.
Chen seems very upset about this change.
From his cell, he stated that the DPP's candidates would have done better to maintain Taiwan's independence.
He even called on the pragmatic Su to refrain from presidential candidature.
Even without Chen's interference, the DPP makes it difficult to choose its possible candidates.
The KMT will have to undergo its own self-analysis.
Mas values are bad, despite rapid economic growth; the KMT candidates wanted to run their campaign without him.
The main reasons for his inpopularity seem to be unemployment and the increasing scissors between the arm and the kingdom.
According to a KMT speaker, he will reshape his cabinet as well as the local facilities.
The strong appearance of the DPP suggests that Taiwan is only in limited favour of re-alignment.
At the same time, most Taiwanese consider economic cooperation with China inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "there is no return yet."
Grammy nominations: The Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding was honored surprisingly in the category Newcomer of the year
If you act on the request of a president, people will notice.
President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding to attend the ceremony on the occasion of the 2009 Nobel Prize ceremony. Now the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer has been nominated surprisingly for this year's Grammy in the category Newcomer of the year.
Given the fact that Spalding has already been a celebrated star since her album "Esperanza" 2008 in the jazz scene, the nomination seems a little unusual. However, it complies with the grammy rules according to which an artist may have released up to three albums prior to the publication of the album with which he became known in the general public.
Her ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society," is certainly a step forward. And with her compelled voice and a good sense for pop, radio and Latin music, you can compare Spalding quietly with Norah Jones 2003, whose great success in 2003 as a jazz interpreter comes closest in this category of nomination Spaldings.
In addition, the album "Historicity" of the Vijay Iyer Trios was nominated in the category Instrumental albums. This favorite of the critics experienced a huge success.
Among the competitors Iyers include "Moody 4B" of the experienced Saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" of the keyboard John Beasley.
Trombone Shorty, a robbery favorite from New Orleans and frequent guest in HBOs "Treme," was awarded in the category contemporary jazz, where otherwise more albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber can be found.
The Secret Societ of the Wild Steampunk musician Darcy James Argue received well-deserved attention in the category of large group. He thus defends the Billy Childs Emsemble with his chamber-jazz and the adventurous Dave Holland and his octet, whose Life-Ablum "Pathways" is a good example of a bassist as a democratic band leader.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead into classic categories
The classic nominations for the 53rd Grammy Award contain a colorful mix of musicians and composers from all over the world.
The list is given by Michael Daughertys "Deux Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra with five voices, and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse," an eclectic orchestra, with three voices.
Among the nominees with connections to South California, the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt is with his symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles." This piece was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonics and launched in 2009 in the Walt Disney Concert Hall.
The composer Avner Dorman, based in L.A., was also nominated for his Mandoline concert.
Classic nominations are divided into 13 categories, from orchestra, opera, choir to solo recordings.
Five artists were nominated in the category of classic producers this year - Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Among the nominated classic albums are Bruckner's Symphonies No. 3 and 4 from the Royal Concertbuilding Orchestra; Daughertys "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" played by Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey's "Dreamhouse" by the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati "presented by various artists; and Verdi's" Requiem "by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chor.
In the category of opera, Bergs "Lulu of the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House" Adolf Hasses "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariahos "L'Amour de Loin" by the German Symphony Orchestra Berlin; Rodion Shchedrins "The Enchanted Wanderer" by the Orchestra and Chor of the Mariinsky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivans "Ivanhoe" by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
As composers, Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina," Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus," Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer" were nominated for a Grammy.
Pärts Symphony No. 4 was uploaded and recorded on January 4 in the Disney Hall by the L.A. Philharmonics under the direction of Esa-Pekka Salons.
The 30-minute piece has the title "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnate Mikhail Chodorkowski, who is in prison in Russia.
Dorman's "Mondoline concert" received a nomination in the category Instrumental solo with orchestra.
The composer from L.A. said he wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for the Mandoline artist Avi Avital who performed the concert with the New York Metropolis Ensemble.
"I used sounds from the Middle East and numerous North African sounds and rhythms," said Dorman in a phone interview.
The director Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the category Orchestra performance for a recording of Strawinskis works with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under his leadership.
As instrumental soloists, the pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin, the organist Paul Jacobs, the violin Julia Fischer and the Harfinist Sarah Schuster Ericsson were nominated.
This year only women were nominated as vocal soloists, including Anne Sofie von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the category Classic Crossover, the soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song."
Mosque in Temecula wins approval of the Planning Committee
The construction of a mosque in Temecula took place after a five-hour public hearing, often heated, the unanimous commitment of the local planning committee.
Critics accused the project of promoting both terrorism and traffic congestion.
However, according to a statement from the Commission on Wednesday evening, the new religious centre is in line with local regulations and will become an aesthetic glance.
"The project is supported by many good people - Christians, Jews, Bahais, and many others," said Hadi Nael, Chairman of the Islamic Centre of Temecula Valley on Thursday morning.
"As an American, it makes me proud."
"It shows the rule of justice."
"There are only a few opponents," he added.
"They're just very loud."
"In this valley, beautiful people live."
The meeting began at 18: 00 and the discussions for and against the construction of the centre took almost until midnight, with the votes on both sides fairly evenly distributed according to Press-Enterprise.
The debate was continued on the newspaper website.
"There is no America anymore," said a comment.
"It's another planet of monkeys, and the statue of freedom is dead in the sand."
"America is at the end."
Planned Islamic centers have also led to protests in other parts of the country, e.g. near Ground Zero, the scene of the terrorist attacks on the City of New York on September 11, 2001.
In Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush called for violence.
His community with about 135 families has lived peacefully in Riverside County for years. But they wanted a larger and better place than the camp they rented together with a manufacturer for water filters.
The new, about 2,300 m2 large Mediterranean mosque should have two minarets and be about 13m high.
It is to be created on the approximately 17.500 m2 large land on Nicolas Road near the Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still object to the project at the City Council.
Arsenic-resistant microbes could allow new life forms on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a foreign species of bacteria that can live from arsenic, among other things, creates new opportunities for new forms of life on Earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists discovered this unusual bacterium here on Earth, it is a sign to them that life is possible even without the elements considered necessary to date.
"This organism has two possibilities."
"He needs either phosphorus or arsenic to grow."
"This makes it something very special, although it is almost a kind of 'alien' life form," Paul C.W. Davies from Arizona State University and co-author of the report, which appears on Thursday in the online edition of the magazine Science.
So far, six main elements have been considered vital - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
However, as scientists found out, the bacterium grows in the California Mono Lake even if it replaces phosphorus by arsenic.
"What else is possible," said the co-author of the Ariel D. Anbar report from Arizona State University.
Discovery is an important step in the search for alien life, as scientists need to recognize life and its forms, so Anbar.
The study deals with microbes found on Earth.
The announcement of a press conference, in which no details on discovery were announced, gave rise to too widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could act from the discovery of foreign life.
This is not the case.
The discovery "shows that in other planetary systems organisms can start with the help of other elements of biochemical processes and that the 'standard elements', which we believe are absolutely vital, are not necessarily determined," said Charles Cockell, Professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute of the Open University of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom.
Cockel wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is a novel, because it shows that in basic biochemical processes and structures one element can be replaced by another," added Cockell.
This discovery wasn't a coincidence.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the Astrobiological Institute of the NASA, which led the study, chose Mono Lake because of the high arsenic content.
Since arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar, she assumed that microbes that are both exposed may be able to replace one element by another.
"The toxicity of the arsenic is mainly due to its chemical behaviour as phosphorus."
"This makes it difficult for organisms to distinguish one element from another."
"But the difference is so large that arsenic works differently than phosphorus. It comes into our biochemical system, where it sort of moulds everything," explains Anbar.
The researchers put off the GFAJ-1 bacterium of an increasing arsenic concentration. It adapted and grew.
Although the microbe grows better in phosphorus, it can also survive in arsenic, it shows that an arsenic-based lifestyle can naturally occur, either on Earth or on another planet or moon, on which arsenic occurs more frequently.
According to Jamie S. Foster, a professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic is not new. But so far there has been no working example.
Arsenic occurred more often in early earthquakes, she says, therefore science assumed that early life forms used it.
"This is why life may have developed differently than in the early Earth Age," said Forster, who was not a member of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was supported by the NASA, the Energy Ministry and the National Health Authorities.
Other stolen exhibition dogs found in Compton
The remaining two of the four exhibitions that were stolen in front of a Bellflower motel were found on Thursday according to Los Angeles County Sheriff's statement.
The four exhibition dogs - two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis - disappeared on Tuesday, when unknown stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express van in which the animals were housed in front of a Bellflower Motel 6 at night, according to government statements.
Two of the dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon, and the last two on Wednesday evening, explains Steve Whitmore, a speaker of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is, the dogs are well," said Whitmore.
"They're in good condition."
"They were returned to their lawful owners."
Whitmore did not provide precise information on the location of the dogs yet on the circumstances that led to their discovery.
"The investigation is still running."
"We don't want to say any more about this," explains Whitmore.
"We're tracking some traces."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not available on Thursday for information.
They received their two dogs on Wednesday afternoon in a district theatre in Downey.
Representatives of the sheriff found the truck and the two dogs in different places in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old female, and Didi, a 10-month-old dog - were unharmed according to government statement.
But the Corgis Bunny and Peter who wanted to present Rickard and Peek this week on behalf of their Japanese owners on the competition remained missing until Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in the city this weekend because of the AKC / Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach because Trace was supposed to take part in the competition.
As Peek told the Times on Wednesday, the other dogs should take part in other competitions in the days before the AKC / Eukanuba show.
South California is a stop on the almost one-month tour of the couple from dog watch to dog watch.
On Monday evening Peek and Rickard checked in at the motel.
They often stay in motels and park their truck in front of their room window.
They took three more dogs - one boxer puppy, one Parson Russell Terrier and one Brittany - with in their motel room.
The thick Akitas and Corgis stayed in the truck because it was cooler there.
They left the window wide open, so the dogs had fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported their car stolen on Tuesday at 6: 00.
Peek promised anyone who could give a clue to the Corgis a finding salary. The animals were implanted microchips for identification.
On Thursday, it was not yet established whether a finder's salary is paid.
The lion shouts again after the judicial approval of the MGM restructuring
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got green light for a new start.
On Thursday, a New York bankruptcy judge officially blessed the "prepare" credit plan to eliminate the debt of $5 billion and to pave the way for new movies and television shows to the 86-year entertainment company.
According to Thursday's statements, the plan meets the requirements of US bankruptcy law, so that the restart of MGM under the leadership of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, is no longer in place. Barber and Birnbaum will be the head of the somewhat secured studio as the head of the main business.
The number of employees is reduced from more than 400 to about 320.
For MGM, Chapter 11 does not actually enter into force until JPMorgan Chase has completed a planned loan of $500 million to finance the new MGM productions.
At the moment, a consortium of the Investment Bank, which is itself investing $75 million, is running the company. The financing will be held until mid-December.
The restructuring of the studio began in May 2009 with the assignment to the Investmentbank Moelis & Co, the management that fought with interest payments of $300 million / year, to help solve their financial problems.
In August, Managing Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO at Enron and restructuring experts known by his activities at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis & Cooper's efforts to solve the financial concerns of MGMs and pay out more than 140 creditors of the studio took longer than expected.
After months of discussion, the parties decided to offer the company for purchase at the end of 2009.
But the auction attracted only a few tenderers and no one wanted to pay the $2 billion required by the creditors.
In the spring of this year, everything began from the beginning of the MGM team with the restructuring plan, which was finally signed by creditors after monthly debates and internal disputes at the end of October.
If MGM has officially passed bankruptcy in the next few weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive a bonus of several million dollars for their work.
The share for Moelis & Co, who have already received $1.2 million, amounts to $9.5 million
Cooper, paid for the management of the company monthly $375,000, receives a "success bonus" of $4 million
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM. This year, the studio produced only one film and created an annual plan of seven or eight films to come to the movies at the beginning of 2012.
They also plan two movies after "The Little Hobbit" in co-production with Warner Bro.
The studio needs a separate loan between $265 million and $275 million for its financial share in these two films, which are to be created under the direction of Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, who financed around 18% of the MGM loan, tried to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, whose largest shareholder he is.
However, the last negotiations between the two companies did not lead to a result.
Tech Toys keeps your gift budget in balance
This year's favorite among the gifts is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect video console. Both players can tear a significant hole in your gift budget.
An iPad costs as much as five BMX wheels for $99, while the price for a Kinect game corresponds to about 10 classic jump ropes or about 48 doses of Play-Doh.
But you can save your gift budget.
I recently visited three electronic toys under $80 three national toys dealers - a whale mart, a toys "R" Us and a BJ's wholesale club.
I immediately realized that Moore's law had entered into force. This year the technology games are more powerful and at the same time cost a little less than last year.
And although fewer new toys appear with their own website, you can find on the most famous of this kind, webkinz and Club Penguin, a wider offer.
There are more and more button cell-operated toys on the market, and many contain rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(If not otherwise stated, all prices of toys are "R" Us.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for children from 3 years old) are plug figures, as big as sea pigs singing a note when pushing on their belly.
One push corresponds to a note, by multiple push you can play a song.
Several singing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony.
Attention: Once you start pressing, you can't stop anymore.
For a combination of sand and dance, the Dance Star Mickey (Fisher Price $60, for children from 2 years) is the best choice.
Based on the Elmo Live technology developed last year, the animatronic doll offers interplay games as' Simon says', and thanks to the new scarring feet with wheel blocking, it dominates the Moon Walk.
Children who tested the device use Mickey as a dance teacher. However, their parents complained about the lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, remember Alphie, one of the first computerized learning tools.
Now he's back (Hasbro / Playschool, $40, for children from 3 years old), with a whole bunch of questionnaires with which a drive can become a lesson, with a best wiser with autocorrection function as a teacher.
If you don't want to trust your child your smartphone, there are three independent alternatives here.
MobiGo of VTech ($60 for children from 3 to 8) is the cheapest and user-friendly solution, equipped with a qwerty keyboard. However, the games contained on it are not as instructive as those on the Leapster Explorer ($70, for children from 3 to 12), which after Leapfrog's first major revision of the Leapster series is equipped with a new, lighter screen.
None of the versions are compatible with older cassettes.
iXL from Fisher Price ($90 for children from 3 to 7) uses a system similar to iTunes for games and eBooks, and thanks to the SD card running work, family photos can also be viewed on it.
Finally, there is still Scrabble Flash ($30 from Hasbro, for children from 8 years). The five blocks are not larger than a string wooden box and have its own LED screen.
The game is about assembling the blocks to words before the time runs out. It is great for an improvised literary competition.
More and more toys have some kind of online connection.
If you go to the toy shops alone after the offer, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important.
To give your child an online animal at Club Penguin, for example, you can buy a Disney Club Penguin 2 "Mix'N Match Figures Package ($5 for children from 6 to 12) that contains a coin with a secret code.
If you enter the code online, your child will receive enough credits for two more parts at Club Penguin Store.
These can be wheelshoes or a puffle material animal.
The latest head cell-operated microphrobot, Hexbug Nano ($10 for children from 5) is not larger than the head of your toothbrush.
The beetle quickly moves to 12 vibrating silicone legs in any direction.
It's fun to send him through a madman from clusters.
And he's holding up a lot.
We fell from the kitchen table and even survived some time in the mouth of our dog.
Police operations in China are getting slower
As a training officer, Tang Shenbin stepped over a city square, verified his nervous subordinates and gave orders with military authority and constrained voice.
He wanted his female members of the Chengguan - China's robust guards of urban order, feared and despised for their arbitrary razor and their hanging to violence - to impress the spectators.
"Just stand!"
"Look straight!"
"Show them," he whispered to them, "how beautiful girls are!"
Four girls, barely escaped from the age of teenage, with white gloves and identical oil beans jackets and pants stood tight.
Four pairs of black pumps were in straight row.
Four proper hats sat perfectly on the hair with blue-white striped grinding.
"For me they look average," Mr Tang notices low value.
"Models are pretty."
Several governments have already tried to polish the image of China's city inspectors.
In a city, all new candidates must have a university degree.
The province of Guangdong introduced a bright blue uniform instead of the grey green.
Wuhan in Central China replaced violence by low-staring: In 2009, 50 officials reported a non-properly set-up cart and stared on the operator until it packaged in after half an hour and left the place.
Xindu, a district in Chengdu with 680,000 inhabitants, wants to change the image fundamentally.
Since 2003, 13 women have strengthened the city police stripes. They have been selected specifically because of their appearance, their good character and their youth.
They're supposed to give the cruel police a more soft, feminine aspect.
Unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson would not be able to improve the bad image that the Chinese have of these city commands.
Right, that's what the critics say.
Unlike the police, these officials are allowed to enforce urban laws only by means of fines or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media routinely show a different picture.
In January 2008, officials in the province of Hubei investigated an audience to death when he filmed them with his cell phone, how they defeated a protest against a trash.
Last year, a training manual from the Pekinger officials was stolen and published on the Internet, describing how criminals can be beaten without bloodshed.
This year, a Shanghai water melon dealer suffered brain injuries after a hand mix with five officials.
An anti-violence video game that can be downloaded from the Internet shows trained officials in China in an attack on road dealers.
"Chengguan frightens the government," the national newspaper lamented China Daily last year, following further controversy on tactics.
The newspaper demanded a "really thorough cleansing."
Skeptics find the current approach clearly inadequate.
When the Distrik was looking for eight female recruits in October, a editorial in the Beijing Evening News asked whether the women should have real tasks or only serve as an optical distraction.
Probably both.
According to the job display, women aged 18 to 22 were sought with good figure and "harmonious facial trains."
They should be above average size - over 1.5 m or 5 feet, 2 1 / 2 inches.
The employment relationship ends with the achievement of the 26th year of life.
According to the officials, the activity of women over 25 is physically too exhausting.
"The most important is their image," an unnamed district officer posted at the virtually government website Rednet.com.
"Whether the candidates get the job depends first on their external appearance, such as size, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes temperament and "inner qualities."
"Female Chengguan are like flower vases," he said and added, "but they have other duties."
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Head of the District Municipality, does not wish to endorse this description,
But admitted that in China size figures in job ads for both types of sex are not unusual.
The same applies to uniform faces.
Whether this is to be equated with good looks is controversial in China.
But people with disabilities or physical attitudes do not need to apply.
"We cannot use lambs or buckles here," said Mr Zheng.
"Your image would not be good."
Liu Yi, patrolling on the Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22, has an apple basin and a well shaped mouth.
She didn't feel sexist to put so much value on her appearance.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" asks her with an ironic look.
Your colleague with the dimples, the 21-year-old Xu Yang, commented, "We have the task of representing the image of the city."
According to their information, they do not regret the short attitude, as they have more ambitious career plans than simply squeeze traders through the streets to prevent them from doing business.
Every morning the stripes deal with about twelve road dealers who try to sell as many bread and tofu dishes as possible on foot or on the bike before they are hunted away.
"Mr. Wang, please get out of here."
"We have told you so many times!" explains Frl. Xu to a trader who fled on foot and had temporarily abandoned his noodle kitchen on a bicycle cart.
According to the officials, the activity is more monotonous than difficult.
"It is almost the same every day," explains Huang Jing, 20, who studies sales services in leisure time.
"All routine."
One reason for this is that female officials are not allowed to confiscate the goods of dealers, like their male colleagues.
They can only threaten criminals to report them to their male superiors.
This is intended to protect them from public insinuations that are often exposed to officials in China.
This year, hundreds of inhabitants of Kunming, the capital of the province of Yunnan, after the rumor cursed, Chengguan officials had killed a dealer.
More than a dozen police officers and Chenguan officials were injured during the night incident, 14 government vehicles were thrown over or fired.
Xindu has so far been spared from such violence.
But unrest is not to be ruled out.
Only two blocks away from the quiet Baonguang square, where the female officials patrolled this morning, more than 50 people gathered at a street corner.
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle, which was repaired in contrast to the rules on the door instead of in a workshop.
The owner screamed Zeter and Mordio.
After 15 minutes of hesitation, the officers with a horrible face took the road to their vehicles and went on with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator of male stripes, stayed behind, turning his white name sign to remain anonymous.
Like their colleagues, the coordinators - men over 40 - play a purely supportive role.
But they were not trained to present a clean image.
"Sometimes we go verbally."
"But sometimes also physical," Mr Li explains sober.
"Most of the time people start fighting."
Attorney General won't sue Senator Ensign
Public Prosecutors of the Ministry of Justice have released Senator John Ensign from the accusations that were brought against him after his affair with a former electoral assistant and his attempt to provide her husband with a lobby activity, the senator's lawyers announced on Wednesday.
This decision terminates the most serious protest against Senator Ensign, the Republican from Nevada. Until the scandal that took care of headlines throughout the country and put a demon on his career, he was considered a possible presidential candidate for the Republican for 2012.
As Senator Ensign's office announced, he was "very pleased" about the judgment following the one-year investigation.
However, the Senate's Ethics Committee could impose a disciplinary penalty.
According to Ensign lawyers, they were informed by the Ministry of Justice that the investigations against Senator Ensign have been terminated and that no further charges have been made on this matter.
The Ministry of Justice did not wish to comment on the case.
The judgment was a surprise for many ethics lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice. In your opinion there was sufficient evidence that Ensign has failed to respect the lobbying ban.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents published for the first time in October 2009 in the New York Times gave rise to the assumption that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his electoral assistants, had a lucrative order to buy his silence about an affair with Hampton's wife Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton worked as a treasure champion during a campaign.
Ensign made contact with some political friends to get Hampton to work. According to the documents and interrogations he took over for them after setting Hampton's lobby work.
Since Hampton was recently in Ensign's election team, he was not allowed to take over lobbying for a year for his former employer or the entire Senate.
According to ethics experts, the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, violated the so-called ban on the rotary lobbyist.
According to the published indices, "everything seems to be a deal and a violation of the rotary statutes," Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer specializing in defending clients who are in the direction of the government.
While the Ministry of Justice officially refused to announce the reasons for the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethnic whites said that the Ministry appears to be very cautious in taking up political charges after a variety of defeats that were persecuted by the media with great interest, including the decision last year to drop the charges against the former Senator Ted Stevens for failure by the prosecutor.
Public Prosecutors "are apparently horrible," said Melanie Sloan, the chairman of the Association of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (an organization whose aim is to combat corruption in the parliamentary and government circles of the United States), a group of lawyers who brought various charges against Mr. Ensign to trial.
"This means in principle that senior government officials can now assume that the laws are not applicable to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, Chief Defense of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a prosecutor on Monday and another on the next day when he was told that the ministry would not sue his clients.
Mr. Ensign's defenders had cooperated with the prosecutors to convince them that the senator, like his office in a statement on Wednesday, reiterated "in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused to explain more precisely the legal arguments he had put forward to the prosecutors.
"I am not good at going into the conversation details between the Ministry of Justice and me. Only so much is said: we believe that we have made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Electoral Commission decided to terminate the investigation for a separate complaint by the ethics group after which a payment of $96,000 by Mr. Ensign's parents to the Hamptons violated the federal electoral law.
The electoral commission said there was not enough evidence that the money had been anything but a gift.
NV Energy, a large company in Nevada, which for a long time supported the Senator, was one of the companies in which Mr. Hampton was found thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign lobbyist work.
An e-mail from December 2008 shows that after Mr. Hampton had passed on as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensings Chief of Staff, John Lopez, had a conversation with Mr. Hampton in which he told him that he was "knocking at the Ministry of the Interior for a matter."
Mr. Ensign was also meeting with Mr. Hampton and another customer from Nevada, Allegiant Air, for lunch and asked the Minister of Transport to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after that Mr. Hampton had hired for lobbying.
Last year, for the first time, information about this affair came to the public, Mr. Ensign apologized to his voters and abandoned his position in the Senate, where he had been in the rank of the Republicans in the fourth place.
After he had not noticed many months, Mr. Ensign told two weeks ago reporters that he sought a third term of office in the Senate.
In the announcement that Mr. Ensign is no longer the target of police investigations, his press preacher, Jennifer Cooper, said that the senator hopes that the ethics commission will follow the example of the Ministry of Justice very quickly and initiate his investigation.
"Senator Ensign is looking forward to continuing his hard work in the service of people in Nevada," she said.
Cheshire vocation makes Twitter aware
Half a dozen of them tipped into the crawls in the courtroom.
In the minutes of the day, they sent Twitter their reports of cruel testimony.
At the end, the defense said, there were more than 140,000 Twitter reports about the process of rape and chained children on beds in a house that went up in flames.
On Thursday, the carefully pursued trial by Steven J. Hayes, who was accused of having killed three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, will find an official end when the judgment on the death sentence that the jury has issued falls.
But Mr. Hayes's lawyers have already filed applications for a court to explain the reasons for a appeal and will employ the courts for years.
One of the most provocative reasons is that the intensive reporting of the process - including the extensive use of Twitter by average reporter - has led to a "circus atmosphere" and a so widespread, immediate penetration of exaggerated details, so that the jury had been influenced in an unlawful way by public embodiment.
This objection could lead the appeal courts to consider whether the new technologies make new rules necessary in the court room.
"As I have experienced during this process, I believe that it is really a danger that the entry of new technologies into the courtroom affects the right of each individual to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes main defender.
The president, Jon C. Blue from the Supreme Chamber Court, rejected the applications by a decision shortly and in common last week when he said that the new media would be "carefully controlled," and that there was no evidence that the jury had been driven by passion.
But that was certainly not the last word in this matter.
For decades, court appeals have found that the reporting of famous cases gives rise to doubts about the fairness of a process.
In his historical decision of 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States repealed the judgment against Dr. Sam Sheppard, an osteopath from Cleveland, who was supposed to have killed his wife, and said in his decision that there would have been a "carnival atmosphere in the courtroom" because of the new media.
Some people believe that the TV series and the game film "On the Escape" are based on this crime.
Some lawyers say that court claims, which Mr. Hayes considers a half-century later, could follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to regulate the means of communication from the courtroom which were still unthinkable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a good reason to be concerned about the influence of the new media in processes persecuted by a wide public," said John J. Donohue III, Professor at Stanford Law School, who investigated the death penalty in Connecticut. According to his report, it is arbitrary.
Professor Donohue said that some appeal courts could be fascinated by the idea that limiting an immediate communication from the courtroom could make the processes fairer.
The Twitter issue is just one of many who presents Mr. Hayes's lawyers to discuss for years and thus delay a conviction.
For example, the defenders also claim that Mr. Hayes could have already been condemned when Judge Blue had not allowed them to test the reactions of potential judges by showing them cruel crime scene photos during the selection of the jury.
Some of the lawyers have said that photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years, and their bondmen, Hayley, 17 years, and Michaela, 11 years, they would have filled with shame.
The defendants say that they would also question the constitutionality of the death penalty constitution and argue that the judge wrongly exchanged a lawyer who had been a critic of the prosecutor, and that he had exerted unlawful pressure on the judgment when he had made the unusual decision to release the jury during the weekend.
The jury wasn't isolated.
However, their arguments about the impact of detailed reporting on the process may attract the greatest interest.
In an appeal they submitted last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed by the candidates during the election campaign for the governor's office and for the American Senate.
They argued that the new media had continuously retrieved the flames of emotions about the case.
"Such a daily urge of media piepers, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom," the lawyers wrote, "they have not experienced before in New Haven and perhaps even in the country."
Their focus on Twitter reporting is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that the assertion that these direct messages are more exciting than reports that are slower, is a technically hostile look that degrades reporting about future processes.
However, some lawyers said that appeals would often be confronted with the argument that social and technical changes would require the adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayer's lawyers are reinforcing this claim.
In her objection, she referred to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966, in which the conviction of Dr. Sheppard for reporting was repealed and made it clear that the new media require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "Sheppard represents against Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can courtesy connect the separation?
After a campaign on chimp words and negativity, this week little courtesy has broken out in Washington.
Is it the omens of a genuine two-party cooperation or a moment of illusion before you return quickly to the struggle of the parties in the capital?
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and the leaders of the Congress did not bring a breakthrough on the major issues that had to be dealt with during the so-called "lame duck session," the meeting at the end of a government period in which no more decisions were taken.
After all that you hear, it was neither a polite discussion between two different sides nor a respect for their shared responsibility, but rather an empty episode of a party pool of points.
The public meeting of the President's Deficit Commission on Wednesday was also civilized, despite the political differences that remain between the members.
It seems clear that a close interaction over a period of months creates mutual respect which conceals the ideological gap that continues to separate members.
This is hardly enough to claim that there has been a new era of cooperation.
Both sides are now in a test phase - in which one of the other signs of cooperation and compromise is called upon, while one tries to weigh the boundaries of public opinion and the patience of voters after a renewed party war.
Therefore, the meeting on Tuesday itself and its assessment by the participants were limited to a minimum of claims or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep to expect a rapid change in the atmosphere that has prevailed over the past two years.
No matter whether it's about taxes, donations, health or attractions, the two sides are miles away from each other.
Finally, the November elections in Washington have voted mild for at least a short time.
"No question, the sound has changed," said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush government, who now works for the "Ethics and Public Policy Center."
"This is inevitable after elections.
Elections create partial passion that will die again.
And that's good. "
In some questions, especially those on the agenda of the "lame duck session," Republicans and Democrats have hardly any choice but to find a solution. "
Bush's tax reductions end at the end of the year, and no one supports that.
Both sides want to find a way to get some or even everyone, whether temporarily or permanently.
Likewise, a compromise on the increase in unemployment engeles is expected, although only because the Republicans cannot afford to believe that the preferred tax reductions for the rich while they refuse to support unemployed workers.
After the meeting on Tuesday in the White House, optimism has increased that we can agree on these issues during the "lame duck session" and at the same time ratify the New START Treaty.
But William Glaston of the Brooking Insitution warns that successful cooperation on urgent issues of the lame duck session "does not necessarily lead to permanent cooperation of the parties when the new 112. Congress is convened in January.
Instead, he says, a phase of non-consensus is more likely, perhaps even indispensable.
"After the things that have to be done, this short-term psychology will turn into confrontation," he said.
Wehner is also skeptical - and this scepticism is shared by many - that courtesy leads to true cooperation.
"I see a lot of what happens from today to 2012, as a prematch, or shadow boxes, for the main event of 2012," he said.
The reasons for this have a great deal to do with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the Tea Party voters who were useful in their education.
How worried the Republican leaders may be that they are poking too high, they know that they must try to keep their promises to reduce government spending and to put an end to health reform.
These parties are already shown in the first reactions to the Commission's recommendations on deficit, which include tax reform and raising some taxes, raising retirement age and reducing government expenditure.
Vice-Presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to their own assessment, have so much pressed to put the deficit issue on the public agenda that they can no longer be ignored.
But they need 14 out of the 18 votes within the Commission to make their plan an official recommendation and they fight very hard to get close to this number.
The greatest resistance is found in the elected representatives of the body, since in financial matters, at least today, there is little room or sympathy for compromises.
Galston predicts two phases in the struggle between the White House and the Republicans in the Congress.
The first battle will take place next year in the form of party confrontations when Republican Obama is challenging the state budget, taxes and health system, followed later by a phase of greater two-party cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
The public opinion.
It is proven that, despite the partiality of the current election, the majority of Americans still want the two parties to work together.
If confrontation leads to a dead end, as it happened in 1995, both parties must be careful about the public response.
Whoever is condemned to lose will have to change the course and seek the compromise.
This may indeed be an optimistic view.
Participation and polarization are now greater than in the mid-1990s, and they seem to be a greater ideological gap between Obama and the Congress Republicans than that between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, the activists of both parties consider 2010 to be a purely precedent for a much broader choice in 2012.
Thus, the courtesy that is shown this week may be welcomed by many Americans.
But there will be much more effort on both sides to find a common denominator on the issues that the two continue to separate.
Sighted US document portrays Moscow as the port of corruption
The city's control lies in the hands of the "Kleptocracy" and it gives a part of the bribes and the protection money it collects to the Kremlin. Thus, in February, the American embassy in Russia reported in a memo.
Both the police and the State Security Service are blackmailing high protection funds so that they can keep their expensive standard of living in Moscow, it is said.
They collect money not only from legitimate business, but also from organized criminal bands.
Each layer of bureaucracy - which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called "Vertical of Authority" - takes its share of the money that the ladder walks up.
The memo sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle was published on Tuesday by WikiLeaks on his homepage.
The memo is based on sources whose names have been edited.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still the mayor of Moscow, and it accuses him of corruption.
He was fired by President Dmitry Medvedev in October, but there is hardly any proof that in the meantime it had been cleaned up.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a well-known construction company, have repeatedly rejected corruption charges for years, and he has won numerous prosecutions against such accusations.
In September, he explained to a Russian television station when he was asked for a documentary that suggests he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's dirty, it's dirty."
> An incredibly large number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt.
But it is unusual that, as is happening in the Ambassador's report, individuals are mentioned, and it is unheard that this is happening by a diplomat of a foreign country.
"The direct link between the Moscow government and crime has led some to call it" disturbed "and come to the conclusion that the government acts more like a Kleptocrate than a government," said the memo.
"Criminal elements enjoy a" kryshna "(a term from the world of criminals / the mafia, which literally means" roof "or protection), which covers the police, state security (FSB), the MVD and the prosecutor's office as well as the entire Moscow government bureaucracy.
Experts have discovered a three-day structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"FSB, MVD and the militia are on the second stage."
"Last but not least, the ordinary criminals and the criminal inspectors follow at the lowest level."
"This is an incompetent system in which criminal groups close a gap in some areas because the city offers no help."
The report further states that the FSB cashes money from the largest companies and that the police arrest small businessmen.
A source, that is, "said Moscow's business holders understand that it is best to get protection from MVD and FSB (and not from organised crime) because they have not only more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by the law."
"For this reason, the protection of criminal gangs is no longer as demanded as before."
The memo notes that while collecting the funds is comprehensive, protection itself is not very modest; even those who pay are sometimes arrested.
Those who do not pay will find their business very quickly closed - because of one or other prevail.
Medvedev has spoken several times about combating corruption, but at the same time noted that he has made little progress.
The memo of the message contains descriptions of men who go into the Kremlin with bags that were probably full of money.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev must rely on the bureaucrats," said Georgy Satarov, Director of Indem, a Moscow expert commission, recently in an interview.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
"It is not part of the political class because a political class no longer exists in Russia."
Without politicians, without opposition, without separation of powers, he says corruption is inevitable.
All over the country, it is estimated that corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
The country ranks on place 154 of a recent investigation into the global perception of corruption by the NGOs Transparence International (countries are listed from "least corrupt" to "most corrupt").
The disclosure of the memo of the American Embassy, which occurred after Moscow's late evening, will certainly trigger failures within the Russian Government, although, as Luzhkov can be accused of the Moscow mistakes, it can also be an opportunity for the Kreml to claim that the problems are solved.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin claimed that the WikiLeaks documents could be a forgery and responded angry to the discovery that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth is that this is about our interaction, which is an important factor in internal policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we would not have expected this to deal with such an arrogance, with such pressure and in such unethical way, you know."
Khmer Rouge veterans forced to confront the past
In a weak illuminated, emphasized classroom with dirty and blowing walls, the director of Anlong Veng High School reminds the man who built it to the later Khmer Rouge Führer Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and he took care of his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years.
Due to his brutality during the Khmer Rouge reign known as "the Butcher," the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge-Hochburg in northern Cambodia, where he built hospitals and bridges, developed the infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the surrender of the Khmer Rouge to the government, many years of followers are being challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum allowed victims to face public confrontation with the people who once supported the regime.
In June, the government distributed a school book that for the first time tells children of former soldiers the history of Khmer Rouge.
And in July, a United Nations and Cambodia tribunal sentenced for the first time a former member of Khmer Rouge when it sentenced the former chief of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these developments, the fear of the Khmer Rouge Veterans Alnlong Vengs increased, hampering their efforts to reconciliation and reintegration into the society of Cambodia.
"There is still rejection and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything," said Chhang Youk, Head of Cambodia's Documentation Centre, an independent organization that investigates the regime.
"For them life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"It separates families itself."
During the Khmer Rouge reign in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of illness, reprocessing or hunger.
When the Vietnamese fell and the Pol Pot-Ied government crashed in 1979, the remains of the regime and his military fled to the border of Cambodia to Thailand.
Here they spread until December 1998, when the last movement surrendered, unrest.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the Guerilla War from their base in the west of the mountains and jungles of Cambodia, Ta Mok moved to the next generation in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, when a peace agreement supported by the UN in 1993 led to the first democratic elections of the country, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to pass to the government, leading to the capitulations of Ieng Sary 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural death in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had not given up, was arrested by government forces at the Dangrek Mountains in 1999.
He died in Phnom Penh's prison in 2006, waiting for his trial.
When their goons no longer protected them, most former Khmer Rouge fighters fled into the devastating poverty of rural Cambodia and many kept the movement in nostalgic memory.
Although a few elite officers of the Khmer Rouge held their local government posts because they laid down their weapons, the simple soldiers remained poor, uneducated peasants.
"These people have benefited very little from the surrender," said Sok Leang from the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which holds public forums throughout Cambodia, even in Anlong Veng.
"They are anchored to the utopic agrarideology of the regime."
"They grew up without any professional knowledge."
Sor Lim, 55 years old, who had joined the Rhmer Rouge in 1974, fought in the jungle for Anlang Veng before he settled in 1998 to live a life as a poor rice builder.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Ta Mok gave everyone something to eat."
"But now life is hard because we have to take care of ourselves."
The ongoing Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also raised concerns here.
At the beginning of next year, the court will try to bring Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, as well as Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge Minister, to justice.
The court's mission is to condemn the old leaders and those who are mainly responsible for the abomination, but it is not said whether it will follow further actions beyond these four cases.
This has helped little to mitigate anxiety in Anlong Veng.
Current media speculations have focused on In Chaem, 64 years, who had been head of the district in Manteay Meanchey Province during the Khmer Rouge reign in the late 1970s.
In 2007 she had told representatives of the documentation centre of Cambodia that she had led the construction of the Trapeang Thma Damm, a project where thousands of forced workers probably died.
On a hot evening, In Chaem returned from work on the fields to her wooden house on a dirty street outside of Anlong Veng.
When the sun had long shadows on the devastated grass, In Chaem refused to discuss her past at the Khmer Rouge.
She said that if the court asked her to leave, she would refuse to leave.
"Cambodia lives in peace and stability," she said.
"If there were no more persecutions, there would be war here."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who fled from the Khmer Rouge in 1878, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would become uncertain, the court would accuse more suspects, although experts and historians discuss this.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia has to do to make progress, said Chhang Youk from the Documentation Centre.
"Reconciliation with the Khmer times means gathering the broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to assemble these broken parts so that everything can be understood."
The centre created the first school book approved by the government on the Khmer Rouge, the 75-page "History of Democratic Cambodia."
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as an annex to the history book for the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages about the Khmer Rouge.
As often in Cambodia, the young people in Anlong Veng know little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the links of the city to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19 years old, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said that the new school book helps students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents responded sceptically when he brought the book home to read it.
"My family rejects many parts of the book and the court," he said.
"They are suspicious because they are not sure how many people are sentenced by the court."
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicated, said Sok Leang.
But the public forums, the school book and the court gradually gain influence, "he said.
The Khmer Rouge still has a powerful attraction here.
Upstairs in the Dangrek Mountains, an overgrown and filthy path with plastic waste leads to a rectangle of black root covered with a roasted sheet roof.
Pol Pot's body had been burned here after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31 years old, a cell phone seller on the street, said she didn't know much about the man who had been burned here.
"But he has a strong spirit and many people here go to pray to him," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and later on the day she wanted to go to Pol Pot's last resting place, where she will take a bush of ripe bananas - in the hope that he will bring her luck.
Belarus agrees not to gather further weapons of uranium
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign to secure global nuclear material, the government of Belarus announced on Wednesday that it will no longer collect highly enriched uranium, which is a critical part of nuclear weapons.
The deal was announced in a joint statement following a meeting of Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton with the Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the Security Summit.
The US government had been trying for years to convince Belarus to no longer collect highly enriched uranium and seemed to have reached a hurdle last spring.
But officers of the US government told the Washington Post that in the past two months two secret agreements have been made with Belarus to remove 187 pounds of weapons of uranium from a white Russian research facility.
This prepared the stage for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material - according to an official employee who remains anonymous due to the sensitivity of the subject, about 500 pounds.
The agreement seems to be one of the most important results of Obama's' 47 Nations Nuclear Safety Summit 'in April, which had ruled out Belarus.
And it was obviously good enough to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really excited about the fact that they want a seat at the Nuclear Security Summit (from 2012)."
"This proves to me that it works," said Ken Luongo, President of the Global Security Partnership, a group to promote nuclear safety.
Clinton called the agreement "a very important, important step" of Belarus.
Obama promised in April 2009 in Prague to secure all precarious nuclear material within four years.
Since then, the US government has helped six countries get rid of its highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did it under the government of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama's nuclear security summit, the Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko said that the nation will never give up its uranium.
"How to keep highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which is fundamentally armed, and less enriched uranium," said Lukashenko at that time.
"This is our raw material... we're not gonna make dirty bombs from it and we're not gonna sell it to anyone."
"We only use it for research purposes, that's all."
However, Belarus approached the United States a few months ago when it showed interest in the meeting of an agreement.
The first start to remove the uranium of Belarus in October was particularly complicated because the material was easily radiated, says official.
It was loaded into a special train for more than 1,300 miles to a Russian storage and disposal factory, says official.
The second launch was decided on Monday and was carried out by aircraft according to the official authorities.
The US government pays $14 million for these efforts, with a large part of the money flowing into white Russian research with slightly enriched uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
"This was extremely carefully coordinated and voted to build confidence," which led to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Ministry of Energy, working on global risk reduction.
The James Martin Center for Non-Providing Studies estimates that Belarus had at least 88 pounds of weapons-fired uranium this year as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
According to the Joint Agreement, Belarus wants to dissolve its warehouse by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been tense for years, mainly because of Lukashenko's harsh violation of human rights.
But the statement of Wednesday suggests a possible approach.
"Welcome to the progress of these global security issues, the United States of America and Belarus announce that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue in improving bilateral relations and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," she explains.
No objections by the Spanish Government to CIA flights
The Spanish Government had no objections to the CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaida prisoners via Spanish state territory to Guantánamo, as illustrated by a telegram of the United States Ambassador in Madrid.
This reflects the documents enveloped by Wikileaks and forwarded to the newspaper "El País" (via cable). It is added that the former Deputy Head of Government, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, called for the Spanish Government to be informed "to prove that foreign aircraft flying over Spain are adequately monitored."
In June 2006, following the publication of a report by the Council of Europe indicting aid for human rights abusive practices in a dozen countries, including Spain, the former North American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega discussed.
The Deputy Head of Government admitted that the Council's report "had met Zapatero in the distance" and confirmed that Spain had nothing to hide on this issue.
"De la Vega underlined that Spain had no objections to the intelligence flights over Spanish territory."
"You just want to be informed" in order not to be "unprepared surprised," Aguirre reports by cable.
The former Foreign Minister, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, also pointed out to the Ambassador that the Spanish Government "did not want to pay great attention to this matter, although the government had little influence since it was in the hands of the judges."
In January 2007, Attorney Vicente González understood the message that he would not block the judicial initiative to declassify the documents of the Spanish Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Minister of Defence on CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any burdensome or sensitive information," the ambassador explained after a conversation with the prosecutor.
Nevertheless, the US was more concerned about the "apparent coordination between the Spanish prosecutor and the German prosecutors" than about the declassified information of the CNI and the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to operate discreet between governments," Aguirre complains.
At a lunch in March 2007, in which the Ambassador of the United States and Spanish Minister of Interior Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba took part, the latter commented that "although the Spanish judges were deliberately concerned about their independence and did what they considered appropriate," he had instructed his employees to "avoid inflating rhetoric comments in order to make the tension slip."
The Ambassador also expressed concern about the PP's approach to this matter.
"Despite its generally proAmerican attitude, our experience teaches us that PP will not doubt from a indication that the government of Zapatero has tolerated or deliberately ignored the US's actions that could have been interpreted as human rights violations, even if these disclosures could have a negative impact on the US government," he emphasised.
The child murderer confessed that she complained on the Internet about the "mühsal" of maternity.
The young woman spoke of the child, when this was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror in a galactic way"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is on the Internet "Muki."
Under this name she leads from small, she keeps in contact with a cousin and at least one friend. Both come from Noia, a village in the province of La Coruña, in which she was born.
The communications are from 2008.
To understand these, you must know their love life, which reconstructs ABC's daily newspaper on the basis of testimony from their family members.
In 1998, the 30-year-old gal woman entered a relationship with Iván Túñez, an industrial woman.
She lasted a year.
Shortly after she had dissolved her relationship, it became known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him perform a DNA analysis.
She had a different relationship shortly afterwards.
The selected was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighboring municipality.
She lived with him for a long time.
César lived with them.
When the young woman went to the Balearic Islands to look around the labour market, the girl stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But from the content of their news it can be concluded that their love relationship broke and they separated.
In March 2008, she was on Menorca alone and wrote: "Alberto is very strange and angry because I came to work."
"When I told him that, he liked it, but now, of course, he realizes what it means to be alone with the boy all day and not be free to do and let what he wants."
Later she mentioned a message she just received on the phone: "I want you to come back this month or get me an address to send the boy to you."
She complains, "If he doesn't like me leaving the boy with my mother, I'll pick him up when I get back."
In May she talks about returning to her village: "This week I'm going to go there, but I will only stay there until 19, because I have to introduce myself to a job on the 20th if I don't want to lose it."
She explains that she takes her first-born if everything's okay.
"He will be with who he must be, that is, with me. Never in my life will I leave him with someone but with my mother again," a questionable intention when considering their bad relationship.
In July there is another email.
When she writes it, it is assumed that the boy who came to the island on the first of the month and was allegedly murdered on the 10th is dead.
"On the one hand, César is satisfied, on the other hand not."
"On the one hand he's with me and he likes the place a little, but on the other hand he has to go to school every day."
She's talking about moving to Mallorca.
"There he (the boy) will attend a summer course, so I have less expenses for the nanny."
On 17: Memories and complaints.
"A giant kiss from César asking me when you'll be here."
"Alberto says he sent me some videos on the e-mail. You see, if he wants, he'll find me, such a crap."
On 30: "The boy is fine. He goes to a summer course to learn Catalan."
From Víctor, her current partner, there is one: "He shoots money to me."
On the Internet, in Anime and Mangablogs, there are messages from her.
She even had her own blog in MySpace, which is now locked up, and in which she called herself "Muki, the prisoner."
"Terror a la gallega (title)."
The last man who lived with her, an authorized hunting officer, explains his conscience bite because he feels guilty.
He can't believe everything happened because she didn't tell him she was a single mother.
Mónica was transferred yesterday to Menorca to Palma Province Prison from the Center for Criminal Prison.
The defendant, Carlos Maceda, said that she could not remember the outcome of the matter, "and she did not intend to harm the little one."
But before that, she had confessed to drown César in the bathtub and stabbed his body in a suitcase.
Defence and prosecutor requested a psychiatric opinion.
Partido Popular won 4 seats in the Congress and PSC lost 9
With the results of November 28, PP could play a key role in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After the significant increase in voting and parliamentary voting in the last regional elections, the PP is already looking at the parliamentary elections - preferred or not. Their expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes achieved by this party in these elections is usually twice as high as that of the elections in Catalonia.
For example, the Catalan People's Party received 610.473 votes in the 2008 parliamentary elections, while this figure was only 316.222 in the 2006 regional elections.
On the last Sunday the PPC reached 384.091 votes.
If this rising trend - the result of the redirection of the PSC's voting share and the binding of PP's electoral power - should continue, the PP analysts predict that the PPC could rise from 8 to 12 congressional delegates during the parliamentary elections, while CiU four (now has 10) would gain and the PSC would lose at least 9 (of 25) members.
These calculations demonstrate the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the People's Party, the ERC would lose a member - it currently has three - while ICV would hold its members or win one.
However, if the electoral calendar is maintained, the next appointment with the municipal elections will be in May 2011. Even then the People's Party (PP) can be the tongue on the scale to put an end to the socialist rule, in four provincial capitals and with their majority in the Barcelona City Council, one of the largest city administrations with the largest budget: 661 million euros for 2011.
Both the nationalists and the People's Party agree that the PSC will lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the Socialists do not achieve a majority or can rely on their traditional allies (ERC and ICV).
According to the Republican Debakel, it is not absent that this party will lose its representation in the Municipality Council of Barcelona, in which it would have to achieve 5% of the votes.
On the other hand, PP recorded an increase in its voting share in the four provincial capitals and could become a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced to be able to play the main role in Tarragona's revolution. There they had ruled in front of the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros, together with the PP.
En Lérida is the PP only 500 votes behind the PSC. The mayor, the Ros Mayor, has good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last election campaign they met several times.
In other important places, such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus, the People's Party was able to see a significant increase.
At present, PP is represented in 34 city administrations of Catalonia and aims to create lists in as many places as possible.
The Catalan cell bought Al Qaida thousands of passports
Apart from the seven arrests in Barcelona there were three more in Thailand
The seven Pakistans and Nigerians arrested by the police at the Barcelona Police Department were the Dschihadist cell controlled by Thailand, the various Al Qaida groups, including the "Movement for the Liberation of Tamil Eelam" (LTTE) and "Laschkar e-Taiba" (Let) - the latter was the author of the bombay assassinations requiring 106 deaths - provided with passports in 2008.
The Spanish Minister of the Interior attaches great importance to these investigations, which goes so far as to ensure that the "Campai" operation has "weakened" Al Qaeda's counterfeiting apparatus worldwide and thus "its ability to act."
The researchers assume that in the two years in which the cell was active in Catalonia, thousands of passports were sent to Thailand, where they were falsified and subsequently sent to the groups from which the criminal galaxy Al Qaida is composed, so that their "fighters" could unpunishable cross the borders of European and other western countries.
The detected cell is not the only Dschihadist network active in Europe. Therefore, apart from the Thai investigators, other European police units have also participated in the investigations. It is not to be ruled out that in the EU's territory in the next few days similar assassinations will occur in the same way as those carried out last Tuesday in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested) another one in Thailand where the Pakistans Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thai countries Sirikanlaya Kijbering were arrested.
They had led from Bangkok from the cell located in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - part of it had been destroyed in 2009 - in particular, tourists stole passports according to the requirements of the so-called "International Islamic Front."
This means that the documents were issued on the names of men aged 25 to 45 and had to be valid for several years; they were not allowed to have a visa stamp.
Investigation circles underline that no links between the catalonian arrests and the Bombay assassination have been demonstrated, even though the author of the assassination, "Laschkar e-Taiba," was one of the recipients of the passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it should be recalled that a few days before the catalonian attack several thousand dollars had been sent from a money transfer company that were "invested" in the purchase of prepaid cards for mobile phones, which were later used by the members of the "command," which put an end to the life of 106 people.
The police have seized an extensive documentation.
PP requires Mas to postpone the tax agreement
The chairman of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, took the opportunity yesterday to personally present to Artur Mas their conditions to support his entry as Prime Minister of the General General, which are not different from those already presented during the election campaign and can be summarised with the priority of economic recovery and abandoning regionalist independence abrogations, such as a financial compensation agreement that the regional leader wants to propose at the peak of his mandate.
The President of the Catalan People's Party, with certainty, turned to Artur Mas, who gave her the 18 Members she won last Sunday - a figure that is more than enough to feel indispensable, because the candidate of the CiU CiU bourgeoisie-regionalist party is dependent on at least one of the opposition parties to vote on his term of office.
The future alliances that the regional leaders want to enter into during the forthcoming parliamentary elections in the Congress depend on a possible duck with the PP. However, the talks that Mas is currently conducting with the other party leaders are about Catalonia.
As regards the party chairman of the PPC, it asks that "all disputes concerning the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia, as well as an agreement on financial compensation between the State and the Autonomous Region - similar to that of the Basque Country - should be set up in the back of the office and even be subject to a referendum by the CiU Party Head.
Both political leaders are cruel that they want to make the interrupted political apparatus of the regional administration more slant and to abolish the inheritance and gift tax.
The details of the negotiations on the accession of Mas are discussed by the PPC Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who announced a tough opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV). Today he will meet Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The old-age care secret reaffirms that deaths are not due to "lack of measures"
The owners of the old age home in Olot do not exclude that their nurse killed over eleven older people
The leaders of the old care home La Caritat in Olot (Gerona) yesterday gave a press conference in which they identified the damage to the crime of Joan Vila Dilmés - the nurse who had killed at least eleven old people he was responsible for during his work - to the institution.
The head of the Altenpflegeheim, Joan Sala, joined his lawyer, Joan Cañada, in court and announced "La Caritat wants to accuse the responsible (for the deaths)," but "the law and our liability force force us to accept the process and civil liability."
The institution must not only accept a social loss of reputation because it had not detected the careers' criminal actions in time, but now also pay a high amount of compensation calculated by the legal representatives of the victims' family members.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime went back to August 2009 and that he had continued to murder since then.
The judge ordered the exhumification of eight bodies - former patients of the old care home - because he suspected that no doctor had personally investigated the deceased, but the formalities due to their age and illness were handed by phone.
The head of La Caritat denied this point and said that "no remaining measures could have been the reason for the incidents."
The attorney of La Caritat added that "there were no indications of negligent acts of a person other than the defendant in the dispute."
He already confessed as the "Angel of Death" before 11 murders and declared that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009 and murdered the second old lady one and a half months later.
In this case, he killed with an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime in which he had given a mixture of various tranquilizers.
The head of La Caritat stated that access of staff to the medications was difficult to control.
The insulin syringes and the tranquilizer cocktail used the nurse in six out of nine crimes committed to free patients with death from their suffering.
But the results of the laboratory tests will show whether Vila lies and for his first victims actually chose a less cruel death or whether he burned it from the inside by giving them blue lauge, as he had done in three women he murdered between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat, one does not believe in the statements of the caretaker, not even as regards the number of confessed murders that could be quite more. This attitude is justified by the fact that Vila had made very different statements in court and that it makes no sense to change his approach suddenly after eight successful murders.
They say that they made them available for this reason and to clarify the scope of these incidents by the judiciary.
Threatings of the European Central Bank (ECB)
The investors responded sharply yesterday to the threat of the President of the ECB, Trichet, who warned that "the markets should not underestimate our ability to react."
The risk increases of the euro-peripheral countries have increased dramatically and the shares of European banks have increased by more than 5%.
However, we should not underestimate the possibility that the ECB can deceive itself and that the euro has hardly added to points that cause concern.
The events of yesterday are typical of an illiquid market, which is recovering as it collapses, but due to the closing of short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will not lose his fear for a long time.
Today, a month ago, the European Central Bank called on us to reverse our liquidity measures, which would require the ECB to withdraw tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and probably several times in the future.
The Bundesbank called for the termination of the plan for the purchase of government debt, as they were ineffective, and for the abolition of all exceptional temporary liquidity measures.
After the Irish crisis, we expect the current liquidity measures "at least until March" to be extended and quarterly tenders with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity until at least June.
We also expect the programme to continue buying obligations and to give a stronger signal.
If the expectations created are not met, the excellent response of the markets of yesterday will be thrown back and if they are persisted to withdraw our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
Just as at the ECB meeting in May, in which the Bank reiterated its intention not to consider the purchase of public debt papers and then collapse the markets, this story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May she showed her teeth and on Wednesday she said she had already bought a lot, which provoked a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday, the auction of one-year State titles in Portugal was quite weak.
The government's asset management spent only 500 million at 5.28%, compared to 750 million at 4.81% in the previous auction.
Nevertheless, interest rates in Portugal fell by 30 basis points throughout the curve and thus reflected a change in market perception according to the words of Trichets.
In Ireland, the figures of Allied and Bank of Ireland's debt salary were published.
The sum is estimated to be about 10 000 million short-term and possibly another 15 000. There is time until February to raise private capital or these banks will be rendered public.
Although Ireland has completely lost its credibility after it had not detected the problem of the stress tests in July, the figures under the rescue plan are acceptable and help reduce the uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the government must receive parliamentary consent to its new budget, and since it still does not have sufficient support, Ireland remains a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has modernized her discourse with regard to the summit of the Heads of State and Government on 14 December. Political unity is required there to show that we are playing the same share together.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries the ninth Symphony Beethovens.
The Spanish President of Government presented yesterday the plan of action to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous regions such as financial institutions, reduction of the government deficit, liberalisation, privatisation and job creation measures. Measures that sound in the ears of investors like Vivaldis four seasons.
The double effect of Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish stock exchange has added 4.5 percent twice as much as the rest of the European stock markets.
Compared to February, the reaction of the government and the Spanish Central Bank was fast and convincing, and we are benefiting from the surprise effect.
Today there is a significant auction of a three-year government bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect. That is why we insist on a strong demand that will eliminate all doubts about our rebate ability.
For Spain, the application for an aid plan would be a self-sacrifice.
We would receive liquidity that we do not need. The Treasury has EUR 40 billion available, three times as much as in March. Interest rates are extremely expensive and access to the markets would be closed in time.
Nevertheless, our strategy should be in line with Caesar's wife's motto: "Now does not only matter about being, but also about the appearance."
Just courage, we can do it!
At the request of his children, the Chairman of the Board of Governors of Eulen is fighting the group meeting of Vega Sicilia
The storm in the open conflict of the Álvarez family, owners of the companies Eulen and El Enebro, does not flee.
David Álvarez, founder of the company belt, will contest the company meeting of El Enebro, which will take place at the request of five of his seven children on the 16th, as he considers it "absolutely invalid." His children will try to obtain a majority to control the management bodies of the company - the owner of the vineyard Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his children Jesús David and Maria José prepare legal measures for a new judicial chapter in their dispute on the control of a part of the group.
The founder of the largest holding of business services does not appear to be prepared in its dispute in order to comply with the control of El Enebro's institutions.
He was expelled from the Board of Directors by five of his seven children, who were appointed members of the Board of Directors at the Shareholders' Assembly of 18 January this year, which was already registered as being contested in the Trade Register.
The company meeting of El Enebro, which was convened by the judge of the Trade Court Number 2 of Madrid for the 16th century, has triggered a new thunderbolt in the lap of the Álvarez family.
The appeal of the Judge to invoke the Assembly is the only legal way to ensure the convening of the Company Assembly.
The last strategy of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is interpreted by David Álvarez as a "desperate means of the applicants - his five children - to recognise, through legal topics, fraudulent activities and abuse of law, the inadmissible Assembly of 18 January," as official speakers explain.
This argument is the basis for the contested convention in the aftermath in order to declare it "absolutely void."
In June, the same protagonists, who conceal themselves in discreet silence, tried without success to convene a assembly on a judicial path.
At El Enebro - asset company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, alongside other assets - David Álvarez 'seven children control 100 percent of the capital.
On the other hand, according to family protocols, the founder of the service group calls for more than 51% of the capital to be used.
This is the actual background of the matter to be decided by the Judge in the hearing on the examination of the appeal for which no date has yet been laid down.
Red Bull wins in the F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
The cars are improved with a real-time software.
Since Red Bull entered the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history has been characterized in this experienced universe by the speed of surprises and successes.
At the beginning, no one paid attention to the new world and, despite its steep rise in the world during the last season, all put on the victory of the Ferraris of Fernando Alonso at the final track last November.
Without trying to reduce the ability of the German pilot and world champion Sebastian Vettel or the power of the engine of Renault, the "secret weapon" which the Multi Siemens Red Bull put into the hands and thus created a winning team has become a legend.
In fact, it is a powerful software to simulate processes that the German company placed on the market in 2007 for purposes that are not related to car racing.
This information program called PLM was used for the development of assembly chains in plants around the world, energy works and highly precise instruments.
Faithful reproduction or simulation of a product or process is intended before it is actually built in order to avoid errors and unnecessary costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of the cameras of Canon, the aircraft of Sukhoi and the most famous commercial vehicles of Nissan.
Siegfried Russworm, Head of Siemens Industrial Division, explains that using this software in formula 1 - Factory Red Bull "in a few hours, almost in real time" can design and implement the changes and improvements that are detected at the race and at the tests.
Russian worm suggests that in 1992, in the racing stations, ten technicians were working on average, who could introduce up to three or four improvements in one season.
The Red Bulls team today employs 180 highly qualified young people. They carry out analyses and any possible changes to the racing car with powerful computer systems.
The Siemens Manager stated that the PLM software was able to analyse and improve all components of Red Bull's racing cars, except the engine for which Renault is solely responsible.
The materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are changed.
The changes can be transmitted within less than 24 hours from the virtual reality of the simulator to reality thanks to advanced production plants and high-tech car claves.
The only limit that is set to this crazy technical perfectionism is the $40 million that a Formula 1 team may spend for his racing in a season.
Red Bull has built his high-tech factory for the development and manufacture of his racing cars in a 50 km away from London.
These are two buildings where visits - especially by journalists - are heavily restricted.
Everything that happens there is Top Secret.
The team comprises 580 people, including the two pilots, the world champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bull's true formula 1 - Hero is undoubtedly the latest world champion Sebastian Vetell.
Behind the enormous technological resources that the energy drink manufacturer puts in the services of its participation on the racing routes, other protagonists are hiding, whose support is unappreciable and their awareness is equal to zero.
The technology manager, Steve Nevey, stressed that five years ago one could say that progress in R & D for racing cars contributed 50 percent to the victory and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today the share values have changed. Technology represents 85 percent of the success, while the contribution of the pilots is estimated at 15 percent.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by computer, because they are "unpredictable gladiators."
HP will open twenty own shops with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) announced his first exclusive shop in Barcelona yesterday in collaboration with his partner Ront Reyes.
It is the first sales network of 20 stores with 80 to 100 square metres each, which the Multi intends to open in Spain in the next two years.
The company agrees to this initiative with the 16 existing sales areas in the multi-brand business, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The vice-chairman of HP España, Helena Herrero, mentioned as an example the rebuilt shop at the Gran Vía in Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with which HP has been working for thirty years.
The North American Group intends to set up 200 sales outlets in Europe by 2010, of which 20 establishments in Spain.
The first were inaugurated last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia). Barcelona is the third business.
Herrera did not want to betray the forthcoming new openings, but did not rule out that Madrid could be the next target.
The vice-chairman, who is also head of HP Personal Systems, assured that the philosophy of opening the store is always the same. She supports a local distributor with experience and industry skills.
The North American company group advises and takes over the exclusive shop equipment (with interactive products to touch). In Europe, all shops will look alike.
HP is also responsible for training the shop staff.
Helena Herrero said that it was not a franchising system and pointed out that the exclusive sales agency network intended to "optimize the customer service and advice of small and micro-enterprises when purchasing and then even the packaging."
The Barcelona store has a pioneer pilot program that solves the technical problems of HP devices with guarantee.
An online service builds up a connection to the technical centre in Maastricht (Holland).
"In this way we can solve problems in ten minutes that sometimes take up to two days."
"This system has been developed especially for small and micro-enterprises as well as private customers, because the large companies already have their service contracts for technical customer services," Helena Herroro said yesterday.
Sabadell wants to steal his rivals in three years
Banco Sabadell's managing board member, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers. He believes that 2001 will be a tough year for the banks, but first throws off a new liquidity crisis and prophecies the end of the debt war.
Nevertheless, it foresees a fall in interest rates which banks are trying to compensate for with increases in fees and prices for loans.
Sabadell expects to capture one million private customers in three years - one still to exist.
Sabadell has found the way to exploit the next three years and thus survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will introduce a new three-year management plan in 2011.
The aim is not only to survive without taking advantage of the public assistance from the FROB, but also to increase the market share by one million private customers - 700 000 if you withdraw the customers that the bank will lose - which is the major challenge that this bank faces, because it has so far paid more attention to its business customers than its private customers.
This year it has received 250 000 private customers and 50 000 companies.
Their market share for private customers is 3.5 per cent, while business customers account for more than 10 per cent.
Another principle of the 2011-2013 business plan is to increase productivity, namely austerity, cost reduction. The challenges facing the Bank will be presented together with the annual report.
Only a few banks dare to set and publish targets in these difficult times, as the financial crisis has disintegrated all banks' plans worldwide.
This year Sabadell will complete its plan Optima set out four years ago. It was initially designed to cover three years, but due to the market situation it was extended by one financial year.
The customers who will leave the savings banks are the main objective of the bank.
At a breakfast organised by APIE, Guardiola stressed that 2011 would be a "difficult" year "with a great range."
The manager assumes that Spain would only "slow" out of the crisis.
In addition, it would be "very difficult" to create "work" in two or three years - essential for the survival of banks.
Even if it assumes that the war on liabilities - which punishes the interest margins - will be triggered by the risk increases that banks and savings banks will have to pay for their issues in order to maintain liquidity, as a compensation for diminishing profit margins will already be reduced to the credit price.
"The issues of liquidity and financing are structural and they will put pressure on loans."
"We didn't turn the hooker off, but the interest differentials are very high," Guardiola admitted.
Banesto already issued the order to its branch network on Thursday to restrict long-term loans and increase interest differentials (cf. Cinco Días of 22 and 27 November).
The manager also admitted that the banks were currently pursuing the state, "increasing fees," but "within a framework characterised by competition."
Sabadell's guideline is based on organic growth, even if the group, as always, does not exclude corporative business.
He does not insure for free that in Spain "larger companies are needed."
"In the next year, everything will change," he assures.
It stresses that the capital needs are currently "rising" and does not exclude the fact that some Spanish financial institutions will slip into red figures.
It considers that the FROB could replace the money market in the case of capital increases.
After assuming that Sabadell could also survive a temporary closure of the markets, he discourages the argument of some banks that are already proving a new liquidity crisis.
He emphasised that nothing could be put into circulation, but in contrast to the events in June, short-term funding could be achieved through repo transactions and thus resolve the crisis.
CECA excludes a second fusion wave of savings banks
The Director-General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday the possibility of a merger wave of savings banks and stressed the speed with which the industry was restructured.
When the concentration process of the Spanish savings banks began, several savings banks did not participate in the first phase. They remained the second round.
On the other hand, the Director-General of the Spanish Sparkassenverband (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured that this second round would not take place.
"I believe that most of the mergers have been completed. The inclusion of Cajasol in the Banca Cívica group cannot be considered as a second round, but it was rather adjustments."
"The largest part is completed. It may be that we have thirteen or fourteen instead of seven, but all important processes have already been completed. They were controlled by Banco de España, which has strongly supported all operations."
At a breakfast organised by the Association of Managing Directors and Manager of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta said that the concentration process was "carried out as quickly as possible and that we must be satisfied with the timely process that was established in earlier times, not now, within the framework of the business plans with Banco de España," he stressed.
"The transition from 45 savings funds with an average of 28 000 million assets to 17 with 75 500 million each is a historically incomparable process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62 percent and are now much larger, which we have fulfilled the Basel agreement," he highlighted.
Olavarrieta stated that "there would be a number of unprecedented opinions on the slowness of the process, which manifested inseriousness and insinuity," because "Banco de España urges us to close before the end of the year."
The Director-General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain has one of the most rigorous financial systems in Europe and "perhaps" around the world and that those who doubt that do this "without deeper knowledge."
The manager noted that in the current economic recession, we need to "not worry" about the situation of financial institutions and savings banks, which have undergone a "very significant" concentration process that will be carried out "as soon as possible.
He also recalled that the Spanish banks had passed very well the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the red line of Germany
Berlin has chosen to maintain the euro, but at the same time set conditions for the whole of the European Union.
The tensions in the markets have triggered a double response from the government.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has presented new adaptation measures, starting with tax reductions for small and micro-enterprises, regulation of temporary employment companies or cancellation of the 426 euro support for unemployed people who do not receive unemployment allowances, up to the privatisation of 49 percent of AENA, the administration of Barajas and El Prat airports and 30 percent of the state lottery.
On the other hand, with the help of former President Felipe González, the Deputy Head of Government, Elena Salgado, supports the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as a responsible person who has outlined the current crisis.
How are these processes to be understood?
It should be anticipated that Merkel's position is not a mistake in its publicity work.
On the contrary, this is a new round in the difficult process of redefinition of the euro.
In doing so, Germany takes a fundamentally new perspective on shaping our future, which conflicts with the maintenance of the old traditions of a large part of its partners.
In view of the resistance in Europe, we begin to speculate in Germany about three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first: a strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south should leave the euro area.
The second: The re-introduction of German Mark - although it sounds more like Science Fiction at the moment - is supported by a large part of the public opinion, about 50 percent of the population.
The third: a change in the euro according to German proposals, which means: more macroeconomic control; strict budgetary management; penalties for the countries that fail to meet the requirements; possible cancellation of some countries, as well as extending the costs of potential adjustment measures to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been drawing off for some time now. That is why there are no excuses now.
First in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission created incentives for deficits and the German Government withdrew a constitutional reform from the sleeve to prevent this from 2016 onwards.
This was the first sign of the disintegration between what Germany considered necessary (strict tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second sign was that the Central European country, when Merkel put out the decision to rescue Greece painfully.
This was strongly criticised at that time, but the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and the published opinion was absolutely against a rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last few days of October, Merkel emerges with a clear position, calling for a reform of the European Union's agreements to allow the rescue of a country and at the same time commit private borrowers to bear part of the costs.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, as it pushed forward the Irish crisis and all of the following.
However, her proposal has been adopted, although somewhat diluted, and in the coming months we will be taking part in the reform of the European Union, which will enable these measures to take place from 2013 onwards.
Germany has drawn a red line that does not intend to cross it.
It says to everyone that, even if unpopular measures are needed now, the old functioning of the euro will no longer exist as from this date.
2013 will be the year of birth of a new monetary area in which the contradictory countries are severely punished, forced to declare themselves incapable of paying and in this case the private sector must take part of the costs.
Germany shows us that we need to take a tough growth course, with high savings and investment rates, measuring consumption, improving productivity and competitiveness, and positive external balances.
The other alternative, which is based on debt and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments, as it was mentioned by Spain in tree times, will simply not be taken away.
The offer is clear.
And we would do bad not to understand.
It is not just about reducing the government deficit to three percent by 2013.
The demands are much harder.
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions is to cheat on ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will pass in more tranquility.
And that we will take advantage of the opportunities offered to us by spring 2013.
It seems that Zapatero understood that too, and its double announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the large companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures from yesterday) point out that despite the criticism of Merkel's hypothesis of creating order in his own house, it has prepared its way.
But the red line drawn by Germany is there, and it doesn't look like something would change about it.
Among the possibilities envisaged is not to exclude the need to leave the euro area with little seriousness.
In this case, Germany could still tell us that it warned us.
Sports and circumvention of rules
Tricks like those of Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax show an invention spirit, but not the will to circumvent a sanction.
The exclusion, allegedly by two players of Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the 23 November game against the Ajax in the Champions League, led to a lot of ink being shed about whether or not it was an unsporting act and whether or not both players should be punished by the UEFA.
As is widely known, the two players lost a few minutes before the player (their team had already clearly won) time and played several Fouls so that the arbitrator showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, and as the Real Madrid would lead its group, the two players will fulfil the required sanction at the next Ligasplay against the Auxerre and thus enter the next stage without cards.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee punished the club's trainer José Mourinho with two games and the players involved with different amounts of money.
The provocation of a yellow card under such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more frequent in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos - the unwritten, but in this sport-type of rule -.
Part of the debate on the present case is based on the fact that a team of the Real Madrid football club (who has presented in his hymne noble courage and honour and had punished his players for similar incidents on other occasions) played the main role, and on the dramatization by Mourinho, which has added an episode more to his long history as theatrical and provocative technicians.
In any case, the debate is about whether this behavior not expressly forbidden by the statutes contradicts the principles of sport, that is to say, whether these acts constitute a rule circumvention. In fact, this approach respects the statutes of sport, but seems to circumvent its sense.
In this case, the damage caused to the spirit of sport should be investigated.
The spirit of sport defends the physical integrity of the opponents, an aspect that was not endangered by these actions, because it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid the violating players taking an unjustified benefit from the opposite team. Nor did that happen.
The paradox of the action of the players of Real Madrid is that it does not correspond to what we normally understand under wrong play or circumvention of rules, because the circumvention of the rule was not carried out secretly to avoid a sanction, but it should be as striking as possible so that it is punished by the arbitrator.
The players waited and took the sanction with pleasure.
Another question is what kind of advantage the contradictors have drawn from the deliberate fouls.
Here it should be emphasised that the rival was neither put in a more unfavourable position nor that benefits for the game played were raised, because the obvious result of this action was that the own team had to continue playing with fewer players.
It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club does not have these players.
The advantage is obviously that players start the next season of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But it is a long-term, up to a certain degree of unknown advantage, as the team could eventually exit. Furthermore, with this approach, players receive a sanction and pass into the second card cycle where they exit less because of card accumulation with a card than in the first cycle.
So it is not so clear whether this is really an advantage.
Finally, such practices are not directed against the spirit of sport, which also includes strategic decisions in order to make maximum use of the rules.
In this case, players did not want to circumvent sanctions (that would actually be a clear case of rule circumvention), they wanted to choose more when they undergo them.
They made a strategic decision without avoiding a punishment or escaping from it.
Although the limit between invention and the regulatory environment is wasted, I believe that this is a clear case of invention.
I have the impression that the polemics have arisen due to two factors: because it was two self-exclusions and because of the type of provoked regulation transfer.
The damage caused by these actions to the principles of sport is less ethical than rather aesthetic.
Offer offensive for customer catching for group Christmas dinner in Barcelona
This year, the dictatorship of the calendar drops a lawine of reservations to days 16 and 17 December.
The celebrations paid by employees themselves spread. They do not want to spend more than 20 to 30 euros.
Like the Turrón and the Christmas lottery, there is also another group dinner in the pre-Christmas season that brings Barcelona's restaurant and leisure industry oxygen. However, as a result of the economic crisis, they trigger a price offensive to capture the customer segment that represents the large mass: almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros for a lunch or dinner, the respondents confirm the business and associations.
In order to make accounting a little more complicated, the calendar (New Year's Day falls to one Friday) has dropped all orders into the week of December 13th, with the result of a lawine of reservations from dinner to two top days (the 16th and 17th) and almost no orders in the week before.
Since 2008, when the bad times began, many companies have canceled group dinner for household reasons.
In order not to refrain from this tradition, many workers pay them out of their own pocket.
Whatever the economic situation is, low prices are required, the president of the Barcelona Hoststättengremium, Gaietà Farràs, confirms.
The representative of the roofing group has not yet been able to predict what the holidays will look like this month.
"People think about it a hundred times before they book."
"They want to go out, but they pay great attention to the prices," he emphasises.
The business will go well with those who "offer quality at good prices with a good service," he adds, and reminds us that customers are saving in times of crisis, so prices are most demanded by 25 euros.
A survey in several centrally located restaurants shows that the evening of the 17th December leads the providers to collapse.
The group Soteras says that the queries for this Friday with the intention to spend less than 30 euros would be booming. The group has adapted its menus with complete offers between 25 and 35 euros to the economic situation.
With another leading group, Andilana, which maintains 16 restaurants in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the ownership of the calendar has led to premature reservations even from the beginning of November.
"We have made it impossible to maintain the previous year's prices with menus for every taste of 19,95 to 30 euros," he explains.
At AN Grup, which runs El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 locals, you do not lose optimism after the second quarter's revenues have been reflowered and good, although even for a few days focused prospects for Christmas business.
Sources of the group emphasise that the 18th will also be an overactive day with friends who celebrate Christmas.
To the six group menus a Christmas menu for 30 euros or more has been added than price hit. One has the impression that customers are willing to spend 10 percent more than in the previous year and in return want more details, such as Cava.
Also in some companies you see green springs spreading, so the employees are invited again. This gives the impression that the group food is back in recovery.
Vonseiten of the Fecasarm roof group (with mergers such as the Barcelona bar, restaurant and leisure club), the deputy chairman, Enric Gomà, trusts to see the end of the tunnel and notices that the reservations in general are quite "vibrant," although customers "set a maximum."
However, the fun of celebrating did not go back, no matter who pays.
The Pakistani nuclear programme gives rise to great concern in the United States
Islamabad produces nuclear weapons "faster than any other country."
Revelations of Wikileaks confirm relations between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the North American Embassy in Pakistan and the US State Department, revealed by the Internet portal Wikileaks, confirms the enormous concerns of the Pakistani nuclear programme in Washington.
On the margins of the clarifying and juicy details that provide documents on the content of the talks and the thinking of the accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad, they reveal that cooperation between both countries in the field of nuclear safety is not being strengthened but rather "decreases," and that the unstable Asian country produces more nuclear weapons "to a faster rhyte than any other country."
In particular, the characteristic of the Pakistani nuclear programme - that the weapons are not assembled, but their parts are stored in order to make their destruction difficult in a possible attack - prepare Washington for sleeping nights.
The following risks are identified by Ambassador in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report before the visit of the former Head of the National Security Council, James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear installations to the area attacked by the Taliban, the presumption of proliferation of nuclear material and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear material."
The large number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programmes is no longer considered to be a source and reason of caution by the US, but also by Russia.
"Pakistan must recruit strictly credible personnel to monitor nuclear installations; due to the low educational and cultural levels, extremist organisations have more opportunities to recruit people who are involved in nuclear or missile programmes," said the expert Yuri Korolev from the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a meeting with his North American counterparts.
New to the documentation published by Julian Assange's Internet portal is that cooperation between the USA and Pakistan in the field of nuclear proliferation is dropping and the increased pace in which Pakistan produces nuclear weapons.
In May, an office of the Embassy describes communication with Pakistan as "frustrating," said, "There is often no transparency; we do not receive any answers or they are rejected."
In another communication, Peter Lavoy, State Secret Service official for South Asia, confirms that "despite the economic disaster Pakistan produces nuclear weapons as quickly as no other country."
Ambassador Patterson asks Washington to "clarify to the responsible" that "Pakistan's army must cease its silent support for terrorist groups during a visit to General Ashfaq Kayani."
On the hunt for Wikileaks boss
Obama appoints a high responsibility for the anti-terrorism struggle to prevent new discoveries.
Interpol gives a red warning to persecute and find Assange.
Everything related to Wikileaks and its founder, Jullian Assange, is a complicated labyrinth in which the facts are difficult to clarify.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red warning" on Assange's "detection and persecution."
However, this is not a traditional arrest order.
Besides, she's not new, she's from November 20th.
It also has nothing to do with the last disclosure of more than four million diplomatic documents from the United States, but with the accusations of sexual abuse that the Australian has to face in Sweden.
The lawyer of the founder of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, also assures "the police know where and how to contact Mr Assange."
The international police office based in Lyon (France) issued the order already on the 20th on request of Sweden, but it was not announced until yesterday after receiving the authority of the Swedish authorities.
This is how things lie. The 188 Interpol countries are required to identify and invent Assange, "to seize and deliver him provisionally."
Although Interpol cannot arrange the arrest of an individual affected by a red warning, many Member States, according to the organisation, consider the red warning as a free letter for an arrest - to be carried out by the national police - especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case of Sweden and England where Assange is likely to stay.
Assange's lawyers, who published a letter in which they informed that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks is willing to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities by video conference.
They also recall that Assange requested the exit from Sweden and was compared to the prosecutor, who received the permission of Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Head of Security of Stalin.
"This is like a hunting, not a legal persecution," is charged in the letter.
While the world is looking for him - and his mother from Australia is crushed out of the innocence of her son - Assange stays in an unknown place, but not silent.
On Monday, he gave an interview to the head of the Time per Skype magazine from an indefinite place. During the conversation he requested the resignation of the U.S. State Secretary, Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be demonstrated that she was responsible for the order of North American diplomats to spy on the UN and thus violated international agreements signed by the US," he said.
His opinion was condemned yesterday by the press secretary of the White House, Robert Gibbs, who called the request for resignation "ridiculous and absurd."
"I'm not sure why we should value the opinion of a type with a website," he explained to the CNN station.
Obama himself has instructed a high responsibility for the anti-terrorism struggle, Rusell Travers, to prevent new document disclosures.
The attempt by the speaker of the presiding Barack Obama to pay less attention to Assange is contrary to the opinions expressed by conservative politicians and commentators these days.
Congressman Peter King, who will chair the National Security Committee of the House of Members from January, has asked the State Department to examine the possibility of putting Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organisations "to seize their funds and to track anyone who supports them or contributes to them."
Tom Flanagan, the Canadian President's advisor Stephen Harper, had gone further and had to revoke his statement that Assange had to be "murdered."
"Obama should turn him into a target and use an unmanned plane or something."
If you didn't apologize, Mike Huckabee, Baptist Minister, former Governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"Whoever it was who had information searched through the government, he is guilty of betrayal and everything that is not execution is too mild to punish," he explained to the Fox transmitter.
Puigcercós searches with an eye wink to the Carod near peace in the ERC
The Republican leader allows the party to hold a secret vote on his continued office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic government and the end of the full assembly principle.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe to avoid for the twentieth time an internal insurrection in the series of after the loss of 11 MEPs and half of the voters' voices directional ERC.
The chairman of the party is aware that his threat of resignation is not enough for the neighbours of former party leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira. But he also knows that the influence of this sector today is as weakened as its mentor itself and will not cause him the same headache as other former currents.
Therefore the leader of Esquerra tries to win the new critics with an eye wink, which would secure his position until the next municipal elections.
At the beginning of yesterday, it was announced that more than 200 ERC regional council members could express their views on their stay in office in secret.
With electoral notes, not with raised hand.
If the Carodists wanted to miss a penalty ticket to the President, they could do so without having to fear repression.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid both the impression of division and the impression of subjection among his person.
In several interviews he confirmed that he would feel unconfirmed with half of the votes plus one, and he added without indicating percentages, a result "in Bulgarian style" would not be good either.
The Carod neighbours demand more of the President than only the party to make his office available. An insufficient gesture because Puigcercós controls the top organ of the Congress.
However, since they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignation, they will agree with the Board of Directors a plan of action from now to May.
To this end, they expect to be able to participate in the drafting of the document on strategic remortisation that the management will be presented to the Council for voting on 18 June.
Their intention is to guarantee Puigcercós. In return, it is to promise to relocate the Congress in autumn 2011, which the party's pitch already thinks is a fact.
The chairman of the ERC is of the opinion that the "polyphony" is damaging to stability and he strives once and for all to enable the organization to wash their dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article signed by the acting Conseller Josep Huguet in his blog is symptomatic.
Given the fact that Puigcercós is an ideologist, the holder of Innovació considered it to be a fact that the party chairman "in exchange for various objectives."
He counted five, two of which are in the forefront.
Firstly, the "restructuring" of the board so that it represents at least 90 percent of the party members, that is to say the inclusion of new faces from Carod's environment.
The second could be the big news.
Huguet suggests that ERC should finally abandon the full assembly principle as a function.
In this way, he fears a reform of the Statute to enable the Congress to be held with elected delegates.
Puigcercós' team, who already fought for the last two congresses, is obsessed with the end of the full assembly model - an exception in the Spanish party system.
In fact, the party leadership at the meeting in 2008 was commissioned to review the principle of full assembly at a congress which should deal with the reform of the Statutes.
This date is still up, since the internal upheaval of recent years has not been advisable to deal with this matter.
Now, without the critical sector, the time could have come to reconsider and close this matter forever.

China maintains its targets to reduce greenhouse gases
China's representative stated at COP16 that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce carbon traces and it would maintain its offer to reduce 40 to 45 percent of its greenhouse gases by 2020.
China keeps its offer to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, Su Wei, the representative of this country at COP16.
At its first public appearance at the 16th World Climate Summit of the United Nations (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country would have made enormous efforts to reduce carbon traces and change its industry.
He stated that in the last four years his country has invested $245 million to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
On the other hand, he stated that China would not change its objectives, but would work with the international community on this matter.
He stated that the Chinese climate change strategy was divided into four aspects: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and support for pilot programmes.
In all aspects, progress has been made, including the adoption of a new energy law last year, which sets out the objectives of reducing gas emissions.
On the other hand, it emphasised that in China the authorities of the states had worked with those of the central state and the municipalities to achieve the objectives of energy saving, effective use of energy and reduction of emissions.
He also stated that several multiannual plans have already been launched or completed, both those financed by the Chinese Government and those that received money from other countries.
For example, he referred to the programme for the effective use of energy introduced over the last five years and received investments from the United Nations (UN), the government and from private hands.
He also said that there is a project on climate change at provincial level, another on the exchange of traditional bulbs through energy savings, and another on the weakening and adaptation of the system.
Martin Krol, a scientific government consultant on climate change in this country, confirmed that China's efforts were far greater than generally accepted.
He showed that the per capita emissions of greenhouse gases in China are six tonnes per person, while it is 100 tonnes in the United States. China is responsible for a nine percent total contribution to environmental pollution.
It also makes unprecedented progress in the field of energy use. Energy efficiency has been increased by 20 percent over the last five years and a further increase is expected by 2020, he said.
Legal exclusion Espinos: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN stated that the former Panist party chairman had the right to refer to the National Regulatory Commission and to ask what the right to grant him.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espino Barrientos had been legal and that the former party chairman of the PAN had the right to refer to the National Regulatory Commission and to ask what the right to grant him.
In an interview that took place before the complainant, Gabino Cué Monteagudos was the governor of the State, he stated that Espinos was excluded by a decision taken at local level.
"It is an independent decision of the Ordinance Commission in Sonora."
"Mr Espino has the right to refer to the Comisión de Orden del Consejo Nacional in his case in order to make a decision by a competent body," he added.
On the other hand, he stated that it was not time to think about 2012 and that an alliance with presidential candidates had never been on the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that Acción Nacional was strengthened by the internal vote on the next 4 and 5 December, where his successor was elected.
"This (a alliance in 2012) is a topic that was never on the negotiating table, at least not so far. It was a pretext for the municipal election, he was successful and fulfilled his purpose," he said.
The Panist leader explained that the PAN looks back on 71 years of dialogue, so "does not scare us from internal competition; on the contrary," we enjoy it and it strengthens us, "he commented.
He said that the Council would undoubtedly elect the President or the best chairman that Acción Nacional would need for the next three years, and that is why he would give the staff "to those who the Council would decide."
"I am completely unconcerned and open. I would be proud to transfer each of the five to the office of the party chairman."
He predicted that the upturn of the party in the last elections of 4 July would be reflected in the next elections, although "it was not time to think about 2012."
"Now it's about supporting Governor Gabino Cué in his task."
In this context, he pointed out that the three governments that emerged from alliances between Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa, are carrying the flag and being observed throughout the country. Therefore, "many hopes and desires are put into them and I am sure Gabino is at the level of the requirements."
When he was questioned about the PRI's criticism of President Felipe Calderón for his discourse in his four-year government, César Nava called upon the PRI's supporters to think about the six-year period of former Presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón, they should start defending them, they should finally come out of the closet," he confirmed.
He believes that the holder of the federal government can make expressions like those he could make in his discourse at Auditorio Nacional, because in this country there would be no mouthforbidding and even less a censorship.
Obama is in Twitter for the law for undocumented students
"If you are in favour of the adoption of the Dream Act - law, then call your senators and press for the adoption of this law," the President of the United States twittered in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today supported the country-wide mobilisation to support the Dream Act - Law on legalising undocumented students with a message on his personal blog in the social network Twitter.
"If you are in favour of the adoption of the Dream Act - law, then call your senators and press for the adoption of this law," twittered Obama.
His brief communication contains a cyberlink to a more comprehensive document which calls on the public to contact less than its senators, as the vote of the law is immediately coming.
"With your voice we are waiting for, the time has come to listen to you," he emphasises.
The message was disseminated after the 42 Republican Senators called on to block all the votes for each law, except the extension of the tax reductions from the times of Bush and the financing of the government would be extended.
Such a blockade, which was announced on a letter signed by the 42 Republican Senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act - Law and other projects such as the ratification of the new START agreement with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
On the blockade of the Republicans of the Dream Act and other projects, President Robert Gibbs said he trusted that, once the tax issue was resolved, a timetable could be drawn up for the other projects.
"I think we have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that tax matters must be settled before the end of the year..."
"I believe that we can reach an agreement on this at any time and then we can plan the end of the rest," he said.
The chairman of the democratic majority in the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that "he would request the vote at the end of the debate," so that the Dream Act - law with which the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted in the Senate from next Thursday, although next week would be more likely.
The version of the Dream Act - the law or the law of the American dream would legalize about 800 000 young people who emigrated into the United States when they were not sixteen years old, while the last five years have lived in this country and have been registered in a higher education institution or in the army.
But the advocates of the law need sixty votes to adopt the initiative, which is why they are dependent on the voices of a handful of Republicans. Currently, the organizations of the intercessors of this project are organising an intensive influence on the adoption of the law.
The Democrats, of which the majority support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, one of them, Senator Ben Nelson from Nebraska, said he would vote against it and only one Republican, Richard Lugar from Indiana, announced his support for the law.
Therefore, the defenders of Dream Act must get several Republicans on their side if other Democrats should decide to turn the initiative back.
Among the most converted Republicans are Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as Senator George Lemieux from Florida, who took over the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who in the past supported the Dream Act are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas, but they declared that they would no longer support it at another opportunity.
Another Republican who had voted in favour of the law, John McCain, has not yet established his position.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act in the Senate is facing the greatest obstacles.
Put your finger in the wound with literature
The second round of 'The Lust in the Language' was a walk in which the participants made themselves strong for the narrative
"I understand that with sex in the language, but... The finger in the wound? What is expected of me?," asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela, who should open the second round of 'Los loces de la lengua', a cycle that celebrated the Spanish language literature and at this occasion used the subtitles of her question (at another event the round table was dedicated to sex in the language, she said).
The finger in the wound... "brings us in trouble," the Argentinian writer sweetened to the audience, which consisted mainly of young people who met at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) to attend this round table moderated by Marisol Shultz, at which Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero attended.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that she devoted to Gonzalo Celorio, and then characterized the shultz as a great story. Luisa tells in first person and is the protagonist who is looking for what is a "wound," and goes from a doctor to a doctor, of which she does not receive an answer, but notes for the guide of her narration.
The infectologist is convinced: "Patience is not my strength, perhaps this is my wound."
Finally, after a frustrating approach to the traumatologists who robbed her in the middle of the corridor, and who explains to her that wound is not a scientific term, the psychoanalyst reveals the secret: "the wound is the real open, the symbolic is the scar."
The main figure of the narrative makes it easier and concludes that "it only learned from the wound that it is truly open and not exists." But it is convinced that the desire for language and their traps are mixed.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a lovely story that he called "Praise of Invention," and in which the finger in the wound is not mentioned but discovered.
With inspirations to magical realism, he tells of a famous magician who touched the clouds, brought back far-ripe men or restored the virtue lost by a girl. The story made a turning turn and reported of America, the great novel that was not missing from the beginning to his own chronists, and he quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticized the flooding of the stories of the conquerors.
"Cervantes, who invited us all (the writers), spotted the presumptuous witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as true, but in other ways the history of America would never have been told - with imagination that even disappeared the feeling of shame."
However, he emphasises that "it is the insane and liars who best imagine things," and there reality and lie are approaching each other, where one no longer knows which side the story belongs to, where fictional literature reaches the summit.
He actually calls this the 'tradition Cervantes'.
"We inherited from him to be what is told."
When Mayra Montero was on the line, the writer commented and praised the variety of interpretations to which the invitation of the FIl to the round table 'The finger in the wound' had contributed.
The Cuban and Puertorican devoted their contribution to the great wound of social violence that affects their country - like Latin America as a whole - as a result of the struggle for drug trafficking.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a silent, unintentionally planned commitment," she explained, after having emphasized that literature is communication and accountability that builds up between the author and the readers as with a "chemical reaction."
In the evening, the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose contribution was also "this finger of the dedicated writer in the wound of the writer."
He noticed that in a fast-lived world, the intellectual habits and the control of consciousness also run into dogmatism, and will forget that "behind every confirmation there is a little no and behind every denial a little yes."
"To be in possession of our thoughts and reality, we need to nuance: and nuance often means putting the finger into the wound and harassing those who feel much more comfortable when thinking in the form of cartoons, in black and white, in prefabricated ideas without nuances, and also harassing the powerful who prefer to share the world in black and white, he noticed and invited to discover a sense of writing.
Romano struggles for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano looks back at three defeats in final games, he has experienced ops and abs in his career, but three times he played decisive games.
In addition, the duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the final game is two different styles, given by their respective trainers, and their encounter marked by contrasts is reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano looks back at three defeats in final games, he has experienced ops and abs in his career, but three times he has had decisive games, and so far he has been good, why this opportunity is of great importance to him.
The Argentinean has played up with the medal to the second champion, he has stayed behind the winners and surprisingly he has played with the same team successive final games.
The santistic strategy reached the first final game as a trainer at the Torneo Apertura 2002, when del Morelia had the trains in hand with which he experienced a great defeat against Toluca with 4-2; later, at the 'Clausura 2003' he reached the decisive duel that he also lost with 3-1 against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna on the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010', where they played against Los Diablos, Rubén had to put a retreat again as the game with 2-2 against Los Choriceros went undecided after 210 game minutes, but at the eleven meter he came forward with 3-1 and got two ways to stick his title, but ultimately three of his players missed the eleven steps and the game turned to a 4-3.
Rubén had already lost two final games with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his great rival. Therefore, he does not want to be persecuted again by the misfortune and free himself from the evil spell to celebrate a title for the first time, although he confirms that for him the most important is the game itself.
"I want to be champion, I don't want to break statistics, that's for a club, for my affection that I give up, and that's why the title will come to me, but what happens before is the most important thing," the controller commented when he was questioned about the lost final games.
The last final game has remained strong in his memory, he's assured to have learned a lot of it: "The only lesson that we can draw from it is that until the arbitrator does not peep the end, we can't celebrate, we are prepared on the line, the players too, because the last time we were prepared with two eleven meters already to exit, and I believe that this is a lesson until the game is not finished, there is no occasion to celebrate."
To know that this series could be decided by eleven meters, he does not worry, because he trusts his players: "One never wants to arrive at eleven meters, one wants to finish in the regular playtime, but sometimes there is no alternative and one has to be prepared for, in the previous tour we were prepared, but unfortunately the fate prepared us a bad game, sometimes due to nervousness or the intense endeavour to keep the title in the hands that left us something for this final game, and we hope that this time it will not happen."
It is in Romanso's power not to be only second champion anymore and to cost for the first time the glory that the titles bring.
The US changes the rules for obtaining a visa
Persons must introduce themselves to the Consulate for a visa application prior to their conversation; the costs will be reduced in this way.
As of 10 January 2011, the procedures for applying for a visa will change in the United States Embassy and in the consulates.
In the new procedure, most applicants have to introduce themselves to the Visit Application Services (ASC, the initial letters in English) prior to their consultation at the Consulate.
The staff of the ASC shall record the applicant's biometric data, which shall be verified by the consulate prior to the discussion.
The new procedure has certain advantages for the aspirants, including:
The total costs for the management of the visa are reduced because it is no longer necessary to pay separately the date agreement, the processing of the visa application and the transport service with which the document is issued.
The applicant shall make only one payment covering the three services.
The current price remains unchanged: the counter value of 140 dollars for a tourist visa, 150 dollars for visas with application (including visas for temporary workers) and 390 dollars for hands and investors.
Those who wish to extend their visa only do not have to have a conversation in the consulate; they only have to imagine the next ASC where they present their documents and their fingerprints are taken.
Since the biometric data are collected in the ASC, applicants requiring a second date for the consultation at the consulate remain less time than before.
Those who apply for the visa in the consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo no longer have to pay the $26 service supplement.
Additional information on the new visa application procedure can be found on the following website: http: / / mexico.usembassy.gov / boletines / sp101201 _ Visas-FAQs.html
NASA announces the fund of alien life
The North American Space Agency called for a press conference to present tomorrow a fund that will have an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The United States National Aviation and Space Authority (NASA) announces an astrobiological discovery tomorrow, Thursday, which could confirm the theory of the existence of alien life.
The Fund will be presented tomorrow at 1: 00 at a press conference in the office of NASA in Washington by experts in astrobiology, a science that examines the origin, development, distribution and future of life in the universe.
When the press conference was convened, NASA assured that it would present "a supervising fund for looking for foreign life," which triggered speculation among experts from other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that it could exist in hostile environments that have been considered to be inhabited so far human beings. It was the hypothesis that they could transform into intelligent beings - like humans - if their living conditions improved.
Apparently, it is a microbe found on the ground of the Mono Lake in the Yosemite National Park, California. It lives there in an environment that was considered too toxic for all possible forms of life, as the lake is highly arsenic.
In some way, the microbie uses the arsenic as a survival resource. Taking into account this ability, it increases the chances that there could be similar life on other planets that do not have our protective atmosphere.
When these organisms change the arsenic, according to the astrobiologists, it has been demonstrated that "there is actually another form of life, a second form of life that differs from the one we know."
The Space Agency will announce the actual scope of its funds tomorrow, on Thursday, at the press conference.
At the conference, the Geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who investigates the possibility of life on Mars, studied the biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who studied Titan (the largest moon of Saturn) under the question whether his chemical composition is similar to the Earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patrón form an opposition block
The reform of the institutional law through the Congress will introduce the two-party system, they complain.
The 60th legislature had just begun, and an opposition block was already installed, led by the members of the PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who presented themselves as an independent person. The four questioned the following: the entry of the 'two-party system' into the chamber.
Before the introduction to the 60th legislature period, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of the PRD and Patrón Montalvo contended with the reform of the body law, as they would be excluded.
With this reform, they repeated, a 'two-party system' would be introduced, because now it would be two people, the same number as parties that controlled the Congress.
These four members, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, the coordinator of the PRD, were the only members who voted against the Bureau chaired by the Panist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca in his capacity as deputy chairman.
Corvera Quevedo stated that the parties PRI and PAN had institutionally introduced their political outline with these reforms.
He stated that in the next few days they would talk to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme, and that if they hadn't, they would be subjugated by both parties, which would put an end to the opposition coalition.
"Until now I come (the opposition coalition), that is what I see, because we are excluded from all decisions that do not even reject the opinion of the others."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia stated that there were agreements with PRD, PT and Patrón and that therefore a pluralist group would be formed.
It cannot be allowed, he continued that the Congress, after being monopolistic, should now be "duopolistic."
"It is not the spirit of law reform that a permanent two-party system should rule in the Congress."
"For the beginning, this group starts with five Members and they speak with other colleagues to become more," said the Convergencia member.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza from the PT argued that the Congress has now turned into a 'prey' for two.
"Before it was only one party, now they split it up to two."
Mr Patrón Montalvo requested that Members be respected and given their place to the negotiating tables.
"It must not be left outside because of top five decisions, which are likely to be nine Members, and the five that are currently seen as being split up into different political groups, have decided to unite in order to take our place at the negotiating table, because due to the reform that has been carried out and agreed on by the others, we have stayed outside and we do not agree with this reform."
200 000 Peso more for "the supplier"
The city administration of Mazatlán pays another check to the controversial owner of the company for electrical material.
Another check on something more than 200 000 Peso in favour of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the city administration.
This means that the sum paid to the owner of the company for electrical material in the second half of the year is 1 200 000 pesos.
According to the page for greater transparency of the city administration, this check was issued to a amount of 200.144,56 Peso with number 9258447 last November with the purpose of "offset bills."
The treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had already sent forward that more money from the community would go to this supplier. She is observed by the Auditoría Superior del Estado because she sold at overpriced prices.
What has not been mentioned is the total amount still owed to her and consequently the number of checks still issued in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
"Nothing was bought with her, it was simply paid the debts, just as with the other suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks "appeared" again in the last quarter of the year: 24 September, two from 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and this last from 16 November.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal as required by law when a company is questioned by the ASE in order to avoid other administrations applying for its services, the treasurer assured that its services would not be reused.
After publishing the review of the cheques issued by the city administration to its suppliers on July 25, the newspaper Noroeste announced that, from March 2008 to July 9, 2010 during the three-year term of office of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the municipality had paid over 10 million pesos with 42 cheques to Camacho Palazuelos.
There was also business with Jumapam where she introduced cheques worth over 3 million pesos.
Tourism places need to be improved
Tourism companies regret the accident of foreign tourists due to the poor state of Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourists into the collapse of Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the tourism industry of Mazatlán requested to pay special attention to the authorities, the areas which are in a bad state and which give a bad image to the port city.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, chairman of the distributor association of the Zona Dorada, reminded us that at different occasions it was called for to maintain the destination and to transform the bad conditions that tourists find in new employment opportunities or routes.
He said that the bad condition of roads and trails had had a negative effect since the tourists came to wear and saw the disorder, and then they would turn their backs to the nearby shops.
"The politicians do not know what it means to have to close a business one day and they do not worry about how much money you lose, because otherwise they would not carry out construction in this way slowly and planlessly."
The hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the crash of the tourists would have highlighted the lack of prevention and the lack of maintenance from the city side.
"The community must take on its responsibility and avoid that something like this happens again. How to do that? Well, by a preventive maintenance instead of improving everything afterwards," he said.
"We are deliberately waiting to have a clean city. Because not only because it is a tourist area, it must be maintained, even we residents have a right to a clean habitat. The city administration must change its strategy to maintain the city in a good condition."
"There are other places that also look uncared and unfinished," he said, "for example el Escudo y el Venadito of Mazatlán."
"Nowadays we need more than just advertising to attract tourists. A good product must be offered, a city that cleans its beaches and streets and keeps the tourist attractions constantly in fire," he added.
"These arrangements have not been given enough attention and this kind of incidents just put what is obvious to everyone: maintenance is urgently needed."
Raúl Llera Martínez, Sub-Secretary of Promoción Turística, expressed the importance of saving the tourist places of Mazatlán, because they were not properly used and caused a bad image to emerge.
He mentioned a number of places that would have to be brought to front with the city. To make the city clean, proper and attractive for tourism should be a priority.
"Fortunately, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites that need to be cleaned up and cleaned first to make them attractive for tourism and add them to the inventory with which we are recruiting for this destination.
IP calls for results from the Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CCE, proposed that Members take the great responsibility to give a model for a better Sinaloa, which is facing many challenges.
The business industry of Mazatlán calls for a worthy Parliament, free of agreements, to twist the parties and the government, because Sinaloa is upset and is facing major problems.
Yesterday the 60th Parliament was inaugurated. It consists of seven political forces, 19 PRI Members, 13 PAN, three of Partido Nueva Alianza, two of PRD, one of PT, one of Convergencia and one of PVEM. That makes up a total of 40 people.
The new members of the State Congress are expected to do a cleaner job, feel committed to society and to the different social groups that are dependent on responsible parliamentary work, and do not repeat the same patterns of partiality and paternalism.
Eduardo Dávalos, Chairman of the CCE Enterprise Coordination Council, proposed that the new Members take the great responsibility to provide a model for a better Sinaloa, which is facing many challenges.
"We hope that Members will truly exercise their right to act freely from agreements between the parties, because it is common for them to enter into agreements with which they represent their own interests, transforming them into carnival complements of the governments and leaders of the parliamentary groups."
He said that they should demonstrate their commitment to building the necessary bridges to support the current government.
"We take care that they carry out a trustworthy work and work for society and their groups above all, because it was the inhabitants of Sinaloa who expressed their trust in the last elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the hotel association Tres Islas, believes that one of the major challenges facing the 40 people's representatives is the drive and joint work for the state's economic growth, because today the economic situation is extremely complicated.
"The most important thing is that they stimulate economic growth, create investment incentives and infrastructure measures, which will in some way promote job creation."
With regard to the tourism sector, he called on the new Members to assign the necessary importance to the Ministry of Tourism in the state budget.
"I understand that it is the Ministry with the second least funds. This is incompatible with an important economic activity that brings foreign exchange and investment into the country and is in direct competition with the agri-industry."
Tourism projects must be allocated funds, public security must be supported and the alcohol law, which has not been revised in previous legislative periods, needs to be updated.
Holy King is searched
Puppets, cars, bicycles and other toys wish the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family seemingly.
It will be difficult for parents to meet these wishes on the next three days, because the household is no more and not less than twelve people and a goat buck.
Yet Adelaida, Isabel, Jesus, José Alfredo, Maria Guadalupe, Isaias, José Juan and Miguel do not give up the hope that Melchior, Caspar and Balthasar will give them the toys and garments they so desire.
The family lives in a modest house in the settlement of Salvador Allende. They live from hand to mouth, because the father has no fixed work.
"Sometimes hard times are announced because my husband has no job. But we sell mandarins and potatoes... Even in the afternoon I go with the gourns to sell on the street," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
The four-year-old Adelaida would like a doll or a bike, while her three-year-old sister Isabel wants a barbie doll.
The ten-year-old José Alfredo has been wanting a 'monster car' for some time and for its eight-month-old brother Jesus proposes Cayetana clothing in size for one-year-olds.
"(José Alfredo) said to me, 'I would love this monster', but I answered him, 'Let's wait, boy', because it was very expensive, 'Cayetana remembered sad.
For the elderly children who were in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
The eleven-year-old María Guadalupe has size 12; the ten-year-old Isaiah has size 10, while the eight-year-old Miguel has size 8.
The 14-year-old José Juan lacks tennis shoes. A pair of size 5 1 / 2 or 6 would be very helpful.
If you want to help realize the dreams of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family, you can participate in the campaign 'Holy King is wanted' by donating a toy or cash in the reception hall of the newspaper Noroeste.
14 suspected drug dealers arrested
On Wednesday, in the context of the destruction of a production and sales network of cannabis, the ten house searches were carried out in the administrative region of Estria.
Fourteen people were arrested and will be brought against various charges.
The house searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, where they were supposed to have served mainly in the manufacture of drugs.
"About 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of haschisch, cash and equipment that have served production have been confiscated," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, Speaker of Quebec Security Police.
In total, eleven men and three women were arrested, two of whom were considered to be the main wires of the drug ring from Sherbrooke.
The arrested persons should have appeared in Sherbrooke hours after they were arrested.
They could be accused, inter alia, of the accusation of the production of cannabis, the possession of cannabis for sales purposes, the complement and the service of crime.
These house searches had taken place as a result of a long-term investigation, which took place for over a year.
"The information received from the public has enabled us to carry out these arrests," Mr Ruel specified.
Around the 70 police officers of the Estria Regional Investigation Unit of the Quebec Security Police, the Sherbrooke Police Department and the Memphrémagog Police Department had participated in this police operation.
The secret immigration could be pursued without difficulty
The draft law of the Conservatives, which, according to the government, is intended to deal with the problem of ships loaded with secret immigrants, will probably be dropped in after the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they cannot support the proposal.
"I strongly reject this Charter."
"I am holding with a party that has put your feet on your feet," said Michael Ignatieff, head of the Liberals, after the end of the weekly Caucus meeting in front of the assembled Members.
The Liberals argued that the draft law allowing each person identified as a transport of illegal immigrants to be held for up to one year violates the Canadian constitution of law and freedom.
Gilles Duceppe, head of the Bloc Québécois, also pointed out that he could not support the draft law as he turned against the wrong target group.
"We are opposed and it seems that all opposition parties are opposed, so we will wait for what the government is doing," said M. Duceppe.
The criticism of the issue of immigration by Olivia Chow, NDP, has rejected the critics who demand that their party is not resistant enough to the secret immigrants.
"The Neo-Democrats agree to take action against the blind passengers, and that is exactly what we are trying to do by means of another draft law, the C-35," Chow suggested.
We are therefore not in favour of the draft Conservative Act because it seeks the guilt of refugees and keeps children captive for at least a year, "said Chow.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused opposition parties of playing with politics and ignoring Canadians' will.
"The Canadians urgently inform Members that they do not tolerate this kind of secret immigration, these criminal actions affecting Canada and treating the country as a footprinter."
"They expect Canada to take hard action," said Minister Kenneys's response.
"The government has not announced a vote of confidence regarding its draft law which could have led the country to elections that the government had rejected.
However, a conservative said to the QMI agency that the government would call for a vote so that every opponent would immediately declare himself to his voters.
The new unit does not find unanimity
Despite the announcement by Jean Charest of the possible creation of a new, standing unit to combat corruption and collusion, many observers continue to demand the creation of a public investigation committee on this issue.
Robert Dutil, Minister of Public Security, claims that this idea did not come from yesterday: Quebec had already consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this issue last January.
The Metropolis have had a standing unit against corruption since 1870.
Nevertheless, the announcement of Wednesday has surprised more than just one.
It must be said that this measure was not discussed at the meeting of the Quebecer Police Service Permanent Committee on 29 October last year despite the presence of Robert Dutils.
Nor was it missing that Stéphane Bergeron, critic and member of the party Québécois, qualified this announcement in terms of public security as "rabbits embedded from the hat" and "at a table-end properly based solution."
On the other hand, Minister Dutil had turned to those who fear that political power has too much influence on the concerned future unity.
"You will see the result when we will announce it," he welcomed reaffirming.
"One is aware of this problem."
According to Réjean Parent, the President of the CSQ, nothing can replace the conduct of a public survey.
"The more M. Charest insists on preventing the formation of this investigation committee, the more people like you and I think he has something to hide," he explained.
"The only way to form a committee of inquiry is to resign Jean Charest," said Yves Boisvert, Professor of Ethics and Political Systems at ENA (State University for the Training of High Administrative Officials).
In order to get out of this dead end, he proposed to the Quebec to give financial audit control a special mandate in order to enable it to carry out appropriate investigations on corruption and secret agreements.
"One should be able to extend the mandate of audit control," he decided.
He also believes that the Quebec could grant the same power as Commissioners, which would allow you to commit people to testify.
The formation of a standing unit is not the only project in the Charest government drawers.
The Quebec will also require Ottawa to amend the Criminal Law accordingly in order to be better placed on this kind of crime.
This demand comes from the Supreme Attorney General of Operation Marteau, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law in this kind of prosecution is not clear.
Vic Toews, Minister of State for Public Security, confirmed his colleague of Justice, Rob Nicholson, at the moment with certain novellifications relating to this dossier.
During Operation Printemps 2001, which concerned the groups of motorcycle police officers, 131 people had been arrested, although the Criminal Law had not been revised.
Ottawa has thus enforced the law against gangsterism.
Rivers under strict surveillance
Several river flows remain under strict surveillance due to the high defeats that have occurred since Tuesday in some regions of the province.
In Shawinigan, in the administrative region of Mauricie, there was an earthquake on Wednesday afternoon.
Two houses were evacuated preventively.
In the evening, another earthquake occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in the Lanaudiere administrative region.
A road has fallen into itself.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, strong rainfall from 40 to 70 milliliters of rainfall occurred in several regions.
From 20 to 40 millimeter further precipitation was expected here according to the regions until Thursday evening.
The areas north of the river as well as the valley of the Outaouais region were most affected.
Here a total of up to 100 millimeters of rainfall had gone down.
Since the snow melting which has already accumulated in certain sub-areas is still to be added to these defeats, there is a fear of the crossing of several watercourses.
On Wednesday evening, the Quebecer Security Service warned about the flood alarm concerning the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in the Lanaudiere region.
The river flows in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentine mountains and the Chêne in Lotbinière become the object of the flood monitoring and remain under observation.
In the Lanaudière region, the violent defeat has led to the crossing of some lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and also in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte a bridge was torn out due to the strong rainfall.
Ten residents had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In Outaouais the crossing of certain lakes caused the closure of several roads, especially in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The security service remains in alert and monitors the situation closely, according to Security Council Annik Bouchard.
On Wednesday, the Quebecer landing water centre issued warnings of the strong rise of several rivers, especially from Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partially attributed
The Quebecer Radio Moderator Stéphane Dupont has been partially reversed in front of the Canadian Board of Supervisors for Radio Standards (CCNR) because of its controversial statements on social care and Haitians, as well as because of its phrase on radio.
The CCNR considers that Mr Dupont and his CHOI 98,1 FM team would have had the right to their own opinion, but certain statements would have "inaccurate information on social care and unjustified negative representations of the Haitians as well as such unsolicited speeches that are not appropriate to the broadcasts broadcast during the day."
The Supervisory Board had also concluded that a discussion on suicide involving the dissemination of the names of two persons who committed suicide violates the Code of Transmission.
The CCNR had received several complaints concerning the comments made during the consignments issued in 2008 and 2010.
The first order was filed following a complaint by the "Front commun des personnes assistées sociales du Québec."
The activist organisation had complained that the amounts mentioned in the consignment were inaccurate.
Moderators should rather provide solid information as misleading information.
With regard to the issue of suicide, moderator Stéphane Dupont felt that suicide was an expression of cowardice.
The majority of members of the Supervisory Board had concluded that the message provided was that suicide should not be regarded as a solution to life crises.
"The majority of the Supervisory Board takes into account that the effects of the Dupont le midi consignment in question would have addressed a sensitive topic in a family-friendly and appropriate manner."
Therefore, he was occupied with no tadel to his person.
The last point of dispute concerned the statements that were related to the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had given themselves a media-effective dispute discussion that caused a lot of reactions.
The CHOI moderator had declared that he had not donated in favour of Haiti's aid, as one would not know with certainty whether the needy would actually receive the money donations.
The Supervisory Board considers that these comments had not been abusive characters, but that their cumulative effect presents an unjustified negative representation of the Haitians.
"I have already deferred my three-day suspension penalty on this matter."
"My file has been virgin for a year and a half," said the moderator.
In all decisions, the Supervisory Board is pronouncing the dissemination of an unpraised expression.
In all cases, the CHOI-FM has acted "beyond its obligations."
The consequences for the broadcasters, which, among other things, had to report their decisions once during the main broadcasting period within a period of three days, are minor.
A king of King Fu in Montreal
Nacereddine Zemmal, Montrealer Algerian Origin, has taken a very special course.
The athlete, brilliant in "Sanda" (full contact Kung-Fu), in kickboxing and in Thai boxing, now rises in search of new challenges to the Tatami and to the boxing rings of the world.
"I started 12 years ago in Algeria with combat sports such as Kung-Fu and Kickboxen," said Zemmal, who has been established in the Metropolis since 2008 to develop among the professionals.
Personally, I am looking for the battle of all places, because for those who do not like the ground struggle, as the mixed arts present it, are rational competitions in North America. "
Recently, the person who worked as a security officer as well as the company UPS had given his rival bad news, in which he received the World Karate's two gold medals and the Kickboxing Association (WKA) at the World Carate World Championship between October 23 and 30 in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I have won the victory in the categories of full contact kickbox and Thai box," he explained.
"I am currently preparing for the world pocal in San Shou in China."
"The fighters from each category who had placed themselves at the last World Championship were invited to the first four."
"I got babe in Toronto Bronze in 2009."
"In 2005, I became a chase in Vietnam."
"In 2007, I finished the tournament in China in the fifth place while I became third in Toronto in 2009," he added.
"It is worth mentioning that I have made progress in every competition."
"With this rhythm I will be first this time or next year!"
"San Shou" or "Sanda" are disciplines of origin from China, in which fountains and footsteps as well as ground throats are permitted.
The two fights usually play on a platform, rarely in a boxing ring.
The most renowned boxer from this kind of combat sport is the American Vietnamese origin Cung Le, who is well known in the world of fighting arts.
If Nacer Zemmal kept only one event in his career, he would definitely call his presence here at the Super-tournament "King of Sanda," the Super Bowl of the King-Fu.
"This competition is the highest and most respected in China," explained the sympathetic penguin.
"It is a bit like the equivalent of the stadium Lumpinee (the largest stadium of Thailand)."
"That was a super experience."
Zemmal had won his first fight in the semi-final of his category (80kg) before he lost in the final.
"The one who defeated me was a real professional," he analyzed.
"There are four divisions per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg)."
"The winners of the semifinals meet each other in the final of their category."
"Then the winners of each category offer themselves the forehead to crown a single champion, the king of King Fu."
450 million in contracts without tender
Hydro-Québec has agreed to grant 450 million dollars to project planning companies for the hydroelectric project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
A consortium, consisting of BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, has received the most important share, namely that of the project manager, of a total of 295 million dollars without a tender.
This consortium, called "Énergie gérance," was formed in 2004 as a follow-up to the decision of Hydro-Québec, the private sector's responsibility to convey this important hydroelectric project to a sum of $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium "Énergie gérance" gained the lucrative contract without a public tender.
For the Québécois party, recurrence to business consortia is a serious ethical problem which causes the risk of distortion of competition and price increases.
"This is a new way of a discarded game and discourages competition."
"This means that instead of mapped games, instead of being carried out in a secret way in an open form," said Sylvain Simard, PQ Member, yesterday at the press conference.
In the early morning, Simard had raised the question before the National Assembly, because it seems difficult to understand how public interest can be served in this way.
Resource Minister Nathalie Normandeau had responded to it in the afternoon by expressing a strong agreement that this contract would have been a shorter game.
"I remain faithful to my line," she weathed by confirming that the PQ has been "unfair" and "she has a lack of hardness."
She said it was "the least" that the PQ would apologize.
The model of the consortium is a common practice worldwide.
It is usually such a temporary alliance that allows two or more companies to bundle their experts with regard to a bid to an invitation to tender for a complex project.
The Eastmain project has a high level of complexity in terms of its work size.
The construction process is under way and is scheduled to be set up by 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without any competition; there had already been negotiations.
In addition, the model of the consortium in Quebec is no longer an exception even for relatively simple projects.
As the newspaper "Le Devoir" last week noted, the model of the consortium used in the field of engineering and consultancy is the subject of government investigation.
A short crossing of the Quebecer business register allows to designate more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to be of constant duration.
In this way, for example, Dessau works in partnership with the majority of its core competitors, including CIMA +, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin or Roche and Tecsult.
Any link, and there are several dozens of them, leads back to the same legal person, namely Dessau.
As regards the consortium "Énergie gérance," Minister Normandeau has stressed that "the territory of Baie James is subject to special labour dynamics and that Hydro-Québec has been paying special attention to this fact since the 1970s."
Réal Laporte, the great employer of Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has made a declaration that the project management contract has been approved by agreement.
"If you make an invitation to tender and there are only a few candidates, your prices will be fast."
"So you have two options: either you take the people who are on this mart and tell you: you will negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price."
"However, the idea is that not the price is crucial, but the expertise of the people," confirmed Laporte.
This contract granted to the Consortium "Énergie gérance" is part of a long list of contracts of more than 50,000 received by the Party of Québécois.
The contracts were approved either by Hydro-Québec or by SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After review, the newspaper "Le Devoir" counted more than 100 engineering and consultancy contracts which were approved by companies or their branches, including resource laboratories, between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC-Lavalin had entered into 22 contracts, Génivar had received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without including their participation in "Énergie gérance."
All these contracts have been negotiated.
They totalled 449 783 344 $, including the contract with "Énergie gérance" over 295 131 564 $.
Sylvain Simard had assumed that the four companies that formed the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) were well known by the "Parti libéral du Québec."
Minister Normandeau had made it clear that the PQ was equally linked to the companies they "financed" before she clarified that it was rather their managers.
Barometer responsible consumer - The "green" label is not trusting
Green, but unspoiled scepticism.
Quebecer Consument has little confidence in the main players in sustainable growth, but also in the marked brands or eco-labels to control its choice.
It is a shame, although it is bathing in a media-efficient universe, where it is only so wimping from information for a more responsible consumer: the barometer of responsible consumers has to complain of a lack of credible information, an inadequacy which makes itself known as a brake of its commitment, as demonstrated by the first reading held yesterday.
Although they have promoted the consumption of so-called socially tolerable products in 2010, the Quebecer still seem to pay little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two-thirds of the Quebecer population admits to give no faith to the environmental union of the companies as much as to the green commercial advertising, so the measuring instrument that is scattered by the responsible consumer centre of the University of Sherbrooke betrays.
Another finding: half of consumers doubt the reliability of the official certificates attached to the allegedly fair products, but also the credibility of the products and brands that declare themselves environmentally conscious, such as the barometer.
According to the same pattern, only 14.6% of the Quebecer population takes the discourse of politicians on this subject seriously.
However, the information on responsible consumption seems important to stimulate this consumption segment, which is currently being revived by almost one third of Quebecer consumers.
Indeed, empty and doubtful nature of the information diminished the zeal of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the barometer after the higher price of the products.
Moreover, one third of the Quebecer's declared performance of the green products and services that they are trying to put to their hands is misguided.
According to another communication, more than half of consumers had changed their habits in 2010 and mainly changed the brand of one or more products to express their conviction.
According to barometers, they had also preferred 61% purchases from dealers of their urban area and preferred the purchase of food built in their region.
Green and responsible - the index of environmentally conscious consumption had reached 64 of the maximum value of 100 this year - the Quebec's homo consumer loves to present himself as king of recycling, who tries to reduce its traces left in the environment by taking care of animal welfare.
However, social and environmental awareness seems to stop before his car, as the barometer: just 28% of the Quebecer have indicated, used public transport in 2010 or preferred the driving centre to demonstrate their ecological interest.
The admission and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of participants in this comprehensive behavioural survey, which fits the Climate Perceptions.
State borrowing for the acquisition of eXcentris
The Quebecer Government, which was invited by the Société Angus and the company Parallèle to participate financially in the acquisition of the cinema complex eXcentris, agrees with cooperation but only in the form of a competitive loan.
The development company Angus as well as the company Parallèle, who had hoped for a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to acquire the cinema complex eXcentris belonging to Daniel Langlois on the Boulevard Saint-Laurent in order to restore it to its actual cineastic function, obviously does not get what they have requested.
Although the government has accepted to engage in this matter, it is under its own conditions.
Instead of the expected donation, the Quebecer government offers a bond at a lower level than initially expected, which could create a viable solution on favourable conditions, at least in the opinion of the sources that can be removed from the state rumours.
A first action plan and a request for 12.8 million had already been rejected last spring by the Quebec, the request has been corrected again summarically downwards.
A proposal along with an action plan has already been sent by the President of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), François Macerola, to Minister St. Pierre, which is the leader of the eXcentris Act.
Several days ago, he had sent her a final report of facts.
However, the counter proposal of the Cabinet was sent to SODEC on Wednesday.
Parallèle and Angus now have until 31 December time to answer them.
In any case, the premise of state donation seems to have been really pushed aside.
Let us recall that the Quebecer ownership community of cinemas and cinemas had oppressed a direct state investment to support the acquisition of eXcentris by submitting the argument that the Cultural Minister had no financial support for real estate projects there that he did not also allow other cinemas.
However, several other market participants in the segment complained, contrary to this, of substantial economic aid.
After the self-financed construction of the cinema over ten years, director Daniel Langlois had presented the autocinema in the premises of his cinema complex with great difficulties, which could justify the state's exceptional position.
The lack of cinemas that show independent films is more than obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris knew to keep his clients at the bar.
The Société Angus, as well as the company Parallèle with Christian Yaccarini at the top, manage a privately funded campaign on their part, hoping for a sum of $700 000 to stimulate the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one screen continues to show films in eXcentris, namely Le Parallèle.
The aim of the future purchasers is to reopen the three Kinosäles on 27 February next year with the presentation of the very successful film by Xavier Beauvois "Des hommes et des dieux."
Christian Yaccarini, however, did not cancel the newspaper "Le Devoir" and ignored what he and his group think of the downward corrected proposals they have made.
Secret of the complex-shaved Canada vowed
The new American diplomatic lines spread by WikiLeaks are the secret of what the United Nations considers to be a minority complex of Canadians to the Americans, but with the same blow they reveal the superiority of Canada.
As a consequence, the American diplomats are surprised that the Canadian voter does not have the Canadian-American relations in the course of the election, and they believe that President Obama's visit would have helped the Conservative Government to implement its 2009 budget!
The four new communications between the American Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which were publicly distributed yesterday, offer even more peculiar details than the only substantive content to which we have to tap.
A connection dating from 22 September 2008, i.e. in the period in which the federal electoral kampage was in full progress, reports on the point from which the United Nations no longer participates in the operations discussed by its political leaders.
For the great surprise of David Wilkins, the American ambassador used in Ottawa.
Mr Wilkins offers various explanations of this situation.
"A minority complex which is almost inhabited by the Canadians may make Canadian political leaders much more likely to talk about internal disputes of everyday life than the United States in this election to the black Peter (as in 1988 in the campaign on free trade)," he describes.
The United Nations, he concludes, is therefore "the dictatorical Goliath of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to speak of him."
The Ambassador understands this "ear-stunning silence" even less as the two countries have intensive political and economic relations.
"Logically," he said, "it should be the ability of a candidate, a party and much more of a party leader to run such a essential relationship that the voter has in the course of the course of the day as a key factor."
The other expression of this feeling of importance reads in the communication sent by Terry Breese, business director in Ottawa on 22 January 2009, which President Barack Obama is to prepare for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your journey will help to ensure that the government continues to vote for confidence through the Federal Budget at the beginning of February, in which Canada will announce its first deficit after more than a decade resulting from an uplifting programme of 30 to 40 billion dollars," Breese describes.
Neither had he mentioned that the government had to postpone the parliamentary meeting before Christmas in order to prevent Parliament from falling off the coalition and would have an effect on the quality of the proposed promotion programme on the basis of the continued existence of the opposition parties.
Another communication dated January 2008, written by Ambassador Wilkins, agrees with Washington that the dramatic series broadcast by the United States by CBC are becoming more and more negative.
The ambassador is concerned about broadcasts such as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, where you can observe little subtle responses to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly List" or also abductions for interviews conducted by the CIA by muscle pros.
Another communication reports in detail on how Hillary Clinten asked his French counterparts Bernard Kouchner at their first bilateral meeting whether Europe was prepared to include certain Guantanamo prisoners.
Mr Kouchner should have answered the question with yes, but on the basis of an individual 'case by case' decision.
In the end of the meeting, as described, "he handed out a paper to the Secretary of State in relation to Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim Canadian origin."
"The Secretary of State has promised to review the file again."
Finally, let us note that the minds are heated with regard to the WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper very close advisor, had explained about CBC that the responsible for this massive leak should be "killed."
He had refused here on Mike Huckabee from the United States.
Global plan for the renewal of lighting
Yesterday, in Cancun, the UN proposed a plan to renew the lighting of households, trade and industry in 100 countries with a view to achieving a reduction in greenhouse gas (CFCs), which corresponds to almost one third of the additional reduction that needs to be realised in order to stabilise the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan takes its position in the steps of the concrete major projects which the UN hopes to implement in Cancun in order to compensate for the absence of mandatory reductions in industrial countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, the main problem in the form of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of the CFCs delivered due to the lighting on earth would be avoided if the white glow pears, which are still a monopoly of 50 to 70% on the market, were replaced by fluorescent or better, by light diodes (LED).
The lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This corresponds to 70% of the exhaust gases of the world driving park.
Last year in Copenhagen, the large emissions of exhaust gases such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed themselves to voluntary reduction plans that should reduce global emissions of CFCs from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, this balance would have to be deducted from 5 Gt to stabilise the climatic increase by 2 degrees Celsius from today until 2020 in order to prevent it from being out of control.
In the white-glowing pears, 95% of the energy is in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produce the light.
The compact light bulbs reduce energy consumption by 75%, the new LED bulbs reduce this energy demand twice again.
The compact light bulbs hold between 6000 and 10,000 hours on average.
The new LED bulbs, such as those placed on the market by the manufacturer Philips this week - this society has also participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25.000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a white bulb, indicating the savings of the exchange plan to be applied in 100 countries.
In addition to the fact that iese gives very little heat to completely new bulbs, they can also work with a rule resistance.
And they contain no mercury.
Several specialists have shown that compact light bulbs have reserves as they contain mercury and that they must therefore be disposed of as special waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless producers make a place of acceptance available.
However, according to the report, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the compact light bulb, but rather the coal power plants which exit much more mercury to produce the electricity wasted by the white bulbs.
In the United States alone, these coal power plants exit 25.000 tonnes of mercury per year.
The report sets out in detail the profits that each country would generate thanks to this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save a billion dollars a year when purchasing electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, which means an equivalent of 3.5 coal power plants whose construction would cost Indonesia 2.5 billion.
Ivory Coast awaits the announcement of the election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the "immediate" publication of the results of the presidential election of the Ivory Coast directly after their deadline.
"The Secretary-General underlined the need for the independent electoral commission to maintain its work and to announce the provisional results without further delay," a press speaker from the UN Head stressed.
"He asks all parties and institutions of the Ivory Coast to prove their responsibility and to abstain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite the pressure exercised by certain foreign governments, the electoral commission had left the deadline set on Wednesday at midnight three days after the election on Sunday, without publication of the results.
About 40 minutes before the deadline, the President of the CEI had confirmed on television that the Commission would "continue to work" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, many calls from all over the world have been loud, but the CEI may finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round of elections under Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent, Alassane Ouattara.
However, the Gbagbo warehouse expects the annulment of "fraudulent" voices in the north by the Constitutional Council, achieved by the ex-rebel warehouse of the Forces nouvelles (UN) during the failure of the Putch in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, head of the Ivory Coast Presidential Campaign, had confirmed that the manoeuvre of the UN's practice to intimidate voters in the north of the country had frightened the President's supporters to go to the election.
The entire election could be cancelled if the actions brought by Gbagbo are taken into account by the Constitutional Council.
However, the Gbagbo contractors are now more of the opinion that the highest court of the country is not neutral, as it is led by Paul Yao N'Dré, a politically closely connected with Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man of the North who denies any connection to the ex-rebels, has considered the delay in proclaiming the results of the elections "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, even if he did not go so far to call for victory.
His alliances reaffirm that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows that he has lost; and filing a complaint to the Constitutional Court after preventing the electoral commission from publishing the results, they are illegal.
The second round of presidential elections on Sunday was held for the crowning of the association and reconciliation process of a country that was divided over years into two parts.
On Wednesday, the United Nations had warned the Ivory Coast politicians that they could be held responsible for them in the event of any tensions.
Laurent Gbagbo had the first round of elections on 31 October, with 38% of the votes against the 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who had received public support from former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round), as a top candidate.
Unemployment rates in France remained stable in the third quarter
The unemployment rate in France, as defined by the International Labour Office (IAA), is stable at 9.3% in the metropolis (including the overseas departments at 9.7%), showing the provisional seasonally adjusted data published on Thursday by the Statistical Bundesamt Insee.
The unemployment rate in the metropolis is established at 2.631 million.
The second quarter figures amounted to 9.3% of the working population in the metropolis and 9.7% including the overseas departments.
Over the year, the unemployment rate increased by 0.1 percentage points.
In particular, 3.4 million workers in the French metropolis were not employed in the third quarter but wished to find a job, including whether they were employed every two weeks or not or whether they were seeking work or not.
The situation of young people in the labour market has continued to deteriorate with an increase in unemployment rate of 24.2% in metropolis (+ 0.9 percentage points within three months, + 0.5 percentage points over the year) and 25% including the overseas regions.
In the third quarter, 637,000 of young people aged between 15 and 24 were unemployed according to IAA.
In turn, the elderly have seen a slight increase in the unemployment rate of 6.4% in the metropolis (+ 0.2 percentage points over three months and over the year), i.e. 482 000 of over 50-year-olds, 6.6% including the overseas departments.
Only 25-49 years of age could have benefited from the stability of unemployment in the third quarter; 8.3% in the metropolis (-0.1 percentage points over three months, + 0.1 percentage points over one year) and 8.8% in France as a whole.
After a discussion on its calculation procedures, the Statistical Bundesamt Insee has not published the monthly unemployment figures since 2006.
However, Eurostat, the Statistical Office of the European Union, continues to use this method and announced on Tuesday a quota of 9.8% in France for October (including the overseas departments) compared to 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini accused and arrested
Against Alexandre Guérini, 53, head of a disposal firm and brother of the President of the Bouches-du-Rhône region (PS), an investigation procedure was initiated and he was deposited in Luynes near Aix-en-Provence in the course of an investigation on public and suspected markets.
Alexandre Guérini was accused of being deprived of societal property, disbelief of general goods, healing, corruption mediation, illegal bribery and arms ownership, according to his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is ready to fight and intends to comment on all the questions that the prosecutor will ask him, instead of spreading brain guts."
"It is easy to submit to him a number of criminal charges, another thing is to prove them," explained his lawyer Florence Rault the AFP (Agence France Press) before hearing his client.
Mr Guérini, the brother of Jean-Noël Guérini, the first man of the PS (Party socialiste) in the department, had insisted on giving the judge a memorary on his justification before hearing him through his lawyers.
A member of Guérinis, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and detained on Wednesday night.
According to attorney Lucien Simon, her client had never done anything but to keep his landfill running.
With regard to the business competence or the destination of the associated funds, he would never have known, said Simon.
In this affair, too, Daniel Pinna, former Director-General of the Public Service of the Urban Region Aubagne, was released on Wednesday for oppression and compassion, but then under the obligation to stay away from the protagonists of these acts under judicial supervision.
"My client could explain the facts he was accused of."
"The Supreme Prosecutor has taken into account not to deprive him of his freedom, said his attorney Yann Arnoux.
Four other persons had been charged and were released from custody the night from Tuesday to Wednesday, including two of them under legal supervision, according to the Deputy Attorney General Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Managing Director of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is being prosecuted in court due to "unauthorised influence and passive corruption."
Two state officials from Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier were also arrested, who were one because of the title "Detroit and contamination of general property by an official of the public service," the other because of "Compassion in contamination of public funds."
The life companion of Alexandre Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was also accused of "healing and amusement of society."
Among those who have been confronted with Guérini are Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned because of a similar affair of public fraud that had affected Corsica.
The prisoners suspect his society to have contributed to washing money from "high" criminal circles.
The investigation against X for alleged fraud in the award of public contracts, particularly in the field of disposal, will be conducted in April 2009 following anonymous letters in the files of several open investigations.
Close sources of investigation show that the investigation focuses in particular on the conditions of the award and operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which also relates to waste from the Aubagne area, as well as from certain cities of the Marseille urban area (MPM).
Affaire Clotilde Reiss: the Elysée Palace exaggerates its mediator function for Syria
Within more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher who was held in Iran for "spying," held the French public in breath, relieved diplomacy in alert and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
This is all under the attention of the United States diplomats.
The American documents received by WikiLeaks and reviewed by the newspaper "Le Monde" give some background to this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée had explained to the Americans its strategy that went so far to give these advice on their own crisis of "hostages" in Iran (a small group of migrants).
They show how the French leaders have tried to convince Washington that the liberation of the young French woman does not have the release of Majid Kakavand, a prisoner held in France and sought by American justice on the basis of trade in material for the benefit of the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they put the way in which the French Bureau tried to manipulate the media for the purpose of making it credible, the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde rice, into a cruel light.
In truth, he had not done anything in this respect.
A diplomatic elegance, edited in Paris on 12 August 2009, is entitled "Iran: French comments on how to deal with hostages."
François Richier, Elysée Adviser in Strategic Questions, was accompanied by Patrice Paoli, Director of Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle Orient with the American Diplomatin Kathleen Allegrone.
They explained the French method to her.
They urged the Americans to put everything in place to bring back their own nationals who were being held violently in Iran.
"Makes noise," they said, "articulates loud and clear and without neglect" the words "fundamental human rights," "innocence," "immediate release" in the media.
This is necessary to embarrass the Iranian regime, which is very sensitive to its image.
"Do this even more, especially as the Iranians ask you not to do so."
Because "silence solves nothing," passing the discussion attempts on invisible ways, the Iranians are "masters in escape maneuvers."
Mr Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is a "faithful, Iranian tactics": "hostage for political blackmail."
He announces that the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which should be made on 16 August, the day she escapes to the French Embassy) "requires the payment of a large amount of money to the Iranians" (EUR 230,000 bail).
And he leaves truthful, the Elysée anticipates further hostages, a phenomenon that "will tighten up."
The Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of about 1,800 French citizens who live in Iran," he said.
August 28, 2009.
Clotilde Reiss was released from prison 12 days ago, but is still being held in Iran.
An information has been circulated: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition the United States demands to Iran due to illicit trade in sensitive electronic materials, has been released from custody after the decision of a judge in Paris.
The American Embassy, like many other observers, asks about this worrying coincidence.
For Washington, following the illegal Iranian networks of acquisition of the material intended for the nuclear programme, the release of Majid Khakavand is a bad news.
Did France buy a cow trade?
The liberation of the Iranian against the French?
François Richier assures that this is not the case for a renewed discussion with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September.
The Elysée, he says, was not only "completely surprised by the judge's decision," but also tried to reject it.
"There has been a rough exchange between the French Bureau and the French Minister for Justice (currently Michèle Alliot-Marie), but" the French Government cannot change the decision of the court, "he explains.
Mr Richier would also like to point out that Majid Kakavand remains under "strict" supervision of the French Secret Service.
The Elysée Adviser chooses a telephone number, replaces it, then informs the American diplomat, the Iranian "currently in the buildings led by the Iranian Embassy in Paris."
During the custody of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée does not spare its efforts to believe, through allegiance and media-organized "escape attempts," the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays an "important" and "influential mediator role."
The Americans do not observe this activity without irony and confirm that the manipulation carries fruit, as several press articles reflect the official French version.
A telegram dating on August 25, 2009 describes "the media flash of the French authorities."
What is the basis of so much "thank you" to Mr Assad, the Paris Embassy asks.
"Despite their declarations of praise, the French authorities confess secretly that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then deals with the reasons that led the Elysée to decay this fiction.
The intense communication effort "aims to confirm Sarkozy's policy of openness to Syria," he analyzes.
A policy launched in 2008, which "was perceived as premature and undeserved by many critics in France and abroad."
"The Syrian role building" attempts to show Syria what a praise can be achieved by playing a constructive role in the region. "
The aim is also to sow "interference between Syria and Iran."
The American Embassy knows this from good source.
On August 11, François Richier had entrusted her: "Of course we do not know whether the Syrians have done anything."
"But we have thanked them in spite of everything."
"This should at least create confusion among the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her at the Elysée.
In a communiqué, he thanked the President of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in the release of our countrymen."
No online games for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government will adopt a law called "the ashtray," which will prohibit young people from playing online games after midnight by blocking them access, as indicated by government leaders.
A draft law to encourage online gambling operators to refuse young people under 16 years after midnight access to these games will be presented to Parliament in December, illustrated representatives of cultural and family ministries.
"Many children play these games all night and then have difficulties with learning in school and also with having a normal life throughout the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," said Jo Rin, with this draft of the law appointed Minister of the French Press Agency Agence France Press.
The online games will then be available again from 6 a.m. in the morning.
The producer companies would have had a year to prepare themselves for the application of the law, so it clarified.
The government also drew attention to asking manufacturers to reduce the daily time limit for access to these games to those young people whose parents ask for it to be added to the person responsible.
It will also provide free programs to those who wish to make it possible to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "networked" countries, and newspapers regularly report various events associated with intensive internet use.
The country is also unchallenged champion in global online game competitions.
In November, South Korea had acquired four gold medals in the World Cyber Games compared to 58 other nations.
World Championship 2018-2022: the FIFA nominates the Foreign State
In light excitement due to the suspicion of corruption, the FIFA Executive Committee on Thursday designates the Foreign Countries of the World Championships 2018 and 2022, a highly political choice in which ranking for influence and lobbying threatens to push the technical criteria into the background.
One thing is certain: the issue of the FIFA Royal Disciplin in 2018 will take place in Europe, its traditional highlight (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will then be a bit more exotic; the International Football Association hopes to win new territories (Katar, Australia) after the premiere on the African continent in 2010, or continue to pursue its establishment in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities associated with the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Katar, the head of the Belgian and Dutch government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) shows the degree of economic and political use of a world championship.
So the activities behind the scenes are threatening to stop until the last minute.
Otherwise, it is difficult to set up a hierarchy of candidates.
According to the evaluation report of the FIFA, the English, Spanish and Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) files offer more interesting arguments than those of their competitors.
But these considerations will not be so important for the 22 members of the executive committee at the time of the election.
The Sunday Times, which was at the beginning of the discoveries with the suspension of two members of the executive committee (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could as well have ruined the chances for their own country, the wall of football, which was allowed only once to take the world championship, namely 1966.
The BBC had once again given nutrition to it on Monday by sending out a documentary report that took three influential members of the committee, namely Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou under attack.
Reason enough to upset the FIFA and embarrass the English leaders, who had primarily done an intense lobbying with David Cameron in recent weeks.
The head of government hopes for a new edition of the chess that his predecessor Tony Blair had succeeded in organising the 2012 Olympic Games for London in 2005.
Would this intensive effort be enough to revalue the image of England in front of the committee?
Nothing is less safe, because the Duo Spain-Portugal does not lack trumpets with its already finished stages, its expertise (World Cup 82 in Spain, Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, EM 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the economic and financial shadow sides of the two countries could diminish their ambitions.
The potential repression against the English people as well as the doubts about the Solvency of Spain and Portugal increase Russia's chances of becoming an important outsider despite its gaps in the dossier (stages, hotels, transport).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided to challenge the inevitable indication of the remarks of the English press "an unfair competition in the preparation of the vote" by the committee members.
"You throw them with dirt, you try to compromise them," Putin weather.
For 2022, the United States, strengthened by the experience of 1994, seems to be the logical favorites.
First economic world power, seat of the FIFA main sponsors, the country seems to have a long list of advantages over Japan and South Korea, which have separately set up a very beautiful project.
However, these new candidates seem premature for two countries who had co-organised the competition in 2002.
Another threat: the approval requested by the FIFA of the World Cup 2026 for China, which leaves the Asian chances to lapse by 2022.
With Australia and Katar, which had drawn up all the registers with the anticipation of futuristic stages, the FIFA is pursuing its extension towards new areas, but these two countries represent a greater risk than certainty.
Australia, like Japan and South Korea, could suffer from the weakness of television rights (due to shifting time), the sensitive nerve of the FIFA.
Second mandate: the openness
The Gaulle had really crashed.
Mitterand had made him think he was stuffing.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not show the slightest hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than this.
A mandate at the Elysée calls the next one.
The current Head of State will be ergo candidate in 2012.
But openness is not a good face to the side of the mystery that the presidential function entails.
So you have to pretend that there's no doubt about it.
In one sense, as in another sense.
In 2006, the followers Jacques Chiracs stated that a third mandate was not excluded without even believing in it.
On 15 November, Nicolas Sarkozy assured in serious tone to make his decision "at some point in the autumn of 2011."
That he would make the perspective of "two mandates" solemn on Tuesday night in Elysée before the UMP parliamentarians had spread a little feverness.
Was that the official announcement of his candidate?
Very missing.
The President only reminded us that the 2008 constitutional amendment limited the number of five-year periods to only two.
He made a statement, no announcement.
It is not the first time that he mentioned the presidential election at such meetings in a humorous tone.
"You have seven and a half years with me, or at best," he explained to them in July 2009.
A new one in May 2010: "Don't think I don't think about the next phase."
His words of yesterday do not make him a candidate more than the previous day, but no less.
If they make comments, then for a double reason.
The acceleration of the race around the candidate with the PS on one side.
However, it is not the opening of the competition with Ségolène Royal that makes Nicolas Sarkozy reveal itself.
On the contrary, it is his obvious candidature in 2012, which advise many members of the PS more early than accepted for the battle statement.
The bad surveys on the other side.
For the first time, the voters of the right would prefer a candidate of François Fillon from Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to the BVA-L'Express survey).
"We have a candidate, and there is no discussion with the UMP about it," responded immediately and carefully to the Prime Minister's environment.
"If he found a defeat as possible, he would not be a candidate," Jean-Pierre Raffarin tells us.
"He will always believe in victory," corrects Alain Juppé, who has settled with openness.
Euro: the ECB is forced to maintain its purchases of public documents
The last meeting of the ECB's Central Banking Council last year should provide an opportunity to show ways of getting out of the crisis or at least to announce the establishment of a large number of unconventional monetary policy measures which are to come to its conclusion at the end of the year.
The crisis of European sovereign debt requires that the Frankfurt Central Bank cannot undoubtedly afford to influence the current, more than tense, situation on European borrowing markets, in order not to cause their worsening.
Political costs would be far too high.
The French Minister for Finance, Christine Lagarde, had welcomed the active role played by the ECB yesterday at a press conference in solving Europe's government debt.
It did not dare to say whether it felt that the Central Bank could do more, for example by stimulating its programme of purchasing government bonds.
"I retain my considerations for my European trading partners (...)."
Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, had shown itself in Brussels on the eve of his hearing by the Economic and Monetary Committee of the European Parliament, but was pleased to point out that the programme of purchases of public documents on the secondary market would "continue" and that we will see at the meeting on Thursday "how decisions are taken."
Only certainty: The ECB will remain unchanged at 1%, the historically lowest level since May 2009.
In practice, the debt purchases of the treasury were doubled by the ECB last week to around EUR 1.35 billion.
And according to some traders, she was supposed to have made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese state papers yesterday.
A total of EUR 67 billion has been purchased by the Eurosystem's central banks since May 2010.
Among dealers there is no doubt about the anticipation of a follow-up of the purchase course (see page 29).
The economies are not expecting any more remarkable change in the course.
If the borrowing operations of more than three months will already have disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, the latter will still make itself available to the full cash reserves for a period of one week to three months.
The economies are already working today to ensure that this measure will be extended by a few months.
"I cannot imagine that the ECB will change its programme in a substantial way."
"Otherwise, it would take the risk of provoking new tensions in the short term," Michael Schubert, Volkswirt of the Commerzbank suspects.
"A progressive exit for the course of the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely to me," he anticipates Norbert Bräms, Volkswirt at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In the field of their interventions in the State debt market, "the ECB should maintain such a volume of purchases of bonds that revive the contract market," added Norbert Bräms.
In view of the relevance of the exposure of European banks to the euro area State debt markets, the central bank has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It must enter the market at any price to the buyers of the missing investors and act in such a way to prevent the premature enthusiasm about the yields paid to the weakest states," a significant obligatory holder testified yesterday.
For if interest rates are to be applied to the flight, the States would be even more prevented from reducing or stabilising their debt.
This is the price to protect the euro.
The government of Berlusconi is covering in Italy
After a week of concern for Italy, the situation was a little relaxed yesterday with the fall in cornerstone interest rates to 10 years.
A return to the wicked silence.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister of Economic Affairs, the regional chairman Giulio Tremonti had qualified the situation as "infinite" and had expected him to have a "unpredictable" weekend, which the person concerned immediately demented.
In any case, on Tuesday, the scissors with the German interest rates would have reached their record of 210 basis points and the prices of the contracts to cover the risk of bankruptcy would have increased to 263 points, which had caused a certain headache in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi pointed out to his Council of Ministers that the difference between Spain and the German interest rates was 400 basis points.
However, his right hand, Gianni Letta, had expressed itself as "seriously concerned" about the "market turbulence" and a possible risk of connecting from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third euro area economy, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute.
It is clear that its problem is the decline in economic growth and the consequent, fraudulent tax incomes which threaten the State to no longer meet its financing needs.
The last Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
In the future, Italian growth of 1.1% is expected in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012, although the budget for the Senate is projected to be 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, the EU Commission is calculating, the budget deficit will still account for 4.3% of GDP next year (compared with 3.9% predicted by governments) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
That is why the call for a new budget collective, which could be used after the holidays for a sum of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, new austerity measures must be taken," says auditor Olli Rehn.
At the hour, Italy will receive the support of international institutions.
"The basic fixed of the Italian economy is in order and its accounts are regulated, which we have repeated for a long time," Arrigo Sadun, Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund, who is entrusted with Italy with the IMF.
"At the moment there are no problems, neither in the short term nor in the long term, as, despite its high debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, A.d. R.), less stabilisation progress is demanded than other countries," observes Pier Carlo Padoan, head of the OECD.
It remains the question of political impartiality.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a request for suspicion by the Chamber of Members, which would allow the preferred elections to be organised at the end of March.
There is therefore a rather favourable period for decision-making on a serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking about the development of anti-crisis measures
Christine Lagarde had explicitly emphasised it yesterday at a press conference in Paris: "I believe that it has been proven on Sunday afternoon and also in the evening: Europeans are clearly together, are ready and committed to defending their currency and their currency area."
Although quite relatively - the deduction recorded yesterday in the interest rates of European government bonds was water on the mills of governments and the ECB.
However, a start on normalisation cannot yet be mentioned.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's had announced that it could reduce the debt note of Portugal, probably the most effective target of the speculators nowadays.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political visibility, which is particularly prone to the banking systems," said the economists of Exane BNP Paribas.
In particular, "political time goes much slower than that of the markets."
The European countries, who are well aware of this gap and the danger in which it is concealed, are intensifying discussions to strengthen the existing anti-crisis measures.
The informal discussions between the most directly affected ministers of finance and in the wider sense with their counterparts of the G20 are going well ahead.
And this also with regard to the meetings of Eurogroupe and ECOFIN at the beginning of next week.
The ECB meets today.
The plan sets out the unconventional measures to reinforce the euro-zone countries in the crossroads of the markets (see below).
With regard to the EU Stability Funds, its Executive Director Klaus Regling has already begun his Asia tour on Tuesday in Singapore to inform investors in the Far East about developments in the crisis in Europe.
If the aim of his visit is not explicit fundraising, he certainly prepares the ground for it.
The first EU Stability Fund advertising expenditure is scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, an official American representative of the Reuters Agency had entrusted the United States to support a possible increase in the fund mobilised by the additional direct commitment of the IMF.
Portugal and Spain, the countries in the first row, intend to take on structural reforms, particularly in the field of labour market organisation.
Reforms to be added to savings measures, but to show effects in the near future.
Lisbon and Madrid take a different path than Greece and Ireland have done.
Both the one and the other have to avoid asking for international assistance before it has set up its own budget corrective measures and decided on essential structural reforms, which will bring them back confidence in the long term.
In turn, European investors are discussing the options available to speed up the normalisation process of government bonds markets.
Axel Weber, who was on the doorway in Paris on 24 November, had the first idea that if the EUR 750 billion mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to take up its own pocket again.
Barclays Capital's economists, with regard to the market of European sovereign debt, judge that an extension of around EUR 100 billion would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of a direct liquidity injection.
This means that the European mechanism of financial stabilisation is currently 60 billion euros.
A council that has all the opportunities to be carefully examined in the European capitals.
Particularly when market conditions accentuate.
Snow and Glatteis: 24 Departments in Alarm Level Orange
The snow episodes are still experiencing traffic difficulties, particularly in the secondary transport networks of Brittany and threaten to affect various economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in an orange alert level due to the threat of snow and glatter risk.
The regions of Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have joined the 20 departments already in Orange alert level; 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, then later in the night.
According to Météo France, the intense snowshowers tanks the north of the Gironde as well as the Charentes, it snow easily on the et Ile-de-France.
In the departments concerned, snow ranges from 2 to 5 cm, sometimes from 7 to 10 cm, as well as 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm in the Paris region are expected.
The regions concerned are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
The snow cases are significant enough to create traffic barriers and to affect certain economic activities, Météo France predicts.
In the Côtes d'Armor region several regional roads for heavy transport of more than 7.5 tonnes are blocked, including the transport axes Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
The traffic situation of the secondary transport networks in Brittany is very difficult, according to the transport policymakers, who refuse to use their own vehicle only in the emergency case, and the use of some TER buses has been deleted all day long.
In the Picardie, the school traffic for Thursday was cancelled.
No specific restrictive measures were foreseen for heavy transport on Wednesday evening.
The prefecture "calls on drivers to be very careful on the roads and to adapt their driving behaviour accordingly."
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) asked airlines to cancel on Thursday 25% of their flights from Paris Airport Roissy and 10% of Orly's flights due to the expected strong snow falls.
The DGAB recommends that air passengers contact their airline.
The airports of Gatwick in the south of London and the airport of Edinburgh, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Métro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate on the modernisation of the transport sector in Ile-de-France has been fully underway, it rains billions.
At least in the discussions.
In particular, the 23 billion for the Grand Paris Metro, which is to be built by the Société du Grand Paris, are called to be remembered.
In order to initiate the construction of the SGP, the State has announced a capital transfer of EUR 4 billion.
In the theoretical scheme, this is the sum that the SGP would then allow to grant a share of the financial sum in the markets to its double.
Today, it finally came to the first high bills.
The 2010 supplementary budget, this morning passed by the Financial Commission of the National Assembly, contains the measures envisaged to raise the first part of these funds.
These are two measures: the creation of a special tax to develop and higher taxation of the offices at the Ile-de-France.
First of all, as you take Article 15 of the draft law, goes "in favour of the public-law institution Société du Grand Paris."
This is estimated: "The product of this tax amounts to 117 million euros per year."
The second is a reorganization of the existing corporate taxation: "to modernise it to increase the product resulting from it and to overcome this increase of the Société du Grand Paris."
How much would that cost?
A puzzle.
This sum is not in the text.
One is far away from the 4 billion.
"It is stated that the tax resources are added to the €4 billion of the capital transfer that the State is investing and the Société du Grand Paris is progressively provided for the project," the explanatory statement is to be found.
The SGP does not find this system disturbing at all.
"Since the moment you book revenue (the two taxes, d. R.), you can cover the projection for over three years and then draw from the 4 billion," it is explained.
"This is recorded in the budget and deducted gradually."
The SGP estimates that 2013 will begin to record the 4 billion for the 2014 budget.
This measure, whose 4 billion promises you will be able to look for for for a long time, is at risk of calling for a rather moving parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will take place on 7 December.
Revenge hackers and embezzled spies
The affaire WikiLeaks has a double meaning.
On one side, it has become an obvious scandal, a scandal that is only a scandal in sinner hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at international level and gives a taste of the future dominated by regression.
But let's go in the row.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that any file created by a secret service (an x-any nation) consists exclusively of newspaper cuts.
The "extraordinary," American discoveries about the sexual habits of Berlusconis throw nothing more than what one has been able to read for months anyway in any X-any journal (except those whose owner is Berlusconi), and the scary caricaturized profile of Gaddafis has been offering cabaret artists fabric for their sketches for a long time.
The rule according to which the secret dossiers may only consist of already known news is essential for the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century.
When you go to a library dedicated to esotheric publications, you will recognize that every work (about the grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templer or the Rosenkreuzler) repeats exactly what has already been written in previous works.
This is not only because the author of occult texts does not want to publish research (yet because he did not know where to find news about the non-existent), but because those who dedicate themselves to occultism believe in nothing other than what they already know and confirm what they have learned.
This is also the success mechanism of Dan Brown.
So do the secrets.
The informant is faul, and faul (or limited spirit) is also the head of the secret service (otherwise he could be anything, for example editor at Libération), who considers only what he recognises as true.
The top secret information about Berlusconi, which the American Embassy had sent to the State Desert in Rome, was the same as those that Newsweek had published the week before.
So why has such an end to the disclosure of these dossiers been made?
On the one hand, they say what every educated person already knows, namely that the messages - at least since the end of the Second World War and since then also the Heads of Government can call each other or take a plane to meet for dinner - have lost their diplomatic function and have turned into spy centers, with the exception of some small representations.
Every audience of investigative films knows this very well, and it does not happen for hypocrisy to do so to ignore this.
Nevertheless: the fact of repeating it publicly violates the task of hypocrisy and serves to put American diplomacy in a bad light.
Second: The idea that an X-any hacker can take the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world is the major blow against the prestige of the state decernation.
The scandal also puts less victims than the "sharpest" in trouble.
But let us devote ourselves to the deep nature of what has happened.
Former times, at Orwell's times, all power could be bundled like a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell's prophecy could have been quite right since then, where you can control every movement thanks to the phone, every transaction done, the visited hotel, the chosen motorway and so on; the citizen would become the total victim of the eye of power.
But if you face what is going on today, that even the secret crypts of power can no longer escape the control of a hacker, the control course will cease to be one-sided and will be circular.
The power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - chosen as the citizen's vengeance - can experience the secrets of power.
But how can a power that is no longer able to preserve its own secrets?
It is true, Georg Simmel already said that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be disclosed); it is also true that any knowledge of the character of Berlusconis or Merkels is basically a secret free of secrets as it reveals the public sphere; but disclosing in the style of WikiLeaks that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets means depriving them of any power.
WikiLeaks did not wrong Sarkozy or Merkel, but Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this corruption, which has been added to such a tremendous power?
It is evident that in the future the States will not make any more reserved information online - this would be equal to an outlet attached to the road corner.
But it is equally obvious that it is forgiven with the current technologies to hope to keep confidential reports by telephone.
Nothing is easier than to find out whether and when a head of state moved on a plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How could private relations and only for certain ears be maintained in the future?
I know very well that my prediction at the moment sounds like science fiction and romantic, but I see myself forced to imagine the government agents moving in a secret way on uncontrollable marshal routes, their communications in no place other than in the mere memory, and furthering the few written information they have received in the footwear set.
The information would be stored in a single copy in closed footwear: basically, Watergate's spionage attempt had less success than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is progressing like a cancer nowadays, namely backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph had revolutionized communication, the Internet reconstructs a telegraph with (telephone) wire.
The (analogue) video cassettes had enabled the film researchers to explore a film band for tape by spilling from the back to the front and lifting all the secrets of the assembly, while the (numerical) CDs nowadays allow nothing but to jump from chapter to chapter, i.e. in macroports.
The high-speed trains drive from Rome to Milan within three hours, while this requires three and a half hours by plane including the shift.
It is therefore not extraordinary that politics and communication technology return to cars and horses.
One last observation.
In the past, the press tried to understand what kind of secrets were embroidered between the messages.
At present, it is the messages that demand confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France praises his financial promises
One year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to investigate compliance with the rapidly resolved funding promises (also called "fast start" or early financing) implemented by developing countries.
And the crude French beauty shipowners have already been discovered.
With the Copenhagen Treaty, developing countries have committed themselves to providing 30 billion dollars between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has promised EUR 7.2 billion over three years, France EUR 1.26 billion (i.e. EUR 420 million per year).
At the opening of COP16, the EU has drawn all the registers in order to convince its partners of the fact that they are committed to fast-start financing: detailed and reliable progress report of their Member States, press conference, major side events, brochure distribution.
The operation is remarkable and appreciated for its real value: the developing countries and civil society are happy to see that all developed countries did the same at the same level of precision.
The EU proclaims to have released EUR 2.2 billion in 2010, which brings it on the right path to respect for its commitment of 7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look into detail, things are a little more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Treaty, this money should be "new and additional" in order to ensure that an additional effort has been made without enriching to the detriment of public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means.
While the Commission had proposed harmonisation, certain Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the guideline that he considers best.
For example, the European Commission has set itself as a guideline for 2009: international financing will be maintained and will provide 150 million in the framework of the financing of fast-start over three years.
Other countries have chosen similar indicative values, either in terms of year or conditions at the level of public development aid.
In contrast, France considered that the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 was "new and additional."
In other words, there are no indicative values for the expenditure of the previous year or at the global level of public development aid.
In concrete terms, the total amount of French support for developing countries can remain stable (or decrease) - France claims to comply with its commitment to "new and additional" financing.
Another crucial element is the breakdown into donations and loans.
There is no rule about this yet, and everyone chooses his calculating mode.
Some, such as France, are €1 borrowed as equivalent to €1 donated.
Obviously, this is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans for certain profitable investments (often linked to emission reduction projects based on the most effective technology) can be justified, it is fraudulent to present the euro that is taken as an equivalent for a donated euro... In addition, only the cost of the loan to the investor country should be considered as an commitment (i.e. the equivalent of a interest rate).
But France has nothing but the following: it "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros by taking 91.5% loans (389.8 million euros) and donating 8.5% 36.1 million euros) - see also the EU document to convince itself.
France is the only country in the EU that makes large use of loans.
Germany calls for 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among other things) fulfil their 100% commitments with donations.
In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union is spending €1 to fulfil its obligations, France is just giving 10 cents and understands a similar effort.
Beautiful hokuspokus!
All in all, France operates in its fast-start financing with double fraud: partly with a further development of the action over time and partly with the reality of financial intervention.
France succeeds in believing that it spent 420 million "new and additional" millions in accordance with its promises, saving 36.1 million euros.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (since it seems that it was Bercy who carried out the arbitration) could have a double negative effect; once the EU-internal (why do the other Member States continue with the donation if it is enough to borrow?) and then in the negotiations, since the developing countries are not completely deceiving...
The chapter of early financing is only a small question for a relatively short time compared to the whole of discussions on the climate.
But it could be the drop too much in the immense machine of the UNFCCC.
Let us hope that this will not be the case.
However, it is indispensable to learn his lesson from this first year of early financing.
In the first place, France could announce a change in its type of accounting for 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of respect for its commitments and equitable justice with the other countries of the European Union.
In particular, however, France could bring forward discussions on the subject of long-term financing (another, decisive and currently debated issue): it does not escape the question of "accountability" or the type of accounting of its loans.
France could change its position in order to be as progressive as it is in other matters.
Hope is therefore based on the new Minister for the Environment, Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive next week in Cancun.
A surprising announcement about the fast-start of France and its vision of "accountability" as well as the use of loans would naturally highlight the international trust base which is necessary for further discussions.
Alarm - Pesticides taken by children
A 10-year-old child takes over day 81 various chemical substances, such as a study published this Wednesday by the Association of Générations Futures (former movement to protect the rights and respect of coming generations).
The association, which explains that its results "in view of the low number of analysed samples do not reflect a statistically significant value, but represent an illustration of the problem," had purchased from July to September the usual within four, from a ten-year-old child to meals consumed food plus an intermediate meal in the supermarkets in Oise and Paris.
These typical meals - including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and fruit parts, three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water per day - have been examined as well as naives from laboratories looking for chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The table balance is low flattering: 81 chemical substances, including 42 classified as potentially or likely carcinogenic and five classified as safe carcinogenic, as well as 37 substances with endocrine disorder factor, according to studies of several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Even if the legal limits for each chemical, individually absorbed substance are not exceeded in the approximate whole of the cases, this survey is very well taken to note that the reality in which the consumer may be exposed to carcinogenic substances or substances with endocrine disorder factor is worrying," the association notes.
Already at breakfast alone butter and tea with milk already contain more than ten of the potentially carcinogenic residues and three safely proven carcinogens, as well as more than twenty residues that may affect the hormone system.
The apple imported from Brazil, intended as an intermediate meal for the study, has traces of six chemical substances, including a fungicide prohibited in France.
The same applies to the green beans from Kenya, including lunch where the study has identified traces of an insecticide strictly prohibited in the EU.
In addition, the hake steak, the tuna from the box, even the baguette and chewing gum of pesticides and other chemical substances were spiked.
In the pipeline water, the analyses have brought to light the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
At dinner the salmon steak with 34 detected chemical residues was the "richest" and even the plastic plates used to heat up the meal in the microwave were not unloaded.
The final risk of this "pollutant cocktails" for the consumer "is probably underestimated," said the study.
The "Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts" (EE-LV), on the one hand, "in view of the urgency of the situation" proposed to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop the "increase in civilization diseases."
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) identified the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides, identified in fruit and vegetables, consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
