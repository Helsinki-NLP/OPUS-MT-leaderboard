No liberating novelle for Tymoshenko by Parliament
The Ukrainian Parliament today refused the request to abolish the paragraphs on the basis of which the opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko had been convicted by a novelle of the Criminal Code.
The new regulation, which could have opened the way for the liberation of the imprisoned Prime Minister, was rejected by Members at the second reading of the request for the reduction of penalties for economic offences.
In October, Timoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for the conclusion of an allegedly adverse treaty with Russia on the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not yet legal; in December the appeal of the convicted shall be negotiated in court.
Timoshenko himself refers to the judgment as a political vengeance of the regime and also in the West the process made the suspicion of the pronouncement of the court.
The request to remove paragraph 365, on the basis of which the Prime Minister was convicted, from the Criminal Code was supported by 147 MEPs.
226 votes would have been necessary for its adoption.
Libyan victory
The history of the Libyan Liberation struggle or Libyan Rebellion already knows its losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
Now only the winners can be defined.
As usual in this region, Islamists are victorious in the elections, the question is only which - the moderate or the radical.
The National Transitional Council was familiar with the law of custody of the Sharīu, of which one now has a certain idea with God.
Libya would become a country without crime, because for theft one hacks off the hand shortly.
Women should also forget about emancipation as soon as possible, any faithful will be executed, and so on.
Instead of a single dictator, society will be united by the Qur'an in future from mutually commanding tribes.
In short - in Libya there will be a order which would hardly be imaginable and, above all, would not be desirable.
Only - our lifestyle is not the only and objectively not the best and would hardly fit the Libyans mentioned.
So it is rather strange that the Muslim fighters were able to help themselves by the unbelievers.
In order to apologize, it may only serve the fact that NATO's air attacks were not led by any General from America, but by God himself, whose power was praised after every successful hit.
The victors in Libya?
We only took part in a shooting change, served the interests of Islam, and our politicians disappeared in the person of the dictator of a political ally without any advantage.
After the fresh and bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we would prefer to refrain from a military occupation of Libya.
This gives the hostel a worries - the expulsion of the cruise drivers.
But do the petroleum companies get the black gold at the spots price even without an occupation?
I am sure that the West can finally praise itself with the right of its self-esteem in terms of the protection of human rights.
If this does not destroy the Sharīa representatives.
Start of a new crisis era
France and the rest of Europe in the focus of investors.
On Tuesday, a statistical storm was needed through Europe.
Each Member State published its data on its GDP for the third quarter.
The Czech economy stagnated in comparison with the previous quarter, Germany and France.
Today, however, the obligatory market is ripping up all the records.
Investors are keeping an eye on not only Greece, but also Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the European zone, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries published their preliminary forecasts of economic development in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP was expected to grow by 0.5%, France by 0.4%.
At the same time, both countries corrected their data for the second quarter, where Germany recorded higher growth than originally expected (0.3% growth rather than 0.1% forecast), while France provided a slight decrease of 0.1% (original data were only about stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 per cent in the third quarter of this year compared to the previous year.
However, compared with the previous quarter, gross domestic product stagnated and according to the Statistical Office, the trend in the slowdown in economic performance was thus confirmed.
The results are therefore worse than the forecasts of analysts.
The main events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 per cent in the third quarter of this year compared to the previous year, but compared to the previous quarter it stagnated.
According to provisional and seasonally revised data, the German economy grew by 0.5 per cent in the third quarter.
In the whole euro area and in the EU, the economy grew by 0.2 per cent between July and September compared to the previous quarter, which is consistent with the expectations of analysts.
The Greek economy declined by 5.2 per cent compared to the previous year.
The yield from its 10-year-old government bond was 28.45%.
The yield of Italian and Spanish government bonds rose to its critical limits.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and other countries are also starting to experience problems...
The return on Czech government bonds is below 4%, although the situation in the region is deteriorating.
In Germany, voices are loud that the ECB should become the creditor of the last instance.
Czechs qualified for EURO
In Montenegro they won 1: 0 and now celebrate their qualification for 200 million
The soccer selection has mastered the hardest task of the whole season!
Thanks to a well-established Torwarts Čech and a wonderful gate by Petr Jiráček, she won 1: 0 in Montenegro.
With a large portion of luck, the Czech football could thus defend its luxurious leap of the home game and will not be missing again at the European Championship.
IHNED.cz tracked the ascending game in a detailed reportage.
Little excitement in the first half and a giant portion of luck in the second.
The Czech selection also won quite happy 1: 0 thanks to the final weakness of the home, a brilliant Čech's and the hero of the day Jiráček in Montenegro and has thus loosened its ticket for the football EM.
Even because of the precise defense game of the Czech team, they were able to put more pressure on the Montenegrines only in the second half of the year.
The Pechbirds of the party were Damjanovic and Vucinic, who shot two giant chances.
Also thanks to an excellent Petr Čech, the Czech selection will join the European Championships next year, and it is also delighted that a premium of about 200 million will be awarded to domestic football.
From the first few minutes, quite fighter football was played.
Both teams combined lengthy and so were played mainly around the middle line.
In the second half of the year, the pressure of the home company remained out and the wide depreciation before the strait was successfully rejected from the Czech defense.
Iranian students are ready to die for the core programme of their country.
They formed a living shield.
Some hundreds of university students formed a living shield around a nuclear object in Iran.
With this gesture, they wanted to demonstrate their support for the core programme of their country before a possible Israeli attack.
The students had prayed Tuesday at noon before the object and then announced death to the United States and Israel.
A few hundred students at the University of Iranian Isfahan formed a living shield around the nuclear technology center in Isfahan on Tuesday, in which uranium is processed.
By doing so, they wanted to be able to protect the core programme of their country, if necessary with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently stated in its report that Iran has not given up all its efforts for a nuclear weapon.
In Israel too, we are talking about a possible attack on Iranian nuclear installations.
Students had prayed to the complex before the entrance and then proclaimed death to the United States and Israel.
In the event of an attack that was intentionally carried out to put the Iranian nuclear programme to the greatest extent to be hampered by the Israeli press, according to the centre in Isfahan, the nuclear enrichment facility in Natan's target of attack would also be the nuclear anchor.
The menu of a fat child: it does not breakfast and eats for dinner bread sausage
More than one third of the 9 to 13 children have problems with overweight, with 9 per cent of all pupils and 5 per cent of all children overweight.
Current surveys proven - Adipous children are mostly from families with unhealthy lifestyle.
This shows once again how important the environment for the healthy development of a person is in which he grows up and is the examples surrounding him.
On the tables of noble children, sausage is up to half more frequent on the table than in families where normal-important children live.
More than 19 per cent of the overweight children had the motto "Adipositas is not a coincidence" for supper bread on the preceding day of the discovery.
In families with thicknesses, sport is not exactly one of the favorite jobs, but the majority of today's students - only 15 percent replied that their parents find themselves at least once a week for active movement.
Survey below 900 children
The survey took place last year at the end of the school year, with nearly 900 children from primary schools being questioned throughout the Czech Republic.
This has been the second year of the action "Adipositas is not a coincidence," which is supported by the General Insurance Fund and the Unilever Society.
So far, more than 12 thousand students from 4th and 8th classes participated in the project.
Unhealthy costs and lack of movement in the family are crucial factors responsible for the scary increase in the number of children with overweight or even fattening.
"For example, only half of the children questioned led five times a day to eat breakfast-second breakfast-lunch-Vesper dinner - one of the main conditions for a healthy diet," is one of the survey results.
No breakfast and sausage for dinner bread
Experts point out that also relatively small things, such as the family's regular breakfast time, are important for the healthy development of a child.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23 per cent of the pupils' families have breakfast.
And - in most families, everyone breakfast alone.
The worst thing was the finding that every tenth family is not breakfast at all.
Breakfast is considered a basic stone of healthy daily food.
The survey test led, among other things, to the day that one consumes unhealthy fries much more often in the families of superior children.
And almost everyone - without regard to weight - drinks sweet lemonades every day (70 percent)
Although more than 40 percent of the children interviewed are sports, only less than half of their parents do that - namely only 15 percent.
Set up your own menu
Another part of the survey made it possible for selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to compile their own food plan according to the opportunities offered by appetite and opinion.
"What Czech children between 12 and 15 prefer in terms of nutrition is far from the ideal of a healthy diet.
Among their favorite foods there were many flour foods, meat dishes and of course sweet foods.
"Alarming is above all the great popularity of sweet lemonades," is stressed in the final report on this survey.
During lunch, i.e. the main court, pastries won barely from poultry.
The children almost didn't like peppers and the popularity of fish and vegetable products as a lunch was very low.
Towards health
At the same time, however, the survey also showed that children are quite willing to change their eating habits when they get the right information.
"For the control group of respondents who completed the questionnaire after completing the clarifying presentation" Adipositas is not a coincidence, "in many cases a clear shift of preferences to the principles of healthy nutrition was mentioned in the results of the project.
This was evident, for example, in the sweet Limos, where many children began to give priority to ordinary water.
The children also crossed much more poultry or fish in the questionnaire as the main dish of the day and were prepared to eat less nodules or sweet food.
Prospects claim - a stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the introductory article about how to learn stylists, I had a bit confused that this was a little too much fabric for the beginning.
I didn't even know what else was coming.
Presents from three professionals from the industry, the clothing of problematic figures and a seminar on how the "on the spot" runs.
It's supposed to be worse.
The closer the exam is going to get to us, so that we have more information and practical tasks ahead of us.
But even if the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it is still fully documented.
This time we discussed with Director Alena (no one takes part in the course) how to attract a woman who has no ideal proportional figure.
And these are most of us anyway.
The one has one too short neck, the other one too young figure without proper curves and again others are chubby.
It is a matter of the stylist to crush wide shoulders optically, to extend the neck or to highlight the necessary curves.
We also got tips on how to wear a woman type like Jennifer Lopez - that is, with large buses, broad hips and narrow waist - pretty and figure-stressed without having it acting too provocative.
For example, if the difference between tail and hips is so large that the skirt or pants really don't fit, you should at least cut one piece by measure.
I'm sure you won't regret that, because good sitting clothes are simply unpayable.
In such a tailor-made skirt you feel much better than in one of the rods that always slides up and slides, in the waist, etc.
Young figures can in turn allow themselves to wear clothing with folds, builds, applications, embroidery or refinement.
With this amount of information and character types, I'm glad I have a whole week to let everything go through my head thoroughly.
And yet, I'm afraid it's almost impossible to do in the face of the homework that has been commissioned.
For each of the students was awarded a celebrity for which she was supposed to think of suitable outfits - daydressing and evening robes.
We should take into account the current appearance, the fashion style of the corresponding star and its figure type.
I'm supposed to wear Miranda Kerr, which you might know from Victoria's Secret campaign.
Inside, I applaud, because this is much better for me personally than to attract Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who has probably increased to the hundred kilos lately (well, this is a little overdriven), or also the young Selena Gomez.
The garments should be cut out of magazines or searched on the Internet, printed and then graphically edited.
In the "Moodboard," as the whole result is called, our very personal style and our relationship to graphic design should then be expressed.
It is very important to think about the graphic side of the styling as well.
The stylist attracts the models not only physically but also shapes the so-called product page in the journals (according to specific requirements, for example trend handbags, coats, etc.).
That's what the stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us.
But it's only Sunday.
That means that a stylist must have a good overall overview.
The Saturday lecture filled with information about the types of figures was the same by three visitors from the industry:
by the stylist Jan Pokorný, by the fashion designer Jakub Polanka and by the fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is illusion and that a stylist should be able to exploit this.
And engraved stylist can work with a single piece of clothing in quite different ways.
The spell is called variability.
For example, you can wear a trenchcoat as usual over the jeans, so like a T-shirt or coat, but you can also wear it on the naked body, put on shots and wear it as a dress.
It's enough to scratch up the sleeves or the collar and the whole look looks completely different.
"Play with it," he stressed.
But most of the advice came to me: "First you have to know the rules perfectly."
"Only then can you hurt her," said Jacob.
Finally, I understand why we need to break all these sets of lessons, what you can combine with something and why, even if you often see in fashion journals completely different.
Not to mention fashion watches.
Thanks to the photographer Ben, I now know that a stylist must have prepared much more clothing variants than he finally photographed.
So you have to be prepared for a fashion story with ten pages (speak ten outfits) to stall at least fifteen.
And also that the clothes on the photo in combination with other accessories sometimes look quite different than in reality.
So all of this must be expected when designing the outfits.
That image and style sometimes represent half of the success, that also confirmed us Jan Pokorný.
You just need to look at Madonna, a not exactly brilliant singer from which image and marketing have made a world star.
In the Czech Republic, the services of a stylist are rather reserved.
Also known personalities think this is often discarded money (the main thing is that I bring something that I look like is second-rank).
And if one of us is able to steal, then we should expect him or her to force us with great probability to have a completely different (smaller) size than he or she really needs.
Then you only need to google to make sure that the Boulevardpresse writes, the corresponding celebrity has increased or decreased, etc.
Jan and Mario put our heart on Sunday, not to believe that a stylist only needs to focus on fashion and then the outfit "to build together."
In his work, he must communicate mainly with the people he styles and he must be a well-qualified psychologist.
I think that is a good thing to do.
"If any manager orders us to see her wardrobe and to complement pretty pieces, then we can't clear her whole closet and say - my God, that's terrible."
"You have to find at least a few praiseworthy things to recommend what you can carry on," says Mario.
He also showed us very concrete what such a so-called "space bag" must contain.
So this is a bag that you knit on the waist and in which you carry all the necessary prophecies.
Except for such clear things, such as scissors, scissors for removing hair or safety needles, it also contains such equipment as a nylon thread (it helps the stylist to photograph products such as handbags or hats), special clips with which the clothing is mounted in the back if it is too large (stickers or other clamps are prohibited so that the substance does not break) and natural sewing equipment.
But in order not only to listen, but also to try something practically, we learned how to put shoes right under.
Also when photographing in the studio, where the floor is right, you can damage the shoe hole, sweep it outside.
We glued and we glued...
With the scissors, you can't even touch the shoes so you don't hurt them.
So you really have to do well.
Mario welcomed me by praising my "creation" without restrictions.
Because the aforementioned skill is not exactly my strength.
All this was just the fraction of what we heard at the second weekend continuing course.
One thing has become clear to me now - to dedicate themselves to styling at a professional level is not a children's game.
V Need for Speed: "The Run" - the illegal race across America
Review
The original careless journey is due to a series of completely avoidable dilettantic errors to the routine drive to the early shift.
Although it succeeded in fulfilling the ambitions to a large extent, what does it do if obviously no one wanted to do a little more.
Already before he came to the Ladentic, the new part with the subtitles "The Run" raised high expectations.
He promised to move the "Need for Speed" series that he had already earned again into a new dimension and in the playable demonstration examples he did not seem to be just one of many action racing games.
We were also curious about how the customized passages in which the main protagonist rises out of the car and goes on foot.
But as you are used to NFS, in the end, much is different than expected.
Certainly - potentially it is quite decent Arkade races, but overall the game is narrowed by some superfluous errors that have been present in this series for more or less a few years.
So it's not really any more mistakes, but rather signs of an incomprehensible faulty of the game developers in principle.
The adventure begins very well.
For the first time one is introduced into history, whose main character Jack has some personal problems; the only solution seems to be to take part in an illegal race across America.
In San Francisco, that is to say on the west coast, you get to the steering wheel - with the task of being the first to be in New York.
The Grundidee includes a whole range of interesting elements.
The entire route is divided into ten stages and divided into more than fifty single races.
This means that each race is carried out on a different track and that the individual stages take place in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
You don't have a moment the impression that game would always offer the same thing.
Some environments still have to be looked very pretty, although the technical level of the graphics does not go beyond that of the previous parts of the series.
So no world-moving thing.
But the journey through the desert, through autumn landscape or high above through deep snow landscape seems visually very pleasant.
Occasionally, untypical elements bring a little change in the individual races.
In the desert, for example, one is surprised by a desert storm that severely restricts sight.
In the mountains, you have to be careful not to be spoiled by a lawine.
By the way, the individual races are well built together.
Just a few, but they're good enough.
For a while you try to overtake the prescribed number of opponents (in principle a classic race), then you have time to pick up (classic race against the stop watch), then you expect another personal duel with a single contractor.
And the police are still interfering with that, trying to screw up the whole thing.
A novelty is a passage where Jack leaves the car.
This is more about some interactive animations where Jack flies from someone and where the player has to help him by pressing the right button at the right moment.
So nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are much less such passages in the game than one would expect (in concrete terms only three).
Finally, this is more of a benefit, because this element has at least no chance of getting boring - it belongs to the above mentioned elements that make the game more varied.
The driving model runs into the pedestrians of the previous parts.
That means, seen from today's point of view, it does not tear out trees, but one could not say it would be bad.
If you are looking for realistic simulations, you need to look around elsewhere.
However, the current driving model will continue to be very well matched by operating racing, even though it could be better found in competition.
Until then, everything is in order.
Real problems will only appear after some time.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is not quite OK
From a game of this kind it is hardly expected to calculate complicated deformations and collisions, but if you practically have no impact on any object idea how the car behaves, then obviously everything is not all right.
Typical example: In close overhaul or passing by on arriving cars one "strips" in some places the other car only easily, in other, almost identical situations, but one gets into the glow and turns wild pirouettes.
Or the car goes straight to scrap.
Thanks to the Restart system, it doesn't make any difference, but it's always annoying.
The residues are solved like this: if you have total damage or land far beyond the route, then you throw the game back to the last point of the route.
Only - in every race you only have five restorations.
When you've exhausted them, everything goes ahead.
So the restarts are more like a tool, in case something doesn't succeed, but you should not rely on it.
Sometimes, however, even the restoration does not help, there is nothing but the critical section learning out of the head.
Very unpleasant is that the same things often happen in the same places.
Some curves, for example, have to be passed in a very specific way, otherwise you simply don't fit through.
Otherwise, you always meet "civilian" cars in the same configuration at the appropriate place, whether you come first or fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is particularly annoying in situations when you see that the contractor is coming in front of a playing on two arriving cars, but until you get there, the cars are already in such a position that you have to drive them around or brake them.
And it doesn't matter when you get there, because everything is so designed that this situation always comes close to your nose.
The contractors have further advantages.
During the whole game there are a few places where you are always overtaken by the same opponent and even here again without regard to the time.
The most crazy thing is to finish the game on the long bridge that happens in the opposite direction.
The contractor's got to get one out of here obviously to the devil.
And if he's ever before you, he's gonna take a look at you, of course, so you start driving your own car in Klump a few times.
Of course - you just want to make the game more exciting and exciting but this intention is so clear that it quickly misses you the joy of the game.
And that's a shame, because despite a simple driving model, the game is all quite entertaining and occasionally also so handled that you almost no longer know where one of the heads stands.
And in principle it doesn't matter what "blame" is - the concept with fifty unique routes, the arrangement of the races in a way that no boredom can occur, or something quite different...
An unusual idea is also the car change during the race.
You must not overlook the gas stations on the route, because right here you can change the car, although in most cases the car you have is sufficient.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are well suited for the urban areas, the strong American limousines for the straight motorways and exotic super sports cars for the technical journeys, for example on the serpentines in the mountains.
Hand in hand with the mode of play history goes also the task mode (challenges) - i.e. the races in the individual localities that you know from history.
There are not only medals here, but also points of experience for your own profile, which is shared for the tasks (challenges) and history.
In order to reach the higher driver level, various objects need to be opened: starting from the car to the background of the profile.
This is connected at the same time to the online function Autolog, which compares among others its own results with those of other players and also ensures further collective functions.
One of other incomprehensible cuts is a situation in the last race of history.
This is where you come by car into a metro tunnel (my way), where you run along the tracks in the dark (my way).
On the Tacho, numbers are looking between 150 to 200 km / h (my way), but there comes a subway from the back at once and drives a compromise-free to scrap.
In our editorial work, I think we're going to have a long debate on whether this was a blackout of the game designers or whether the authors think we're so stupid.
The technical side is not overwhelming but at least the visual overall impression is in most cases quite appealing and even brilliant here and there.
The more annoying it is that at some exciting moments the frequency of repetition is slowing down and this sometimes quite dramatic.
However, this concerns, in particular, accidents with a greater number of operators, where a continuous FPS is not useful anyway.
The sound reproduction is so far O.K. and the soundtrack is tasteful.
In trying to address as broad a scale as possible rather young audience, a soundtrack a lá "of everyone something" was created - but who buys himself such a game because of the music?!
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run? The feelings are rather mixed.
If the game would not be reduced by the mentioned totally unnecessary errors, we would have been able to say with the breast tone of conviction that The Run is the best piece of NFS in recent years.
But that's how the game seems somehow unfinished.
A great pleasure in itself, but one should be prepared for you to put these mistakes in the eye with the power of airport headlights.
Concert of the "Students of the All Revolution" with singing ensembles from Karlsuniversitet
The Festival Festa Academica offers for the third time the quickening of the World Student Day with the anniversary of the Samtner Revolution and this as well as musician experience.
In the course of the festival, the twenty professional and university chores are presented.
The festival focuses on the two concerts held on 17 November.
"Karlsuniversitet has a great share of the festival."
"Among the participants, the choir of the pedagogical faculty and the faculty of humanist studies is also represented, and in the festival committee, the principal Václav Hampl," led the head of the organization team, Jakub Čaloun.
Absolute highlight of the festival is the public concert of scholars, which takes place on 17 November from 14 a.m. in front of the National Technical Library in Dejvice.
The program includes the composition of the important Czech Jazzer Karel Ržička "Celebration Jazz Mass."
In the evening hours, in the gallery of the People's House in Vinohrady, the concert "Students of the Comprehensive Revolution" (Studenty sametu), where also university chores occur, does not exclude choirs of the Karlsuniversitet.
Festa Academica has the goal not only to celebrate the World Student Day and remember the 22nd anniversary of the Samtner Revolution, but to present choral music to the public at the highest level and to promote creative cooperation between young people.
The main organizer is the Association of Czech Chöre in cooperation with the Johannes Kepler Gymnasium.
The screenplay over the entire event took over Bohuslav Svoboda, the mayor of the capital Prague and Václav Hampl, the principal of Karlsuniversitet.
The festival will take place from 16 to 20 November in Prague and Pardubice.
The drafting plan also includes numerous music meetings, student happanings, matinees and other events, except for party concerts.
Detailed information can be found on the website of the festival www.festaacademica.cz
EU Ambassador Vicenová:
The Czechs have the reputation of negativists and Eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has brought the balance between the various institutions felt out of the fate."
I didn't expect such a hard war to burn. "
"It will take five or six years until the walls slipped and all of them will be used to their new role," Milena Vicenová, the Czech Ambassador at the European Union, started a rather sharp lecture at the Juritical Faculty.
How serious she takes the motto "understandable and open about Europe," she already demonstrated in the first part of her presentation, in which she succeeded in describing the individual EU institutions and their mutual relations in such a clear and understandable way that she could have envy some of the lecturers of the University of Karel.
Ms Vicenová also commended the new permanent chairman of the Herman Van Rompuy Council of Europe:
"At first, criticism became that he was too unnoticeable - a grey official who had not grown such a role, but I have to say that it has defeated everyone's breath, how well he accepted the matter.
"He is a person who is ready to listen to seven and twenty Member States with patience, communicate with them and, above all, have a clear idea of how to proceed with the EU.
She then explained the new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy as an answer to the question: who is this - the European Union? What number should I call? ", which is an important step towards agreement and better readability of EU policy towards countries such as China or India.
No one wants to prohibit us from our oil mouthful quarry
Ms Vicenová also devoted herself to the agenda according to which the European Union lived and intended to live in the near future.
The Czech Presidency of two years ago described it as a success.
The Czechs would have mastered the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also organised the Eastern Partnership Summit.
The case of the government during the Presidency was considered to be a major negativity which had seriously damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently fully committed.
In the words of the ambassador, it was not only the Presidency but also the subsequent crisis, which has not yet been overcome, quite hectic.
And the seven-year EU budget still needs to be approved, which makes it much more complicated precisely because of today's economic situation.
Whether it will be a slim and efficient budget, which sectors will be given priority, which countries more and which less will be promoted - all of this is now on the agenda.
The ambassador also reminds her own slogans, with whom she came to Brussels: "Understandably about Europe."
"If I don't like something, it's horrible shorts, strangers and specialist jargon that no one understands.
How can I, as a citizen, really know whether you really have a crush or round cucumbers and different large bananas in Brussels or whether someone really wants to ban us the quarry?
It would also have liked to use the EU's soil to get more Czechs into European institutions.
Europe of two or different speeds in view
The EU Ambassador believes that the Czechs are in the name of being Eurosceptics who perceive more the negative than the positive sides of the matter.
The weaker representation of Czechs in European institutions is all the more annoying.
This is due to many factors, including the restraint of our candidates, their inability to write motivation letters, and not least the weak support of the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, it also highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, the so-called V4.
"Believe me, when a polar or Hungarian comes to me and a slowake is near, the Frenchman next to me says," Hey, what are you heads together - is that your V4 again? "and making a pretty sour meadow.
According to Mrs Vicenové, the EU is expecting hard rules for Member States' budgetary policy in the future.
As much more real, as a "European Federation," it sees the concept of a Europe of two or even different speeds.
"We have the countries of the euro area and the countries outside the euro area.
"We have the Schengen area and we already have the Institute of Strengthened Cooperation."
"For the first time, it was said that only the countries that want it should cooperate and those who do not want it should stand quiet aside."
"There will be more and more such institutions, which ultimately leads to a strong Europe of different speeds," Mrs Vicenová expects.
In this respect, it also appreciated the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in enforcing the principle that all issues having an impact on the EU as a whole must be discussed by all Member States and not only by the euro area countries.
Brand Story:
The innovator IBM enters the second century of its existence
If one wanted to look for a matching word that IBM's strategy characterized the most accurately, this would probably be the word "longevity."
For the general public, IBM is the synonym for technological revolution, it is known as a modern company, although it has passed a century since its creation.
The basis for this longevity was already her first boss, the visionary Thomas J. Watson.
Already he represented the slogan, countless global problems could easily be solved if people were willing to think a little.
His slogan "Think!" became a trademark to play the life of the future giant (and at the same time the title of the company's internal magazine that IBM began to issue in 1935).
This was also the basis of Watsen's thoroughly prepared corporate culture.
"For us from IBM this long-term thinking means a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM survived and was also successful for a whole century because it remained faithful and did not fear to change everything else around it.
This allowed us to transform technology, business and society during our first century.
We hope that we will make more in the next hundred years, "said Samuel J. Palmisano, the current director of the company on the occasion of the anniversary.
Maintainable system
Watson has been doing social care for his employees in the thirty years - in the same way as the entrepreneur Baňa in Czechoslovakia: IBM people had paid vacation as one of the first American employees, an insurance by the entrepreneur plus elegant uniforms as work clothing and a thorough pay system for the best newers and dealers.
The long-term relationship between IBM and its customers is also clear.
From the beginning, the company has been brilliant in the promotion of talent - one of the first companies worldwide raised any discrimination against IBM - and has been able to choose accordingly.
In line with this anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan that Palmisan will be replaced next year at the top of IBM by a woman - Virginia Rometty.
It has been with IBM for thirty years and has so far taken the position of the veto, marketing and strategy phin.
IBM has been making so-called online brainstormings in recent years, from which many future strategies and innovations grow.
No wonder - ideas are enough, in the company almost half a million people are employed.
An institution with a good reputation
Your unshakable position in business guarantees a strong image to the company and this to the inside and to the outside.
"From the outset IBM had the concept of an institution rather than just a technology company," Economist said the professor of Harvard Business School and the author of a book about IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems using technologies," added George Colony from the Consulting company Forrester Research.
As the company itself underlines, it is a difference to be only present on the market or to form it directly through this presence.
IBM - called in the states of their logo because of family "Big Blue," has grown into one of the largest companies in the world in a century.
It is one of the most versatile technology companies at all - IBM develops hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consultation services in an incredible range of products - from servers to nanotechnology.
Of all American technology companies IBM owns most patents and five of its employees have already been awarded the Nobel Prize.
His most famous inventions include bank machines, credit cards, financial swap, string code or the disk.
IBM was the second largest technology company this year (just after Apple) with some 220 billion dollars of stock exchange (market capitalisation), the first time since 1996, it has overtaken Microsoft.
The view ahead
Not all products and innovations met the taste of today's customers - unfortunate, for example, were the attempt with their own operating system OS / 2, the online service Prodigy or even IBM PC jr.
"Business is based on the forward movement, so you must not commit emotionally to the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
IBM therefore has no problem building its basic walls on different platforms - and if they do not work, they will leave again.
Unlike the counterplayer Microsoft, which is in principle Windows and falls with its operating system.
Successful technologies
IBM's gains are largely involved in services, software and hardware, each of which is one fifth.
Hardware was still the strongest in 1990 with a more than fifty percent share.
Since 2000, IBM has sold little profits from depreciating assets worth 15 billion dollars, but at the same time it invested 58 billion dollars in purchasing future technologies.
In these investments, IBM continues after 2008, when the newly-timed financial crisis fought like a storm over the world for the first time.
Here too IBM remained faithful to the legacy of his first boss Thomas J. Watson, who in the middle of the big world economic crisis increased its investment volume.
Up to now, it seems that IBM has survived the current crisis without prejudice.
The value of IBM shares has increased by 120 percent since 2008 and the company's return gain has continued to grow.
IBM's business logan is: everything can be changed - only the values cannot be changed.
This is also why it is expected that this flexible giant will also champion the next crisis.
IBM history: From cheese cutting to global flights
The company IBM (International Business Machines), founded in New York a hundred years ago, initially had a rather complicated name - Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
She took the name IBM only in 1924 - originally it was a brand name for a branch in Canada and South America.
The founding stone to the later company IBM was the merger of four companies whose history dates back to the 1980s of the 19th century.
They possessed technologies such as the famous card watches to register the beginning and end of work.
Charles Ranlett Flint became the architect of this new company, who was also chairman of the Supervisory Board until 1930.
And it was Flint who hired the head of the competition company Thomas J. Watson to help him manage the company.
This Leader then even put the founders of IBM in the shadows - based on Watson's ideas to date is the invincible culture and identity of the company.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as the name betrays, began with the manufacture and distribution of all kinds of machines for trade - from sausage and cheese cutting to cash.
In the first four decades Watson led the company, he doubled its sales to nine million dollars and the company gradually expanded to all continents.
Watson was so indispensable for the company that he was in the chair for the whole forty years, only then he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence and also developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, engineers and computers from IBM helped to lead flights to space - to Merkur and Saturn and in 1969 also the famous flight of man to the moon.
In 1964 IBM developed the first computer family with the same computer architecture - the IBM System / 360 series.
A classic PC that set the computer standard of that time came to the market in 1981 under the name IBM 5150.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, but on the other hand it purchased the consultant part of the company PricewaterhouseCoopers and thus fully entered the business of consulting services and services with high added value.
The strategy that IBM has been paying out over the last three years is the concept of "Smart Planet."
It embraces the intention to use technologies in a wise way in areas not even planned so far, for example to improve the situation in transport and urban administration.
In the commercial sector IBM recently introduced the Smarter Commerce platform to help traders run the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in the Czech Republic.
In 1932, IBM founded a branch in Czechoslovakia - the first country in Central and Eastern Europe at all.
Today IBM ČR also operates a strategic outsourcing centre in Brünn.
The Central and Eastern European Centre is located in Prague and there is also a world-level top research team dealing with voice recognition technology.
Darina Rychtářová about her unfaithful husband:
Iveta - you can keep this donkey, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) says - now it's over!
After her husband Josef Rychtáő (53) had become her lover from the protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), Darina remained the hope that Josef would wake up from his rosé dream and come home.
But now it is finally over with patience and she has set clear rules for the future of life.
"Josef can come home, but no more than my partner," said D. Rychtářová.
When Darina Rychtářová, the singer I Bartošová, had offered refuge in her own house, she would not even have realized in her dream, as it goes out with her husband.
When Iveta moved out on her pressures after 30 days, and returned to Líčany, Josef went with him.
Yeah, he even knew publicly that he loved her.
With time, Darina resigned, yes, it even seemed that she wanted to reconcile with her unfaithful husband - now she finally gave him the passport.
Rychytářit doesn't care who his wife sleeps with
If RychtáňIveta Bartošová should leave in the future, then he will certainly not receive open arms at home.
"He is the biological father of my dreams, and if he wants to decide his days in our common home, I will not hunt him out."
"However, not as a beloved, lost old donkey, but as a human being to whom I still have certain ties," she betrayed Rychtářová; but she also said that she has already been emotionally separated from him and is alone on mutual decency.
The fact that Darina has locked the back door to him, Josef has so far had dignity.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'll stay with Iveta, nothing will change."
"My wife wants a paper marriage and I respect it."
"The company continues, I'll take care of the repairs, the garden, the property, I'll make the purchases."
"With Darina I'm talking perfectly normal, only the bed we don't share," said J. Rychtáň( the leaf) Blesk.
If Darina wants to find a new love, he wouldn't stop her from it.
"We don't sleep together, so I don't care if she has a friend or who it is.
I realize this is my fault, I fell in love with Iveta, and that's why I take all responsibility.
The worst female indignity, how are you?
If you ask the men to call some typical feminine indignity, they shake exceptionally some prompt out of the sleeve.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, in which we let some unsettled revelations happen again, which will let men blood in the veins?
Purchase search
Does their husband pretend to be a buyer?
Do you have to buy at least one hader weekly?
Do you like to go shopping and can it also be a little more in action?
Then I guess in your case it's really about a weakness.
Some women are at least aware of this and are trying to keep their shopkeepers under control.
But hand on the heart, which woman is already holding to try to find a well-sitting upper clothing just through a garment shop and not try out all (in all possible color combinations) in the cabin?
Even though shopping for most women is a hobby, for men it is often pure hell.
Why don't you think about how many times they've told her husband? You'd better stay outside.
Continuous dissatisfaction
"Aren't I too fat?"
"I should take at least five kilos - should I start jogging or doing gymnastics?"
"Do I even like you?"
Does that seem familiar to them?
Yeah?
Then you must also be one of the women who are quite obsessed with what they look like.
That doesn't mean you're supposed to let go, but a lot of men are allergic to it when their wife's always complaining about her appearance.
The stronger sex agrees - with the increasing frequency of complaints women are increasingly intolerable.
Order and cleanliness at first place
It's a fight against windmills.
Clean windows, wash tiles and dust, shake the tub - and this at least twice a week.
Are you cheating with your partner because he's trampling with dirty shoes on the clean tiles again, you kicked the kids because the just shocked washbasin is dirty again and because the glass door at the locker has again fingerprints where polishing makes so much effort?
If you suffer from this kind of "deviation," you should know that you are not allowed to exaggerate anything and that the order and cleanliness of family life are not at the forefront.
In the end, this immeasurable purity fiddle can also harm the mutual relations and, above all, the rest of the family.
Tags
"Dirty gym pants come into the laundry basket."
"Do you really want to wear the old socks again tomorrow?"
"A wet towel doesn't just throw on the floor."
If your partner is exposed to such a tirade, you must not wonder that this brings him to the palm.
Of course it's not bad meant, they just want to have everything in order.
If the men knew that, then the women might not have needed to meckle so much.
Clatch and Cratch
Some women like to clatch and chattering, they are wrinkled behind their back or even wrinkled, or you're forging alliances.
Women are now focused on relationships, so they like to go through such issues, for example - who, where, with whom, how and why.
I guess each of us women has a little harmless squeeze and squeeze in camp.
Hand on the heart - that's probably all women's own.
But that is not to be confused with the most graceful calibers that are nothing and no one is holy, who may despise anyone in their surroundings and which are particularly dangerous to women's collections.
Jágr and Voráček reconcile Philadelphia with their assistants to victory
The Ice Hockey Storm Jaromír Jágr had a large share of the 5: 3 victory of Philadelphia on the ice in Carolina with two assistants on Monday's NHL game and is thus again the most productive Czech player in the NHL.
In both cases, Claude Giroux, who added an assistant and was named the best player of the game, was the beneficiary of the overview of the nineteenth-thirty-year ice hockey star.
Two assistants in the same game also recorded Jágr's co-player Jakub Voráček.
Jágr claimed after the game journalists that he had Giroux a great evening prophecy.
"Already before the game, I'll tell him that he is successful today."
I kind of felt that. "
"All the time, a feeling like this comes through," Jágr said, after Giroux's action, when the Flyers first shot a gate.
A little later the second hit also had "a Czech track."
Voráček fought the Puck behind the gate of the Hurricanes and presented it to the successful Maxim Talbot between the circles.
One second before the first-third pfiff, home player Patrick Dwyer achieved a short-hander, but the second-third then belonged to the Flyers again.
Concrete Giroux.
In cooperation with Jágr, he reached his third hit and later led Wayne Simmonds to the fourth gate.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't want to say that he is the best player in the league, but he certainly belongs to the best three," Jágr appreciated his center.
"In my life, I would not have realized that when I finished my career with such an ice hockey player as with him."
"I'm so excited."
"I'm cutting my game at me."
"All these years in the NHL my players put their game on me and now the spit turns around," Jágr sparked.
Carolina still made the game a drama - by the hits of Tuoma Ruutua and once again Dwyer, who passed out of a criminal shot, it came to a gate.
However, Matt Read prevented any further complication in which he was successful in over two against one.
"Excellent Pronger still acting in our zone."
"He caught the puck, I took a ride and (read) moved to remove posts."
"I tried to meet him and I'm glad it worked," Voráček described the last hit of the party from his perspective.
With this victory, Philadelphia was at the top of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal Jaroslav Špaček injured himself in the game against Buffalo and took off in the second third for injury to the upper body.
The Candidates, alongside Beck, also experienced their leadership in penalty shooting 2: 3.
Tomáš Plekanec was not able to transform one of the criminal shots.
More than the lost points probably hurt the trainer of home manhood the high disease-related failure in the defensive - the game they played only with five defense players at the end.
"That's bad."
"We only finished the meeting with one experienced player, the rest were young players."
"But there is nothing to do with this," said Jacques Martin.
"In every change, one wave of attack after another, and we had nothing to oppose it."
"We should have made the game easier and brought the puck out of our third."

The Czech Torhüter Ondřej Pavelec defended thirty shots of Tampa Bay and thus contributed decisively to 5: 2 victory over Winnipeg.
At the gates of the Jets, which ended a series of five defeats, five different shooters had a share.
Trends in travel prices since 1989
Until 1989 there were only five authorised state travel agencies in ČSSR: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Recrea and Autoturist.
The travel agencies only sold journeys to the socialist East Block countries at the time, and in the West only selected.
And so Czech tourists travelled to the Baltic Sea (the German Democratic Republic - the GDR), to the Soviet Union (Sochi on the Black Sea Peninsula), to Bulgaria and Romania to the Black Sea and to Hungary to the Balaton.
A minor exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when one could also travel to Yugoslavia, then Yugoslavia took a pro-western course and therefore travel to Yugoslavia was severely restricted.
A great paradox of those socialist times was that it was not even allowed to travel freely within the framework of the socialist countries by citizens of the East Block (i.e. the Czechoslovakia).
For example, if a citizen of the ČSSR wanted to travel individually to Poland or even to the Soviet Union, he needed a so-called invitation letter, otherwise individual trips were not possible.
Even then the travel agencies also offered trips to the West, but then one had to buy huge snakes or stay in the sleeping bag in front of the travel agency, or at least have "good acquaintances" in the travel agency.
This was not the case for a long time.
The so-called foreign exchange usage - the condition for an exit to the West - was granted only "politically reliable" people - the others were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovakian currency was not a free exchange currency, so it would have been impossible to raise the necessary financial resources (Western currency) for a trip to the West.
The white majority of Czechs therefore spent their holidays in the country, no wonder that the Czechs bought countless weekend houses and dicks - a habit that lasts until today.
The total revolution of 1989 followed a journey revolution of the Czechs on foot.
While until 1989 a holiday in the GDR or Bulgaria was the measure of all things, the Czech Republic spent 4.5 million of its foreign holidays last year in countries around the world.
A tremendous paradox, which is no longer known today, is the fact that one could not travel to the currently most popular holiday country of the Czech Republic - Croatia until 1989, because it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
From the beginning of the 90s of the last century, foreign exchange obligations in neighbouring Western European countries were abolished, leading to a huge wave of short visits mainly to Vienna in Austria and Germany.
The Czechoslovakians simply couldn't get enough for a long time from their trips to the West, everyone wanted to have been there for at least a few days.
So the Czech holidaymen slept on traveling to Paris in the tent in the park, because who had already had the money for accommodation at the hotel or in a pension at that time.
A typical feature of foreign travel from Czechs was a trunk with preserves, beer and permanent sausage, etc.
Another important milestone was the introduction of the free exchange of Czech crown - after decades our tourists were finally able to buy the western currency freely.
Our level of life and thus also the average salaries increased, which led to another important moment in 1997.
Thanks to the increased travel demand, travel agencies began to prepare regular travel by charter flights after 1997, making flight trips unbelievable compared to the past thanks to the possibility of negotiating quantity discounts.
At the end of the 1990s, the Czechs, with the exception of the United States, already had a currency-free payment transaction with all the highly developed countries in the world, making travel even easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of "post-gathering" travel came in 2000, when the first direct charter flight to an exotic country - to Thailand, thanks to the high demand.
Since then, direct charter planes with Czech passengers have been flying to far away sunny countries every year; this year you fly 12 exotic destinations directly from the Czech Republic.
To the 100 Tsd. Czechs travel every year to exotic countries!
Another important moment in the epoch, which characterised our "post-revolutionary" development, came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the US suspended the visa requirement for Czech tourists, which definitely included our country among the highly developed countries in the world.
In 2008, the Czechs spent for the first time more than half their holidays abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history they spent more than 15 Tsd per head for a single vacation stay including the cost of holidays.
The general meeting is supposed to find a new chairman - again a patt is threatening.
For almost five months, the Czech football has not been a chairman, threatening that the successor of Ivan Hašek at the top of the Czech football association (FAČR) will not even be known after the extraordinary general meeting on Thursday in Nymburk.
So far, there is no agreement on what electoral order is to be elected.
And without this there is no vote at all on the three potential successor.
Three interested parties would like to manage the Czech football - Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
In June, Hašek withdrew from his function, calling on his colleagues to agree and find a strong personality that could lead football in the future.
Only - in the era to Hašek, the old crosses broke out again between the two chambers of association which cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was apparent on 16 September when the new chairman was to be selected.
The delegates of the General Assembly had come to the People's House in the Prague district of Smíchov for nothing, because the negotiation did not lead to a result and it was not just about the election itself.
It was not even possible to agree on who is actually entitled to vote in the plenary session - only the statutory representatives or the functionaries equipped with a power of power.
At least part of the agreement was reached on this one point, including the recommendation of the State and Law Institute, which, in the opinion of the Court of First Instance, does not have the right to represent on the basis of full power.
However, the disputes about the electoral order continue.
Even the Executive Committee did not bring any more clarity to the matter, at which meetings - whether ordinary or extraordinary - are in principle nothing else at all on the agenda.
Although the views on the election changed a few times - the neuralgic point remained the same.
The question is how to proceed in the third round in order to avoid a patt situation.
"The point of dispute concerns the question of whether to proceed in accordance with the Statute or whether a completely different model needs to be found," Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice-chairmen of the FAČR, who represents the professional football in management.
According to the statutory model, in the third round, the candidate who receives the greater percentage of support in the chamber for which he candidates.
Morocco is allegedly ready to comment on the compromise that the candidate who receives the higher number of votes from both chambers is victorious.
In turn, the Czech side is subject to the condition that the winner receives at least one third of the majority of the vote in this percentage.
"Then the two pre-rounds no longer have any sense, this mode would question the whole two-chamber concept," Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian side, which found it best not to bend the electoral order, but to choose according to the valid statute.
It is also surprisingly agreed with Tomáš Paclík, although it is clear that the statutory electoral order of all candidates is most likely to meet Pelta.
"My wish is to be elected as far as possible after the Statute."
"In order to avoid any insane replacement variants, as at the last general meeting," said the owner (the football club) Victoria Plzeň, who first candidates and in his opinions was mainly linked to Pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic.
In his opinion, the new president will be known in Nymburk and he believes that the candidates will also work together constructively in the future.
"The possible qualification of the national team for the football EM today would certainly help to calm the minds."
"If the football rides on the euphoric wave, the willingness to cooperate is also greater," says Jablonec's functionary, who brings the greatest experience of all three adepts, and this at both professional and regional level.
Rajchl is more restrained.
"I hope for an agreement, but unfortunately the situation is dubious."
"This is not a matter between people from Bohemia and Morocco, but there are some efforts to" correct the rules for their own purposes. "
"Therefore, reblocking at the General Assembly is not excluded."
"I hope, however, that the healthy sense of mind will eventually win," said Rajchl.
Only - a lot of time to agree on all sides is no longer left.
Some negotiations are supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether football generality will be complete until the qualification game is at all.
The charter plane, with which, among other things, Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl should fly to Podgorice, could not start in the morning in Prague because of a technical disturbance, and so they were fierce searching for a replacement variant as to bring a part of the executive committee to the location of the Barrage Games.
In the end, the meeting at ministerial level, which is supposed to be on Wednesday, is probably crucial.
Josef Dobeš, the Minister for Education, Youth and Physical Education, would have liked to move the split parties within the country's largest sports association to an agreement.
There is a lot at stake: state subsidies, the credibility of the Czech football and also the forthcoming CSSTV general meeting, which is intended to lead the new direction to the Czech sport following the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclik is fighting for the position of the chairman because he does not see a suitable candidate
If Tomáš Paclík, the head of the Pilsner football player before the extraordinary general meeting, could have been a strong candidate who would have fulfilled all his ideas about the new chairman of the Czech Federation of Football (FAČR), he would not have taken part in the struggle for this top position at all.
"If there were a good candidate, I would fight for him and refrain from choosing."
"But in the current situation it did not succeed in finding such an addict," said Paclík ČTK.
The main reason for Paclík to go to the duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl is therefore to prevent the alleged favorites of the election, Pelta, from reaching the top of the FAČR.
Paclík also emphasises that in the event of his victory, he intends to perform the role of the chairman only one year, i.e. until 2013, until the date of the ordinary general meeting.
In the position of the chairman he would have liked to see an experienced top manager who is not too much involved in the football event.
"I spoke personally with some people in question."
"It's hard to believe that some people told me that they didn't want to identify themselves with the Czech soccer at the moment.
"Such views would have liked to have changed," he said.
Most of all, Paclík allegedly disturbs Pelta's connection with the chairman of the Pilsner District Football Association Roman Berbr, a man with controversial reputation, who is considered to be a powerful lobbyist behind the scenes, with the ability to influence delegate votes on main gatherings.
For Paclík, it is therefore unacceptable that Pelta should have the position of the chairman.
"In his victory, today's condition would be preserved and in Czech football it would not go any further."
"The support by Berbr, a clever businessman, got twice bad for football," said Paclik.
He also insists that Pelta's name fell a while ago in connection with phone interrogations to investigate a corruption affair, but that Pelta came out of it.
"I don't know what Prestige should bring a victory of Pelta to (tsh.) football."
"And how would we stand there in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," řekl Paclík, who said his previous statement, "he will sell the Pilsner football club if Pelta becomes chairman," but sees a little more left.
However, if Paclík were to win in the Thursday election, he could imagine a future cooperation with Pelta.
Also another candidate - Rajchl, who had supported Paclik before the general meeting in October, ended with a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I'd go to."
"He has great skills."
"I could imagine him as the head of the national team, for example."
"But I don't think he's capable of running the association as a manager."
"I am not putting my nose on matters that I don't understand about," said Paclík, who had made sure in September that he was at the forefront behind the dismissal of the Arbitration Commission with Luěk Macela, who replaced Dagmar Damková.
Paclík himself claims he feels the role of the association chairman grown.
He is also the head of Pilsen, who celebrated the first triumph in the league in May with his support.
"I have the power to change something in the football environment and contribute to a certain cultivation of this."
"In order to restrict the influence of certain stakeholders who tend to influence disciplinary and professional commissions, which prevails in miserable situations," said Paclík, who does not make a heal from his antipathy, for example, to the Sparta chief Daniel Křetínský.
As one of his priorities, he saw the strengthening of relations between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with which he would lobbying political leaders for more money from the lottery tax to go into sport.
"This is one of the crucial things that the new chairman should devote himself to."
"If it comes to taxation of gambling, as the political parties declare, then I understand their argument, but they also have to cut and say clearly where the money goes," he said.
His connection to the Pilsner Club also does not regard Paclík as a handicap, although he himself emphasises that the chairman of the FAČR must be "superior."
Pelta is connected to Jablonec, Rajchl with the Prague Dukla.
"That's not exactly ideal."
"I don't think it makes much sense to transfer my shares in the Pilsner Club to a third person in order to return to one and a half years," Paclik explained.
Pelta promised new FAČR statutes, which will trigger a patt situation in the future.
Two days before the general meeting of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the Presidency office, namely Miroslav Pelta, promised that he would make a strong contribution in the event of his election to the FAČR's new statutes which would exclude any future dispute on the electoral order from the outset.
The Jablonec official is confident before the Thursday negotiation in Nymburk and believes that the election campaign will certainly deteriorate in the event of a possible success of the Czech selection.
Pelta had already promised before the unrealised election in September that he would focus on the national team and the acquisition of funds in the event of his election.
He decided only at the last moment to participate in the election before the last general meeting, so he liked to help the two-month break to defend his ideas about the direction of football and present him in a broader context.
"People at all levels dedicate themselves to football, they are impatient and therefore expect the chairman to be known on Thursday."
"He feels that it is high time that the association was led by someone," says the man who is primarily connected to the Jablonecer club, but who also acted for many years at Sparta and the Executive Committee.
He also believes that he has sufficient experience to lead the Czech soccer.
He is convinced that today's problems with the election are the responsibility of the Euphory, which reigned at times of Ivan Hašek.
"Unfortunately, the general meeting in June approved statutes which were not as complete as they had all been adopted.
If they had not allowed different interpretations, we would have had a chairman from September, "said Pelta.
It was precisely the revision of the main document of the Civil Society that he used as a lockdown for the delegates.
"If I become chairman, I accept it personally and am willing to bear personal responsibility if it doesn't work."
"This is a fundamental thing he cannot be without," Pelta claims.
In addition, he does not try to divide himself to his contractors.
He had previously announced that he could imagine a cooperation with Jindřich Rajchl, which he recognises due to his legal education, and he knows well that his countercandidate would be his first deputy.
Tomáš Paclík has long not attacked him, which in turn left no dry thread to Pelta.
In football he has been moving over a year and can already refer to certain successes. "
"However, his attacks were declining and many people were shocked by his campaign."
"This is why many of them now doubt his real character," said Pelta to his opponent, who must remain faithful to his proclamations, which he already expressed in September.
In his view, his strongest weapon is the knowledge of the football from the lowest classes to the national team.
And this should be the exit sign of Czech soccer balls.
"I would also endeavour to end all affair - from the Causa Bohemians to the detriment of the corruption scandal of last year."
"Soon afterwards, I would fall into negotiations with the private and state sector to ensure sufficient funding for all football," said the forty-six-year-old candidate ČTK two months ago.
At that time he also promised that his entry into the top of the Czech football would not mean any human cleansing.
"I should first get acquainted with the working content of all employees," he said towards Strahov, where due to the long anarchy, it is understandably nervous.
Despite the timely catastrophic scenarios accompanying the forthcoming general meeting, he believes that the delegates will not go to Nymburk for nothing on Thursday.
"If really the only controversial point is how to choose in the third round, we'll get over it."
"Football needs credibility and it only wins back by finally having a new Leader," Pelta remains optimistic two days before the possibly decisive day of his career.
Rajchl promises that the FAČR under him will start working hard
If the former Vice-President Jindřich Rajchl was to be elected to the general meeting on Thursday as the new chairman of the Czech Federation of Football, this would allegedly neglect many people in the association.
Rajchl promises to start working hard in the event of his choice.
He wants to introduce system changes and make the members of the Executive Committee responsible for individual football areas.
He also promised to solve the case of Bohemians, to improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, to bring more money into football, and otherwise to continue the work that the former president Ivan Hašek started.
"As chairman, I would like to dedicate myself to football as a whole."
Starting from international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, through national selection, professional football, to performance football for young people. "
"I don't want to say that I want to do everything alone," said Rajchl in conversation for ČTK.
"I am a team player and I would therefore like to distribute the competences of the Executive Committee in such a way that each member devotes itself to a certain area."
And I will distribute hard tasks to make football progress in every segment with mileage steps. "
Many would not be delighted about this, because instead of criticizing the work of others, they would have to start working really hard themselves, "he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, it was considered not to be candidates at all.
"I know I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that it makes sense and that people are behind me who are not unavoided throwing crap between my legs and questioning every step I take," he said as an explanation why he had hesitated.
"But many people told me that I should not give up because otherwise others would."
"This is trust that you can't play out," he said.
He also claimed to be motivated to continue the work he started under Hašek.
"In two years we have done a big piece of work and I don't want to throw it away."
"Processes have been launched which may only come into effect in a few years and I would hate to see someone stop," he said, and expresses his concerns that in case the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta would be elected, the situation could return to the times before Hašek.
"I believe in systematic action and this is something that Mirek Pelta does not bring."
"Behind him are people who would make the football so that he would only be there for the chosen ones."
I guess I can be accused of some things, but not that I'm a party. "
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want football for everyone, because then everyone is well and not just the chosen one," noted Rajchl.
He also contradicts the claim that he is only a chairman of the Czechs.
"Even though some people claim the opposite, I really intend to do the best for moths."
"For example, it is time to consider whether the league should not be divided into a Czech and a Moravian part, whose winners then climbed into the first league."
"Then it could not happen that today only three Moravian clubs play in the league, which is a problem especially for young players in Morocco," says Rajchl.
Because the head of the Pilsner Club Tomáš Paclík has joined the struggle for the role of the chairman, Rajchl does not trust to appreciate his chances of being elected.
"I feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has elected me to its Vice-President and now recognises that clear successes are behind me," said Rajchl, who also considers the saving of $10 million for unfavorable contracts, the agreement of television contracts and the negotiations on the lottery law to be his success.
On the other hand, he partly blames himself for the fact that the association does not draw on a single string.
While he says about Pelta, "he has been disqualified from the outset to help the Czech football to renew confidence," he believes the second rival - Paclík is a strong candidate who really has something to offer to the football.
"No one can question that he has done excellent work in Pilsen in just a year."
"If he were elected, he would probably continue the things that Ivan Hašek started, and he would obviously not change the staff occupation in the Commission in principle."
He would certainly not want to bend things to his favors, "Rajchl judges over his rivals.
Europe's most beautiful pools
Jump into blue
By Julia Stanek
Plank basin in Ufo optics, Prunkpools in Budapest: Anyone travelling through Europe can experience his blue miracle - and after a city tour or a hike rest the tired legs in sprudges.
A book shows where wellness is most beautiful in the water.
When Iris Meder went on a search trip in the last one and a half years, one in her luggage was not allowed to be missing: her bathing suit.
Lying on the water, she looked high in artificially shaped domes, she swammed marble pudding waiting for them at the basin edge, and astonished about acribtically restored juvenile floating halls.
If she liked a bath, she took it flying into her notebook - as well as knowledge of the construction and history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools explored architectural historian Meder in this way - and now presented her in her recently published book "Bathing Friends": People's Swimming Hall in Munich, historical bathing palaces in the Black Forest, "Hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus.
Through 13 countries she carried her "trip to the most extraordinary baths in Central Europe": alongside Germany, Austria and Switzerland she visited places in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true bathing culture enthusiasm.
With sport she doesn't have much on the hat, says Meder - only in the water it is different.
It's just annoying that swim fans have to find themselves with blue clamps and chlorine stank, while jogger can breathe into the disturbing fragrance of fighter forests or listen to happy bird squirrels in the park.
"I wondered one day why swimming pools must always be so ugly," says the media living in Vienna.
"So I started gathering beautiful baths."
Water surface doubled architecture
The wellness factor in baths is therefore so large that all senses are served, so Meder.
And when the builders have struggled, swimming halls can be a true eye mouse: "Instead of a floor you have a water surface in baths."
"It is transparent on the one hand, but reflects the beauty of the entire building on the other."
Everything is doubled optically: high wolves, colorful hairdressers, jump boards.
The kleinformatige image band "Bathing joys" provides knowledge on 190 pages about the architecture and cultural history of historical wellness oasis - but above all makes desire for a leap into the blue.
Remarkable specimens discovered the pool collector Meder in their research in Hungary.
In addition to the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, she found a nitrathic water in an unprecedented carnival cave (cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) and a thermal bath, whose basins are filled with alkaline water and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürsterben in Jászberény).
On the other hand, spectacular views offer many heated outdoor baths in Switzerland and Austria: while you are watching the entire city from the Zurich roof pool, you can look at the snow-covered Arlberg in the outdoor pool of a bath in St. Anton - and: In the steam bath there is a window to watch the drive on the ski slope.
The perhaps most extraordinary pool design awaits bathrooms in longitudinal fields: The Aquadome Ötztal looks like an Ufo just landed in the Alps.
From three upwards open shells it vaporizes in the winter, while in the background the mountains of the Otztal are rising into the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in every swimming pool, the pool collector climbed into the nose with the smell of chlorine.
Many thermal baths smell like sulphur, in the Árpád bath in Hungarian Békescsaba, it stinks so much of heating oil that you hardly believe to have landed in a health bath.
The smell comes from the alkali-hydrogen carbonate-like healing water, which is almost black and its wear sticks you to the skin as soon as you slip into the basin - a wellness experience of the special kind
In one place, however, Iris Meder was disappointed in searching for beautiful baths: when she wanted to visit the free and sunbathing in the Czech bathroom Luhatschowitz, she found a locked terrain.
The bathroom designed by architect Dušan Jurkovic in 1902 has been closed.
When Meder threw a look through the weathened windows of the red-white-yellow juvenile style building, she saw how weed grew between the tiles.
On the other hand, a spooky swimming pool in the Black Forest, the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad, has counteracted the fall.
Three construction phases have this bathroom already behind itself; you can discover not only neoromanian elements that come from the times of its construction in 1844, but also a Maurish hall in the Alhambra style, which was added around 1900.
Since the careful modernisation of 1995, the Palais Thermal has been the favorite swimming pool of the Pool-Kenner Iris Meder - not only because it originally comes from the Black Forest.
"It's already a performance to merge different construction styles to such a great unit," Meder says.
With such a palace, the dive in the thermal pool is apparently only secondary.
Agrar speculation
Deutsche Bank allows raw material business to shine through
By Christian Teevs
Does the Deutsche Bank abandon its business with agricultural raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to examine the consequences of speculation for the poor in the world.
In January, the head of the group then wants to draw consequences.
Hamburg -
For the federal citizens, the matter is clear: 84 percent of the Germans do not believe it is acceptable that banks speculate with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or maize.
Two thirds of the respondents even demand that the Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions get out of this business because it exacerbates the problems of the poorest in the world.
This is the result of a Forsa survey on behalf of the consumer organisation Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in the middle of October.
In this, the author Harald Schumann shows that the bets on the global commodity stock exchanges drive prices up - and therefore banks bear a part of the world's hunger problem.
The consumer protectors' campaign is specifically directed against Deutsche Bank Chief Josef Ackermann, even though large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similar.
Originally, commodity laws were intended to secure dealers against price fluctuations.
But now most experts agree that the Zockers have decoupled from supply and demand - and at the expense of the poorest profits.
Unlike the US competitors, Ackermann responded to the criticism: He promised to examine the accusations and said that no business was worth risking the good reputation of the Deutsche Bank.
According to the information provided by SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining the allegations contained in the Foodwatch report.
By the end of the year, the audit will be completed and the results will be presented to the Board of Directors of the Deutsche Bank - as well as a recommendation on how to deal with it.
At the end of January, the top of the bank will then inform us of the consequences it draws.
In the end, a reduction in the raw material business could be possible, or even the complete return.
Ackermann bases on his image
Foodwatch Chief Thilo Bode welcomed the message, but at the same time reaffirmed his criticism of the financial sector: "The bet on rising prices of foods shows particularly drastic how ruthless banks today damage the general well."
Ackermann is now a top bank lobbyist.
"The Deutsche Bank must remove all the assets from its portfolio where money is used for betting on food prices," said Bode.
"Whether Mr Ackermann is suffering from hunger or the reputation of the Deutsche Bank."
The insight of Ackermann comes surprisingly at first glance, but it is clear that the head of the group wants to give a perfect picture a few months before his departure from the office.
On Monday, the Deutsche Bank announced that the Board of Directors will not switch to the Supervisory Board differently than planned.
By turning away from the controversial agr speculation, he could improve his image.
And in order to make possible burdens, he hardly needs to be shy - it would eventually have to do his successor.
Each second would cancel raw material plants
Foodwatch is trying to keep pressure on the manager high.
More than 30,000 Internet users have already participated in the organisation's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Institute of Forsa interviewed 1001 people on November 7 and 8.
It is therefore only 11 percent that it is legitimate that the Deutsche Bank is offering facilities that are betted at food prices.
Many bank customers would also draw personal consequences if they learned that their bank participates in such transactions: each second would cancel the survey all installations where money flows into the raw material speculation.
43 percent would discount acquaintances from such a bank, 49 percent claimed to think about terminating their account and switching to another institution.
21's house in Vienna
The surrounded pavilion
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with heights, depths and Happy End: The Austrian World Exhibition Pavillon of Brussels in 1958 gained prizes, became a museum in Vienna, stood empty and chained.
Now he's being reopened as an exhibition house.
If it is warmed by modern post-war architecture, by clear shapes, glass halls, courageous swings and new building materials that are typical of the faith in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer for the Brussels World Exhibition 1958 is a suitable and famous example.
The pavilion of the tail received the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its lightweight and floating steel glass construction.
The construction is considered to be a milestone of contemporary architecture until today.
He announced to the architect that he also built at the next world exhibition of Austrian pavilion.
With his legendary BMW four-cylinder house plus shüsselartificial secondary construction in Munich, he was finally internationally famous in 1973.
His pavilion, planned as a temporary exhibition building, had been set up, rebuilt after the world exhibition in the Swiss garden at the Vienna South Station and opened a museum of the 20th century in 1962 - the "20th House" was called it.
However, the building was not suitable for spatial and technical purposes as a museum - no walls for hanging art, no good climate.
Nevertheless, it was used until contemporary art in Vienna got a new house.
Since 2001 the building was empty and came down more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has rebuilt the pavilion, now called "21 House," and will be used as a museum of contemporary art in the future.
On Tuesday evening, the Belvedere Museum, to which the house belongs, opens the first exhibition - a happiness event in all respects.
In 2007, Agnes Husslein-Arco became a new director of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere.
Husslein-Arco, promoted art historian with a considerable career among others in the youth as an ice careers, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as the founding director of the Museum of the Modern Salzburg, strongly implemented the reconstruction among politicians and monuments, purchased public funds and private sponsors and established the use.
In addition to contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba should be issued by the same-name foundation, a café and a bookstore should be provided and an office house had to be built to do so.
Strong supervision, small budget
For the implementation then crisis chanitz was the ideal occupation.
Not only because he had rebuilt and expanded Joseph Olbrichs Secession in Vienna sensibly and won the competition, but because he studied at Schwanzer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was a "extremely important place" where he had looked at the exhibitions "almost every weekend."
He knew the Ur design, and he knew the problems of the building, which was lost when he moved to Vienna and its use of generosity and ease.
There were far bigger problems in the current reconstruction: the building was "an energy sludge," says crisis chances.
The window profile of the glass facade has been exchanged, glass fibre reinforced insulating glass has been used and the glass roof has been replaced by special safety glass.
Cold bridge steel carriers have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos filled blankets have been cleaned.
Two substrates provided space for the new use, a lowered lighthouse between house and street ensures lighting, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new construction, but still the lightweight tail pavilion.
The original exterior doors have remained, the house is deleted in the old red-brown stainless protection color.
And the cinema is even exactly the way he used to be.
And all of this under strict supervision of the monument authority and with a small budget.
"Often a good and cheap material had to be found and the monument protection office also liked," says Krischanitz and points to a robust floor on the underfloor.
Despite all the constraints, problems and changes, the building has remained flexible and easy.
Krischanitz has recently said a typical "drop-in-the-city story."
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and still "wanted to raise a real consciousness."
In this case, however, the 21's house is not in the wrong place, because there has been a city-building happiness: around the Swiss garden, the completely newly planned "main railway station," with offices and residential houses, is created.
And another lucky thing might happen: the 21's house could get reinforcement from another crisis chanitz building, because the collector Francesca of Habsburg bought the Berlin Temporary Art Hall, and as you hear, she already negotiates with the city a neighbourhood site in the Swiss Garden.
Railway Plant Winter Crisis Package in Million Height
The train has a crisis plan designed to prevent train failure in winter.
The number of employees is to be doubled.
It costs millions.
In the fight against winter-related train failures and delays, the Deutsche Bahn reports that over 70 million euros will be spent this year.
The "picture" newspaper reported in advance on the basis of a group internal crisis plan that investments of around 300 million euros were planned by 2015.
In order to achieve better availability of vehicles and rail networks even in extreme weather.
Among other things, it is planned to double the internal and external staff for snow disposal on railway installations and stations to 16.000 people.
The aim is to free trains up to the start of the operation and 90 percent of the necessary weights within four to five hours from snow and ice.
Two months ago, after a top meeting with government and industry, railway chief Rüdiger Grube had warned about train failure and delays this winter.
Last winter, the train had considerable problems in passenger transport, as it lacks reserves, among other things, in difficult weather conditions.
For example, many new regional trains have been waiting for approval from the Federal Railway Office for years.
There is also a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway has also been creating for years that it has to have the axles of ICE trains checked significantly more frequently in the workshop after an ICE at the Cologne Hauptbahnhof had an axle break.
Deutsche Bank pays millions of penalties in the USA
After the Tumult around Chief Josef Ackermann comes new inconvenience from the United States: The Deutsche Bank has to pay a million bucks there.
As if the problems at home were not enough for the Deutsche Bank, the industry riders now also collect their past in the USA: the Frankfurter Institute pays 145 million dollars (106 million euros) in a comparison to settle disputes on the plea of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It's about selling mortgages.
The financial market regulator NCUA claims a whole series of large banks that cooperative banks have made false promises to purchase the financial products; they would have reduced the risks.
Such papers have been heavily lost in value during the financial crisis and the banks are rising into the depth.
"We are pleased that we could solve this issue without the parties having to go to court," said a German bank spokesman in New York.
The bank didn't blame the comparison.
This also applies to the Citigroup, which committed itself to payment of 20,5 million dollars.
The NCUA president, Debbie Matz, welcomed the return of the two money houses.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the US cooperative banks and starts with pleas to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA is trying to replace the billionaire damage.
The comparisons now concluded are the first of their kind
The regulator had also taken advantage of other large banks and sued JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs in the summer.
The mortgage-backed securities in question are so-called mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on skin credits.
When the US real estate bubble collapsed in 2007, this became a lot of financial companies.
In September 2008, at the peak of the financial crisis, the US Investment Bank turned Lehman Brothers.
Even though the events have been behind for a few years, banks are currently facing a sharp wind in the US.
Investors and supervisors have committed countless complaints to obtain compensation or to alleviate errors.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the largest piano.
It claims 18 international large banks to have overdistributed the two state US real estate finance fans Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in mortgage transactions in the volume of around $200 billion.
The Deutsche Bank also has to make a complaint by the FHFA, which concerns several transactions worth a total of $14.2 billion from the years 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority requires the Frankfurter to stand up for "material losses" without mentioning a precise sum.
The Deutsche Bank had rejected the claims as impatient and declared its intention to oppose them.
Warren Buffett increases with 10 billion at IBM
Finanzguru Buffett invests heavily in the IT company IBM.
Since March, he has purchased shares worth more than ten billion dollars.
So far, the great American investor Warren Buffett had always declared that he would not invest in IT and computer companies, as the long-term development of the companies is not predictable.
Now, however, he read IBM's business reports and changed his opinion on investment in the industry.
He had to understand much earlier that IBM mainly offers services and acquires computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
An investment by Warren Buffett is considered a knight hit in the financial world.
Therefore, the IBM is now allowed to call itself "Sir IBM."
Because Buffett now revealed in the US business station CNBC that he has bought IBM shares worth 10.7 billion dollars since March.
His investment holding Berkshire Hathaway has thus risen to one of IBM's largest shareholders with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that not even IBM had known anything about the commitment so far.
He praised the management that even in the economic crisis had provided proper profits.
"You did a great job," said Buffett on strategy.
IBM has spent some time focusing on lucrative IT services such as the operation of data centers.
The more than 100 years old computer pioneer also offers software and advice as well as powerful company computers.
Buffett had rather avoided technology companies so far.
He says he only invest in companies whose business he also understands.
Instead, Buffett approached a freight line, a lubricant manufacturer or machine builders.
His holding Berkshire Hathaway also owns some 80 own subsidiaries in a whole range of large companies such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Munich Rück.
In the 1960s the 81-year-old had taken over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway and expanded it with smart investments into one of the most valuable companies in the world.
Nevertheless, his lifestyle is modest.
He is therefore a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost unbelievable sense of money earning has given him the nickname "Oracle of Omaha."
After the Buffett investment was announced, the IBM share increased by one per cent in advance.
"Big Blue," as IBM is also called, is worth more than 220 billion dollars on the stock exchange, and is, together with Apple and Microsoft, one of the most valuable technology companies in the world.
At Microsoft, like Buffett said, he didn't want to get in.
Founder Bill Gates is a close friend.
The threat is tangible
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer Zelle" Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
A newspaper speaks of a "bloody ideology," which now lives again.
The murders of eight Turkish voters and a Greek small entrepreneur in the years 2000 to 2006 had a right-wing extremistic background.
This message is responded with fear and concern in Turkey and within the German population in Germany.
For many German Turks are returning a long-believed ghost: since the fire attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no similar violence with a right-extremistic background against Turks.
The fact that there is xenophobia in Germany was never in question.
However, the detected right-extremistic network reveals dimensions whose dimension is not yet foreseeable.
"Lives the bloody ideology again?" titled the Internet release of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk."
On the other hand, the newspaper "Sabah" underlines that one of the perpetrators should have been a V-man of constitutional protection, and shows concern that German authorities could also be involved in the legal radical swamp.
The Turkish commune reacted in Germany: on the weekend she remembered the victims of racist violence with a guardian in front of the Brandenburg Gate.
Only two weeks earlier, the Turkish municipality in Berlin had thought together with German and Turkish politicians in a feast of the fifty anniversary of the German-Turkish employment agreement.
In happy colors, the co-existence had been conceived - as a story of success.
As an ear coward, the reporting of some Turkish media works: "Germany's gift for the fifteenth" is the title of an article in the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X," which refreshes the background of the murder series.
Even the German edition of the "Hürriyet" cannot be taken to draw this grateful connection.
"It starts to smell," is the title of the column of Ahmet Külahci.
He stressed that people had been murdered who had paid taxes and made an important contribution with their work to the reconstruction of Germany.
It is extremely critical in German Turkish Internet forums to discuss the police's action and their subsequent success.
Why the German authorities did not think much more of looking for suspects in extremistic circles, the authors wonder.
Some of them are at least rhetorically prepared for drastic means: "If this continues to happen, the migrants will be left with nothing but self-defence and arms."
"This will be the best self-protection."
"The goodness of the education and adequacy of the punishment of the entire network depends very heavily on internal peace in Germany," writes "Selen."
What it means when internal peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s illustrate.
The photo of the fire ruins of Solingen is deeply anchored in German and Turkish memory.
For no other event showed more clearly to the living Turks that there is a tangible threat, and to the Germans that suspicion and distance can lead to judicial violence.
The attacks, however, strengthened the we-feeling on the Turkish side.
Do not repeat past errors
In the Turkish press, the failure of German politics was brightened after the attacks: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the fire attack of Solingen, he sent a sympathetic elegance to the Turkish President of the State, but he was represented at the funeral in Cologne by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel mentioned in his speech how many charges the local Turks did.
As a matter of fact, the value of a person is calculated according to the amount of his taxes.
The current report by the Turkish media once again shows how deep the mistrust of many German Turks has been in the current rule of law since then.
In addition to the efforts made to clarify and re-evaluate the extremity of terrorism in Germany, we need open words this time.
The Scandal Bank of Zurisee
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not in Italy or France but in Switzerland.
The UBS almost went bankrupt in the financial crisis and has since slipped from one crisis to the next.
Now I want it to be a German.
I'm sure Axel Weber didn't think so.
After his spectacular departure from the top of the Federal Bank, it was announced in July that he would enter an almost equally spectacular new job in 2013: Chairman of the Swiss Grand Bank UBS, an unexpected and lucrative career step.
Axel Weber publicly welcomed Switzerland whether its beauty and UBS were their newly gained solidity and made friendly comments about future colleagues.
"The UBS made the tournament."
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
But already in September it became clear that everything would be completely different.
A distributor of the UBS in London had circumvented all the bank's security systems and drowned around 1.7 billion euros.
UBS Chief of Board of Directors Oswald Grübel, a banker not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
The President-in-Office of the UBS has been regarded as being attacked since then - and everyone asks: when is Axel Weber finally coming?
It was already known that Weber was allowed to advise the bank from February 2012.
And he will take over the board of directors already in May - not until 2013, as the Bank announced on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber, it's going to be hard.
He is not a banker, rather an economist and notebooker, and would certainly have needed a time of refining.
With a stroke, he then assumes responsibility for the strategy of a bank that has just proven that it deserves the title of the largest European scandal bank.
Because the UBS is huge on the one hand - until recently it was the world's largest asset manager - and, on the other hand, has been slandering for years from a scandal in the next.
Nothing, it seems, remains the once so proud Swiss bank spared.
It started in the financial crisis.
Until 2007, the UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the silent and solid, but also buffered Swiss asset administrator had combined it with ambitious goals: she also wanted to become a very big number in investment banking.
In 2007, UBS managed more money than any other bank in the world with $1.6 billion.
On the other hand, as an investment bank, it was brought forward to the league of the largest banks in the world.
That made an impression.
The one-time banker and later long-standing bank professor in Zurich Hans Geiger said: "My students have always put the UBS as a model of a good bank at that time."
"From today's point of view, how could I be so wrong?"
He was so wrong.
In 2007, it was first apparent that something was wrong in the UBS.
In the middle of the year, head of the board of directors Peter Wuffli resigned surprisingly, which until then was considered highly intellectual and equally brilliant bankers.
A few months later, they figured out why he left.
The bank's investment parties had disguised themselves with subprime papers and had to write off billions.
In order to shoulder this, the UBS announced an increase in capital in the amount of saying and write 13 billion francs.
In fact, it found investors, but which, which had fallen over the nose of some to a short time ago: an intransparent Asian State Fund from Singapore and an Arab State Fund, which was so hidden that it was not even known its name.
But that was just the first blow.
It was worse in April 2008.
The bank had to announce new billions of losses, Governor Marcel Ospel, the second best paid board of Switzerland in 2006, resigned.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: the UBS stood before the collapse in the face of its misinvestment in the financial crisis and had to be rescued by the state.
The National Bank purchased UBS for tens of billions of problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for a forcing borrowing which it could become a member of the Bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shocked - because it noticed how dramatic it is for a small country when it houses so large banks.
Finally, the balance sheet of UBS 2007 was more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland (see graph).
"Once again, we could not save the UBS," says Bankenforscher Geiger.
The first disaster was the second one.
Already a few months later, UBS capitalised in the tax dispute with America and agreed to issue the data of potential customers who might have withdrawn taxes with the help of the bank.
In addition, she agreed to a payment of 780 million dollars - as a refund of unjustified profits from these transactions as well as penalties.
Thus the UBS was more or less open to helping with tax evasion.
At the same time, she lost something that had always been her capital in competition for rich customers: the Nimbus of secrecy.
After the scandal, Swiss banking secrecy was no longer the same.
It followed the resignation of the Board of Directors and Chairman of the Board of Directors.
And the exodus of customer money.
For example, within a few months, the Bank had lost its credibility in both key business areas: investment banking through misspeculation and asset management through tax evasion aid.
And just as it got a little quieter again, just as you thought the UBS would get it back to you now, then this unselfish trader story follows: a single trader curses 1.7 billion euros before the bank realizes that something is going wrong.
And it turns out that risk management in investment banking is still not working.
"The case of Adoboli has had to be found that risk control has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, economist and financial professor at the bank institute of the University of Zurich.
The financial board of a large German bank is also certain: "The problem of UBS is that it has no control over risk control."
It was precisely the idea of caution with which the Swiss bankers had long ago attended to become guardians of the great assets of the world: no too great risks, security for money - even beyond the Alpine Republic could break down the world.
The venues of the Swiss banks had become the symbol of unshakable reliability such as Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly noble chocolate.
The centre of the UBS in Zurich is still in line with the cliché of the Swiss private bank - it is just a little larger.
The situation is already classic.
The bank has its headquarters on the Zurich Railway, which leads directly from the main station to the Zurichsee, surrounded by the snow-covered summits of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are pronounced, the stores are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelry like Tiffany's is found here between Swiss traditional shops such as the Confiserie Sprüngli.
For centuries the Swiss banks have resided here: from the National Bank to the Palace of Credit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius Bear.
The reception hall of the UBS enters through a heavy rotary door.
Inside the walls are marble dressed, there are thick leather chairs, next to the bank logo a large sign to the "safe."
The UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss Bank has both Swiss big banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, but sometime displaced - or betrayed how the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He would rather not read his name in the newspaper, eventually he does business with the two big banks, like all Swiss bankers.
The UBS had become far too big, he finds - especially in investment banking, where the Angelsachsen would also have spread.
The Swiss have nothing to say there.
"And if so, they have been adapting to the sittings of the fishing axes for a long time."
In fact, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed the UBS, first gave her high profits and then the debakel: no European financial institution has lost as much money as the Swiss Grand Bank in the subprime jungle.
On 15 October 2008, the disaster became visible.
"On that Wednesday, the government coalition of the small seven-million country decided the largest rescue action in the history of their nation," writes Luke Hässig in his book "The UBS-Crash."
Up to 68 billion francs or about 45 billion euros, politicians authorised to save the large bank before bankruptcy.
How could it come to this?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem mainly in the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss Grand Banks joined a huge group.
A bank was created that was too large for small Switzerland - and grew ever more.
This helped the two different predecessors of UBS to complement themselves: a rich but sleepy bank focusing on asset management in Zurich and a poorer but already more internationalised.
Suddenly, the internationalised investment banks came to a lot of money that they could turn a huge bike with.
Two names are associated with this rise of the UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 head of the UBS group, and Marcel Ospel, then chairman of the board of directors.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," says bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the high-intellectual, modest, who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the abdominal man who has worked up from the banknote to the top."
But Ospel finally trusted Wuffli.
And Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake at the end: "He thought his models were the reality," Geiger says.
"This is a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
Clearly, overcourage came before the case.
UBS staff clearly remember the executive meetings on which head of group Wuffli spent the same parole again and again: Goldman Sachs encountered the throne.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
She introduced the League Tables, the ranking lists that documented the success of the banks of that time.
That's where the UBS wanted to go upstairs.
Some steps had already been taken.
She played at the top of the market in foreign exchange and stock trade.
However, business advisors who were commissioned highlighted a weakness: in the international interest rate business, in the banking language "Fixed income," there is a huge distance to the largest banks.
The UBS has gaps in American mortgage products.
In order to close this gap, UBS went into an adventure that almost cost it the existence.
Hungry after growth, both the bank itself and a pre-established hedge fund invested in American subprime investments.
It developed into a huge machine that packaged and extended securities on American mortgage credits, but also kept risks on its own.
Also, when other banks have long been looking for the exit.
"Even in summer 2007, when the American real estate market was in flames, the UBS bought there," says bank expert Geiger.
So big the euphoria, so deep the case.
One manager had to go after another than the attempts to clean up more difficult than thought.
Posts at the UBS became the slammer seat and are so far wacky.
Whoever runs the big bank now has an almost impossible job.
He needs to find a strategy for a bank that has handled all of the compelling business models.
Bankenforscher Geiger already has an idea: end with investment banking, focus on asset management, return to the Swiss roots.
As far as the bank does not want to go (yet).
But investment banking should shrink sharply, so much is already clear.
On Thursday, the new bank manager Sergio Ermotti will present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Italo-Swiss was actually only intended as a transitional solution when the bank was surprisingly separated from predecessors Grebel.
In the meantime, he has enacted: he is to run the business of UBS permanently, the Zuricher Bank informed on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to return the investment bank to the position in the mid-1990s.
3500 posts he stops.
But that won't be enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to make money?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is probably already asking.
In public, he only says he's going to find an apartment in Zurich with his wife.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe burdens US stock exchange
The threatening recession in Europe has taken the courage of US investors for the weekly start.
The change of government in Athens and Rome remained unpunctuated.
The deteriorated industrial production on the continent embraced hopes for a stabilisation of the debt crisis in the core.
The general relief of the change of government in Rome and Athens could not be enforced.
The euro fell against the dollar.
Last week the Italian and Greek glass had golden as half full, not half empty - but now again the problems were pushed into the forefront, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
In particular, financial values were on the sales cables.
The Dow Jones Index of Standard Values recorded at a minus 0.6 percent at 12.078 points for the end of trade.
In the course of trade, the market barometer pendled between 12.027 and 12.170 points.
The wider S & P-500 index closed at 1251 points, a minus of one percent.
The Nasdaq technology exchange index lost 0.8 per cent and went out of trade with 2657 points.
In Frankfurt, the Dax passed with a minus 1.2 per cent on 5985 counters.
Industry in the 17 euro countries has significantly reduced its production and is facing the end of the recovery.
In September, enterprises produced two per cent less than in the previous month, as reported by the Eurostat Statistical Office.
The US investors were sceptical about that: "We are not an island, but dependent," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe will soon not be able to free itself from a recession, and there are other signs of weakness among banks.
The investment legend Warren Buffett only confirmed this caution: It is not yet clear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything to end the crisis, he said in a CNBC interview.
That is why it seems too early to invest in European government bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffett threw a decade of old principle over the pile and entered the US technology industry.
His investment over ten billion dollars in IBM was based on the share rate of the tradition group and had it first recorded almost one percent higher against the trend in trade.
The paper closed almost unchanged at 187.35 dollars.
Buffett has, according to his own data, paid an average of 170 dollars per piece and now holds 5.5 percent.
The share rate of his investment firm Berkshire Hathaway lost 1.3 percent.
The Bank of America's share bonds, with 2.6 per cent, were significantly stronger than the market.
The house silver almost the rest of its shares in China Construction Bank and pays 6.6 billion dollars for it.
The institution aims to upgrade its capital ratio with net profit from the transaction and thus meet more stringent regulatory requirements.
The aircraft builder Boeing added and thus limited the losses in the Dow.
The share won 1.5 percent after the group had collected the largest order of its history.
Airline Emirates ordered 50 long-distance machines of type 777 on Sunday and estimated the value of the order to 18 billion dollars.
Including options on 20 more machines, the volume is even 26 billion dollars.
At the New York Stock Exchange, about 710 million shares changed the owner.
719 values added, 2281 gave after and 79 remained unchanged.
At Nasdaq, sales of 1.38 billion shares totalled 630 in Plus, 1913 in Minus and 82 unchanged.
Intelligent crows spread in cities
In many places, crop seeds are regarded as "problem birds": However, from the cities the highly intelligent animals are no longer able to be disposed of, say experts.
The one likes them, the other want to get rid of them very quickly: crows have been part of the city image for centuries, but in many municipalities, people are often complaining about dirt and noise of animals.
A means against the "problem birds" is not yet in sight.
Seeds should no longer be removed from the cities, said experts at the first crow symposium in the East Freshwater Empire.
There specialists from the entire federal territory reported about possible ways out.
You are looking for alternatives in the cities
Natural protectors also led the problems in cities to the land escape of particularly protected seeds: the use of chemicals in agriculture increasingly destroys traditional habitats.
The hunting, growing cultivation and the fall of typical breeding trees made the birds difficult to live.
Crows are under nature protection.
Large colonies with more than 600 brutpairs are among others in the West African Soest, in the North West, among others in Jever, Diepwood and Achim near Bremen and Leer.
In 2005, a controversial project for the massacre killing of crows in the district had provided negative headlines.
Critics had called the catching of the animals in bird falls and the killing with humping as particularly brutal.
"The normal expulsion, the despair, does not bring anything," the town and landscape plan Werner Klöver from Leer found.
Injecting nests with water or falling trees, often have unwanted consequences, also said the environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals divide, large colonies split up and spread to other places."
Disgracements are only possible as an exception to hospitals, old-age homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we can't get them away."
Without the surrounding country, the problem in the cities cannot be solved, said Mayor Wolfgang Kellner from Leer.
A combination of degrading animals from sensitive residential areas and lockofferings is possible to relocate them to other places.
On the other hand, the psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens threw "Infotafels instead of chain saws" for a completely different way of dealing with the animals: "We can finally bear a pickle in our face most confident."
In Schleswig-Holstein, Jürgens had co-founded the Ascheberger Krahen teaching path, in which evidence signs of the life of the highly intelligent seeds were informed.
The project has already been adopted by tourists.
Also to criticise the noise of the birds, Jürgens had his own opinion: "There is a lot of communication that have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendaric: Seeds cranes use not only tools to get to a delicious bite, but as a tool make their tools even themselves.
Practitioners at the University of Cambridge recently tested four crows of seeds as far as the intelligence of the birds reaches.
In an experiment, the birds quickly learned that they have to bring a rod with stones to collapse in order to reach a mottenlarve.
Without a lot of training, they realized the size and shape of a stone to make the platform collapse.
In a second attempt, the pimp crows had to solve a more difficult problem.
In a vertical cylinder the researchers had placed a small bucket with a mottenlarva.
With the snail, the birds could not reach their bust.
However, the researchers had handed them wires.
From this all four animals formed a hook, with which they then apply the bucket to the handle from the tube.
Three of the four seed crustaceans even managed this.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal to EM 2012
The hopes of Bosnier and Turks on a coup remained.
The favorites Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and also Ireland are present at the EM 2012.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have solved the last tickets to the 2012 European Championship in Poland and Ukraine in the Play-offs.
Posted by the double successful Superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53rd), Portugal beat Bosnia and Herzegovina 6: 2 (2: 1) and made after 0: 0 the fifth EM participation in succession perfect.
The Czechoslovakia reached 1: 0 (0: 0) in the Play-off replay at Montenegro's external side, after the replay (2: 0) had already been a clear thing.
There was no more burning Croatia at the 0: 0 against Turkey, and Ireland picked up a loose 1: 1 (1: 0) against Estonia.
Nani (24.), Helder Postiga (72., 82.) and Miguel Veloso (80.) achieved the further results for Portugal.
The former Wolfsburger Bundesliga-Profi Zvjezdan Misimovic with a transformed handheld meter (41.) and Captain Emir Spahic (65.) had twice shortened for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic saw the yellow red card (54.).
Bosnia had already failed in Portugal in the 2010 World Championships.
In the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal reached a start by measure.
Ronaldo chased a free seat from about 30 meters for early leadership into the masks.
A good quarter of an hour later Nani showed his long shot qualities and hit from 25 meters to 2: 0.
The Bosnians, who did not take place in the first half of the hour, had their first clear chance by Torhunter Edin Dzeko.
The ex-Wolfsburger from the English table guide Manchester City put a head ball at the bottom of the latte, but the ball did not cross the torline (33).
Jiracek meets for Czech Republic

After an attack against Helder Postiga in the Bosnian stray, Stark decided to swallow and showed the Portuguese yellow card (36.).
On the opposite side, Stark gave a controversial handheld meter after an action by Fabio Coentrao, which Misimovic certainly transformed.
But after the break, the Vice-European Champion of 2004 made clear everything with four meetings.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek also ended the last doubt in the 81st minute.
This is the fifth time in succession of the 1976 European Championship.
The team of trainer Michal Bilek with the Bundesliga legionaries Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nürnberg) were also lucky and had to survive a horror second in the initial phase.
Endmann Petr Cech, with a reflex at the last moment, prevented a possible owner by Tomas Sivok (9.).
Montenegro had its greatest opportunities when the Duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic shot in the 40th minute from the rotation from the border of the streets just near the gate of Cech.
After the break, the cross-latte had to save the already beaten world class orchestra of the Czechs, again the stormer of FC Seoul had withdrawn (50.).
The gate just before the end finally made everything clear.

Four days after the 0: 3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb did not go beyond a 0: 0.
While National Coach Guus Hiddink has to clear up his seat on the Bank of the World Cup Third of 2002, the Croatians are allowed to enjoy their fourth participation in an EM final round.
In front of 31,000 people in the Maksimir Stadium, the Turks almost caught a dream start.
In the seventh minute, Selcuk Inan met with a distance shot only the posts, attacker Kazim Kazim was unable to lower the printer in the gate.
After the horror seconds, however, Croatia took control more and more.
Even after the break, the Croatians did not burn anything.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic of VfL Wolfsburg, who took place from the 62nd minute for the Dortmunder Ivan Perisic, the Bundesliga-Legionäre Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) were still in use.
Trapattoni goes to the EM
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated the first EM participation in Germany since 1988.
Stephen Ward brought the team of trainer Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already provided for a preliminary decision with the 4: 0 success in the replay, in the 32nd minute in leadership.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57.) similar for guests.
Ireland pressed the pace from the beginning but had to wait until 23 minutes before Robbie Keane from Los Angeles Galaxy had the first good chance.
Only at the last moment did the Estonian rear crew prevent the possible leadership hit.
But in the 32nd minute it was time.
After an unfortunate defense of Endmann Pavel Londak, Ward was in place and pushed the ball to 1: 0 over the line.

SAP wants to double the number of employees in China
Europe's largest software manufacturer SAP will invest billions in China in the next few years and will almost double the number of its employees in the country.
By 2015, about two billion dollars (about 1.5 billion euros) are to flow, the Dax Group announced Tuesday.
"We will create additional research and development facilities and recruit appropriate staff," announced co-boss Bill McDermott at a customer fair in Beijing.
The staff is expected to grow from about 2500 to 4500 employees.
The number of branches of the world market leader for business software will double from five to ten or eleven.
SAP has been present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guanzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
About 4000 of the more than 176 000 SAP customers worldwide sit in the Boomland.
The growth plans in China are also an important component of the Dax Group's 2015 strategy.
SAP intends to increase its turnover to EUR 20 billion by 2015.
Last year, the Walldorfer had recovered around €12.5 billion.
Currently, the business of the software provider, who employs 55 000 employees worldwide, runs as rarely as before.
SAP has been active in China for 20 years.
"Now we want to expand our activities (...)," said McDermott.
"Our goal is to promote sustainable growth in China supported by comprehensive education."
Mass slaughter at a personal level
The new book "Beauty and Terror. A story of the First World War, told in nineteen fate rooms," begins with Peter Englund's new book "Beauty and Terror.
Here is a tip on how to proceed: Cut this page out gently and make it your bookmark.
You will get to know these people in English's romantic story very well. And these main people will work as your GPS, as a lighthouse in these few moments when you are lost like Anglund's men and women in the fog of war and robbed your illusions.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which determines the Nobel Prize for Literature.
He wrote an unusual book that he does not describe as "a work of anti-history."
It contains few large names, important contracts or famous battles. There are hardly any ambassadors, mad reporters or discussions about tactics and equipment.
It is less a book about what happened, he explains, but rather "a book about how it was." It is about "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods."
"Beauty and Terror" is almost the experience of 20 more or less unnoticed men and women on both sides of the war, from schoolgirls and botanists to mountain climbers, doctors, caretakers and office employees.
Some of these people become heroes.
Some become prisoners of war, lose limbs, go crazy or die.
Each of these lives flashes up like the votive candles in a church, some come to it while others are extinguishing.
Englund's book differs from the usual history books.
It also corrects the idea that the First World War was only the devastating opinion war at the West Front.
"Beauty and Terror" walks with an expert view of other war scenes: the Alps, the Balkans, the East Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book fall for bee carcasses, a celebrated Christmas among the pyramids in Egypt, Tsetsefly are an insoluble problem.
This is almost from the beginning a moving book.
The war floods the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like a hurricane Katrina that smells of cordias.
Imagine you're a woman who's home with her kids and hearing cannon fire in the distance. Do you stay or take the escape?
Who's coming?
Hardly anyone understands what's happening or why this war is at all going on.
"Missing facts," angels say, "were mutilated with suspicions, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"Beauty and Terror" follows individuals like Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German ship atross.
Their stories were mainly taken from memories, letters and other already published material.
Their life reports may be frightening or catching, but they are extremely alive in the angels of small moments that lose details.
Many of them act of shortage and of themselves.
In the history of a German schoolgirl he says: "Replacement, everywhere replacement."
"Replacement coffee, false aluminium, false shaver rubber, paper associations, wooden buttons."
He tells more about replacement food in Germany.
It describes "meat made of pressed rice and baked in hammer fat (and last served with a false bone of wood), tobacco made of dried roots and dried potato bowls, shoes sown with wood."
There was, as he notes, "837 registered food supplements allowed in the manufacture of sausage, 511 registered coffee supplements."
Some stories deal with honour and bravery.
An American recognizes his own desire for wildness and says about the war: "One feels that in spite of everything that was meant for men rather than sitting in the chair, with the evening leaf or the best seller and a cigarette and a whiskey in the hand, and doing as if such a facade meant civilization and as if there were no barbary behind its own strengthened and defeated shirt breasts."
On the other hand, a British soldier recognizes that he is likely to die and no one will take note of it or take care of it.
"If you take away from the idea of sacrificing yourself, you want to think that this is happening in front of a audience," he writes.
Instead, it's as horrible as "a condemned man who was hanged in secret."
Other observations are about the old Europe that falls apart and about new types of terrorism.
"The conflict has become an increasingly economic competition," writes Englund, "a war between the factories."
He catches the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the beast of the still young century": "the word wounded and ideologically convinced mass murderers in the suit that slaughters while sitting behind a desk."
People behave in an unforeseen way and there is as frivolous behavior as heroism.
Englund talks about the soldiers who tried actively to get involved in a prostitute with a gender disease to escape the front service.
"The grotesque expression of this can be discovered in trade with gonococcal eaters, because soldiers bought and smiled on their genitals, in the hope of coming to the hospital like this," he writes.
"Those who were really desperate put him in the eye, which led them to be blind for the rest of their life."
In this translation from the Swedish by Peter Graves, Englund's poetry is flattered and yet imperative and adapts perfectly to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes he catches the way the war "unveiled uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred."
People are starting to wonder why their leaders make them fight.
The best books about the First World War were usually more distorted like Paul Fussell's "Great War and Modern Memory" or novels like Erich Maria Remarques "Nothing new in the West" than extensive history books.
Englund's band joins an unconventional glory hall.
His book has the most devastating end I've ever read in a book.
I'm not giving it to you anymore.
But it's like he took this page away from us with his book with the main people in front of the nose and lit it with a string of wood.
After an early failure, a minimally planned attack
Hundreds of police officers were involved in it, some of them wore operation helmets.
They had chosen the night from Monday to Tuesday, because at that time there are hardly any people in Zucotti Park.
The operation was kept secret and only a few high-level officials were informed. All the others believed to be part of a exercise at the beginning.
Police President Raymond W. Kelly was among them and his presence underlined the fact that the operation was full of challenges.
The incidents of the past weeks, such as the use of pepper spray against protesters, which violates the rules of the December Council and caused the house occupants a huge increase in public sympathies, were no longer allowed to repeat.
And so the police action was carried out to remove the protesters from Zuccotti Park after two weeks of planning and training.
Officials had prepared them by observing how occupations were handled in other cities.
A disaster exercise had taken place with a look at Zuccotti on Randalls Island.
Officials strengthened the so-called chaos training - measures to combat terrorism, including rapid deployment of a large number of police officers - to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training unit took place on Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order to move into the park came "in the last minute," someone who is familiar with the orders said what a declare as "exercise."
"The few policemen who were involved in my knowledge did not know that this was about Zuccotti Park," said someone who wants to remain anonymous.
"The only ones who knew it was about Zuccotti Park were the senior officials of the resort."
A reason for secrecy was a lesson the city had learned.
On October 14th, officials wanted to clear the park, but then again, when hundreds of protesters came together after they had learned of these plans.
Officials from various police units were involved in the operation of Tuesday, including operations commands from all over the city - hundreds of mobile officials who are normally used in high-level criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that during the day many people enter and go into the park, almost like pendlers, so 1: 00 in the night is a good time to go in.
"It was appropriate to do this when the lowest number of people stays in the park," he said.
Rescue cars with Jupiter lamps and speakers were ready before departure at Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near the Manhattan Bridge.
The lamps and the messages recorded in advance, which were running out of the speakers, seemed to intimidate many protesters.
When the public officials entered the park in their light blue wind jackets, many protesters simply wrapped up their things and left the place.
The police said that until 1: 45, no tents would be touched to give the protesters time to pack their hat and good.
Other teams of officials were seen gathering in the area to intervene should be required arrests in the park.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, President's spokesman, said that this had happened for their own safety.
But many journalists claim that they wanted to stop them from observing the police operations in the park, and they said the handling of the officials had been very rough.
Mr. Browne said that television cars on Church Street on the west side of the park could have taken pictures.
When the police moved to the west through the great confusion of personal things of the protesters, including suitcases, artificial grass and bags with dresses, their employees followed the city cleaning that lifted up what had been left behind.
Some protesters who refused to leave were dragged out. Pictures of this appeared shortly later on on the Internet.
A main core of protesters occupied position near the kitchen area of the camp in the center of the park.
Some built barriers and the police continued their methodological arrests.
Approximately 10 people in the Epicenter of the camp tied to their arms.
And two people chained themselves to trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Civil protection officials were called to cut them off.
As Mr Kelly said, no arrests were carried out in the park until about 3: 30.
The clearance was completed after 75 minutes, according to police statements.
Mr. Browne said that 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most arrests came, as he said, due to "undue behavior and resistance to arrest."
The most prominent official on the ground was Joseph J. Esposito, head of the department, the highest uniformed official of the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, Head of Division of the Criminal Officer, was also there.
Despite his presence, "Mr. Kelly" did not run the operation, "as Mr Browne said.
In case they should access, a second group of officials on the eastern side of Broadway waited between Liberty and Cedar Street.
In Cortlandt Street, a street block north of the park, and in Pine Street, a block further south, barricades were built.
It was observed that these police sites extended the area around Zuccotti Park.
In one place, several officials, many of them with shields of protection, were observed to drive people outside.
Approximately 28 people were in the northern area.
Some of the most violent actions of the night took place in the south of the park.
At 5: 00 south of Pine Street, a protestant jumped on the roof of a police vehicle and other demonstrators left the air out of the tire of a police bus.
In one place, the crowd threw a piece of sperm.
In the end, an official and a protestant came to the hospital.
The trade union of the guardian will file a complaint against the city for redundancies
The union, representing hundreds of school nurses who have lost their jobs last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday, as dismissals are not necessary and discriminatory because of their inappropriate influence on schools teaching poor students.
The action is probably the last possibility that the trade union, the district council 37, is still open in its efforts to revoke redundancies.
Six hundred and twenty-seven school assistants, caretaker coordinators and other employees who belonged to the worst paid staff in the city and lost their work on 7 October, described the trade union leader as a political revenge for refusing access to a health fund that the working groups had maintained to close the budget gap last year.
This claim was categorically rejected by the authorities.
At a hearing of the City Council, Dennis M. Walcott, director of schools, said last month that the redundancies had been part of the budget that had been adopted in June.
A member of the City Council shot back and told him that in the budget nothing specifies that staff of the school assistance would be dismissed.
Officials of the City Council 37 said they had and warned the Ministry of Education against a complaint. On Wednesday there will be a press conference announcing the filing of the complaint before the Supreme Court in Manhattan formally.
The complaint will be presented to Mr. Walcott and the Ministry of Education of the City as accused and eight dismissed workers will count as applicants who are all colored or Latin American women, like most of the helpers who have lost their work.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesperson of the city's Ministry of Justice, said that the city was not in charge and therefore could not be commented on its individual claims.
According to a draft complaint submitted by the New York Times, the trade union has concentrated on the number of dismissals at schools in the city's Armenian quarters to support a complaint for inequality treatment. It claims that poor schools would have lost more helpers because they were chronically underfunded.
It states that, while there were no redundancies on Staten Island and only a few redundancies in the schools of Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school helpers in Brownsville District 23, Brooklyn, were lost and 46 helpers were released in districts 8 and 9 in South Bronx.
With the determination of the loss of five out of eight school assistants employed at public school 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the complaint says: "This is not a neighborhood of enlightened parents who can organise donations to catch budget cuts."
P.S.: The budget of the 36. district was reduced by 3.26 percent this year. Furthermore, money was lost when the city changed its method of calculation for extra funding for each Armenschool registration.
The trade union also complains that the head of the High Schools was led into error through the language in a memo which authorised the dismissal of the care coordinators.
The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the action, even if "excess" (German: translate) in the USA usually describes the change of a teacher from the pay list of a school to a pool of available workers paid by the central office.
"Sixty and sixty careers have been dismissed, not transferred," says the draft appeal.
Mission completed, Congress ready to agree on Libya
In the end, Republicans and Democrats in Washington seem to have already agreed on the rebels in Libya.
All that was needed for this was the success of the revolts, the arrest and murder of the long-standing dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the end of American interference.
On Thursday, the Senate's Committee for International Relations decides a resolution which will be subject to the President John Kerry (Massachusetts) together with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut), praising Libya for the successful rebellion and the American troops for their "courage."
"This resolution honours the courageous people of Libya who have begun to rebuild their country," said Kerry.
"It confirms the support of its democratic efforts by two parties."
Language may sound innocent, but so far nothing has been easy in the Libya debate.
This summer, both the legislators of both parties and the White House argued about the choice of the word of a series of resolutions to approve or disapprove the role of the US military in the NATO Libya mission.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution approving the limited use of US military forces in Libya.
The law was rejected in the Senate by a broad peripheral group of both parties and there was no vote.
But on the same day this law was passed in the Senate. In addition, the Chamber passed a decision to reduce the money for American operations in Libya.
This led the US mission to a kind of legislative fence - with a congress that was enough to criticise Obama's approach in the context of the mission, but not angry enough to finally remove him from the ground under his feet.
Then the unresolve of the Congress was obsolete by the events.
Tripolis fell under the Libyan rebels in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on International Relations "congratulates Libyan people on their enormous courage and extraordinary endurance in their self-liberation" and "praises the men and women of the US military and their coalition partners supporting military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism."
The resolution also reaffirms "the national interests of the United States of America in a successful and irrevocable transition of Libya to democracy."
Will the new measures receive full support from the Foreign Relations Board or will they divide the legislators, as the June Act has done?
The last version encountered the resistance of Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the top Republican of the Committee.
Lugar's spokesman said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new law.
According to capitol, it is Senate's responsibility to vote this week on a constitutional change requiring a balanced budget, a top priority in almost every congress legislature period of Republicans and some Democrats.
The measures under the leadership of the Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia) will be the first constitutional change in the budget or other area currently coming to the vote in the Senate or Congress.
Other legislators have so far tried to bring their amendments to the vote without success, although they have often tried enough.
Goodlatte's amendment is only one of 68 constitutional changes that have been presented to the Congress and encompass a wide range of topics.
Some are double - the same law was presented to both the Congress and the Senate - others are slightly different.
Only in the Senate there are at least 15 versions of the balancing budget change and another dozen that would "control federal expenditure."
Some of the laws are also identical, but they give their contractors - in particular beginners of the Republicans who want to polish their CV - the opportunity to praise that they have "written" such a measure.
The Budget Control Act, adopted in August, requires both Senate and Congress to vote on a change in the balance of budgets.
In March 58 Senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution which supports the idea of such a change.
In addition to the budget, some members want to limit the number of provisions that may be presented to members of the Congress, while Republican José E. Serrano (New York) wants to lift the limit to two terms of office of the President.
The Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a number of amendments which, among other things, guarantee the right to good education and health care.
A change that prohibits a marriage of equal sex is, as is a change that prohibits burning flags, an ever-recurring template.
Some legislators also want to allow the abolition of federal laws if two thirds of the States reject them.
As eager as Members propose changes, they move as uneven faster as they have been in recent years.
In the 111. Congress, legislators presented 77 such changes at 110. Congress 66.
In comparison with the early 1990s, where members regularly proposed more than 150 changes every two years, the figures provided by the Senate library are blurred.
But they were not much more successful than today.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed to the Congress in 1789.
"Dropped but not defeated," said Giffords in the first television interview after the assassination
Ten months after a armed man had shot at her from the nearest distance during a election event in Tucson, the Republican Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) appeared on a national television Monday evening. She only sang to the Broadway piece "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said that the desire to recover was greater than the wish to return to the Congress.
When she appeared together with Diane Sawyer in the ABC News "20 / 20," she rang for words and needed help when going.
The broadcast showed the heavy slow recovery of the damage that the bullet that divided its skull drilled through the left side of her brain and crossed her head from front to back.
Three months ago, she returned surprisingly to the Congress to triumphant her voice to the debt brake.
In her first television interview after the January assassination, where six people were killed and 13 injured, Gifford smiled, laughed and sang - and described their recovery as "difficult."
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gifford (41) replied: "Very good."
The interview with Gifford and her husband, the astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a one-hour "20 / 20" special recorded shortly before the publication of the new book of the couple: "Gabby: A story about courage and hope."
The Special has been following Gifford's recovery since the assassination of January 8.
In videos that Kelly had recorded in the first weeks, you can see them in the hospital bed, with a chalk shaving head and a long scarf over your forehead.
She can only lift one or two fingers if her husband encourages her to do so.
Months later Giffords sits in a wheelchair while therapists show her how to perform simple movements.
A nick with the head.
A lick with your lips.
And then, their first words, "What."
After a few days, Giffords whispers another word: "Toast." She wants to change her breakfast.
Videos played in the ABC show show show that music played an important role in Giffords' recovery: you can see how congressionals sing together with the therapists to Cyndi Laupers "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Pettys "Free Fallin '."
In the interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who spent two hours with therapy every day, said she couldn't remember the day of the assassination.
Her husband said that on March 12, he had read an article of a daily newspaper about the murder when she interrupted him and for the first time asked for the six people who had been killed during the murder.
The suspected shooter Jared Lee Loughner is in a prison in Missouri and will be treated medically during his trial.
"Many people have died," told Gifford's Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard."
In the course of his wife's recovery, Kelly Sawyer said, "I was hit."
"So, I'd say," Gabby, you weren't defeated, "said Kelly.
You were just hit.
And you'll get through this and you'll recover and you'll come back stronger than ever before.
Groups feel more compassion than respect
The event was a Wall Street Gala that collected millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helpless, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and marines gathered around him.
The amount in black smokings rose up and applauded.
"The soldiers and soldiers were seen as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the donation action in spring.
A ranghoher military officer on the gala, who was observed among other things by the Chief of Staff and then chairman, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They were introduced like orphans," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers meant it well.
I know that.
But it was no respect, really not.
The scarce contradictory impressions illustrate the heavy relationship between the military and the most distant, sometimes admiring American public.
The troops are overwhelmed with praise for their victims.
But the praise has its price, says servants.
The public is increasingly acting like you are suffering people in uniform.
"We were not victims in any way," said Brigade General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
"But apparently the only way to support is to push us into the role of unhappy souls."
The issue is extremely sensitive to military leaders who do not want to appear ungrateful or in a dispute with the public who serve them.
They also realized that the rage, the returning troops in the last years of the Vietnamese war, was far worse.
As a result, conversations are held about pity in the silent and private between war veterans.
After his two sons returned from fighting with the marines, the colonel a.D. Mark Cancian warned them that people outside the military world could see their service from two different perspectives.
Some would consider them with a sense of fear, as they defeated rebels and had travelled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if a "angry, violent veteran hidden under the surface," said Cancian, who had fought in Iraq and taken over a high state post in Washington after his return.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some of the respondents were subtle asking whether he was able to withstand the pressure of a demanding post in Washington immediately after his return from the fight.
"If you talk about your service, you have to keep the negative impressions against it," Cancian explained to his sons.
The lack of lightness of the military is partly rooted in the lack of American interest in war.
Services in the field of battle are rarely used as a praise by a country that has little experience with the military and sees little benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We, as a nation, no longer appreciate military heroism as was absolutely usual in the Second World War," said Lieutenant General David Barno a.D., who commanded US troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public focuses largely on the suffering of a member of the service.
Groups find recognition for the number of attacks they have sustained, the number of friends they have lost or for the severity of their injuries.
Military faces the growing pressure to harsh through rape
This week, an important hearing will decide whether 28 women and men are being charged with non-intervention in a rape before the military court.
If this is not the case, hundreds of applicants are ready for the next hearing.
High Freed Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and pregnant in the 11th week when she was raped by a soldier at night.
It was in October 2008 and she just returned to her barracks in Miramar north of San Diego from dinner with a friend when she met a male colleague who carried a 12-pack beer with her.
He asked her if he could accompany her to a drink in her room.
"My alarm bells went on," said Lyman.
But the Texan wiped away her concerns.
I thought, "Oh, what, he's 19.
He's from Texas, "she said.
"I wish I had listened to my stomach."
A few minutes after they went to Lyman's room, the man came behind her, pushed her down and raped her, she claims.
This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 other current and former military workers are waiting for a trial with a historical hearing in Arlington, Virginia, in which it is decided whether an action they have brought against the former Defence Minister Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, is being admitted to court.
The lawsuit claims that Gates and Rumsfeld have not been committed against the widespread rape within the military and under violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
In February of Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, D.C., the complaint initially included 17 applicants, but in the following months they went up to 28: 25 women and three men who all claim that they were raped or sexually abused by soldiers, and that the military failed to investigate, condemn or provide appropriate case-law according to the alleged attacks.
Burke says she's following the top military leadership, as the problem starts there.
"The military is hierarchically built," she says.
"Who are the individual people who are in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation? The leadership."
Burke also says that she has contacted almost 400 more survivors since February, many of them could be part of future complaints.
Their strategy: Instead of all applicants putting their eggs in a basket, they will, if necessary, submit many further complaints in order to maintain the pressure.
The defense team for the Ministry of Defence, led by State Attorney Neil MacBride, has submitted an application to reject a complaint.
The files of the Court of First Instance, which are available in Newsweek, are in full support of the defence strategy, primarily that the military cannot be accused of current or previous soldiers for injuries which it has come to in the armed forces.
According to a law of the Supreme Court of 1950, the so-called Feres doctrine, the government is not liable for injuries caused by soldiers in active service.
"The alleged damage occurred during the military service of the applicants'," says the document.
The Ministry of Defence refuses to comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are still not allowed to serve in battle, the distinction lies only in the name of: modern wars rarely have clear fronts.
Both in Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of soldiers play increasingly important roles, especially in contact with domestic women in the wars areas.
The result: between these two wars, 150 soldiers died, two thirds of them in fighting.
It is time for the military to be modernised, says Burke.
And she is not alone in her struggle: three more lawsuits except for them are pending.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans' Legal Services Clinic is preparing a lawsuit against the four major military academies for allegedly promoting a women's hostile atmosphere.
The non-profit Vietnam Veterans of America collects an appeal against the military, focusing on the diagnosis of "personality disruption," which received rape victims to release them from the service - a common approach according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the Service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
In December, her group brought an action against the Veteran Administration (d.o.b.: the administration of the war veterans), in which she brought before her discriminatory practices in dealing with claims for benefits for persons who indicated that they were sexually abused in the service.
Nine laws were presented to the Congress independently of each other by a mixture of senators and representatives of both parties, which provide a number of evidence.
In 2010, according to the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (eds.: Office for Prevention and Reporting Sexual Abuse), the Ministry of Defence has indicated 3.158 sexual abuses.
However, most abuses are not reported at all and according to the Pentagon's own estimate, this figure takes account of approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated 19.000 cases to which it comes per year.
The report, published in March, also examines the rates of prosecution: in 2010, 20 percent of the military cases were in court, only half as many as civil law.
The plaintiffs in Burke's case describe their attacks as only the first of a series of dreams.
In Lyman's case, she reported the alleged rape of the military police less than an hour after the robbery.
That night, she says, she was asked 11 times to tell the details of her rape of a whole series of cops, doctors and commanders.
She had a rape set and the blood of her attacker, which came from a cut on his arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge. During this hearing she was asked for the sex she had before the assault with her friend.
Six people declared themselves witnesses in the name of the suspected perpetrator who was finally released.
"I still remember well the day the judgment was read," says Lyman.
"I thought the wounds would be used. I ran screaming out of the courtroom."
"They brought me to the psychiatric department and I remember when I came out again, I said to my commander: This was not his procedure. That was my procedure."
Lyman was invited to visit a military psychiatrist who ultimately diagnosed a personality disorder and declared her incapable of serving.
In January 2010 she was dismissed unhonorably, so she does not receive any support.
Whether Lyman and the other complainants have made progress is pure speculation, says John Turley, Professor of Law at George Washington University Law School.
Nevertheless, he said, "I think they should move forward."
What is between them and a judgment is this doctrine, which has been criticized since it was questioned for the first time.
I'm a critic of the Feres doctrine in my life.
The military is a decade behind it, because they do not have the same incentive and the same deterrence that entails liability.
He adds: "The chances stand against them... but it's important for them to try."
These things will only change if good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing does not follow its path, Burke, the lawyer of the applicants, will begin with its hundreds of other applicants for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the military in this respect until reforms are made," she says.
Or until we die, whatever happens first.
Walls have eyes: How researchers watch you on Facebook
Before becoming a new face of right extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was only one of many boys who sent their anti-immigration opinion online.
On Monday, Breivik, who confessed to having committed an amoklope in Norway in July, where 77 people were killed, had his first public hearing in court.
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is far from alone in cyberspace: he has spent a lot of time until his attack before his computer and chatted with some of the millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social networks.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But how do you find them?
This is easy - you just have to log in to Facebook.
"We have found that it was not difficult to come to them," says Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a recent report by the British DEMOS Idea Factory on Digital Populism in Europe.
Facebooks hiding personal data is so enzyclopedic, says Bartlett that researchers simply need to use the advertising tool of the page to determine their desired demographic data with scientific accuracy exactly - as marketers have done for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million fans in the right-wing groups across Europe and then filed them with adds, but instead of connecting with a new band or a new diet product, the Adds users invited to an inquiry in which they asked about their educational status, their attitude towards violence and their own future assessment.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to question more than 10,000 followers of 14 very right parties in 11 European countries - without having to leave their office once.
"It is a rather new method of research," says Bartlett.
Some of the results are hardly surprising. Online promoters of right-wing groups are mostly young, male and annoying about immigration.
But in some kind of surprising distortion, "those who combine their online activism with an offline activism are more sensible, more democratic and less violent than those who remain behind their computer screens."
DEMO's work is just an example of how Facebook becomes a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.
Ideas factories, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study everything, from health issues to societal trends such as "Likes," text messages and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users, which add on average three content per day, Facebooks "Data Supernova" generates a research tree that has increased the number of scientific work with the name of this page in the title by almost 800% over the last five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is the fact that you can study people through this page that you usually don't reach with your clipboard on the street.
"If you used to try to question people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"They had to inform the party first and they would never have given them access," says Bartlett.
"On Facebook, all this goes away - they go straight to them."
Others say that the page offers an opportunity to identify and solve social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues have found out that students who discussed their full outlook on Facebook tend significantly more to drink problems than students who sweat about this topic.
Moreno suggests that similar students, such as residential advisors, monitor the site and help a student when they post too many status updates.
"You cannot solve a problem if you have not recognized it," said Dimitri Christakis, Morenos co-author and head of Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle of the Washington Post.
"We have found a way to identify vulnerable children that would otherwise not have been found."
Facebook is also constantly accessing the data of its own population.
The data team of the page has produced statistics on the relationship status and Valentine's Day, election participation in the mid-2010 elections and a National lucky index (mainly using information that only Facebook has access - masters of digital freedom have long known that the page should make its large data base mine available to others for research purposes).
But the users of Facebook know that the page observes them whether or not they want to. To be able to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, you allow the page to deliver your own personal data.
But what if the users of Facebook become part of a survey that they don't even know about yet?
While researchers have strictly defined guidelines how to collect their data offline, everything is allowed online.
"I don't think that many users have even thought about the fact that a researcher could study their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, to a study from the year 2006 in which he studied the public pages of students on Facebook.
"As for her, it was only about her and her friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline there is no guarantee that a research participant is absolutely honest.
On Facebook it is impossible to know how many of the information are true in a user profile and in contributions.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside Facebook are two completely different things," says Selwyn.
Therefore Selwyn, despite his years as a technology researcher, thinks that a clipboard and a pen are still the best research tools anyone can use.
"There is no substitute for going into the real world and talking to real people," he says.
"Social research must take care of the social - and a lot of social life is still taking place offline."
"Cold and inhuman": Anders Behring Breivik appears for the first time in a public court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who has confessed to two amobs, where 77 people were killed in Norway this summer, described himself as a "resistance" fighter in his first appearance in a public court in Oslo.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a temple knight of Norway," he said in front of a courtroom with more than 500 people.
"I object to the court because you have received your mandate from organisations that support hassideologies and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I recognize the laws, but I do not confess guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monolog, as he "did not want to allow Breivik to use this hearing as a platform on which he can express his views."
For the same reason he refused Breivik, who brought a prewritten speech, the permission to contact his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, he has no access to the media for four weeks. He said that the authorities will closely control all visits and the entire correspondence over eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and members of the victims participated in the hearing.
Some came in the hope to see Breivik in the eyes, others wanted to confirm that he stayed behind the castle and bars.
Everyone took part with the aim that everything would end at a closing point.
"I thought he seemed cold and inhuman," a survivor of Utoya told the Norwegian transmitter NRK.
"It was unpleasant, but for me it goes a bit further after I've seen and heard the suspect."
Breivik wore a dark suit and a blue tie and worked quietly and professionally throughout the hearing. He looked journalists and survivors into the eyes when he entered and left the building again.
Despite Breivik's bizarre indication that he was part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge concluded that he was not mentally ill and said there was no proof that he had been compelled.
Some may like that the attacks of July 22nd seemed to be the work of a single extremist and not of a group of radicals.
But does this automatically facilitate the grief and confusion that a whole nation still feels?
"I wish he looked like a monster, but he does not," said the victim's family.
"It would be so much easier if he did."
7 lessons from the interview with the deceased Steve Jobs, which was shown this week in a theater
After Steve Jobs's death on October 5th, some compared him to Henry Ford and highlighted the technology genius as a great modern inventor.
But what Apple fans might find the most obvious in the recently discovered job interview, which this week was dipped up before special film presentations on the important markets, is how much this creative head has understood business processes and work processes.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer and self-appointed hippie, but he was also an acribian organiser who was eager to graph - a man who believed that many managers suffer from "a disease of thought" that a really great idea is 90 percent of the work... [but] there is a huge amount of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product. "
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the TV series "Triumph of the Expert Idiots" about the break-up of the personal computer. And he sat together with jobs for more than an hour, in which they had one of the rare, detailed talks.
At that time, as 10 years had passed since Apple had pushed jobs, and he was already working hard on his new computer company NeXT, and was looking forward to the widespread adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of Cringley's interview was used in professional idiots, he says that the copy templates of the interview were missing during delivery.
Only after Job's death was a complete VHS copy discovered in the warehouse of the director.
This slightly revised film material forms the basis for the 68minute film "Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview," which comes to the Landmark Theatre this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who is known to dislike detailed interviews, jobs appear surprisingly eager here in explaining its technological philosophy and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtful.
During the interview there will be four times longer breaks between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds in which jobs clearly weigh their thoughts and strive for accuracy.
There are also moments in which Jobs' perfectionism comes to light when it appears to be unpatient responding to Cringelys' questions and pushing him to respond faster to topics or ancillary actions of greater importance.
Before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone recorded, the lost interview seems somehow horrible when jobs evaluate what other companies make their opinion right or wrong and represent their own vision to the future of the computer.
It's one thing to read posthumous dignity of career jobs'. But to see jobs here as the greedy dream that is on the jump to magnificence is something completely different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things could and should be.
Shortly after he had done all this here, he went and did it.
A quick look at seven remarkable sequences of the lost interview:
How he learned to run a company:
"For all these years in business, I always ask," Why do you do things?. "And the answer you always get is," Oh, that's how it's done. "
No one knows why he's doing what he's doing. No one in business really thinks about things thoroughly.
That's what I found out.
Jobs continues its efforts to rationalize accounting at Apple.
Amazing how costs were recorded - usually one started with "standard costs," which were estimated to be adjusted with "deviation" - he developed an automated factory that ensured that business costs could be determined up to the smallest.
How the Pope was alerted:
Jobs tells about the "Blue Box" he built with Steve Wozniak, a device to sneak into the phone company and lead remote conversations for nothing.
A lot has been written about the device, but Job's enthusiasm, when he describes the Blue Box as an act of self-authorization, is contagious.
He describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a fee-payable phone, make a call and then connect from one AT & T network to another while slipping through as many satellites as possible.
"We sent things around the globe half a dozen times, and when you cried on the phone, it came out a minute later on the phone next door," says Jobs kichernd.
"We were young and we learned that we can build ourselves something that can control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world."
We both, we didn't know much, but we could build this little thing that could control a giant thing, that was an incredible lesson and I don't think there would be Apple without it.
Jobs continues to talk about a glorious joke, which wozniak and he almost pulled off when they called in the Vatican in the middle of the night via Blue Box and wanted to talk to the Pope, while they were so well able to follow Henry Kissinger.
Since several members of the Catholic hierarchy were called in in the middle of the night to talk to the American diplomat, they had to laugh before the Pope came to the phone himself.
How he fell in love with the technique (and unprepared Bill Hewlett called):
At the age of 12, when he was looking for spare parts to build a frequency teller, he searched for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after her 20-minute telephone call, jobs for the summer received a part-time job at Hewlett-Packard.
"This had a remarkable influence on me. It was the only company I had seen at that age and it formed my views on what a company was and how well it treated its employees."
Later Jobs became one of the HP employees who visited the research laboratories of the company in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever created."
He was as big as a suitcase, had a small screen with brown tubes and I fell in love with him.
I would climb up at HP as a teenager and hang on this machine and write programs for them.
How to Improve Innovations:
Several times in the interview jobs talk about how to spontaneously invent new products.
Early in his career, when he built some platinum, he was asked by a customer to assemble the entire computer.
He worked with a payment period of only 30 days and had to think about both the assembly and the delivery of the finished equipment.
Later at Apple he remembers the problems he had in developing a computer mouse:
"I remembered persistent arguments... They screamed at me that it would take five years to build a mouse that would cost $300] and I got up, went out and found a manufacturer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could build for $15.
About large companies who leave behind:
Long before he made Apple live again, Jobs anticipated the paths in which so many industrial registers went with their visions in stalkers and lost control of their shares.
"Let's say you work at IBM or Xerox, so do a better copier or printer, well and?"
They own the stock monopoly, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [it is people] who ultimately run the companies and the product with which people are pushed out of decision-making.
The product genius that has led to this monopoly position is eradicated by people who have no concept of good products versus bad products - craftsmanship is necessary.
This happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
You could have been ten times bigger, that Microsoft of the 1990s could have been...
They caught the defeat of victory.
About innovation as an art form:
"There's a lot of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product... when you develop this great idea, it changes and grows."
You learn a lot about your fancies.
You have to vote, certain things you can't, but electrons, glass, robots, factories.
You have to remember 5000 things, these concepts, and bring them all together...
In the end, it goes on to taste, it goes on to try to break up with the best stuff people have created and then try to bring these things together to what you do.
Picasso said that good artists copy, steal great artists.
We're always shameless in stealing great ideas.
Part of what made Macintosh great was that the people who work there were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, who were by chance the best computer scientists in the world.
If it hadn't been the computer industry, they would create fantastic things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas dining with opponents of health laws when court adopts case
On the day the Supreme Court gathers behind closed doors to discuss the politically shared question of whether to listen to President Obama's health laws, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, took part in a dinner sponsored by the office that the case was represented in court.
The incident took place last Thursday when all nine judges met to discuss the petitions for examination.
One of the cases to be dealt with was a complaint brought by 26 States against the far-reaching reform of health care decided by the Congress last year, a law which became the keyword of the Conservative activists throughout the United States.
The judges agreed to the hearing. Indeed, a 5 1 / 2-hour fundamental discussion is expected in March, which will probably lead to the 2012 presidential struggle, which will be fully underway at the time of the court decision.
The attorney who will stand in court and claim that the law is to be kicked, is likely to be Paul Clement, once a prosecutor-general under the government of George W. Bush.
Clements office, Bancroft PLLC, was one of almost two dozen companies supporting the annual dinner of the federalist society, an old-fashioned group dedicated to the defence of conservative legal principles.
Another company sponsoring dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the economic associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, who are fighting the law.
Another sponsor was the pharmacist Pfizer Inc., who is financially involved in the result of the process.
The dinner took place a few hours after the court had discussed the case in a Washington Hotel.
Among other things, Mitch McConnell, Head of the Republican Group in the Senate and a declared opponent of the health reform
The guests of dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: the two judges have been visiting events of the federalist society for years.
And that does not violate moral rules.
In fact, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct, which regulates the actions of the lower federal judges.
If they were, they would probably fall under the principle 4c of the Code, which says: "A judge may participate in benefit events near the law and other organisations, where the judge must not be a spokesman, guest of honour or a guest of such events according to the programme."
Nevertheless, the extreme proximity of Scalia and Thomas was extended to two of the branches related to the case as well as to a company with a massive financial interest in this to alert moral and government activists.
"This amazing breach of morality and the contradiction to the code punishes the complaints of some judges lie, the court adheres to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of the Common Cause, a movement of civil rights in the United States.
"The judges won and dinned at the court during a benefit event with lawyers who were in proceedings."
Their appearance and support of a donation action for this event undermine any right to impartiality and are not acceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little respect for critics who say they would mix justice too easily with groups that can be guided by the agenda, such as the federalist society.
And Thomas's wife Ginni is a well-known conservative activist.
On the other hand, the Conservatives claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was a prosecutor-general under the Obama government when the first lawsuits came to court in the first instance.
Their critics urged Kagan to withdraw themselves from the hearing of the case because she was too committed to defending the law in order to be unforgettable.
Kagan doesn't do anything to do this.
Boeing draws record order of 18 trillion dollars to land
The airline Emirate orders 50 double aircraft of the type Boeing 777 with an option to 20 more aircraft.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner to Oman Air, a business worth more than one billion dollars.
It is really a rare message that a company receives an order of over 50 pieces of its products.
But it's a big deal when the company of aircraft manufacturers is Boeing Co. and the list price for these 50 planes in total is a record sum of 18 trillion dollars.
Also unusual is the contractor of Boeing: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a forecast published on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that airlines from the Middle East need 2,520 aircraft worth 450 trillion dollars over the next 20 years.
Boeing announced his biggest order of all times for commercial aircraft in the weekend, measured by the value of the order: 50 double Boeing 777 Jets.
The Hammer mission came from the airline Emirates from Dubai.
The airline also has an option, as announced by Boeing at the Dubai Air Traffic in 2011, on the purchase of 20 other aircraft, which increases the entire list price to 26 trillion dollars.
On Monday, Boeing Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8, the so-called Dreamliner, which greatly improves gas consumption and the comfort of passengers.
The list price for six of these planes is more than one billion dollars.
"This is absolutely positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, commissioner of Morningstar.
"The quality of these special customers is very high."
Many airlines in the Middle East are owned by the oil producing countries.
So they have not only the money to pay the aircraft, but rather an increase in oil prices which is usually damaging to airlines because this is one of their biggest cost points, not so harmful because the country deserves a higher oil price.
This is important because they tend less than other airlines to cancel or postpone aircraft orders when oil prices rise, said Dihora.
"You have a natural security," he said.
The appointment of Emirates confirms Boeing's leadership position on the market for large-scale aircraft and helps to keep the Airbus competitor SAS in chess, attacking the dominant position with the A350.
Boeing's victory on the air traffic show comes four months after Airbus has announced that the introduction of the largest A350 that is competing directly with the 777-300ER would be postponed.
The introduction was postponed to gain more confidence after customers had demanded a higher utility load and reach.
The Boeing shares increased by 1.5% to $67.94.
Nurse of the Mexican President apparently loses election in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that the drug dealer Fausto Vallejo from the PRI in the race has supported the governor posts.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon apparently lost her application for the office of Governor of Muchoacan during the violent state elections. She claimed on Monday that drug dealers had influenced the race in favour of one of their opponents.
According to the preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo won the race around the governor posts in the western state from the Institutional Party of the Revolution, the PRI.
"Intervention of organised crime during the entire electoral process and especially yesterday's day is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country," said Luisa Maria Calderon in a radio interview one day after the election on Sunday.
"They threatened our candidates, our staff in the surveys... they occupied election cabins, built street blocks... and instructed people to vote [for the PRI]."
The PRI ruled seven decades in Mexico until they lost the presidency in 2000.
But they strive for a return and victory in Michoacan is an important step in these efforts.
The PRI hopes for a victory in the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have barely beaten Claderon, which had led to the polls before the election day.
Calderon, a candidate of the Conservative Partido Acción Nacional PAN of her brother, refused to recognise Vallejo as a winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the Democratic Revolutionary Democratic Party PRD, the current Governor, came to place three, a heavy defeat for the split and unfortunate left leadership for the presidential election 2012.
Aureoles also refused to recognise the provisional findings.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital of Morelia, denies connections with drug dealers and urges the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and amphetamines.
It is the home country of President Calderon and he chose Michoacan to launch a military offensive against drug dealers in December 2006.
The violence still lasts.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the election during a election event for Luisa Maria Calderon and many candidates have been exiled from local elections for fear.
For the PRI, a victory strengthens the party, no matter how disgusting the elections in Michoacan appear.
The man who is probably represented by the PRI in the race around the presidential office is Enrique Pena Nieto, who congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said: "I think this victory makes us look bravely next year."
ADB urges Asia to help save the euro area
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) calls on India and China to support the rescue of the euro area in its serious debt crisis to prevent a long-term downward trend that will slow the growth of the economy in Asia.
Rajat Nag, managing director of the ADB based in Manila, said that the two world's fastest growing economic nations must do "everything in your power" to speed up the recovery of the monetary block either through the International Monetary Fund or through direct mutual agreements.
He warned the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China) that look "passionately" at the difficulties in Europe, and said that financial support for European leadership and European resources through Asia helps to prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We're all on the same boat."
"So anyone who can help Europe out of this crisis is helpful," he said to the Financial Times in an interview on the edge of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to a certain degree, but it is not immune."
"So if China and India can help, then with all the means."
Europe's monetary union has suffered a serious debt crisis over the past few months.
In recent days, Italy's interest costs have increased significantly and both Italy and Greece have resigned.
The emerging serious debt crisis in Europe raises fears that the global economy could fall into the recession and led to calls that the leading emerging economies would have to gather together to support the euro area.
Mr Nag predicted that any assistance to Asia would be channelled through the IMF, but said that mutual agreements - such as the purchase of EU rescue fund bonds, the European Financial Stabilisation Facility (EFSF) - offer greater negotiating power to European partners in Asia.
Anand Sharma, the Indian Minister for Trade, said that "India will do everything in its power to help the euro area, as its own economy is now suffering from the declining exports and the drowning of foreign capital flows.
"Nobody wants the euro zone to remain unstable and turbulent," he said.
"We face major challenges and we need to maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not an option, it's an assignment, because where else we find work for our millions of young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies such as India do not have the opportunity to help rich Europeans if they face major economic challenges themselves.
Ashutosh Varshney, Professor at US Brown University, said it would be very difficult politically to sell help to the 1.2 trillion people in India, of which more than 800 million of 2 dollars or less live on the day.
"Someday they will find out that the Greeks retire at 50 and spend holidays on the beach. Then you have a problem," he said.
Lee Howell, Managing Director of the World Economic Forum, asked the same way why India's reserves should be used to keep the numerous and well paid employees in public service in Greece, with jobs in poor management, loss-making facilities such as the railways.
Mr Nag said that the crises in the euro area will have "significant domino effects" across Asia.
The prognosis of ADB with an economic growth of 7.5 per cent in Asia for 2011 / is now threatening "the risk of graduation" due to the threat from Europe.
He said that vulnerable emerging markets would have to create "crisis plans" to protect themselves against a downward trend and a significant capital emigration of their dictatorships.
Urgent warnings from the Pentagon against possible cuts in defence
Minister of Defence Leon Panetta heated the Congress on Monday when he warned that automatic budget cuts would weaken national security unnoticed, thereby triggering a financial chain reaction from the halls of the Pentagon to the war scenes in Afghanistan and the civilian flood bands.
The Pentagon is already thinking about reductions of 450 billion dollars in the course of the next decade, but is now afraid that further reductions of 600 billion dollars or more will be necessary if the Congress cannot complete its expenditure.
"The effects of these reductions would be devastating for the Ministry," Panetta wrote in a letter to the Republican Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that a failure of the Congress to achieve a budget agreement, which will lead to a so-called seizure, would lead to 23% general reductions as well as a halt to many new projects.
"Such a high reduction, carried out in such unthought way, would make most of our ship and construction projects unfeasible - you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or building - and other modernisation efforts seriously harm the senators." Panetta wrote to the Senators.
"We would also be forced to unwillingly separate ourselves from a large part of our civilian staff and, as the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would have to vacate civilians with a certain probability to achieve the goal."
"These changes would destroy the faith of those who maintain our military and seriously harm our alert."
The reductions were ultimately encountered by the battle forces, "said Panetta.
"While the war time quotas in the fight against terrorism are not directly affected by the seizure, the serious intervention in the basic budget would adversely affect war efforts," Panetta warned.
"Staff recruitment has been reduced, which would lead to delays in the recruitment and the recruitment supervision that supports the war."
"Staff salaries would be reduced, leading to late payments to war-time dealers and legal and political support would be disturbed."
The two senators answered Panetta 10 days ago and asked for further details about the potential influence of automatic reductions on the Ministry of Defence.
"The consequences of seizing the Ministry of Defence would lead to a rapid deterioration of the United States as the world's leading military power."
"We are firmly opposed to this draconic act," said the senators in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when they published Panetta's letter.
"This is a result that we cannot live with, and it is certainly not something we should be forced to do."
"The seizure is a threat to the United States' national security interests and their entry should not be allowed."
Whether Panetta's letter and the new warnings of the senators will increase pressure on a compromise in the budget or increase the demands to exclude the Pentagon from reductions remains awaiting.
Panetta has increasingly unflooded the possible reductions, although he has been able to gather many years of experience with the budget in the Congress and the White House before he came to the top of the Pentagon, and knows that he is facing serious decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Minister of Defence painted a dark picture of what could happen - a military with shell but without core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a brigade without ammo."
"It's an airforce waiter without enough trained pilots."
"It is a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without sufficiently trained soldiers capable of fulfilling the mission," said Panetta in his opening speech at the Pentagon.
"It is a force that lacks moral and alert and is not able to take it with potential opponents."
"She makes you really angry."
In an annex to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta introduced new details on how reductions "create significant operational risks: delays in crisis times, conflicts and disasters, serious restrictions on our global operational and intervention capabilities, leading to an unacceptable risk in future war operations."
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defensive projects of deletion could be sacrificed, including those already tested and already in the early planning phase.
This list also includes the fighter F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bomb aircraft, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new Littoral Combat Ship and the new ground fighter that the Army and Navy need to replace the Humvee.
If you stopped further development and the F35 tests, this would save up to 80 trillion dollars over the next 10 years, but the supporters say that it is an important next step towards upgrading so that possible dangers can be identified by China and other opponents.
How to reveal a lie
A look at the current headlines shows how worrying and widespread deception and lie are in daily life.
The presidential candidate of the Republican, Herman Cain, is working to rule the accusations of sexual harassment by several women. Both sides accuse each other of lying.
The leadership of Penn State is accused of mentioning because they allegedly retained reports according to which a retired football coach has sexually abused boys.
Last week, an open microphone was heard when French President Nikolas Sarkozy claimed to US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lying destroys careers and shakes countries.
The New York Congressman and Internet Exhibitionist Anthony Weidner made himself a fool when he put in circulation denial that was very quickly reversed by irrevocable evidence.
The former presidential candidate John Edwards is accused of the violations of campaign funding related to the hiding of an extramarital affair.
And then, of course, no one who has experienced the media circus triggered President Bill Clinton when he lied to the Oval Office during his second term of office about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Stories about fools in school and at college examinations are widely used.
There were incidents in which teachers gave their students the examination answers so that they were able to do good themselves in their performance reviews.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send a message that lies and fools are okay.
How much deception do we experience?
As studies prove, we lie every day between 10 and 200 times.
But many of these lies are considered to be an emergency lie.
Another study shows that strangers lie to each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
Knowing lies or "discovering lies" is one that is important to learn for every person, for both personal and professional reasons.
Far from a social game such as scarades, where the aim is to call "Have you!" is the disappointment of a deception a serious field of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades in renowned universities that carried out extensive research projects, especially in the fields of psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the research is that most old myths were tarnished over lying.
Lies look in your eyes.
They stumble, stamp, rot, and don't always squeeze.
However, it must not be concluded that these liars are difficult to detect and disappear.
A trained liar can penetrate to the truth by learning something about the structure of the claim, fine facial expressions, about questioning and timing.
I have spent several years investigating the scientific results of the comprehensive and constantly growing area of disappointment. And it is clear that disappointment of a deception is a modern ability that is easy to learn and helps us to find justice in our complex world, especially when recruiting or questioning people or negotiating or administration belongs to their own professional responsibilities.
Good liars are very good at assessing other people, waking their interest and dominating their own emotions, and they feel intuitive as they are perceived by others.
Thanks to research we know that the extroverted people are more often lying than introverted people that men are more "self-oriented" lies than women whose lies are more "oriented to others" - usually they want to protect the feelings of others - that married people lie less often to their partners than unmarried people (but the lies they tell are usually "fat lies").
We also know that, when a person was disguised as a guilty person, others feel less guilty of lying to that person.
How do you know if someone's lying?
First of all by observing the normal behavior of this person.
This is called Baselining, the starting position.
It provides a reference point for the subsequent evaluation of changes.
Watch the attitude, the laugh, the voice quality of your experimental person.
You should know better when someone usually tripples with the foot, so they don't blame him unjustly if he tripples with the foot during a meeting.
Then pay attention to accumulations of noticeable verbal and non-verbal behavior.
Consider these accumulation as alarm bells that scream, not as proof of disappointment.
People who deceive may starve when they try to remember their story. Perhaps their feet point towards the door or they reject towards the exit, change their position significantly or show a "relaxation after the recruitment conversation," this deep, relaxing exhalation and the change in attitude when all the hard questions are over.
Questioners often incorrectly signal that a recruitment call is over only to keep an eye on after this relaxation after the recruitment call.
Please also note the language of your trial person.
The slider of Scott Peterson is famous when he used the form of the past when he claimed that his dead wife was still alive and triggered a national search for her.
Cheating people can also use a distant language: "I had no sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Lewinsky," or if you repeat a tricky question as a whole.
The most common verbal signs are subtle.
Some people use "qualified language" when they answer a tricky question, "Well... to tell you the truth... as far as I'm aware... according to best knowledge and conscience."
This makes the answer more perceiving than factual, which often shouts the alarm bells.
There is no spell to disappoint lies, but you can learn skills that allow a disappoint.
Thanks to these skills, everyone rarely can be the victim of fraud, both in private and in professional life.
Contentious plan of an oil pipeline is revised after danger by delayed US approval
A few days after the Obama government threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada in the Gulf of Mexico, which caused the trade unions to be upset and at the same time reassuring environmental protectors, the pipeline builders are trying to replan the project so that they can return to normality.
TransCanada said on Monday evening that the planned pipeline will be transferred from the ecologically sensitive area of the Sandhills in Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Nebraska Parliament building.
Alex Pourbax from TransCanada said that the company is still confident that the pipeline is ultimately approved, although with another course.
This was done after an announcement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs last week, after which one would postpone a decision on a federal authorization for the project until the new possible course was reviewed which avoids the area of the Sandhills in Nebraska and the Ogallala Aquifer, a large underwater supply.
"This is a real step forward," said Republican Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, against Fox News.
The new environmental review commissioned by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs may postpone a decision until 2013, after the elections next year, even if officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision.
Last week, Obama stated in a written statement that the decision was a task of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and agreed to support it.
The 1700-mile pipeline was connected Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
She would pump 700,000 barrel of oil from Alberta Province to the Texas refineries.
To this end, the pipeline should cross six states.
Environmental protectors hate them, but labour markets love them, because they appreciate that the pipeline creates 20,000 jobs.
But the legislators of Nebraskas, who are against the plan, weigh the laws to force a departure from the region of the Sandhills and the Ogallala Aquifer, a main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current study on the impact on the environment of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has found that the project has little impact on the environment, but the source of the energy industry states that the Ministry's main auditor has requested a separate probe of the review procedure focusing on two issues.
One is whether a lobbyist who was recruited by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was consultant of Hillary Clinton in 2008, is in a conflict of interest.
The other is whether a company commissioned to carry out the original study was an inappropriate choice as it is related to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle accused her of forced a child out of fear to vomit
A New York family claims that Disco-Diva Patti LaBelle in the lobby of her Manhattan building would have had a crash attack that would have put her little daughter in such a way as to give up fear.
The Tirade of the Lady Marmalade singer made Genevieve Monk, 18 months old, so afraid that she suffered from "personality changes, sleep disorder" and "increased fear of strangers," said her family at the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
It was on 10 November last year when stage worker Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a kindergarten, and Genevieve wanted to leave for a family trip.
While Kevin Monk picked up the car, Roseanna Monk went into her building on the Riverside Boulevard with the luggage and Genevieve on his arm.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped near the door and dropped her daughter for a moment.
"Someone appeared behind me and said," Do you know what your daughter is doing? "I said," Yes, "and went to take her back on her arm," she said.
LaBelle made the pregnant woman angry.
"She said in an aggressive tone," you shouldn't put your daughter off near the door, "said Roseanna Monk.
"I told her," I don't care what you say or think. "
She became angry and started to freak out - she used the F-word and the A-word and got very loud...
She had a bottle of water in her hand and started kicking water out of the bottle on me.
She said Genevieve had become hysterical.
"I said to this woman," Look what you did to my daughter, "said the child's mother.
LaBelle crashed on the mother who was still wearing Genevieve on his arm, and had to be held back from her companion and moved to a waiting car, said Roseanna Monk.
The baby shouted so much that it had to surrender, she said.
Later the LaBelle family asked for an apology, but received no answer.
LaBelle's lawyer and representative did not reply to calls in which an opinion was requested.
The charge is on a non-specified compensation, but the family lawyer, Sam Davis, said he wouldn't charge a fee and plan the family, the money she gets, will donate child cancer aid.
"We want Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her behavior," said Davis.
"This kind of behavior is absolutely unacceptable, especially when it is placed against a kindergarten on the day that carries an 18-month-old baby on the arm."
Climate discrepancies slow down the economy
In the first year where Mario López Valdez is at the government, unemployment and black work increased in Sinaloa, while foreign investments decreased and the economy stagnated.
In 2011, Sinaloas will be remembered in economic history. It is the first year in which Mario López Valdez, who referred to himself as the initiator of change and had great hopes of economic growth, is at the government. However, due to the climate aberrations, growth cannot be mentioned, but on the contrary, the main economic indicators deteriorated.
The low temperatures in February caused not only millions of losses in agriculture, but also narrow limits to the growth of the state economy and caused a general decline in economic activity by 3.6 per cent in the first quarter. This is mainly due to the historical decline in agricultural development by 31.16 per cent, which has reversed further economic sectors.
According to a report published by Consejo Mexicano para el Desarrollo Rural Sustentable (i.e. the Mexican Council for Sustainable Agricultural Development) on the effects of the frost, 582 000 hectares of agricultural land used were damaged, 78.03 percent of which were wholly destroyed and the remaining 21.07 percent were partially destroyed.
The decline in economic activity by November continued to increase unemployment in the Mexican state. The Institute Nacional de Estadística y Geografía observed a rapid rise in unemployment in the first quarter of the year, since from January to March 55 053 inhabitants of Sinaloa did not have employment, which corresponds to 4.53 per cent of the labour force. In the second quarter the unemployment rate increased to 5.28 per cent and from July to September to 6.19 per cent, resulting in 74 000 unemployed in Sinaloa, which is 18 969 more people than in the first quarter of the year.
Lower liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa in the year is due to several factors. Economic scientist Gerardo López Cervantes, Dean of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the University of Autónoma (UAS), commented that public institutions' policy indirectly explains the growing unemployment.
"What we are currently observing is an increase in unemployment, which has to do with several factors. Among other things, liquidity losses in the market due to the reduction of funds by the legislation adopted to combat money laundering in the Congress, because for those who raise bans, it is not easy to let them work for themselves, invest them or use them for anything else," he said.
Migration stopped
López Cervantes pointed out that growing unemployment also occupies a demographic factor.
"The number of people leaving the country in search of work abroad, especially in the United States, has fallen, on the one hand due to the problems of entry and on the other hand because it is difficult to find work there too. These people stay here and look for work, which causes unemployment to rise," he says.
Black work
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is even more serious when taking into account the high proportion of black work, which, according to INEGI, comprises 60.38 per cent of those employed in the country who work without paying in the social security funds.
Unemployment and black work are the lowest wages in Mexico, according to the statistics of the Institute of Mexicano del Seguro Social (Mexican Social Insurance Institute) and the Secretaría del Trabajo y Previsión Social (Government Agency for Labour and Social Services in Mexico).
The average monthly income of workers in Sinaloa was 5352 pesos until September, which is much less than the general government average, which is 7375 pesos.
Reduction of ADI
In addition to the reduction of economic activity and the rising unemployment, the largest decline in foreign direct investment (ADI) over the last ten years is recorded in 2011. According to Secretaría de Economía (State Economic Authority), the ADI was 630 597 dollars from January to June, which corresponds to a swing of 87.74 percent compared to the 5 143 312 dollars in the same period of the previous year.
The Secretaría de Desarrollo Económico del Gobierno (government authority for economic development), on its side, recorded a total investment of 17 280 000 pesos in 2011, mainly from companies from the tertiary sector.
The debt
In the light of the economic crisis, the national government requested a loan of 3 000 000 000 pesos at the National Congress in July to be invested in the reactivation of the economy in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities.
Responses
For the representatives of entrepreneurship, the first year of the government made Mario López Valdé's government inability apparent.
Miguel Loredo López, Chairman of the Cámara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformación (State Chamber of Manufacturing Industry in Mexico), said that no efforts were made in 2011 to harmonise the views of the different sectors, including the national government.
"The economic activity in Sinaloa was really very poor this year. It needs to be worked hard to recover the land lost this year and in 2012 we have to make a double effort. The efforts of all and especially the progress of the already well-coordinated government team have not been sufficiently coordinated," he said.
Slowly economic development
Loredo López said that events such as the Frost at the beginning of the year made the economic development of the country difficult and slower.
"The low economic flow is the result of several events, including frost. One of the most important effects is a slow economy that is not sufficiently moving to create an economic dynamism that could create an acceptable flow of processes, products and services. That is why we will end the year far below our expectations," he said.
Redefine vocation
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, chairman of the Confederación Patronal de la República Mexicana (Mexican Entrepreneurship Association) in Sinaloa, stated that it was necessary to encourage the state to more dynamic productive activities.
"Generally we have observed that work has been done. We believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term programme to redefine the country's economic profession and line, because it is important to activate all material and human resources Sinaloas," he said.
There's a lot to do
The President of Coparmex stressed the importance of developing a future perspective that will guide the government's efforts in a better direction.
"In general, I would say that the government has achieved good results in various areas. Economic development has progressed, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He stressed that the current state power has made progress with the government.
"There are areas in which one can say that the government has acted more extensively. What I can say is that work has been done and that the government is aware that there is still a lot of work ahead of it," he said.
Arrest for 8 kg marijuana
A population of Navolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days in prison for the possession of eight kilo of marijuana.
The Prosecutor of the Republic announced that the drug retailer is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who was punished for a crime against public health - here the possession of marijuana intended for trade.
According to Act AP / SIN / CLN / 687 / 2010 / M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested on 7 Junio 2010 by Mexican military in the surveillance of Cipriano Valdez street against security post No 80 in the village of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug retailer drove in a white truck where he kept a black bag in a box in the car and a small backpack in the passenger seat where the military found eight kilos and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the confiscated product has been handed over to the judge of the district and the penalty remains in the enforcement facility.
Debt for construction
The social buildings provided for by the programmes Hábitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 for migrants are at risk of being unfinished because of lack of funds or only with great delay, Miguel Ángel López Miranda said.
The Head of the Municipal Social Development Authority stated that although the construction programmes have already progressed, they are now in danger, since the government did not pay the funds it has to pay, which exceeds 11 million pesos for the three programmes.
He said that the total investment in these three programmes amounted to almost 50 million pesos, of which 25 percent fell on the state. Up to now only Federación and the municipality would have contributed to the construction work, so a delay in construction termination should be expected.
"12 million must be assisted, and although the year is already over, they have not given us a penny, and that, although they had to pay us a part already in July," he said. "In order not to be late, we have already started the construction work, and they have already gone far, but we need the money."
He stressed that under the government of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the State had failed to fulfil its obligations, so the municipality had to take a loan of 7 million at the beginning of its reign, which corresponds to the amount that the central government had to charge.
"This had already happened to us during the last legislature, because the State had not had enough economic resources. The programmes continued and this year we had to get the funds that the State had not made to participate in these programmes," he said.
Although the public authorities were obliged to pay out these funds, he commented that the Minister for Administration and Finance, was requested to speed up administrative work and pay out the outstanding share as soon as possible.
"Almost 12 million they have to assist, and although the year is already over, they have not given us a penny."
The Court approves the transition to digital television in Mexico for 2015
The transition of analogues to digital signals has been one of the most important changes worldwide in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) rejected the constitutional actions brought by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the Bureau's decision to reject the switching from analogues to digital signals from 2021 to 2015, due to the lack of eight votes required to fight the law.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza, felt that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his responsibilities when he issued the legislative decree with details of the conversion to terrestrial digital television.
With this decision, the Constitutional Dispute raised by the Senate was rejected, since it did not receive the necessary qualified majority of eight votes so that the court could decide on the constitutionality or non-constitutionality. Thus the law remains in force.
In the project for the action prepared by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, it was proposed that the Decree of Constitutional Law should be declared inadmissible, as the rules relating to radio and television are the Comisión Federal de Telecomunicaciones (Cofetel) (Federal Commission for Telecommunications in Mexico), and the Decree of Law would therefore contradict the hierarchical principles and the legal reserves.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted for the project.
With this argument both the Senate and the Chamber of Members lodged constitutional complaints against the legislative decree. After the adoption of the complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero ceased to apply the legislative decree and ceased all activities to establish the digital transmission.
The Council of Ministers also rejected the complaint lodged by the Chamber of Representatives without taking part in the debate on the project for which Minister Sánchez Cordero was also responsible.
In his contribution, the Prime Minister expressed its disagreement with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the country government should not regulate the measures to be taken by the public administration by general rules.
"I do not believe that if this were done, the independence of the regulatory body would be affected." She also recalled that, for constitutional reasons, the central government is responsible for planning strategic policies, such as the telecommunications sector, because it is responsible for state affairs.
The replacement of analogue signals by digital is one of the most important changes that has taken place throughout the world over the last few years, and it improves the use of the radio-electric spectrum, an increased quality of the signal and more channels.
The postponement of the transition, she said, was a postponement of the use of digitalisation, which is a decision in the public interest which has not only technical aspects, "because it covers economic, social, political and security aspects."
These issues, she stressed, "made the whole system necessary to act, according to the principle of economic governance by the State, they included a group of features that lay the Constitution in the hands of the central government."
She remembered that many countries worldwide had already carried out the digital transition, namely the government, although they had highly specialised facilities.
It could not be concluded that the government would intervene in the competences of the Congress with the issue of the contested decree, because the laws adopted by the Legislative were complied with, "she assured.
The possibility of separately counting the voting notes in Michoacán is considered
According to PREP, the difference between the first and second place in the election of the governor is almost 27 percent, with 879 votes of a total of 6074 not yet counted.
This year, the possibility of individual quotation of the voting notes is a reality in the elections in Michoacán, because according to the data issued by the Programa de Resultados Electorales Preliminares (PREP), the difference between the first and second seats in the governor elections is almost 27 percent, with 879 votes of a total of 6074 not yet counted.
In this sense, the President of Consejo General del Instituto Electoral de Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that the electoral office had just adopted a series of rules to harmonise local rules with the reforms of the states in electoral matters last 9 November.
It should be remembered that Michoacán had neither its political constitution nor its electoral law nor its electoral law adapted to the reforms adopted by the Congress, so that they had not entered into force in this round of elections. Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel avoided its publication in the public prosecutor within the time limits set for this election with the argument or objection.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) decided on the constitutional complaint lodged by the local legislature and considered the voice of the State Representative on constitutional reforms as "invalid and illegal," since it did not have the right to "decide or veto against it."
María de los Ángeles Llanderal said in an interview on the possibility of individual counting of votes that thanks to the adoption of the guidelines by the Consejo General del IEM, there was now the possibility that the local electoral authority could count the voting notes partially or completely.
Under the following conditions, the votes contained in one or more electoral packages may be partially counted. The results in the protocols are not consistent; the Minutes on the voting counting and calculation are not in fact available or are not in possession of the chairman of the electoral committee or there are apparent errors or amendments in the protocols.
In addition, the total amount of the full-filled voting certificates may be calculated if there is a difference between the suspected winner and the person on the second place, which is equal to or less than one percent, provided that at the beginning of the meeting there is an explicit request from the party or coalition chairman, who is the second of the candidates mentioned above.
The vote count may also be taken as a whole if, after the proper calculation has been completed, it is found that the difference between the suspected winner and the candidate in the second place is equal or less than one percent, provided that there is an explicit request from a representative of the party whose candidate has become second. In this case, the electoral packages that were suspended for partial counting would be excluded.
It is worth mentioning that the elections in Morelia are in the same situation where, according to PREP, the difference between the first and second place is almost 0.16 percent, although the votes of 129 out of 923 electoral protocols have not yet been counted.
His last will
His ashes will be spread over the Zapalinamé mountains, confirms the family.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés ripped down this Sunday night on Saltillo, his birthplace. On Monday the death show and a death fair took place.
According to family members, the colonel's last will was that his ashes would spread over the Zapalinamé mountains.
After an honour, the family of Bacio Cortés returned to the capital of Coahuila with the others killed during the accident in a plane of the Mexican Air Force. The colonel attended the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At noon at 12 noon the ashes of the colonel landed in the mourning hall, located at the Boulevard Nazario Ortiz Garza, and where the family members and friends came from.
At 5.30 p.m. his remains were examined at the Technical Institute of Saltillo. This body review was initiated by his former fellow students from the technical department and his American football team, which Felipe Bacio belonged to during his preparation for the study.
"He wanted to return to Saltillo and that his ashes would be spread over the Zapalinamé mountain. He had always said so to his family and his friends," Sandra Bacio Cortés, sister of the pilot, announced.
From their point of view, the colonel had fulfilled all his dreams and she felt that he had stood in the full of his life. "He was a successful man, extraordinarily as a father and as a son, a loving brother and he always stood up for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the place of Saltillo very young to enter the school of the Air Force of Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some could not believe it because they thought it would even distract him on a truck. Nevertheless, he always wanted to realize his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembered him as a good person. "He had hardly arrived in Saltillo, and already the whole family wanted to welcome him, as at the opportunity when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo."
The young man recalls that even at the age of seven, he was driven to Zapopán to graduate his family member. That's why he knows that his uncle died when he did what he liked best: flying a plane.
One last farewell
The colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, was adopted with all honour under the leadership of Governor Jorge Torres López. Her honour was given to him by the people and the government, the Mexican army of the sixth military area, the Mexican Air Force, the head of school and pupils of the technological educational institution of Saltillo, where he studied in 1985 and was excellent in both study and sports.
Bacio Cortés died a few days ago, when the helicopter flew by him, where also Secretary of State José Francisco Blake Mora and six other people from the same authority, crashed.
At 6.05 a.m. the embroidered remains of Bacio Cortés, citizens of Saltillo, arrived to be surrendered to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, at the premises of the barracks, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, sisters and other relatives, pupils and teachers.

Wednesday Education of the new Italian Government
The nominated Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to present to him the new government which is to offer the forehead of the crisis that Italy has led to at the edge of the economic collapse.
The nominated Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to present to him the new government which is to offer the forehead of the crisis that Italy has led to at the edge of the economic collapse.
A message from the Presidential Palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet with the President of the State, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm government formation.
It is assumed that he will present a cabinet composed of a majority of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new Prime Minister will be appointed.
Monti said he would present the results of the talks with the political parties on government formation to the President.
"I would like to reaffirm my absolute confidence in the ability of our country to deal with these difficult times," the former EU Commissioner said to journalists.
Monti did not explicitly confirm government formation, but his comments show that the obstacles have been overcome.
The "frame is well set now," he added.
Monti has managed to form a government in less than three days, which is much less time than normal. In the meantime, Italy is fighting against a political and financial crisis which has brought the costs of debt to an intolerable level.
The new government led by former EU Commissioner Monti must adopt a tough savings package, which has been called upon by European politicians in order to restore confidence in Italy.
The pressures at Monti increased by the fluctuating market situation, which led to a 10-year burden on Italian government bonds, which corresponds to the level at which Greece and Ireland saw themselves forced to apply for the European rescue screen.
Emma Marcegaglia, President of the Italian Confindustria Industrial Association, informed the press after a meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government as we could."
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this emergency.
The success chances of Montis were greatly increased by the support of the PDL of Silvio Berlusconi, who had to resign on Saturday following the crisis.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are intended to achieve good results," said Angelino Alfano, Secretary of the Central Right Party.
The support of the PDL, the largest party of Italy, is essential, because so far many of its members have expressed their opposition to a majority of technocrats, which are currently formed by Monti.
Parliament's support
The new Monti government needs strong parliamentary support to implement the probably unpopular savings measures.
Resistance to its efforts or delaying reforms could again result in a devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks also exerts pressure with its indication that a failure of Montis is a disaster.
Monti began on Monday with its debates with political parties, trade unions and entrepreneurship associations as well as with youth and women organisations.
The session will be closed on Tuesday evening.
Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano, who launched an extremely rapid change of government in response to the crisis.
After breathtaking recently at the end of the last week, when it became known that Berlusconi would resign, due to the uncertainty about the success of the new Prime Minister, the cost of the Italian government bonds has again reached critical limits.
Save Italy with a government debt of 1.8 billion euros would be too much for the current EU rescue screen.
Monti said that his government should last until the next elections, which are expected to be held in 2013, despite predicting that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms rather than prefer the elections.
Monti said that he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insisted that this should only be made up of technicians, a reference to their concerns in view of the procedure imposed by the pressure of financial markets.
Political sources point out that mutual mistrust and disputes between the parties complicate the involvement of people from political life.
Spaniards have more games than the Ticos
Of the 22 players who have been called out from Spain, ten more than 50 international games are on the bucket.
From Costa Ricas, only one of the 22 recruited 50 games is behind them.
A huge difference for Costa Rica, when the 22 for the friendship game that takes place today at 3: 05 in the San José National Stadium, are compared with the players set up from both countries.
While the world and Europe champions, the number one at the monthly ranking of the FIFA, can look back to a significant number of Class A selection games, the three-colour team has only the defense player Michael Umana as the only with over 50 international games.
He reached this number on last Friday with the game against Panama (0-2) in Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish players who play in the League de las Estrellas (Starliga) and influential clubs of the Premier League of England each year have the opportunity to participate in numerous home championships (Liga and Cup championships) as well as high-level Europacups such as the Champions League.
In addition, experience with the Spanish Furie in complicated exit games at Eurocup and the World Football Championships.
On the other hand, the Tico football players have few international meetings in the context of the Concacaf, which is at the bottom of the FIFA ranking list.
We will see how the Spanish team draws its last register: the Torwart Iker Casillas, who reached an equation with the former Torwart Andoni Zubizarreta on the last Saturday against England (defeat 0-1 in London) with 126 foreign games.
Casillas will play today against the three-colored team and Spain a new record of 127 foreign games.
= = References = = = = External links = = * Official website
Casillas and Xavi even received recognition last week from the UEFA, together with others of the Iberian team who had reached the magic number 100: the quoted Zubizarreta with 126 and the middle storms of Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
The number of hundreds is also approaching Carles Puyol with 97 games.
He follows Xabi Alonso with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos with 81, Andrés Iniesta with 62, Cesc Fábregas with 61 and David Silva with 53.
From the Ticos side and close to Michael Umana are the left side tower Júnior Díaz with 48 games and the storm Bryan Ruiz with 45.
From then on, only five games were made: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The ones with the least games.
Less than 30 games in the Spanish team Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
From the side of the national team come to less than 30 games Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23
The rest is not even approaching the 20s limit.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, recorded in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson did not have their debut yet.
The historical Torhüter of Spain is David Villa with 50 meetings, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica Bryan Ruiz shot the most gates with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The Quintett included Costa Rica in his tour to celebrate his twenty-year-old existence
"Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that realizes"
In the exclusive conversation with Viva, the Bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam says that the band is prepared to give one of its best concerts on the next Sunday in the National Stadium.
They were expected for more than 20 years, but the band assures that a dream will come true for them when they play in Costa Rica.
This assured the bassist and co-founder of the group, Jeff Ament, who gave Viva from Brazil last week from an exclusive interview.
The band is located in the South American part of its tour to celebrate its twenty-year existence and on Sunday, the 20th, they make their only stop in Central America.
On that day, they will be performing in the National Stadium with the band The X from Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica from 19.30 a.m.
You can read an extract from the conversation, whose full copy can be found in the online edition of La Nación.
For your costarican fans a dream realizes when Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: Do you know what that means to your fans?
Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that is also realized for us.
This is just the second time that we play in South and Central America, and so far it has been great.
I've only been to Costa Rica on vacation once. It is such a beautiful country that we will definitely stay there for a few days.
It's exciting for us to bring our music there.
I ask you this because the fans of the band are completely abandoned, and they experience the days before the concert intensively.
What do you say to your most enthusiastic fans?
Thank you for standing by our side all these years.
We took almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and we're sorry to have taken so long until we got here.
Some people even think that your concert will be the biggest show of the year.
Isn't that a little pressure from your visit?
Some of the most great shows we've had in the last 21 years took place in the last two weeks.
We played a few giant shows in Sao Paulo and we hope they made us fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we want to play there.
We love this country, we like to surf and are enthusiastic about the jungle. Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you meet Costa Rica and his waves to surf?
Many of our friends are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo where the waves are simply unimaginable.
My friends have always traveled to Costa Rica and Nicaragua for surfing. Together with Mexico, they are excellent areas for surfing. In this way, we have learned about people who love surfing.
With a look at the tour you offered giant shows with many songs.
What are your plans for the event in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played there, we have no limits either.
We will try to give the best possible show with many different songs. We want to play a few songs from every album and offer our fans a good and versatile repertoire.
You never repeat your repertoire.
Why?
I think that is partly because we have nine plates and can play more than 120 songs. Everyone likes another song so that the decision that we are going to play is not easy.
If we take two or three songs that we have no longer played into the repertoire, we can better maintain our concentration and they surprise us because they call us the reasons why we liked these songs. Otherwise they could be forgotten.
That makes the show more interesting for us and I think that's why it's also for the audience.
With this tour you celebrate your twenty-year-old story.
When you look back, is it hard for you to believe in your success?
Yeah, totally.
First of all, I believe that no one of us has imagined to play in a great rock band once and for more than 20 years. It seems like a dream.
We also continue to put on this blessing and it is great to be able to make music even now together.
We like ourselves and are excited to produce music.
We are lucky to be able to travel to the places of the world that we have always wanted to visit.
Things couldn't stand better.
What did it mean to you to have actively participated in the birth hour of the Grunge?
It has always been an honor to be part of this group of big bands.
We are good friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising and quite unusual when a movement emerges from a group of friends.
Sometimes a band comes out from a city, but it's unusual when five or ten groups come from the same city at the same time.
We are proud of it and are honored to be part of the Seattle group.
Sometimes we still play together.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and in Canada with Mudhoney and we saw Soundgarden on their tour. We are still happy to be friends with them all and it honours us to be part of this emerged Seattle sound.
It is also very unusual that a band like yours has stayed together with the same musicians for so long.
Yes, four of us have been playing together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) came to us 13 years ago. This alone is much more time than many bands overlap.
First of all, I believe that we all appreciate our happiness to be alive and we also take care of each other.
We are all close friends, so musical paths have opened up that give each individual the freedom to experiment.
One trusts the other and his music.
Your relationship with glory has not always been easy. On the other hand, thanks to your success you could always do what you wanted.
How do you find a balance?
The way we grew has made it easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure not to be on tour too often, because it is too easy to lose this game with huge human masses that love your music.
As long as people have come for music, this reminds you that you have to pay attention to the music and what she has brought into life, without forgetting to be a famous rock star.
What memories do you have of your other project Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote very good songs and at first it was great.
For three years, we were a band that had never released a record until Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
We were disappointed about having taken so long. We are still good with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who built the band with us, friends. When I hear a song or see photos, I think about what an incredible person Andy was and how he made me laugh. It was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh together and talk about music and football and many other issues.
He was an extraordinary person and we miss him.
The Las Robertas national band is responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why the band chose the opening?
Yeah, production sent us videos from several groups and this band liked us best. That's why we're curious to see what Las Roberta can offer live.
Why do you always change the text of Yellow Ledbetter when you play live?
That's a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I have no idea.
He sings him, and I think he sings the first thing he thinks.
Who influenced you as a bassist?
Of so many +
One of the first ones I think are Gezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I like.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep the Grunge alive, even though it's no longer a fashion appearance?
I think we all don't feel very connected with the word Grunge.
When I think about it, I think of the bands that I mentioned earlier, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others who came up at the same time. If they are still important today, I find that great, because it is worth hearing this music and bands like Mudhoney now make better music than ever before.
At first, her music was darker, now it's more positive.
Why?
This is interesting, because I think there are a few songs on the new album that might seem a little light-finished. But there are also other songs like The End or Just Breathe that are classified as very dark songs, although they also have something positive on themselves.
Both of them came to me with tears when I heard Ed play them.
I believe that when you get older and something traumatic has happened in your life - for example when you lose a family member or a friend - that affects your artistic creation and your music and these two songs clearly embodied it for me.
But I also believe that you can be a happy person and still make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori came back to the hospital for medical examinations
The former President Alberto Fujimori was sent to a public hospital on Tuesday to investigate the loss of muscle in his legs, informed his physician.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, who is in prison for 25 years of violation of human rights during his reign (1990-2000), has several diseases, including tongue cancer, which is four times operated and under control.
Alejandro Aguinaga, Congressman and his personal doctor, told the television that Fujimori would be investigated at the Peruvian hospital Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neoplásicas for three days to determine the reason for his pain and muscle loss in the lower bodies.
Aguinaga commented that Fujimori could be insulted for humanitarian reasons. Nevertheless, he did not wish this because he thought he was innocent.
He was operated four times on tongue cancer and he lost 18 kilo weight. Additional diseases such as severe erosive gastritis, a cyst in the pancreas, kidney stones, hypertension and blood circulation problems in the legs, the doctor counted.
Fujimori has been in the prison of Dirección Nacional de Operaciones Especiales de la policía since September 2007.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 persons by the death squad of the Peruvian army, which was secretly active during his reign.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political relations
An official secondment, led by the Uuguayan President José Mujica and composed of several ministers and entrepreneurs, begins on Tuesday her visit to Mexico to expand trade between the two countries and discuss political issues of the region
Mujica will meet with his Mexican colleague Felipe Calderón next Wednesday. According to the Uuguayan President, this will be the highlight of his scheduled schedule with politicians, businessmen and a meeting with the collection of the Uruguayer living in Mexico.
The meeting of both Presidents in the city of Guadalajara "is suitable for the exchange of information on all policy areas between the two countries," announced the Presidential Office of the South American country on its website.
According to local media, Mujica searches for the support of Calderón regarding the incident with France, when French Head of Government Nicolas Sarkozy put the South American country on a list of tax paradies at the G20 Summit in the French city of Cannes.
In his discourse, Sarkozy threatened to exclude those countries that still exist as tax paradies from the international community, which was rejected by Uruguay and raised a question with its ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has been chaired by the G20 since November, a group consisting of the most powerful emerging and industrialized countries in the world. Since January this year, there has been an agreement on the exchange of tax information to avoid duplication with the South American country.
In recent years, the Uruguay Government has tried to speed up the definition of tax information exchange agreements in order to be removed from the "grey list" of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
There has been a free trade agreement between Mexico and Uruguay at business level since 2004, which has contributed to increasing trade in goods between the two countries.
With "Super Mario 3D Land" the dirty installer enters the third dimension
Super Mario has fought for 25 years for the salvation of Princess Peach from the claws of the evil bowser, but never yet in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he fought for the love of the girl in stereo technology.
The game that comes to the stores of the world this month has been tailored from the beginning to the characteristics of the portable console Nintende 3DS, which can be played three-dimensionally without a special glasses.
"Mario is the figure who has to say how the stereoscopy works without glasses," Omar Álvarez, responsible for the press specialized in Nintendo in Spain in the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" was "the first video game of Nintendo that has been developed for this console from the beginning," because so far there have been success articles such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" adjustments of existing title.
Nintendo's spokesman stressed that although it was three-dimensional, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "affordable" video game that allows a fast, liquid game.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D country" contained two games in one: the first part is "easy" to capture the less skilled users.
After that, experts can turn a "second round" over the different levels of play that are becoming increasingly difficult.
In addition, users can choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action. However, to overcome the obstacles without being victims of the "optical effects," it is always necessary to play three dimensions.
This trip Super Marios into the three-dimensional world also means returning the figure to a portable console, which has not been the case since 2005.
With this video game Nintendo begins to the fans of the Saga and repeats the success recipe of the last editions: The sniper-worthy installer must overcome with dangers spiked platforms to free Princess Peach.
However, the player encounters news about the movements, the environment, the disguises and the enemies - and a "playable" Luigi.
Colom guarantees for the delivery of Portillos to the United States
The President of Guatemala, Álvaro Colom, announced this Tuesday that he would accept the extradition of former Governor Alfonso Portillo, so that he would be responsible in the United States for the conspiracy of US $70 million money laundering.
So the process of the US's request for extradition of Portillo ends so that it can be brought to justice there.
In a press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was based on the independence of judicial power and government, taking into account that a ruling court had already ordered the extradition.
He stressed that he had not interfered in court decisions during his government and had accepted all requests for extradition which he was informed of.
Besides Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín is delivered for murder and serious injury, Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Coloms is a government act that takes place when all judicial and constitutional bodies have been exhausted to condemn the former President of the State (2000-2004).
According to the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court of Guatemala, Portillo must be delivered when its legal situation is clarified in Guatemala and its human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was released for the detention of 120 million quetzales in the Ministry of Defence during his reign. This negotiation preceded the extradition, but the minister opposed and revived the case.
Trinijove has helped 6000 young people, threatened by social exclusion
The organization was set up to avoid marginalisation of young people without vocational training.
The first 25 years of life of the Trinijove Social Assistance Organization have led to important results: in this quarter century, 6000 young people, threatened by social exclusion, were supported to find a way out of their difficult situation.
In addition, more than a hundred jobs created for this social group.
On the occasion of the anniversary, an event took place yesterday in the former works buildings of Fabra i Coats, in which more than 300 people participated.
Trinijove was set up in 1986 in the Trinitat Vella district with the aim of helping young people with a low level of education, without work, with drug problems threatened by the risk of marginality.
Yesterday's celebration in Sant Andreu took part in numerous responsible bodies and institutions working with the association during these 25 years.
Participation of political representatives from different directions to election times demonstrated the impartiality of Trinijove's work.
In addition to the President of the General Assembly (Parliament of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia), Artur Mas and his predecessor Jordi Pujol attended the celebrations of the former Socialist Minister for Education Ernest Maragall and the former mayor and currently left-green city council Ricard Goma.
The great hall of Fabra i Coats also visited the current Catalan Minister for Social Affairs and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director-General of the Social Work of the Sparkasse La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas stressed that Trinijove was created in very difficult times and that today's times are not less complicated. But he added that the work so far is "a good basis."
For the President of the Generality Trinijove is a model that knows how to fight difficult circumstances and gives people in difficulty hope.
"The economic crisis is nothing new for the association and the work he does," he explained.
Occupied house, where huge parties were held, was cleaned
The house owners had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments in the building on Balmes Street No 51 (Barcelona).
The twelve house occupants left the building yesterday afternoon without resistance.
Everything suggests that the nightmares of the neighbors of house 51 at Balmes Street have found an end.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building that they were illegally occupied in yesterday afternoon, in which they had organized huge festivals that had driven the neighborhood to despair.
After the cleanup the door lock was replaced to avoid a similar situation.
"From now on, access will be checked," the house manager confirmed.
The house occupants who had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - the rest were inhabited - took the entire electrical installation and part of the water supply. Furthermore, they had registered the walls and left all kinds of waste, especially doses of alcoholic beverages.
In the three lower floors, huge parties were celebrated that lasted up to two days and driven the tenants to despair.
In addition to the building there is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which also suffered damage from it.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europe Press that her business had fallen by 80% since the start of the house occupation.
The owner of the discotheque pointed out that the house crew made their unfair competition, because they sold the drinks to three euros, while they cost 10 euros in the discotheque.
Moreover, the owner of the leisure site had been indicated by the neighbours for deprivation, while according to their statement the noise was not touched by the visitors of the disco, but by the house crew, and especially by the guests of the festivals that were organised there, and which, according to the statements of the annoyed neighbours in recent weeks, became increasingly longer and more.
The discothic controllers stated that the harassment had been so great that it agreed with the owner of the building that it did not have to pay rent for the last nine months.
Guardia Urbana (municipal police) also confirmed that she has received more complaints from the neighbors in recent weeks.
The chairman of the PP (Partido Popular - People's Party) in the Barcelona City Council, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had requested last week to clear the building immediately and to tackle the problems of civil co-existence and the descent of the city district.
He explained that before the summer only one floor of the building had been occupied, but that in the last months the house crew had been pressed forward in all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments. In some it had even come to theft.
In this sense, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to intervene against the asocial actions in the building."
Yesterday, another building in the city district Nou Barris was cleared by the Catalan police.
At 3: 30 a.m. the police approached Montral Road 35 after having received a call from a neighbor who had observed how four people wanted to enter the building.
The four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
The architects agree to the invitation to tender, apart from the debates on fees.
The city call for the 16 gates opens up the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona.
In the middle of the 1980s, at the peak of the now disappeared Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this administration published its fraudulent letter on the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona City.
He was even compared in numbers with the Central Park of New York.
With the fall of the CMB in 1987, the park became in the eyes of many again to the upper limit of Barcelona, because the capital of Catalonia is one of the few that are not spread in the north-south direction, but up (mountains) and down (sea).
The classification of Collserolas as a natural park plays with this idea.
As an example, the Central Park no longer served, but Yellowstone with wild pigs in the role of yogibers.
So far, when the city issued a giant invitation, consisting of 16 competitions, for further access shops to Collserola in September.
There is no doubt that a gate refers to the concept of a park.
Either it is, or someone's planning to put gates on the land.
The question is of course: Collserola, Park or Mountain?
The invitation to tender is not only from an organisational point of view but also from the point of view of a reflection on the city the topic of discussion in the mouth of all architects from Barcelona.
It is already almost a recurrent topic that two members of this old caste who meet in the elevator can rely on.
And precisely this fact provides the substance for one of the rare matches between what three architects from Barcelona think about, and some university professors who have applied to the project.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The invitation to tender is appropriate.
For Roldán "it is necessary" to speak about the "front of the mountain" after the attack on the coast, as far as the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, which has not been carried out over the green apples, has not been carried out.
"It should be assumed that Barcelona's largest park is the beach.
Among other things, because it is well accessible.
Collserola is more complex, "the architect judges, for which the title" Gates of Collserola "contains a" lexical trap ": it must not be considered" as access to a park, but as limitation of areas where trade is required. "
Modol, such as Roldán and Bayona with urban experience, considers the proposal to be a "intellectual challenge" with "some dangers."
Dangers arising from the "uncertainty that is bringing about the design of a public space today" according to the experience of the 1980s which had sung their "pig" in the field of the Forum.
The first fear is the own limitation to what can be built.
"Limiting something always means defining the next step," that is to cross it.
"We need to think about new urban planning instruments, because the current [taking part in the General Metropolitano Plan (PGM)] can lead to a real disaster."
Modol, who keeps closer to the question, believes that the side of Collserola, which goes towards Vallesana, "can be understood as a park that is not in the direction of Barcelona," for purely topographic reasons.
Modol recalls that there is already a study from the Patronat de Collserola that should not "run on deaf ears," although he is grateful to the city administration that she has given his body the opportunity to participate in this project "from the first moment."
He also notes that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the guide letter that allows the architects to take part in the debate, although he expresses his "doubts" about whether this technical profile should lead the multidisciplinary teams ("the right ones," he says) that we architects should only be a tool. "
Bayona points out that the answer to the question in the title of this article is complex, as in the tender conditions a global view of Collserola lacks: "There were 16 cross-sectional competitions," he says, "on the Axis Mountain Sea. But there is no longitudinal perspective that the area as a whole considers."
At least in his case, this led him to participate in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the program and the definition of a project for a gate would collide with that of the architect of the gate next door.
In his view, it is essential that the city guarantee that the strip is equipped directly above the Ronda de Dalt throughout its length, which creates a soft transition between the city and the green areas.
Casino forgives Jonás Larrazábal who comes free
After 72 days of silence, the representative of the Casino Red freed the brother of the mayor of Monterrey from the trial against him for suspected blackmail.
After 72 days of captivity, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal is released after the representative of the Casino Red has forgiven him before the Second Tribunal of the District, which leads the trial against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey for blackmail.
After the assassination of the Casino Royale, Sergio Gil García, the owner of the Casino Red, published a series of photos and videos on which Manuel Jonás is likely to force him to pay a sum of money so that the city administration approves the secret operation of the Wetthause.
After the indictment, the prosecutor opened a criminal trial against the brother of the Panist mayor, who was arrested on September 2 for 30 days.
After four hours with the official of the ministo Público 3 en Delitos Patrimoniales, he was taken to Casa de Arraigo 1 in the Barrio Antiguo of the capital.
He stayed in this place 49 days after a second arrest warrant after the Minister of Público had rejected the crimes for bribery and organised crimes.
On October 19, he was transferred to Cadereyta's prison facility because he suspected that he had buried the owners of the Casino Red with one and a half million pesos. On the other hand, he stayed only a few hours in the middle security street, as there were threats of murder against him.
The authorities allowed him to take part in the trial as a prisoner of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On 25 October, he was sent a warrant by the secretary of the Second Criminal Court of the District, Jorge Yánez, who found that after the almost two months of investigations there was sufficient evidence to blame Jonás for the payment of 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the Wetthaus to open it in return.
This Monday, the representative of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, asked Judge José Luis Pecina to grant the penalty to the mayor's brother, so he will be released in the next few hours.
During the hearing, Ramiro Arias, the official of the Ministry of Público, García Gómez, asked whether he had corrected the damage and who the owner of the Wet House had expressed his forgiveness. However, the lawyer withheld the name.
According to Case 197 / 2011, Jonás Larrazábal is freely spoken and no objections to the proceedings can be lodged, and no compensation is required.
Larrazabal Bretón was released immediately after hearing the representative of the Wet House at 15.50 a.m.
The court secretary, Jorge Yánez, drove to the city prison of San Nicolás de los Garza to inform Jonás that he had been released and his case would be brought to the record.
He also informed him of the court order for immediate release.
The secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the aircraft accident in which the government secretary Francisco Blake and another seven persons died.
The Secretaría de Comunicaciones y Transportes - SCT (Secretariat for Communications and Transport in Mexico) informed that the results of the investigation of the accident in which the government secretary Francisco Blake Mora and another seven persons were killed, pointed out that the helicopter with its entire unharmed structure was blown directly against the ground without the pilot being able to launch an emergency landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary for Communications and Transport mentioned that the pilot had confirmed before the launch that the weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
"The fact that the propeller wing had contact with trees at a height of 25 meters, with the helicopter losing the hull seems to point out that the helicopter had had several ground contacts."
He also explained that the helicopter was built for 19 inmates, so he fulfilled all the conditions for the transport of staff.
He also said that no helicopter parts were found in the field where the machine had come down.
"In the search no aircraft parts were found in other places, the supplement concerned the entire structure.
The helicopter was built for 19 people, so he fulfilled all the conditions for passenger transport.
The area has a scratch of 7 to 30 degrees.
At present, it is a priority to get the results of the investigation as soon as possible, but it could take several months, perhaps even a year.
On the other hand, Gilberto López Meyer, Director-General of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (secretariat for aircraft and auxiliares in Mexico), assured that the helicopter from Estado Mayor Presidencial had flown at the flight rate and the plane fell on a soft slope.
"This information strengthens the assumption that at the time of the collision it was a normal flight operation."
At a press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, identified six relevant points to be taken into account during the investigation:
Visibility flight:
In accordance with the flight standards, it was a flight according to the rules of the vision flight, which means that the crew should have had sufficient visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The AICM recorded suitable weather conditions at the start. During the flight towards the border area between Mexico City and the Mexico State, some deep clouds raised.
Selected flight routes:
It is possible that the team had chosen a lower area with a better view towards the Cuernavaca valley due to the clouds.
Pressure site:
The impact coordinates and the last radar recording of the helicopter agree. Perhaps before the impact there was no loss of control over the plane or a deviation from the flight route.
Dissemination of the remains of the aeroplane in a limited area:
The information available until now suggests that the helicopter was blown from a straight and lateral direction.
The pattern of the scattered airplane corridors suggests that the helicopter was stabbed on the ground with its unharmed structure.
No evidence of fire or explosion:
The remains of the aircraft do not lead to fire or explosion at the scene of the accident.
The latest findings indicate several ground contacts.
The on-site investigations found aircraft parts at an altitude of 9200 feet above sea level. The site is depleted and has a shaft of seven to thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the helicopter probably broke.
Some information suggests that the helicopter could have had several ground contacts.
After a minute search in an area that went beyond the restricted area at the point of accident, no distributed aircraft parts could be found, which reinforces the assumption that the unharmed aircraft structure was blown against the ground.
MSS announces a research protocol to find the gene for obesity
The Social Insurance Institute of Mexico runs a research project to detect the gene for obesity in children and adolescents supported by IPN specialists.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Mexican Social Insurance Institute) announced that it will lead a research project to discover the gene for obesity in children and adolescents under the title "Genetic obesity in childhood and youth," to find genetic markers in conjunction with overweight.
Miguel Cruz López, head of the Unidad de Investigación Médica en Bioquímica (Department of Medical Research, Priority Biochemistry) at the Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI said that an interdisciplinary team consisting of doctors, nurses, food specialists and social workers was built.
This team is supported by specialists and students from the post-graduate course at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and at the Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
The population is invited to participate in the study. Interested parties can come to the sports sites of the IMSS in the valley of Mexico, where tests with children and adolescents are carried out every Saturday at 8: 00 pm.
He emphasised that the investigation began at the sports square of Cuauhtémoc (in the west of the state of México) and has been continued at the sports square of Nezahualcóyolt (in the east of the state of México) since 8 October.
When the target of 500 to 600 investigators has been reached, the study will be continued at Independencia Sports Square (in the south of the capital district) and completed by Morelos (in the north of the capital district).
He stated that the aim of the study was to learn the factors and the role of genetics in connection with the development of obesity and the identification of risk factors for Mexican children and adolescents to prevent chronic degenerative diseases.
At the global day of diabetes, he stated that three thousand children and adolescents aged six to 14 should be able to fill out food-related questionnaires under the supervision of their parents.
They are also asked questions about their physical activity and their family history of disease to control risk factors that could result in diabetes or renal failure.
He also stated that at the said Saturday days the investigators were measured (weight, size, volume of tails), their blood pressure was controlled and blood levels such as glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (attempt to identify genes associated with obesity in children's age) were determined.
Cruz López stressed that this investigation would be carried out in the context of the concern of health professionals about the alarming weight increase of young people.
"The health surveys from 1999 and 2006 showed that in just six years the proportion of fat boys increased by 77 percent and that of girls with fat livelihood by 47 percent. Also the overweight was dramatically increased," the IMSS specialist stressed.
He stated that the search for genetic markers was founded because the genetic history of the Mexican population differs from that of other peoples.
He stated that an average of 65 percent of Mexican (in) was Indian-American, 30 percent of European and 5 percent of African descendants, reflecting the genes associated with diabetes and overweight.
In general, he declared that the genetics of obesity pressed in the inability to burn the surplus of the energy taken to us (calories), so that it was stored in the form of fat.
The researcher stated that the direct benefit for the investigators was in a comprehensive study of the children, which would determine whether they had a degree of overweight or obesity.
It would even investigate the occurrence of dark skin folds in the neck and on the inner arm (atanthosis), which indicate the likelihood of metabolic disorders and pre-stage diabetes.
All information would be treated confidentially and notified to the parents in writing by the doctors. The doctors explain to the parents all the results of the measurement and propose to them changes in the lifestyle that are appropriate to the prevention of diseases.
Cruz López explained that there were three basic factors responsible for overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: lack of movement, i.e. lack of movement in everyday life, to spend most of the time of the day before television and use means of transport, instead of walking short paths.
The high calorie intake, i.e. increased consumption of sugar drinks and carbohydrates (Tamales, bread, pizza, hamburger, etc.) together with a high fat and protein intake as well as the genetics to be analysed in this research project.
Asphalt from UNAM prevents stroke holes
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry at the Mexican University UNAM develops modified asphalt with polymers to make the mixture more resistant to weather conditions and temperature fluctuations
If the signs were taken into account from the street siege, it would not be necessary to repair nearly 200 000 stroke holes if the rainy time at the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (city area of the valley of Mexico) broke out, Rafael Herrera Nájera, researchers at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) at UNAM, warned and assured that if the layout and maintenance of the ashtray were done adequately, the number of slaughters was significantly reduced or even completely avoided.
In his lecture "Blowlights from a technical perspective," he held at the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory for which he is responsible developed with polymers modified asphalt to produce a mixture similar to the asphalt, but that has greater mechanical resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera believed that this type of modified asphalt should be used in areas with extremely hot climate, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve the behaviour of the road siege and thus avoid the occurrence of strokes.
He explained that the asphalt - the heavier part of the oil - is a hydrocarbon compound, some of which have a high molecular weight - the so-called asphalt - and the other part a low - the so-called malthene. Together, they grant the street coating its characteristic delicate behavior.
The adhesive behaviour of the asphalt means that it acts like a liquid at high temperatures of almost 180 ° C, it is very liquid at 120 ° C and almost solid at 50 ° C while it becomes fragile at very low temperatures.
"This means that the resistance of asphalt on the streets is not identical, but changes in one day depending on the weather conditions and temperature fluctuations," the chemistry engineer performed.
The researcher of the FQ noticed that the streets of Mexico city had a majority of flexible road coating, consisting of six material layers, of which the last three were asphalt.
Between the top layers there is a wear layer of asphalt, which consists of small, in asphalt bathed and then attached stones.
Every single stone of this wear layer had been bathed in asphalt.
When the vehicles move on and forces are generated, this layer allows a good distribution of power in the road coating.
"If it were modified asphalt, the forces would spread even better," the chemistry engineer said.
"Over the wear layer," he said, "one last layer is interpreted, the so-called carriage layer consisting of tiny stones, i.e. sand, which was also bathed in asphalt.
Since these layers are in contact with the vehicle tyres, they need a greater mechanical force than the wear layer and they need to produce friction.
The most forces received and distributed by this road layer also require an appropriate thickness and the material it consists of must be maintained.
The weather conditions, especially moisture and temperature fluctuations, are other important factors to take into account, above all the water, "he said," because it significantly affects the behaviour of the wear layer.
When the site gets wet, water penetrates the layer and comes out only difficult again. This causes a deviation of all layers of the road surface and consequently the occurrence of stroke holes.
When a stroke hole arises, "he said," first the cover layer is carried off, while the wear layer is not affected until after that. But the damage is not caused immediately, but it is a process that should be maintained with the first signs through appropriate maintenance programmes. "
The member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (Mexican National Research System) stated that the vehicle load is another important cause for the occurrence of stroke lamps. Therefore, the thickness of each layer of road belag must always be in proportion to the vehicle load and it must be ensured that this rule is complied with in order to avoid frequent stroke lamps.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that a lot of research was still waiting for, for example, on asbestos mutations that were already on the market in other countries and with which the battleholes could be repaired easily and without the use of high temperatures.
What was the candidate del Valle missing to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that affected Melina Ramírez Serna not getting the crown of Miss Colombia.
El Valle receives his 14th misappropriation.
Once again, Valle del Cauca was empty in the award of the crown for Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to be satisfied with standing on the winner stage, presenting a silver crown and the band she identifies as a new Miss Colombia.
With the result received this night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico took the crown and the cedar, the department already comes to 14 misstitel and Melina saluted to the legion of women from Valle del Cauca, who had held the crown near in the hands. Among the proclaimed misses are: Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Eóvers (1989), Mariana (Mariana), Mariana Garcine (1989), Mariana (1989).
The big question that many of us are asking today is: what was missing?
Because the result corresponds to the defeat of a great favourite who had shown in every lecture that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia. Not for nothing she had been elected to the Queen of the Police and Mejor Rostro Jolie of Vogue, titles which also received the beauty kings of Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro, and which took the crown of Miss Colombia home.
The first factor that is considered decisive for the jury's decision to appoint her first Miss is that she did not convince the answer to the question "What book has influenced you most and why?" which had been asked to her by Martín Murillo Gómez by Carreta Literaria Leamos.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca replied to the questioner:
"I read a lot, I believe quite in literature, I think it's a kind of civilization, ultimately I believe that the book that was most pronounced for my childhood, 'The little prince' is a pretty deep-haired book.
At present I read 'Guilt and Sühne'. It is a book of universal culture that we should all read. I am reading a book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book called 'passion'.
An answer that came upon little contradiction, firstly because of the concept of 'civilizing' and secondly because it had not specifically explained how each of her books had influenced her.
But after completing the ceremony Melina declared to feel calm and happy with the result: "The universe is wise, it happens what has to happen.
And for all people, please read a little "The Little Prince." It's a great book.
Among other things, it is said that the love of El Valle is burned out.
A journalist from Bogota pointed out that the fact that she was the preferred person who had all the applause and who had received all the prizes in advance (gastronomy competition Easter, audience mood on the best hand-cut costume and Reina Madre), "the other candidates had made jealous what the queen stressed, which therefore could not shine on stage."
And that was noticed in her first performance in the bathing suit on the beach of the Hilton hotel and in her two elevators at the crown celebration.
Although she appeared safely with both, she lacked the strength and the momentum of the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the Como en casa program at the RCN channel, said that the fact that Melina was crowned as a miss, "shows that the candidate who wins most prices during the competition will not eventually become queen."
In addition, Valle went out of the way to the end of the press - a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle could not convince the Jurie about its interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of national beauty competition.
It will already have his reason that two days before the compilation of the international jury Lucy Doughty explained that they were looking for a woman who was committed to the social affairs of her country.
"Beauty alone is not enough for a Miss Colombia. You have to look beyond the physical and focus on the social sensation that she had already participated in the competition in projects," she said.
It is also speculated that Valle had sinned with her defects of derriere and fibrose that were noticed in her stomach. But that is contradictory, because the jury chose her as a candidate for 'natural beauty' with a healthy body, good nutritional habits and responsible physical work.
The coach of the queens, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that Melina didn't have the best body that there was better, "but her problem with the fibrose on the belly, which was really hard to notice for me, pressed her score on the last day."
Meanwhile, the journalist Guido Hoyos of the magazine Cromos felt that the woman's error from Valle del Cauca had been the surgical interventions she had undergone.
"The operations are okay, but Valle didn't know how to make them right.
Her body has never been her strong side, and this place she had to pay. "
Because of this prize, which is awarded for the first time by the National Beauty Competition, a cruel prediction emerged after the appearance in the bathing suit that was supposed to be true in the night. It was conceived that Raymundo Melina had given a comfort prize to not allow them to enjoy the crown.
Whether that is true or not, the fact is that Melina will join her reign year from today, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that will allow her to represent at the appointment of the National Beauty Competition Colombia in one of the international competitions.
However, as one of the queens who had escaped the crown despite her overwhelming appearance for Cartagena, she will enter history.
So the work of the doctor who identified the body of Alfonso Cano was
A Lophoscopist from Cali entered history as the man who identified "Alfonso Cano."
The work of these officials plays a key role.
Last November, a Lophoscopist of the Attorney General's Investigation Unit (CTI) from Cali was the man who confirmed the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia), including "Alfonso Cano" by comparing the fingerprints.
Of the seven Lophoscopists in the CTI department, this week, Eliazar González had a preparedness service, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working for 21 years in criminal investigations.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in municipalities of Chocó, where he often had to go to the jungle for five days to reach the place where the bodies he should identify were found.
In 2000 he settled in Valle over and after completing the necessary courses he specialized in looscopy, which is the examination of the skin that is exposed to friction, i.e. the hand and foot surfaces.
In the week of the operation against the so-called Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was told to pack clothes for at least three days.
Something big expected him.
On Friday night he flew in the helicopter from Palmira to Cauca.
He knew that he should identify two bodies, and that there was a suspicion that one of the man who led the world's oldest guerrilla could be. That's why he should take the 10-finger print sheet from Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
However, when he reached the place where the body was found, he could not identify him because of his physical appearance, because this was similar to the images he had seen in the mass media.
He had no beard, was dressed like a farmer in the area, wore no glasses and was much thinner.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Armed with a lube, ink, plant cellar and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the body's fingerprints with those on the print sheet.
He had seen right, it was "Alfonso Cano."
The same night, this man from Puerto Tejada was responsible for informing the Minister of Defence, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that it was actually the head of the FARC.
For trace search
For a Dactylos purchase by Sijín in Cali, the appreciation that President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar González had given at a press conference on the use of Cano was very important.
Many people don't know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science without error rate, which can be a key factor in the resolution of a crime.
Lophoscopists do not only identify bodies, they also support investigations in murder and robbery cases and confirm the identity of the arrested persons.
When they're arrested, many criminals present false ID papers or they don't have any.
We'll take the fingerprints and search them in the database.
The researcher told us that he had to rip a piece of wall out of a house at a theft, because the thief had just raised himself with his hand when he pulled out a safe with jewellery and money full of stuffed money.
"Walls are difficult because their surfaces are inappropriate for the removal of fingerprints. But in this case we could take the print of the whole hand and identify the criminal who had participated in several theft," he remembered.
With the fingerprints, murder suspects can also be loaded or loaded.
Recently, a dead man was found surrounded by liquor bottles.
In the investigation, it was suspected that a family member could be suspected and actually agreed a fingerprint on the bottle.
Although this does not guarantee that it is the killer, it is linked to the place where the crime was committed.
A CTI Dactyloscopist stated that "the fingerprints with chemical or physical reagences were taken from the object."
When they appear, a plant cellar or a band will be used to take part.
After that, the prints will be sent to the Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the staff office.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without identification papers," said the CTI expert.
He said that not everything was as it would be in the TV series SCI.
Like not all gold is shiny, not all you touch is a fingerprint.
But yet it can be used if you make a corresponding comparison.
The "affront" challenge the authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators were forced into tents in Zuccotti Square.
A large part of the site was placed in a nearby park.
The members of the Ocupy Wall Street movement challenged the authorities of New York on Tuesday when they re-tried to enter the Manhad Square with a court order after they had been cleared from the place in the morning and tried to occupy another place on the Big Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrators forced themselves to join before the Zuccotti Square, which they wanted to give access to with a court order that allowed the "disgraceful" the new tent at this place. In the meantime, another part of the movement remained at the space warrant and occupied a park further north in the city where nine arrests occurred.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camping in the square, we will find ourselves in another place and continue the battle with legal means to return to Zuccotti, with its-in and peaceful demonstrations," said Mark Bray, one of the speakers of the movement "Ocupy Wall Street."
Bray argued that the answer of the "disgraceful" to the eradication of their tent camp, which had been ordered directly by Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, came to court, where the Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the violent eradication of the place and approving the tent to the demonstrators.
In addition, the "Empörten" occupied a new park located at the crossroads of the central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue close to the entrance to the Holland tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and owns the Trinity Church.
They were able to occupy the place for at least an hour, but then the police arrived and arrested some of the demonstrators, although Bray cannot give precise numbers. He assured the news agency Efe that he had also seen several journalists with handcuffs.
The organization assures that hundreds of people had found themselves in this place, where also a deportation of religious leaders had arrived as a sign of their support for the members of the movement and for mediation with the police.
In the meantime, the Zuccotti Square (a private property site) remains closed in anticipation of a judicial hearing which is still scheduled for this Tuesday and where the legality of the vacation found in the morning gray is to be analysed.
Some of the protesters driven from the place carried photocopies of this court order with them and distributed them. They even gave them some policemen who watched the place, which resulted in "some small collisions," as Bray reported, who had indicated that some of the police had beaten demonstrators.
The court order forbids the authorities to remove members of Occupy Wall Street from the square and the application of "laws adopted after the occupation and to prohibit demonstrators from returning to the park with their tents and other things they had used before."
Mayor Bloomberg explains in front of the press that, due to this court order, the re-opening of the public transport and demonstrators place had been abolished. The demonstrators pointed out that the city laws did not allow them to restore themselves with tents and sleeping bags at this place.
The mayor personally defended the clearing of the Zuccotti Square, where nearly 200 people were arrested, which was decided because the demonstrators "violated the law."
Bloomberg explained that he had given the order to clear the place because it had "transformed into a place where people did not come to demonstrate, but to break the laws and in some cases to harm other people," because "some business had received threats" and the residents were banging "for their quality of life."
"The dawn was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is essentially interested in protecting the financial interests and not in protecting the interests of the North American workers," added the spokesman of the movement that accused the mayor of "not respecting the freedom of the press."
The leaders of "Occupy Wall Street" informed them that they thought about organising "major actions" for Thursday, together with community organisations and trade unions, to remember the two months that have taken the protests since September 17.
Pamela Anderson is the Virgin Mary in the TV Christmas Show
Together with Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, she will appear on December 1st in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas"
The Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement," rescue swimmer in "Baywatch," rabbit at "Playboy," the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee, and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary at a Christmas broadcast of Canadian television.
The private TV channel CTV today announced that Anderson, along with the "crooner" (ballads singer) Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, will appear on 1 December in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" and will embrace a very special virgin Mary's life.
Today, CTV broadcast pictures of the television program in which Anderson - also for the dissemination on the Internet of a self-directed porn, where she is to appear together with her former husband, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe," Tommy Lee, as a virgin Mary with a doll in the shoe that Jesus represents.
In the scene Peters, a known Canadian comedian of Indian origin, who recently worked as a moderator for the show "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" by Charlie Sheen, appears as a Jesuskind.
The CTV Christmas program is not only based on Anderson and Peters, but also on the Canadian singer Bublé, who married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato at the end of March in Buenos Aires, and who is not far from this controversy.
Bublé had recently called the North American Kim Kardashian "whore" at one of his concerts in New York.
Japan is reborn after the earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the spiral of the free case from the beginning of March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralysed, which is still in recovery after the destructive earthquake that led to a nuclear crisis, and the worst disaster Japan had experienced in the Second World War.
The first estimates made by the Tokyo government evaluated the material damage to $300,000, a blow which seems to be weakening despite the difficult world economic situation.
After three quarters of cases, the data on gross domestic product were used from July to September to finally complete this chapter: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% to the year-to-year rate.
The value measured in the second quarter - in Japan the financial year starts in March 2012 - also means the fastest growth since January to March 2010.
The recovery can be partly explained by the machine sale for the reconstruction of the areas devastated by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1% compared to the decrease of 0.9% for investments recorded from January to March, the first decrease after six months of unsustained growth.
Nevertheless, the actual reverse of the Japanese economy is not solely based on keynsian attacks that use the crisis to build or rebuild infrastructures.
Japan is awakened in particular thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable rose by 1%, due to increasing expenditure on vehicles, travelling and leisure work.
The Stigma of the Yen
Tokyo has entrusted itself to the domestic market after the Yen - the Japanese currency - has become one of the "refuge currencies" of investors who flee before the euro-zone debt crisis and the dry forecasts for the United States, a privilege that loads like a tombstone on the accounts of export companies.
With a harder currency, products abroad are more expensive, a serious problem for a country whose economy is based on the health of large technology producers.
Toyota and Sony, for example, returned their weak business results from July to September to the quotation of the Yen.
While the markets continue to occupy the peripheral EU countries, the Yoshiko Noda government remains vigilant.
"We need to pay attention to the persistent risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of floods in Thailand and the rapid upgrading of the yen," said the State Secretary for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa yesterday.
The perspectives are really not very ambitious.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) stated that most Member States had identified clearer signs of slow economic development in September.
The indicator predicting the turning points of the world economy highlighted that the biggest economic potential would have been braking.
Because he sank by four tenth up to 100.4 points less than the 100.8 in August.
The euro area is even below this average value, which is 100 after it has dropped by eight tenth to 99.13 points.
Athens makes doubt rise again
Papadimos says that the austerity measures will be adopted, but the Conservatives will not sign a written agreement
With the risk premiums of the peripheral countries and widespread uncertainty, Greece continues to be lost in the labyrinth resulting from the major European debt crisis.
The impression that the "consensus" of the new Greek transitional government is more a response to the pressure from Brussels than a real conviction of political forces is slowly demonstrated by facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, pointed out yesterday that there were no alternatives to structural reforms and that the hundreds of days agreed on his appointment might be too short for their implementation, the leader of the Nueva Democracia Conservative Party, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would support the new savings measures and in no case withdraw his request for new elections at the scheduled date, 19 February.
"The most important task of this government is the implementation of the decisions taken at the summit of 26 October," yesterday Papadimos assured to open a parliamentary debate which will reach its peak tomorrow with the confidence vote for the new government.
A package of 24 employment promotion programmes, the reform of civil servants' disciplinary law and new measures to combat tax evasion are the first initiatives.
Nevertheless, Samara's communication does not expose doubts about its attitude: "We have committed ourselves to support the transitional government, but otherwise to nothing."
The conservative leader went a step too far with his challenge of the EU and the IMF, the organism that needs to unlock the 8000 million that Athens needs urgently. He made it clear that he would not approve of a declaration of commitment on the implementation of savings measures.
But the European Commission, which is still irrational because of the impact of the Papandreu referendum, reaffirmed yesterday that its request should not be reversed: economic aid would not be signed if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties were "not to sign a clear written agreement as soon as possible."
The spokesman of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, stated that the troika inspectors were coming back "very soon" to Athens to discuss with the new government, "which for the payment of the sixth section" of EUR 8000 million "is" needed, "although there is no final date yet.
The Greek knuckle has a little bit of fiddle.
Queen Sofía: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen emphasised the "dominant" position of Spain with regard to this type of financing
Spain "has achieved a dominant position in the role of micro-finance worldwide."
The Queen Sofía of Spain recalled yesterday that Spain has developed in the last two decades to become the second donor worldwide for this means of international cooperation. Its "beings" are based on the fact that it is a "instrument for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all humanity based on human trust."
The queen gave the fifth World Summit on micro-credit in Valladolid yesterday. She was convinced that there would be no doubt that this kind of business would be "absolutely essential" to achieve the millennium goals set by the United Nations by 2015 and "in particular the goal of the number of people living with income of less than one dollar a day, i.e. below the" poverty limit. "
Spain "continues to work" on the extension of the beneficiary network "to the last corner of the world and it is responsible for this task," said Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and contributions that will take place from the summit until Thursday will be guaranteed "the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest and, in particular, for women" as the main beneficiaries of these loans.
"We have recorded many successes" and "many challenges are facing."
The micro-credit summit is not only a forum for debates but also a platform for the launch of "two fundamental objectives."
The Queen stated that it was intended to have 175 million poor families access to these financial services by the end of 2015 and that ten million of these households will exceed the poverty limit.
The concept of micro-credit goes back in Spain and the rest of the world on the path initiated by Muhammad Yunus "years ago," which the Queen Sofia judges as a "act of justice and recognition."
The father of this financial instrument described it as a "admirable idealist who committed itself to the fight against poverty" and whose work she has known for 15 years when the queen travelled to Bangladesh to get to know the loan strategy on the ground.
This experience followed a year later the first World Summit in Washington and further meetings on the Ivory Coast in 1999 and Canada in 2006. In all, "we have been able to observe a continuous development," the Queen, whose commitment to this project yesterday presented her the assessment as "Chief of the Family" in Valladolid and as "Princess of the poor."
Finally, Queen Sofia ended her lecture by animating the attendants to participate in the debate and to find solutions in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical commandment'
Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez pointed out that solidarity is "an ethical commandment" for the entire democratic state.
In this sense, it stressed that it was a mistake to bind development aid to times of economic boom, because it was a "permanent commitment."
Jiménez felt that micro-credit was a "serious and rigorous policy to eradicate poverty," and that the governments of the industrialised countries now need to work "more than ever" according to solidarity criteria and not allow the crisis to be sacrificed.
For Spain, micro-loans are one of the "most important forms of development aid."
The State Secretary for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, said "success," "marginalized" people, "who are always in front of closed doors" to give "hope" and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed the attendants in a city that "opened their gates, inspired by the spirit of solidarity."
The CDU proposes to elect the EU President on the basis of a general vote
The first day of the Congress of Christian Democrats (CDU on Monday, November 14, in Leipzig was for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and Chairman of the Christian-Democratic Party, without real difficulties.
The future of Europe was originally not foreseen in the programme, but was in place in the autumn, in particular to provide enough to those activists who consider government policy to be too lax today and perhaps tomorrow in Italy.
The presidential proposal from the European Commission, proposed by the Bureau, was adopted almost unanimously.
In 1001 delegates, only nine voted against, 10 abstentions.
The several minutes of standing Ovation, which was first of all due to Angela Merkel's interventions, and a few hours later Wolfgang Schäuble, did not reveal any doubt from the three European financial ministers.
The main title of the Chancellor - as well as the request - is the following slogan: the answer to the crisis is "not less, but more Europe."
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because "nine million jobs are directly dependent on the euro."
For the Chancellor, "the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe."
This could be reflected by a modification of the Treaty of Lisbon, which strengthens the control of the European Union, as regards the budgetary policy of the euro area countries, but also by the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of a general vote, "in order to give Europe a face."
However, this is certainly one of the proposals adopted by the Congress, which Mr Schäuble Pate clearly stood.
Certainly, it is very unlikely that the 47 quickly agree on this revolution: Great Britain is opposed to the situation, and the CDU leaders believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is the same opinion.
However, the milestone is laid.
Similarly, delegates, in a overwhelming majority, have rejected the proposal to weigh each country in the Governing Board according to the weight of each economy, which obviously would result in a strengthening of Germany's position.
The Chancellor in charge of calming the climate within her party has therefore strengthened the reference points to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. However, she has no longer tried to gain her congress at the expense of the "small" or the European countries in difficulty that would immediately criticise the arrogant Germany.
As far as the European request dedicates the significance of "German-French friendship" to a paragraph, Angela Merkel does not call France on the plan.
At least not directly.
Because this reminds us that Leipzig was at the heart of a bloody battle two centuries ago.
In fact, one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What does the fraud represent in sickness reports?
After family support, UMP and government are now taking on the sickness reports.
Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive in Bordeaux on Tuesday, 15 November to visit a family support fund and to present a speech on the issue of the fight against social fraud and economic dependence on the state, which has always been recurring since 2007.
In order to accompany this attack, which is based on the attempt to undertake the economy in a hardened sample, but on the other hand, the majority wants to focus on employee disease reports, not less on an axis of the right presidential campaign.
Firstly, with budgetary objectives: the government intends to introduce a fourth day before taking into account a health report for private sector workers.
In good German, this means that a sick worker would lose the wage of four days without the authorisation of the specific company, i.e. at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that is threatened by the daily newspaper "Les Echos," but would help to introduce 280 million euros.
And the more symbolic characters associated with another measure were: to give the State officials an unpaid karenztag in the disease trap (so far there is for them, in contrast to the three karenzdays in the private sector, no karenzfrist).
In the meantime, these issues are being discussed, the majority also draws up the fraudulent issue, this time focusing on the abuse of work absent.
"Controls will be much more important, and in addition, if required, these reimbursements are," Xavier Betrand warned on Sunday, 13 November before the microphone of the transmitter RTL.
As in other cases, the impact of this notification on the reality of fraudulent acts in the field of disease reports seems somewhat disproportionate.
In fact, this has been the subject of permanent observation since 2002, as well as of political openness, which has been the most common fruit.
The French are no more ill than people elsewhere in Europe.
However, let us begin with the country-wide figures.
According to CNAM, more than 237 million euro daily deposits were paid in 2006.
Means of the Health Institute for Economic Research and Documentation accounted for €11.3 billion of health expenditure in 2008.
46% of this amount fell on maternity leave and accidents at work and 54% on sickness leave, which is EUR 6.2 billion.
And hence, 2.5% of health expenditure.
In 2010, according to a study by the Alma Consulting Group, the French were granted on average only 14.5 days of illness compared to the 17.8 days in 2009.
A mean value that conceals certain differences: another site published in 2007 by Monster.com, a career planning website, showed that 75% of the 40 000 respondents, French workers who were questioned, did not take a single day of illness.
Another study, this time covered by health insurance, makes it clear that 37% of disease reports in 2010 were less than 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between 1 and 3 months and 11% above.
Thus, compared to their European neighbours, French workers tend to incapacity to work elsewhere.
A long-term study conducted by two researchers from the French State Research Centre (CNRS) in 2010 showed that between 1994 and 2001 the global absent rate (disease or otherwise) was oscillated, ranging from 10% to 11% in France, from 20% to 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
The fraud in the case of sickness reports is a disappearing small proportion of black work.
As far as fraud is concerned, only a weak measure is achieved here.
The reinforcement of legislation since 2002 entails systmatic checks on disease reports that exceed 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM (public university for the training of technicians and engineers) found that 13% of the 285,000 of the short-term disease reports that were carried out in 37.050 cases were "unjustified or too long."
In systematically controlled cases of disease reporting of more than 45 days, less than 1.2 million of 11% were "unadapted or unjustified" cases, i.e. 132,000.
Thus, in total, 169.000 "unjustified" cases involve several million workers who have claimed disease.
A figure that represents only a weak size compared to that of black work, for example.
According to the UMP Member, Dominique Tian, author of a report on this issue published in July, this represents between EUR 9 and EUR 15 billion tax loss per year, i.e. more than the total cost of daily allowances, and therefore much more than the depreciation of the latter.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new adjustment plan
Greece needed a new adjustment programme to begin its economy.
This was announced on Monday, 14 November by Prime Minister Lucas Papademos to Parliament, adding that the one-hundred days of its government from the Union were not enough to do this task.
"In order to continue efforts to strengthen the economy, we need support from our European partners as well as a new budget adjustment programme," said the Heads of Government in his first public speech at the opening of the debate on the Parliament's confidence vote on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurosummit meeting on 27 October was the "main task" of the new government, as the country's participation within the euro area "would" be at stake, "as it added.
Accordingly, M. Papademos planned to reduce the country's government deficit by 9% of GDP from today to the end of the year, after it was 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The rights denied the new savings measures
On Monday, Antonis Samaras, head of the right wing, had given his consent to the already approved measures regarding an attempt to escape from the debt crisis, but provided that his party would not recognise itself to an additional saving.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said on the occasion of a Parliamentary Assembly of his party New Democracy.
He had agreed to reduce budgetary deficits and debt, as well as to combat waste, but was hostile to any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
Olli Rehn, EU Commissioner responsible for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who had prevented the IMF and the EU from releasing the necessary loan of over EUR 8 billion without a written guarantee to all parties about their support for the planned measures, had Antonio Samara replied that his word was enough and he would not sign anything under pressure from the outside.
Euthanasia and accompanied Friday must be legalized, according to an expert body
The Canadians live in denial of death, as a report from the Royal Society of Canada
The panel stated that governments, health care institutions and doctors cooperated on painkillers in order to provide the best painkillers, and beyond the cases of cancer.
The Canadian society lives in a refusal to die.
Only 9% of Canadians can actually talk to their doctor about conditions under which they want to die and meet dispositions for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, involving six experts involved in various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
This body recommends that the government amend the criminal law in such a way as to allow accompanied suicide and euthanasia where this choice takes place, in the case of patients who are considered capable of making such a decision.
As a starting point, the experts quote a recently published survey by the independent company EIU, which had compared death quality in 40 countries of the earth's balls.
Although Canada has placed itself on the 10th rank, the study notes that "medical care in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to cut the issue of death."
Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians have no access to painful drugs, so the experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada report to us.
And despite the majority of Canadians' desire to die at home, 68.6% of them eventually die in the hospital.
From the country as a whole, the rate of death in the Quebec is the highest at 86% in hospital.
In the delicate question concerning Euthanasia and accompanied suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that are opposed to the position of the federal government, which has already stated that no changes to the law on Euthanasia and the suicide associated with them are to be made.
Now, however, according to the experts who have inspired all those countries whose approach to Euthanasia and accompanied suicide have legalized or discriminated, there is no evidence that such decriminalisation would lead to abuses in their application, i.e. the practice of Euthanasia or accompanied suicide by incompetent or non-consent persons.
On the contrary, much more cases of such violations are encountered especially in countries where Euthanasia and accompanied suicide are not legalized, as confirmed yesterday by Jocelyn Downie, co-signatory of the report in a teleconference.
"Euthanasia is practised in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"Also accompanied suicide is practised in Canada, although clearly illegal here," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadian support the Euthanasia
Let us bear in mind that, according to an Angus Reid survey conducted in 2010, 85% of Canadians had already spoken in favour of Euthanasia, as they believe that these people were allowed to mitigate their suffering at the end of their life path.
And 66% believe that the situation of legalisation of Euthanasia does not result in the message that the life of older or disabled people has less value.
As regards those who have already practised a accompanied suicide, 41% of respondents believe that they should not be persecuted by criminal law.
As regards the maintenance or recruitment of the resources in patients, the situation is less clear, according to the rapporteur.
They also suggest in their list of recommendations that the Criminal Law should specify that the suspension of the means for which a legally valid refusal was made should not be considered criminal.
The expert body also calls for healthcare professionals to be trained in the task of respecting the cease-up of the means at the end of life, and to be afraid of this without criminal prosecution.
The panel stated that governments, health care institutions and doctors worked together on painkillers in order to provide the best painkillers, and beyond the cases of cancer.
Finally, as regards the funds already widely used in the Canadian institutions for health care, the body calls on the Council to consider them at least as they did not serve as a result of reducing physical pain and seeking the same procedures.
Reservations of other experts
Some experts in the field of health have already expressed reservations about the conclusions of the report of experts from the Royal Society of Canada.
RA Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, has called the attitude of the reporting experts, among other things, "extreme," as this does not limit the Euthanasiepraxis in the final phase of the illness.
"This opens up the gates for a situation in which anyone who is alive and older than 18 years of age to ask another person to help him in his suicide," said RA Deschamps, who had seen a summary of the report yesterday.
RA Deschamps also emphasises that the author of the report seemed to put the individual's own responsibility over all other values involved in the social sector of society.
Now, he says, there would be "guidelines and obligations in a society."
Margaret Somerville, a specialist in health law, has also expressed "a strong resistance" to the conclusions of the report, which she considered as a "pro-Euthanasia manifesto."
Margaret Somerville, who is a member of the Royal Society of Canada, in particular doubts about the non-existence of abuses in certain countries where Euthanasia and accompanied suicide are legalized, such as the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls on President Assad to resign
Damascus pranounces a "complement" to
Syria is increasingly isolated
The Partisanes Baschar al-Assads demonstrated yesterday in front of the authorities of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The diplomatic pressure on Syria, Baschar al-Assads, which, thanks to the support of Russia and a "complement" directed against the country, has increased yesterday.
Two days before Syria was excluded from the Arab League, the European Union has strengthened its sanctions against Damascus, although Turkey and Jordan, the neighbouring countries of Syria, had taken a position in favour of President Assad's departure.
King Abdullah II. Yesterday, from Jordan, the Arab Prime Minister, who had asked President Baschar al-Assad to "lay down his office in Syria," in which the forty civilians and members of the government power were already killed.
"Baschar's interest in his country, he would resign, but he should also create the necessary conditions for a new era of Syrian political life," said the King of Jordan, neighbouring Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
The Turkish diplomat chief Ahmet Davutoglu had, on the one hand, complained that the Turkish mediation attempts directed to the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year had not been successful.
"Those in the Middle East who are not in peace with their people and cannot satisfy them have to go," he said in a speeches on Syria, the neighbouring country to which Turkey is constantly taking a rough attitude.
The United States, in turn, welcomed the "strengthening of the consensus against Assad and the Syrian regime 'as a result of the Arab League and the European Union's decisions.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and countries such as Turkey have struck an increasingly sharpening tone in the face of the repression in Syria," Mark Toner, a spokesman of the state department.
During this period, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the government force in the region of Dar'a in the south of Syria have died, so the Syrian Human Rights Observatory OSDH announced.
According to this NGO, two other civilians had died in the sieged city of Homs in "Shooting Changes and Serious Bombs for Jobar."
At a press conference, Syrian Foreign Trade Minister Walid al-Muallim nevertheless felt that the country "directed towards the end of the crisis."
By the way, he has responded strongly to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damascus from his duties, which is his assessment of a "dangerous step."
Syria "will not give up," he added under the tax, "the plotted plotting against Syria would fail."
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently examining a "civil protection mechanism" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organisations, the media and military observers to the country.
The French Foreign Trade Minister Alain Juppé also expressed his support for the deployment of UN observers in order to protect civilians from the repression of the regime, which encapsulates him into his "paranoia."
A new meeting of the League is planned for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the plan for the rising crisis on 2 November, but in particular the controversial, foreseeable withdrawal of the military troops from the sieged cities and the release of arrested demonstrators.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergej Lawrow has considered the decision of the Arab League yesterday "incorrect" to guard against any sanctions against Damascus, although China had already urged Syria to implement the crisis exit plan.
Italy
Monti calls for the markets for patience and Italy for sacrifice
Mario Monti, the future Italian Head of Government has called for a little more time from the markets to form his staff and implement a programme that "victims" to recover the credit dignity lost during the last months of the government of Berlusconi.
The former EU Commissioner had held negotiations with the political parties yesterday before today's meeting of trade unions and employers.
It was his job to call a cabinet to Parliament, which is relatively strictly composed of external technocrats.
"Monti spoke of an important programme with a number of victims," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many smaller parliamentary groups participating in the talks after meeting with the President-in-Office of the Council.
Gianfranco Fini, President of the Chamber of Representatives, had been waiting for Mario Monti to vote in favour of Parliament until Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The agreements will be held in the presentation by M. Monti of a list of deletions which will undoubtedly reach from a dozen ministers to the Head of State Giorgio Napolitano.
M. Monti commented that yesterday's nervousness of stock exchange and obligatory markets demanded their time.
In "a democracy, there are certain deadlines" to prepare a government and a government programme, he emphasised that it was "sure that the markets will be good and sensible."
His appointment by the President was welcomed by the markets at the outset, but the unrest had increased again, especially following an unexpected fall in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The current Prime Minister should set up a staff consisting mainly of technocrats, although he had stressed that "politicians" should be included.
The new government should only exist until 2013, the date of the next parliamentary elections, he estimated.
According to Gianfranco Fini, the President of the Chamber of Representatives, the new government should receive Parliament's confidence proof by Friday.
Mr Monti has committed himself to working urgently in order to make Italy a "renewed protagonist" in Europe since the start of his function.
A spokesperson from Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "our diagnosis towards the Italian economy itself does not change, taking into account the new government."
The EU, which is convinced that Rome will not achieve its objective of budgetary compensation in 2013 despite the savings plans taken over the past few months, has in particular requested new hard action.
Emma Marcegaglia, "head of the Italian leaders, who will meet on Tuesday at Monti, also insists on the need for economic momentum," because a country that has no growth can not respect the deficit figures. "
M. Monti, known for his competence and independence as EU Commissioner (1994-2004), stands for a "epoche change" of Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconism"; the "professor" symbolizes the "challenge of confidence" and a "other Italy," according to the guiding article authors.
The great unknown here is the longevity of his staff.
President Napolitano would like to prevent premature elections, as Italy will have to make up for 200 billion euro bonds by April 2012.
Russian scientist helps the Iranian nuclear energy programme
A Russian scientist, Wjatscheslaw Danilenko, helped Iran develop an explosive capsule that could be used with a nuclear weapon, so on Monday a nuclear-hazard NGOs confirmed an American NGO specialised in nuclear risks.
The Institute for Science and International Security ISIS is based on the recent report of the International Agency for Atomic Safety AIEA and other documents from this UN Agency to identify this scientist.
Last week, the AIEA had announced its "serious concern" on the occasion of a "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to a thorough study of the AIEA documents from ISIS, Danilenko born in 1934 had apparently been working in a Soviet military nuclear centre in Czechoslovakia (Ural) for three decades since the beginning of the 1960s and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds produced by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991 he was supposed to have left the centre to create a company in Kiev that produces "nano diamonds."
The economic difficulties of his company would have led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He then participated in an Iranian program from 1996 to 2002 before returning to Russia.
In its last report, the AIEA mentioned "strong indications that the Iranian development of a nuclear explosive system" had been supported by the work of a foreign expert who was not only in this technique but also, as a member of the State informed the Agency, had worked its entire career on this technology directly on the military nuclear programme of its country of origin.

Anti-Islamic crimes and crimes have increased by 50%
The crimes and offences directed against Muslims increased by 50% from 2009 to 2010, while other racial or religious violent crimes, according to the FBI statistics published on Monday, either decreased slightly or increased slightly during the same period.
According to these data, the total number of violent crimes committed against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. by 49%, while a 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in crime committed against Jews and a 14% increase in anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of "hate-motivated crimes" has increased to 6,628 cases in a very weak manner, including 47.3% by race differences and 20% by religious differences by motivated crimes, according to the FBI.
"After a deterioration in 2009, it is worrying to see these crimes and crimes grow again," stressed the Human Rights Organization Human Rights First. "The increase in anti-Islamic violence is particularly significant," the organisation added in a communiqué.
"Human Rights First had long stressed that violence directed against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be regarded as a serious violation of human rights," added Paul Legendre, a responsible organisation.
"The American government can and should do more to combat these attacks," he added, with the view that this could be done by improving the police attitude towards "hate crimes."
The "hate crime" is in American federal law as a heritage from the era of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation had been adopted after the death of Martin Luther Kings to punish acts of violence directed against race, skin color, religion or descendant and now also involving crimes of sexual belonging.
Twitter walks the platform and resembles more and more Facebook
The Microblogging website Twitter introduced changes in the presentation of its platform on Monday to enable its users in particular to observe the activities of those who follow their entries, which makes the service once more similar to those of Facebook.
The new tab "Activity" and another "Name" allow better readable live reflection of the activities of other "Twitters," the Internet user whose news ("Tweets") is tracked and who are tracking your messages.
This allows you to find out whether these allow to track their messages, whether they subscribe to new posts, favorise certain messages etc.
This new Twitter menu offer had been tested before its general Internet dissemination on Monday "in August at a small percentage of users," the Twitter speaker Carolyn Penner announced in front of the French press agency AFP.
Twitter was known for his little instinctive function, encompassed with something esotherical adding text (RT to the referenced repeat of the contribution of another person). Follow friday pour recommander de suivre un autre utilisateur) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s'ouvre ainsi a un public plus large avec un maniement plus comparable a celui des réseaux grand public Facebook et Google +.
In the network, users discussed this innovation via the Internet using certain "tweets."
"This is useless, pressing and similar to too much Facebook," writes @ jemb123.
"The function" activity "will help me to better track certain elements of my Flux Twitter," allegedly @ dannykronstrom.
Austria
Entry into the Constitution of a Golden Budget Rule
The government of the Great Socialist / Christian Democratic Coalition in Austria decided on Tuesday to include a "Golden Budget rule" in the Constitution to reduce public deficits and to avoid any degrading by rating agencies in the top-credit of Austria (AAA).
It was the Socialist Chancellor Werner Faymann who had announced this decision of the Council of Ministers, although the government of Austria is at 74.6%, much above the 60% criterion laid down by the Maastricht Treaty, but well below the debt level of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's ability to pay had not dropped from AAA to AA +, we would have to pay three billion euros extra each year," said Michael Spindelegger, Deputy Chancellor and Christian Democratic Foreign Minister.
Austria also calls for the Brussels Summit of the euro area Member States of 26 October: at that time, Heads of State or Government would have demanded the inclusion of the reduction of public deficits by the end of 2012 as well as a return to public account balance in the Constitution or by adopting an equivalent law.
The measure taken in this respect by the Austrian Government is similar to the "German model," since Germany had been the first European country to include such a "rule" in the Constitution.
By 2017, the government's structural budget deficit should be reduced by 0.75% of GDP each year, and from 2017 onwards, the government's structural budget deficit should not exceed the 0.35% limit of GDP, whereas the regional states as well as municipalities should have balanced budgets.
The objective is to eliminate budgetary debt in Horizon 2020 / 21 under the 60% criterion laid down by the Maastricht Agreement.
Starker Yen
Noda is threatening with a new intervention on the monetary markets
The Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese official power would intervene again on the monetary markets if the yen would continue to rise.
"If we find an excessive volatility" in the exchange rate of the Yen, "we will intervene as we did the last time," said M. Noda in the Senate.
On Tuesday, the Yen was again close to the historical levels which the Japanese authorities had forced to intervene on 31 October.
On that day Tokyo had sold massive Yen against dollars to reduce the Japanese currency value, which is currently controlling a new record value from the dollar since 1945.
However, the Yen has increased regularly over it by purchasing investors who regard the Yen as a "refuge value" in these unsafe times of world economic deterioration and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar fell below 77 yen on Tuesday, the euro slipped under the symbolic latte of 105 yen near the levels that had triggered the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis 2008-2009, the dollar recorded about 120 yen, the euro more than 160 yen.
This straw fire of the Japanese currency damages the exports of the archipelago, as it costs the costs of the "made in Japan" products and reduces the income drawn from Japanese companies abroad, as they exchange them in national currency.
"Japan is fighting for its reconstruction after the earthquake and the tsunami on March 11, which destroyed the Tohoku region (northeast)," Mr Noda, who fears that this desertion of the yen could kill the weak recovery already in the germ.
With growth in the third quarter - 1.5% compared to the previous quarter - the third world power has gained traction again for the first time this year thanks to the jumping export growth and the consumption of households plombed by the disaster.
However, the Prime Minister appreciates that the dedication of the Yen does not reflect "the economic foundations of Japan."
The Minister for Finance, Jun Azumi, called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a second-day meeting on Tuesday with its Monetary Affairs Committee, to take all possible measures to discourage the Yen.
However, Hirohide Yamaguchi, Deputy Governor of the Institute, has informed us that the BoJ has already initiated "appropriate measures," which has made it reliable that there is no additional monetary lockdown to be expected on Wednesday.
At the last meeting at the end of October, the Notenbank had increased its government bond purchases by 5.000 billion yen (EUR 47 billion) to cover the 55.000 billion yen (EUR 519 billion) of cover that it had spent on various purchases of financial titles to overflow the liquidity market.
Eurozone:
Rente feet fast to the height, stock exchanges make retreats
The risk of ignition of the debt crisis constantly undermines European figures.
Despite the new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy and the best growth rates in France and Germany, the rates of weakened countries continue to rise steadily.
The stock exchanges that are still concerned about the stability of the euro area are also running a little more in negative fields on Tuesday, 15 November.
In Paris, the CAC lost 1.4% at 10: 00 and fell to 3.064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt declined by 0.4%, London by 0.1%.
"Due to the new tensions regarding the yields of government bonds in the euro area in difficulty, global stock markets continue to spend part of their recent profits.
"The capital investors are nervous and only too well aware of the risk of infection," says Terry Pratt, institutional broker at the IG market, quoted by the press agency Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange, which, on its side, suffers from the renewed fear of market participants in terms of capacity in Europe that the debt crisis continues, had closed with a baisse of 0.7%.
"" Japan, as well as the rest of the world, has focused its eyes on Europe, and trade moves on limited variation corridor as long as investors have no evidence that the situation has stabilized, "says Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This restoration of the worries about the future of the euro zone damages the single currency which continues its baiss on Tuesday.
The euro has been moving at its lowest level for one and a half months.
At 10 o'clock, the European currency was worth 1,3570 doll, so it dropped by 0.4%.
According to the stock exchange brokers, it has returned after the CDU, party to the Chancellor Angela Merkel, who had gathered at the Congress on Monday, had accepted an application which, in particular, provides for the possibility for countries in difficulty to leave the euro zone without leaving the European Union at the same time.
The Italian and Spanish rates are well below the 6% limit.
The lending interest rates of Italy and Spain remain at a very worrying level.
This Tuesday morning, the yield of the Italian bonds reached 6.85% 10 years, and that of the Spanish titles reached 6.2%.
These tensions of interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to feed the fears of investors.
The future Italian Head of Government Mario Monti asked for more time from the markets to restore the situation threatened by paralysis due to the debt burden in Italy.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos had confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone Summit on 27 October was "the main task" of his government.
Spain is in the market visa, as the parliamentary elections will take place in the country on Sunday.
The "spread" between the German and Spanish 10-year bonds has again reached a new historical height.
In anticipation of growth figures in the euro area
Statistically speaking, France recorded an economic growth of 0.4% due to household consumption in the third quarter, which was slightly better than the expected 0.3%.
However, the Statistical Federal Office INSEE had revised the base of the figures of the second quarter, with a minus of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
In fact, it is the fourth quarter that worries the economic experts most.
Germany had an increase of 0.5% over the same period.
A first increase in the euro area is expected at 11 a.m., warning the European Commission against the risk of recession.
Energy policy:
Facts should win over Dogmen
If there is a topic that cannot be dealt with on the basis of short-term considerations or emotions, this is certainly energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly influences the purchasing power and the competitiveness of companies.
It is reasonable to take a election meeting to allow us to think about this issue as well as the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will only bear fruit if it clarifies the overall economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French should base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Although there are 7 billion people on this planet, demographic evolution has led to a doubling of electricity demand by 2050, a huge proportion of the world's population should not have to abandon a vital element.
At the same time, the reduction of fossil resources must be reduced in order to continue to produce stable electricity, without forgetting the imperative of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, an issue disappeared from the ecological debate, in order to combat climate irregularities.
Fukushima's accident does not change any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany remained isolated in its decision to refrain from nuclear power.
This is not the case in Belgium, which imposes its decision on the need to find a substitute substitute source, nor in Switzerland, which is just planning to build only nuclear power plants of the last generation.
Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, in order to name only some countries, continue to pursue their projects with determination.
The United States, on the other hand, decided to join their park in Fukushima by re-operating the Three Mile Island plant after the nuclear accident.
Although the German model is sometimes given as a model for renewable energy sources, reality contradicts the discourse.
The election in Berlin will take place in the form of an increase in the electricity price, an increase in energy dependence, especially from Russia, due to increased use of imported gas, and an increase in CO2 emissions from gas and coal power plants.
All of these unhappy effects will already be noticed within a few months.
The case of Denmark gives rise to thought.
Denmark, on the one hand, is a European table guide in terms of wind energy, from which it covers 30% of its electricity, on the other hand, is one of the strongest users of coal and gas, used alternately with wind energy; on the other hand, its CO2 emissions and its electricity price are 65% and 50% higher than the corresponding European average.
Thanks to the stability of our energy policy, our neighbours pay 40% higher electricity bills in contrast to our French households.
Since the energy price in the globalised economy is a key role of competitiveness and a national stability pond for industry, the French companies have an advantage due to the most favourable electricity in Europe.
Any significant reduction in nuclear power would therefore lead to a strong increase in the energy price, which would lead to an illusion of the noble statements about the reindustrialisation of our country and the defence of purchasing power.
Surveys showed that it is a price which the vast majority of French people are not as willing to pay as it shows resistance to the principle of this energy source.
Let us bear in mind that our country's energy policy has enabled us to build an industry with 125.00 direct and 410,000 induced jobs.
Due to its strong export character, it brings a lot of specialised small and medium-sized enterprises to the international markets and makes them creators of countless jobs.
If France decides to step out of nuclear power, a large part of these SMEs would be sacrificed, and the annual EUR 6 billion of capital goods and nuclear exports would fall more and more.
What electricity would require an EPR designed to function for sixty years if the deterioration of his producer was pre-programmed?
In order to solve the energy equation, we must admit that there is no such thing as a devil's work as a miracle for the production of electricity.
The CO2-poor solutions developed by the company Areva for the use of nuclear power and renewable energy show the complementarity of the energy sources.
Maintaining the highest possible level of safety is an absolute imperative for nuclear power.
In France, we have a security authority which carries out uncompromising and transparent controls in existing works such as construction in Flamanville.
Their working teams, who have made themselves a name because of their professionalism, are obsessed with the security idea.
Within 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious incidents.
Only one, in Three Mile Island, has occurred under normal operating conditions, so it went without consequences for humans and the environment.
In Chernobyl, the drama was proclaimed by reactor construction and infinite human failure.
In Fukushima some seem to forget that the accident of two natural disasters was never caused by a mass that caused the death of several tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn from this accident as it had done after the previous two.
As a result of this approach, as well as cooperation between the safety authorities of the French and German operators and constructors of nuclear power plants, the EPR is a draft which enables it to be resistant to such phenomena.
Since it is considered desirable among the electro-technicians to build a nuclear power plant, a construction stop in Flamanville would be a fabulous gift to the competition of Areva and EDF by letting them free track to travel the leadership position in the inevitable development of nuclear power.
It is indispensable and legitimate to seek the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and party manoeuvres dominate a debate that determines the economic, social and financial situation of our country as well.
Is immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
The immigration policy of Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from many angles - overburdening police, judicial and administrative bodies because of a policy underpinned by the figures, compatibility of this policy with the status of a "country of human rights," as France itself had described.
Recently, the harassment by the public authorities against foreign students had marked the weekly views, the Minister of the Interior had occasionally announced (see Libération of 23 May) that France "did not need talents, murders or waiters from abroad."
But this policy was rarely analysed from an economic point of view.
There is a broad consensus on this issue between the right and the left.
On the right hand hand, the tone was struck by Jacques Chirac, who had declared in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed, including over 2 million immigrant workers, should not be a problem for a country," on the left hand by Michel Rocard, who in 1990 said that France "could not absorb the whole world's poverty."
The only difference exists in the degree of large mobility
The fear of the invasion of the national soil by Horden Polish Klempner was divided in 2005 both from the right and from the left.
The immigrants were perceived by both camps as a burden for the economy and the French society.
The only difference is the degree of large mobility which immigrants are willing to accept.
Francois Hollande is limited in its programme to banalities that point out that partnership development allows us to solve our "migration problems."
This idea of immigration as a burden, as a problem, may have an impact on the elections, but it is economically costly.
As the economic experts Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron present in a recently published work, which summarises the latest findings on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 p.), there is a broad consensus among the specialists on the positive influence of immigration influences on economic growth, wages and jobs in the immigration countries.
Reducing immigration would discourage growth and damage the labour market situation.
Fears about the influence of migrants are based on the idea that they threaten to substitute local workers, especially those less qualified, by pressures on their wages.
Experience shows, however, that immigrants are in fact much more complementary than domestic wage workers, as they have focused occupations in sectors that are unladen to work.
The low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not travel much domestic wage workers, who work more skilled among immigrants in dynamic sectors where training is not comparable to labour supply.
Positive wage effect
Just as a surgeon would have difficulties working in a country where there is a lack of anesthesists, this complementarity would also have a positive effect on wages and national labour market situation between residents and migrants.
Giovanni Peri has calculated in this way that a 1% increase in immigration flows results in a long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity of ideas and economic growth introduced by immigrants is beneficial (a large proportion of immigrants born among American Nobel prize winners; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants also contribute net to social systems, on average in the European countries, at about 1% of the general budget.
For example, the World Labour Organisation estimates that an immigrant from the age of 30 to Germany will, on average, make a net contribution (income minus expenditure) of around EUR 150,000 to the public budget over its lifetime.
Nicolas Sarkozy wished to create the missing interfaces "with teeth" to join his mandate.
However, these said teeth, which should discourage immigrants, achieved exactly the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, now remains to think through European democracy
Democracy is a valuable good, and also a sensitive good.
The European continent should be able to remember who, after its invention in Athens more than two thousand years ago, had passed over the tragedies of the First World War, of totalitarianism, of the Holocaust, of the Gulag, but also of Francos in Spain, of Salazars in Portugal and of the Supreme in Greece.
Some had believed that it was rich enough to exercise the right to vote, in the most direct way possible to see democracy defeat once and for all over their enemies.
It has been known since Napoleon "the little" that it was a characteristic of mind-keeping.
The general electoral right, which is a necessary condition for democracy, is not enough to do so and can as well become a "suppression instrument" as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot expressed at that time.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organisation, separation and control of the forces, training, education, economic and social spirit of the Community, a case law.
The crisis in Europe that we are in is an economic crisis, but it is also, and above all, a political and democratic crisis.
The change in the sense of the Greek True False referendum would have had a double sense of character in this respect: once the need for a strong return of politics, but also those of the worrying feeling of their inability, their inconvenience.
This ambivalence should be considered to be obsolete.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have moved today and that the Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, no longer aim in the right direction.
We have nothing to win to push for a success of the national referendum, which has been organised according to the needs and order of the way.
A free man for the European ruler or a jump with attached eyes into the emptiness of the nationalist retreat: a great choice for the citizen!
No, we want hackebeil, but a collective task, out of full law, resolved and constant, a choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - one no longer knows where to end the list - because there is only one crisis and it is in Europe.
It is all Europe that is bowing to the dictatorship of markets and credit rating agencies suffering from its disability and its lack of solidarity.
It is all Europe that is humiliated at international level.
One is concerned about sovereignty transfers towards Europe - and it is throughout Europe that gradually loses its sovereignty, and hence each of the nations that joined it.
The urgency is to restore the leadership of the European project to the sovereignty of the people.
For it is all about whether Europeans can reduce the burden of their debts, free themselves from the markets and build a future through investment.
The emergence of the crisis has decisions at European level as a condition which cannot be taken without total democratic legitimacy without certainly destroying us.
After this proposal has been put forward by Jacques Delors and the Socialists for a long time, everyone today is pushing European economic governance to do so.
Agreed.
But without political integration and stronger democracy - as it prevents citizens - it would be a new foolishness and a further pace.
We must take a new stage of European construction.
In order to create the Republic in France, it was necessary to "create" Republicans.
The revolution of the interests alone could not afford enough here.
This education remains valid.
We must form a Europe that is better integrated at economic level.
This can only be achieved by creating a politically more democratic Europe, a truly European sovereignty.
We need Europeans to create Europe.
"Contactless" chip cards become general goods
The world fair for chip cards opens its gates in a optimistic position in Villepinte near Paris on Tuesday.
According to Eurosmart, 2011 should actually end with an 11% increase in worldwide sales of microprocessor chips (EC cards, SIM cards telephone), with more than 6 billion units sold.
The most portable segment is the contact-less technology that allows payments in public transport or convenience of purchases by simply keeping the card to a reader.
Over the 320 million sold one year before this year, 460 million contact-free chip cards should be sold worldwide!
Their market share should increase further in 2012 (580 million units expected) and represent more than 10% of the global chip card market (6.925 million cards).
Europe gains ground in terms of uncontacted payment after a long time behind the Asia-Pacific region.
Some 26 million visa cards are already equipped with this functionality and 75,000 payment terminals accept these.
In France, the beginnings are rather modest: only 400,000 contact-free visa cards have been distributed.
However, consumer markets are making steam.
Carrefour has therefore issued 2.5 million contact-free pass MasterCards this year.
In order to move to higher speed, it is now necessary for banks to equip their customers with these cards.
"Two large French financial institutions have committed themselves to providing their customers systematically in the future with uncontacted chip," announced Gérard Nébouy, Director-General of Visa Europe France.
Banks test payment per phone
However, this is only a first stage on the way to the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
A disappearing small percentage of equipment has so far been equipped with the NFC technology (Near Field Communication) necessary to carry out these transactions.
"They've been delayed."
"But they should have a real upward development at least next year."
"We expect to sell 80 to 120 million units worldwide in 2012," explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks take initiative.
The Crédit Agricole announced yesterday the launch of a test run in Caen, which will run from December to June.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees are to be equipped with a capsule that allows contact-free payment.
The BPCE operates a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société Générale had also announced yesterday to prepare for the launch of an offer that would allow its customers to pay by phone without contact.
Terrorist front understands from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the relationship between al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long-standing relationship between the terrorist group al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram seems to be confirmed.
On Sunday, the Algerian Vice-Foreign Minister, Abdelkader Messahel, had confirmed that Algiers had now obtained "certainty."
"The way in which both organisations are involved and the relationship of the secret services indicate a clear cooperation," he explained without further details.
Paris seems to be doing a similar analysis.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two French people in Niger last January has encouraged interfaces on a day-to-day basis.
The Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory, kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by supporters of the Aqmi, were to be killed on the following day at the same time as several of their kidnappers during an operation carried out by the French special units.
French and Nigerian investigators want to find several phone chips belonging to terrorists in the ruins at the site of operation.
Terrorist axis
The analysis of the guided phone calls leads to several interrogators stationed in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France International (RFI), the investigators are particularly interested in the numbers of two interlocutors: a number leads to a Nigerian who has long been in Maiduguri, a city in the north of Nigeria, who had stayed the wall of Boko Haram; the other leads to a man who is considered close to Aqmi and the sect.
"This is a progress, but it is undoubtedly necessary to wait for more clear evidence before you can talk about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem."
"It is conceivable."
"It has been known for years that the sect receives financial and intellectual support from the outside and that it is increasingly active," Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuwo relieves.
In recent months, these "support services" have become increasingly evident in their course, as well as the responses as well as the operations modes of Boko Harem, which now indicate the addition of suicide attacks and the use of ever more complex explosives that carry the same handwriting as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, to begin with Washington, has been pressing Abuja since that time to take account of the problems caused by Boko Haram.
In fact, the Nigerian authorities have long considered the grouping as a community of illuminates, which should not be given special attention.
Quick success
The Boko Haram, founded in 2002 in Maiduguri in the vicinity of a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf - what in Haoussa means as much as "Western education is a shame" - is pursuing the creation of an Islamic emir in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this mediumless region, the merger is experiencing rapid success.
It polices itself and claims strict respect for the sharia, while the activists associated with it are committed to the fight against the wicked central government.
The activists first have churches, bars and authorities in sight.
In 2009, Boko Haram's activists showed themselves particularly active with their reinforced attacks on the Commissioners.
However, Abuja's reaction is indifferent as usual.
The army is surrounding the city, you count 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, captured, is killed in prison.
As a result, the sect becomes more radical and leaves its highcasts in the north.
Last Christmas, she became known for an assassination in Jos, which demanded 80 lives, and then another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram is given the blame for a suicide attack that occurred in the secure police headquarters in Abuja - the first of his art
In August, the United Nations local headquarters become a priority international target.
Since then, the formation of a terrorist axis in Africa, to lead from Mauritania to Nigeria to Somalia, has worrying all the security experts.
While the Aqmi Mali and the Niger occupied the Somalians of al-Shabaab in Kenya, Boko Harem seems to be a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, Alain Juppé warned against Boko Harem at a conversation with President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria and showed himself "ready to communicate all the indications."
The world according to republican presidential candidates
Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry rivalry in simplification and ignorance about China, Iraq and the help for Israel.
Can a crisis-weakened America lead a complex world with simple not to say: simple ideas?
If you listen to the Republican presidential candidates like that, the voters could almost get this impression.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their fellow opponents have repeatedly made their splendid statements as well as their statements on external policy, traditional Republican focus, notable.
Over China, Iran and Israel aid - often in no way supported - slogans fall.
With regard to the appointment of the "Grand Old Party" at the highest level, Mitt Romney threatened the Chinese to cite the WTO and to cite the "monetary manipulation" - leading topic in an America that is ripened at the outset by the emigration of all industrial sectors to Asia.
He said that if this is to imply the launch of a trade war, it was stupid.
Jon Huntsman, the former Chinese ambassador under Obama and the only candidate who seems to have a mature vision of foreign policy, has almost cut off the air with regard to his embarrassment to the emotions.
He had called for a handful but constructive conversation with Beijing (also the current attitude of Obama).
But Huntsman is not being heard because he stagnates in the depths of opinion surveys.
Reagan's image
Romney had also commended military attacks against Iran if the sanctions were to fail to stop the nuclear programme.
"If I was elected, I would have stopped Iran," he would have done.
"If Obama is re-elected, they get the bomb."
He also promised Israel increased military assistance and accused Obama of being guilty of this partner.
The entrepreneur Herman Cain, two-thirds of his candidates, has a shameful lack of record.
Recently, he called on the Chinese military threat to contradict, as Beijing "attempted to develop a nuclear power" - and seemed to consider the fact that China has been in possession of military nuclear weapons since 1964!
The Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and calls for military attacks against Iran, on the one hand, expresses his willingness to employ the American army in Mexico against drug cartels.
In 2009, Cain, Perry and Michele Bachmann also supported the use of torture measures against mutagenic terrorists.
One is far away from John McCain, the Republican candidate in 2008, a political focus.
The current presidential contractors opposed that Reagan had also had simple ideas and, despite all, won the Cold War.
They remembered that Obama was also an amateur and had to give water to his wine, as was the subject of anti-terror.
They rightly retain the failure of his naive onion conversation with Iran, the premature withdrawal of his "boys" from Iraq, his inresolve in Libya, which also gave him the reputation of weakness.
However, this invention is not so unforgettable.
The population is more likely to estimate the positive balance of national security among Obama, which Bin Laden has turned off.
Since Iraq, it has been protecting itself from military interventions leading to paralysis.
And Obama is more surprising by arguing that America needs to be rebuilt economically in order to restore its leadership position.
North Stream, new gate to Russian gas in Europe
The North Stream gas pipeline, which runs on the Baltic Sea sea base and connects Western Europe directly to Russia, was put into operation.
It is intended to supply gas for an equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian gas giant Gazprom wanted to commit this event with Gloria and Gloria.
More than 500 invited guests, including four Heads of State and Government, attended last Tuesday at the Baltic Sea coast under orchestra cooling and at the finely decorated buffet of the inauguration of the new North Stream gas pipeline, which connects Russia and Germany directly under sea level.
The German Chancellor Angelika Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medwedew, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his colleague Mark Rutte from the Netherlands have symbolically turned together the control of the valve which transports Russian gas into the Western European network.
The new gas pipeline is intended to supply 27.5 billion cubic meters of additional Russian gases per year through a first pipeline of 1.224 km length that connects the Sankt Petersburg region with Mecklenburg-Vorpommern to Western Europe.
A second pipeline that allows a total supply of 55 billion cubic meters of gas - equivalent of total French consumption - will be completed at the end of 2012.
And you already make the possibility of building a third line sound on your own route.
For Gazprom, the timely and punctual completion of this enormous construction seems to be a victory.
The project was strongly disputed in Poland and the Baltic States.
In fact, the North Stream pipeline will allow direct gas supply to Germany, while avoiding any trace through third countries (Poland or Ukraine) on land roads.
That is why these two countries are losing a little their power: for them it is now more difficult to put pressure on Russia by threatening to close access to Western European markets.
Warsaw, who was most involved in the debate, was not relieved to compare the North Stream pipeline with a "new German-Soviet pact" in connection with the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the occupation of Poland in 1939.
This means that the subject is politically sensitive.
Western Europe has gained even greater security of supply through the support of this Russian project.
This, however, is at the expense of the dismantling of European energy, as the project has broken between Western and Eastern Europeans.
Russia has completed its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, western countries that have strong gas consumption and whose gas reserves are inclined to be achieved in just five years.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us in an organic way," François Fillon confirmed in the inauguration of the gas pipeline by pointing out in what degree the large gas contracts are important from political and economic side.
All this explains the broad smile of the many Gazprom managers represented in Lubmin regarding gas supply.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also an excellent technique.
The underwater pipeline consists of steel with concrete numbers to protect it from ship's anchorages.
It rests on the sea floor at about 200 m depth.
During their construction, minefields dating from the Second World War had to be removed.
"About a hundred mines had to be carefully removed or destroyed," said Jens Müller, spokesman of the North Stream Society.
In addition, reinforced measures had to be taken to protect fauna and flora.
The line is a long snake of metal, heavy as 242 Eiffel towers, which has been interrupted throughout the length by nothing: neither by valves nor maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned off the coast of Sweden, but the project managers have withdrawn from it as Sweden was little interested in seeing a Russian state company permanently at the level of its coasts.
"In case of a hazard, we close the gas flow in less than one minute," Jens Müller specified.
In the event of a leak, the gas contained in the gas pipeline thus evaporates into the air.
However, this case is considered to be very unlikely by the designers, since the welding seams were estimated to be resistant by one leak per 100,000 years.
State monitoring of the gas pipeline is ensured both by a underwater robot controlled for external observation purposes from a sea ship and by a device circulating inside the gas pipeline.
It has the form of a cigar, measures a meter diameter, is introduced into the inner pipe line and is moved through the gas pressure.
After three full days of movement through the line at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device provides the most accurate information about any deformations of the metal at its arrival.
The gas pipeline was designed to work for fifty years without even having to undergo the smallest repair.
The gas circulation is easily ensured by pressure.
This is 200 bar at the entrance point, 100 bar at the exit site.
Five companies have united their forces to achieve this project.
However, management remains in the hands of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
In addition, the German companies E. ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch gas union and the French group GDF Suez (9% each), are joined here.
These five companies have formed a business community called Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the gas pipeline.
It has its seat in train in Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then rented the entire capacity of its gas transport on a prolonged 20-year contract.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, regardless of how much the real transport gas volume fails," specified Jens Müller.
The financing of the gas pipeline was secured to 30% by shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total labour costs should be EUR 7.4 billion for both pipelines.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment amount was 240 million.
However, minority shareholders are sure to recover their expenses, as Gazprom alone carries the risk of liability.
The gas pipeline shows a sandy, with pine-wooded coastline at Lubmin from the Baltic Sea.
The 4.5 meters high valves form the gas exit pads.
Sensors measure pressure, temperature and other characteristics of the incoming gas before it is passed on to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has been delivered with one million cubic meters of Russian gases per wide hour.
With full capacity, this would be 3 million cubic meters per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a brand notebook.
Started by an Italian company about fifteen years ago, Moleskine now wants to give the writing a new style.
It has a flair of adventures to spend hours on candles with the writing.
The notebook of Moleskine is easily remarkable, with its black, rectangular tape, its rubber tape, the egg-coloured pages, as aging over time.
However, the Moleskine Notebook, as you know today, was created in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, which has its headquarters in Milan, then decided to place a distinct design notebook on the market.
Maria Sebregondi, then specialist consultant of the company, is responsible for the launch of the new product.
The notebook was inspired by an ancient production technique called Mole Skin (mouthpiece), which is called a cotton lac, which is used for for example for coatings of polar benches.
This type of notebook was very asked among writers and travellers.
"Moleskine has revived an old and almost forgotten object that was considered to be an icon of avant-gardist artist until the 20th century," explains Maria Sebregondi, now trademark manager at Modo Modo.
Success comes in.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increase by 26% and settle with a sales rate of 12.7 million pieces.
This is far from the usual production of the first years, where only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine passes the Italian border and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to make a picture of the buyers because the notebook is enthusiastic as well as for the students and specialists.
Moleskine has the image of cosmopolitan, cultivated and open-minded customers.
The small Italian company, which counted 12 employees in its beginnings, currently employs over 100 employees and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan, the other in New York.
The company distributes its notebooks in bookshops, on Internet portals such as Fnac, in small boutiques of the city centres and understands the enforcement of its identity.
"We have followed the spirit of time and its new written need, which exists despite the upturn of e-mails," said Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural feature is accompanied by the development of the company Moleskine: recently the brand launched an exhibition called "Detour (Umweg)," in which architects and artists exhibited their own notebooks.
In August, the company also placed a link with Leopard's pattern on the market at the time of the film festival in Locarno.
Moleskine benefited from its success and this cultural spirit of time and understood to diversify its products: pockets, calendar, fillers, computer shells... The brand has the entire range of articles.
A success that brings nigger to the plan: In the autumn of 2006 Modo Modo was purchased by SG Capital Europe, today's Syntegra Capital, by the investment fund, and thus launched a new chapter in the history of the company Moleskine.
Why does the unemployment rate of disabled workers remain at such a high level?
Approximately 19% of disabled people are looking for a job.
Today, the "15th week of work for disabled people" begins.
Despite a targeted public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate for disabled people is always twice as high as the average average: 19% against 9% of the total population.
Discouraging?
"No, so emphasizes Éric Blanchet, Director-General of the Adapt Association, who arranges the" week of work for disabled people. "
"Progress made within fifteen years is considerable."
"At that time the unemployment rate was not double but three times as high."
"Nonetheless, much remains to be done."
However, it must be said that there are still numerous obstacles for disabled unemployed people before they get a job.
It is more common for the elderly: 37% are older than 50 years (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualifications: 80% of them do not have a degree and there are only 10,000 disabled people below the 2.3 million students with higher education.
Finally, long-term unemployment is also very widespread: 53% of the disabled compared to 38% of the total.
In short, there are so many criteria that make it difficult to get back to work and which form the "core of the problem," according to Christian Grapin, Director-General of Tremplin, a 1992-based association which helps companies to recruit disabled workers.
So much for the actual brakes.
It remains the unspoken, the spiritual attitudes, which, although certainly, develop slowly.
A study carried out in April by the IMS Entreprendre Association for the magazine La Cité indicated that the interviewed managers have "a weak level of knowledge regarding the disabled," which is "overrepresented" by persons in wheelchairs, psychic or intellectual minors. "
The result is that private enterprises with more than 20 employees still have a long way to achieve the employment target of 6% of disabled workers, which was laid down in a law of 1987.
These latter figures from 2008 refer to a ratio of 2.6%.
"We are now at around 3%," says Pierre Blanc, Director-General of Agefiph, to the organization which is responsible for collecting contributions from companies that violate this law.
The evidence: The number of "fees payable" establishments has decreased as well as the sum of the amounts paid between 2007 and 2011, ranging from 59.000 to 46.000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 Law, which provides for increases in contributions, created a strong pressure on the companies," said Pierre Blanc. "
"But this improvement also expresses a real insight, especially in the large groups of companies."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of the establishments employ disabled persons between 20 and 49 employees, while companies with 100 to 199 employees employ 82%.
Hazard: "What luck"
Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens had not concealed their pleasure, which brought them the friendship game, even before they offered their forehead to the "Blue Tuesday evening (20: 45).
It would have been too far taken to claim that there had been a secret agreement between them, but the image speaks symbolic volumes.
Sitting side by side at the stage of the Stade de France, George Leekens and Eden Hazard would have been able to make peace.
Five months after the temperamental gesture of his attacker against Turkey, the Belgian national trainer had harvested nothing but praise about his person.
"I am very pleased with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian."
"I'd like to look forward," the born Liller assures himself.
As for the contrast between his representation in club and national elf, "It is a unit that justifies everything."
"In Lille I am over all year, which is not the case in Belgium."
"It's time for me to start."
Hazard will come to Saint-Denis, brought forward Friday night against Romania regarding the match against France to finally "shine."
However, without leaving the note of "pleasure."
He has been firing the French national team since the age of 7, and he has led his victorious field trains between 1998 and 2000.
"I was always supported," he confirmed.
This necessarily helps to strengthen the "unique" character of this encounter even more.
So much in advance: "Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be there," he presents.
"We just walked over the road."
"Playing against them means great luck!"
Leekens, on the one hand, made a sound of "pride."
"The pride to carry out a galamatch."
"Stolz" also to confirm - in his capacity as "neighbours" - that France "has become a very high-level team again," and that little more than a year after Knysna's trauma.
"Laurent Blanc did a damn good job," he said enthusiastically.
Although Belgium will be missing in the next European Championship, the engineer is very likely to share the plane with the blue (the French national eleven)... in the direction of Brazil in 2014.
"We little Belgians come out big," he stressed.
"We're planning one thing, the players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You will notice that at the upcoming games." Included the game against France.
Portugal very confident
The Portuguese team of Paulo Bento looks forward with great optimism to the replay against Bosnia (22: 00) this Tuesday in Lisbon.
Both teams had failed to play in the game.
"At the end of these 90 minutes we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already seeing himself in Poland and Ukraine.
For him there is no doubt that "La Selecçao," his national elf, for which he has been responsible since September 2010, will qualify for the 2012 European Championship.
For Portugal, this means only 90 minutes of happiness.
But there is a match to play, and to inherit an opponent, namely Bosnia.
Given the play (0-0) on Friday in hell of Zenica, it seems obvious that the cubes have not fallen yet.
Portugal clearly dominated the party over more than an hour, but the team was unable to press the matter on the so important stamp that had taken the pressure from it.
"This is a good result, but there is a certain risk, since we have not reached a major exit."
At home, however, in their bright, brilliant city de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to go through before an audience that is likely to be equally hot at the game, even if the party was, of course, announced as "very short," said the optimistic but clear Bento.
"We expect a very scarce match, but we are absolutely convinced to win the upper hand," said the 42-year-old Portuguese trainer.
"We still have a 50% chance to join the 2012 European Championship," but relatified the successor of Carlos Queiroz.
The undecided Friday in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to achieve and win a gate.
The Bosnians, who also need a gate, may already be satisfied with an undecided decision.
"This is a good result, but there is a certain risk, since we have not achieved a major externality," regrets Bento.
"We will oppose a team that has high technical qualities and has players with many individual qualities," he added.
As already in Zenica, the Portuguese would have the intention to put maximum pressure on the Bosnians at the beginning to "give them no time to think."
A good idea, provided that it is implemented this time.
