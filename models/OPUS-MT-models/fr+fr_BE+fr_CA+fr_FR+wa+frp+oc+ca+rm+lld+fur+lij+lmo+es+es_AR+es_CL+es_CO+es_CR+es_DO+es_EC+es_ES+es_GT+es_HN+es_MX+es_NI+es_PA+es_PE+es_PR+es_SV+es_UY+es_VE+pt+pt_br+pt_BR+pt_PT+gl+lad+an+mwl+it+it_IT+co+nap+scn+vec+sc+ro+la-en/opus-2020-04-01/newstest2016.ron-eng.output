UN chief says there are no military solutions in Syria
Secretary General Ban Ki-moon states that his response to Russia's military support for Syria is that "there is no military solution" to the conflict that has lasted almost five years and more weapons would only aggravate the violence and suffering of millions of people.
The UN Chief again called on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said Wednesday at a conference that he intends to meet this month with foreign ministers from five permanent countries present at the Council - USA, Russia, China, England and France - on the sidelines of the General Assembly's ministerial session to discuss Syria.
Ban expressed regret that the divisions in the Council and between the Syrian people and the regional powers "made this situation unresolved".
Ban asked the five permanent members to show the solidarity and unity shown when they were able to conclude an agreement on Iran's nuclear weapons, thus addressing the crisis in Syria.
8 digits from the polls showing Donald Trump has a real chance
Some tried to label him as a "flip-flop" politician.
Others called it a joke.
And others are waiting for implosion.
But no matter how some Republicans try to tear Donald Trump down from the top of the polls, it hasn't worked (yet).
Ten of the last 11 national polls have shown that Donald Trump drives with a two-digit percentage and some voices are beginning to seriously wonder what this means for the real estate mogul's chances of being appointed.
Of course, it's still premature.
None of this says Trump will win the race for nominating Republicans.
Pundits shows that, in the same period of 2011, Rick Perry's advance made way for Herman Cain in the polls, but none of them won in any state in the nomination race.
And the reasons why they would fight hard in general elections are numerous.
But outside groups like Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the conservative economic Club for Growth group admit Trump's power and start supporting him with money.
Here are some figures from recent surveys that suggest that the real estate mogul is not just a passing thing:
The figures that indicate support for Trump are back at 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a poll conducted by the University of Monmouth showed that only two out of 10 Republicans had a positive opinion about the real estate mogul.
By mid-July, the percentage went up to 40%.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Currently, six out of 10 Republicans have a favorable opinion of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they have a negative opinion.
These figures shall be maintained.
A poll conducted last week by Quinnipiac in Iowa concluded that 60% of Republicans in the region have a favorable opinion of Trump.
Two thirds of the GOP voters would be happy if Trump won the nomination race.
In a poll conducted last week by CNN/ORC, 67% of Republicans said they would be "enthusiasms" or "thank you" if Trump won the nomination race.
Only two out of 10 say they'd be "strung" if Trump won the nomination race.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% say they would be "enthusiasms" against 40% who say the same about Trump).
Closest in terms of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio, with only 21%.
On the other hand, 47% of Republican voters say they would be "unsatisfied" or "disappointed" if the favorite Jeb Bush wins the nomination race.
Most Republicans don't see Trump's temperament as a problem.
Although Donald Trump was strongly criticized for his insults and his bombing style, 52% of Republican voters at the national level believe that the real estate mogul has the right temper to be president, according to the poll conducted on Monday by ABC News/Washington Post.
We find the same figures in the state of Iowa, where 52% of Republicans believe Trump has the right personality to be a leader, according to the poll conducted last week by Quinnipiac.
However, 44% feel that he does not have the personality to act effectively and nearly six out of 10 independents say that his temper has nothing to do with the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters get used to the idea.
When they take the attitude of intellectuals, Republican voters consider Trump to be authentic.
According to a poll conducted last week by CNN/ORC, on the question of who has the most chance of winning the race for GOP nomination, four out of 10 said Trump.
The situation changed from the end of July, when four out of ten would bet on Jeb Bush.
Full information: in the past, GOP voters have not read the future very well.
In the same period of the last election, four out of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry for nomination, compared to only 28% for Mitt Romney.
However, these figures show that most GOP voters consider Trump's campaign plausible.
Even if the Republicans have turned back to another candidate, Trump is still in the lead.
Some voices say that the divided situation will probably contribute to Trump's victory, while supporting Trump will be shared with more than twelve candidates.
But a survey conducted at the beginning of September by the University of Monmouth shows that, in the hypothetical situation of a collaboration between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump will almost always benefit from majority support.
Trump is 13 points away from Carly Fiorina, 14 points away from Marco Rubio, 15 points away from Walker, 19 points away from Jeb Bush and, finally, 33 points away from Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
It's almost equal to Ted Cruz.
The only candidate that beats him?
Ben Carson would beat the businessman with 19 points in a hypothetical one-to-one confrontation.
Most of Donald Trump's supporters say they've made up their minds.
A new poll conducted by CBS/NYT on Tuesday shows that over half of the voters who support Trump say they do not change their voting option.
Obviously, a lot can happen in this respect and no one can say that they will never change their mind.
46% say they leave the door open to the possibility of changing their option.
However, Trump's most important opponent is currently neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but he is twice as likely as voters who say they have decided to vote with Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump named immigrants from Mexico "rapists" in his campaign opening speech two months ago, immigration was the central topic in the campaign for 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's bombing style will lead to a split between the important Hispanic voters and the Republican Party and will harm the rebranding efforts.
However, according to the poll conducted by ABC/Post on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
So, it seems that as long as the immigration issue remains in the spotlight, so will Doland Trump.
Frustration of the authorities reaches new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now supported by almost half of the Republican voters, largely because of their status as outsiders.
According to the poll conducted by ABC/Post on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they prefer a political outsider to the detriment of someone with experience in government.
People are also upset about Washington authorities.
A survey conducted two weeks ago in Iowa by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg shows that three out of four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated by the performance of Republicans in the COngres, 54% declaring themselves "unsatisfied" and 21% "endless".
Jeremy Corbyn makes his debut at Prime Minister's Questions
Since his choice, Mr. Corbyn's debut at PMQs has been long awaited
The new Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, will later make his debut at Prime Minister's Questions, facing David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will address the first of the six questions to which he is entitled shortly after lunch; his performance will probably be examined closely by the media and Labour Parliamentarians.
During weekly appearances, he asked for "less theatre and more facts".
He also said that he could give up a few participations and that he would hand them over to his colleagues.
The confrontation will be Mr Corbyn's first parliamentary test in a leading position, coming after he appointed a "phantom booth" and after the speech he gave at the annual TUC Congress on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour Party leader's decision to keep silent about the national anthem in a job held on Tuesday on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of England attracted criticism from conservative parliamentarians and kept the front page of the newspapers.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem attracted attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said that he "had kept quiet in a respectful manner" and recognized "the heroism of the British Air Force in the Battle of England."
But a member of Mr. Corbyn's ghost cabinet, Owen Smith, said for the BBC broadcast Two's Newsnight that he would have recommended the Labour leader to sing the national anthem "indifferent" to his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Around twelve ministers in the ghost cabinet refused to be part of Mr Corbyn's lead team, arguing by differences of opinion related to economy, defence and external, while less than one sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant states that the policy differences "accumulate" in the Labour Party after Mr Corbyn's appointment regarding his position vis-Ã -vis the European Union and the benefit limit.
Mr Corbyn said at the TUC conference that the Labour Party would make changes that would completely eliminate the idea of limitation.
A few hours later, Mr. Smith, Minister of Labour and Pensions, said that the party "is very clear" in the exclusive opposition to government plans to reduce the "head" level from Â£26,000 to Â£23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron faces at the rostrum in the last decade, since he took over the leadership of the Conservative Party.
The Labour leader, who promised a different approach to politics, says that he has ideas "from external sources" for questions to be addressed to the Lord Cameron and that he has received over 30,000 suggestions.
Parliamenter Islington North said that PMQs involves too high a level of confrontation and that it will refrain from replicas and attacks, committing itself to focus instead on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and challenges facing young people.
Mr. Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, Minister of Finance, will take her place at PMQs when he cannot participate - for example when Mr. Cameron travels abroad.
He also expressed the idea that he would allow other colleagues to take the floor occasionally, saying that he approached the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, John Bercow, to discuss this issue.
In 2005, when he took the lead, Mr Cameron said he wanted to give up the "Punch and Judy" political style often associated with PMQs but admitted a few years later that he did not succeed in his work.
Since the first broadcast in 1990, PMQs has been considered a key barometer of a leader's reasoning, how he leads the Chamber of Deputies and his position among parliamentary colleagues, although critics say it has become a cartoon and needs profound reform.
âCadru in Joburg': Youth without shelter benefit from photography courses
It's hard to be a homeless man in Johannesburg.
But a group of people who lived on the streets in childhood found a way to learn a job and earn their lives.
"I was shot in Joburg" is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless youth to take photos of the areas they live in and earn money from it.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of the project.
Chief JD Sports says higher wages could damage enlargements
President JD Sports, Peter Cowgill, said that an increase in the minimum wage in the UK could mean "a greater purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers."
However, that purchasing power is unlikely to exceed the higher labour costs within the firm, he says.
Costs could have an impact on JD Sports' expansion plans, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by President Tennis Australia, Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis would deserve to be praised and not criticized for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was a collateral victim in the "storm" created around his friend Nick Kyrgios, and his behaviour deserves rather praise and not criticism, according to President Tennis Australia, Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the youngest part of the talented duo often called "Special Ks," was dragged into the spotlight by the scandalous skirmish that Kyrgios had against Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters tournament.
In a qualifying skull game played shortly after, in Cincinnati, the chair referee had to intervene twice to separate Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison, after which Harrison said: "Wawrinka should have put Kyrgios to the ground, and I should have put this kid to the ground."
Although he was last seen making a dust rocket after having muscle cramps and missed a possible US Open tournament, angry with Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was firmly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, where he is fighting with Sam Groth for second place in singles, after Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semifinal against England.
"One thing I feel strong about is that, in my opinion, Thanasi was drawn a little into conflict," Healy said.
The truth is that he broke a rocket when he lost because he accused cramps in the US, but he's not the first player to break a rocket out of frustration with himself and I know Thanasi well enough to know he wouldn't be proud of it.
But let's face it, he's mastered himself extremely well in pretty provocative situations in the US with Harrison and so on and I think he deserves a lot of trust.
He's got an amazing team, he's got a great family next door, and I think he's been treated unfairly.
He is a very mature 19-year-old, he works hard and has joined the team, he has had no conflict with other players, he is highly respected in clothing, he trains hard, he is in an excellent form, he is a very balanced and mature young man and I think he deserves to be judged exclusively on the basis of his qualities and defects.
Healy also supported the decision not to take Kyrgios into account for the major draw match, which starts on Friday, and described the "common decision" as the most appropriate for all, but supported the return of the Canberra player to the long-term team.
"First of all, we want the team to focus fully on the playoff game and not think at all about the controversy around [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And I think Nick climbed very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray said, he matured under the public eye and made some terrible mistakes and deserves to be criticized, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I think he needs a time when he's not at the center of attention to be able to reflect, a good thing for both the team and for him.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton's Advantage in the Face of Bernie Sanders Halved to Half in National Polls
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still has a two-digit advantage in the democratic race for national candidacy, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins the ground.
Clinton is now supported by 47% of democratic voters (down from 58%), while Sanders is second, with 27% (up from 17%).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced that he will be running for president, is supported by 15% of democratic voters.
At least five months before the start of the primary election, most Democrats say it is too early to say that they have decided on the candidate they will support.
But Clinton's supporters are firmer in their choice than other candidates' supporters.
Faced with the CBS news survey last month, Clinton lost ground in a number of demographic groups, while Sanders won a few percentages.
Clinton retains the advantage among women and moderates, but the advantage has been reduced.
Support among men has been considerably reduced and Sanders is only 5 points away.
Clinton's advantage among democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated, now being equal to Sanders.
However, Clinton is still at the forefront of the older voters.
Last month, Clinton stood in front of Sanders, with a two-digit percentage among the liberals, but Sanders now has an easy 5-point advantage in this group.
About half of the national democratic voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if they had chosen to run on behalf of the party.
A quarter would support it somewhat reserved and another 15% would support it just because it represents the party.
Six percent wouldn't support it.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, the likelihood that Clinton's current supporters will be enthusiastic about her choice is high.
The opinions are more mixed among those who do not currently support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support it.
While 48% of democratic voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, the number of Republican voters who say the same about the first class, Donald Trump (35%) is smaller.
When Clinton's supporters are asked an open question about why she would like to win the race, the majority answer is that she has the right experience (16%), followed by the fact that the time has come for a woman to be president (13%) and that she is the best candidate for this job (10%).
Clinton's supporters also mention her association with Bill Clinton (9%).
The agreement on these issues and eligibility is also mentioned.
Given that the Vice-President is considering a possible candidate for the presidency, 57% of democratic voters would like to see him in the race - although a third think he should not run.
On the question of the second option for the party representative, the democratic voters call Biden a majority.
Of Clinton's supporters, more than half said Biden would be the second option, long before Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run in the Democratic Party race, Hillary Clinton's advantage in front of Sanders grows from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points if he doesn't run.
55% of democratic voters consider Clinton to be the candidate with the highest chance of winning the general elections, but the figures have fallen from 78% last month.
Biden is at a distance in second place but the percentage according to which he is the most eligible has increased.
However, when asked what is most important to an elected candidate, democratic voters prefer problems instead of eligibility.
Like last month, no democratic candidate or possible candidate is considered by these voters to be unacceptable as a representative of the party in the presidential race.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates are doing well with regard to some key features vis-Ã -vis their party's primary voters.
Most voters regard Clinton, Sanders and Biden as integrity and trust and have strong leadership qualities.
Biden is best seen of all three in terms of integrity, while Clinton's strong point is leadership.
30% of democratic voters do not believe that H. Clinton is intact and reliable, twice as many as those who say this about Sanders (15%), but 27% do not think so.
Democratic voters also generally consider that the three, Clinton, Sanders and Biden, have the same ideologies as they do.
Regarding all these aspects, about a quarter of democratic voters do not have an opinion on Sanders.
As questions persist regarding the use of a personal email address and server by Hillary Clinton while he was Secretary of State, most Democratic voters are satisfied with his explanation of the subject and say he did not affect their general opinion of the candidate.
But things are different among the American public.
Half of the Americans are now dissatisfied with her explanation, while only about a third are satisfied.
The public opinion was divided in March on this subject, shortly after the issue came to light.
Most Americans say that that email-related controversy did not affect their general opinion of Clinton, although 36% say they changed their opinion in the negative.
Mainly the Republicans, more than six out of ten, say they changed their mind about Clinton in the negative.
Although the Democratic voters consider Clinton to be sound and reliable, this aspect continues to raise problems among the general voters: only 32% consider it to be sound and reliable, 8% less than last month and 15% less than in May.
62% of voters do not consider it to be intact and reliable.
At the same time, 55% of voters at the national level do not consider Trump to be reliable and sound.
However, both Clinton and Trump have white balls for leadership.
Of the six candidates assessed, Biden, Carson and Bush rank first in terms of integrity.
The number of those who consider Sanders to be intact is higher than those who do not feel the same, but as in Carson's case, many do not think about him.
The margin of error for the sample of 351 primary democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Five members of the brother accused of murdering the student in 1st year of Baruch Faculty
Almost two years after a college student lost his life during an initiation ritual in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, five people were charged with murder.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood of the Baruch Faculty of New York brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during an initiation ritual in September 2013 and postponed taking him to the hospital, which contributed to his death, according to police statements.
Official sources say that the victim was blindfolded, put a 14-kg sandpack in the back and was repeatedly abrupted as he tried to head towards a target on a frozen land.
Mr. Deng accused of headaches after which he lost consciousness.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi brothers did not call the emergency number after he passed out and claim to have waited an hour before taking him to the hospital, the police say.
But they found the time to change Deng's clothes, look for his symptoms on Google and contact Andy Meng, the president of the national brotherhood, to ask for advice, police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference.
"At this time, members began to hide their personal belongings and put the good of the brotherhood before Michael Deng's good," Wagner said.
He couldn't be resurrected and died the next morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng suffered repeated head trauma, torso and thighs.
"Too many families have been devastated by the rituals of the brothers since 1970, at least one student has lost his life every year because of the rituals," said Douglas Fierberg, Deng's family lawyer, in a statement.
Fraternities and their members must be held accountable and this action taken by the authorities is important.
The Monroe District Grand Jury recommended that the first five members be charged with third-degree murder.
Thirty-two other members of the Brotherhood, including Mr Meng, will also be indicted for outrage and complicity in murder.
"We want to hold the people involved to account, but if there is an organisation that has authorized the brotherhood, officially or unofficially, we will also hold it to account," Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
The Baruch faculty banned the brotherhood and the national brotherhood withdrew its affiliation with the local representation.
Here's what's gonna happen when the Federal Reserve increases the interest rate
The interest rate will increase and the bull market (growth market) will be staggered, bond profitability will increase and the economy will enter into recession.
That's what we know.
What we don't know is how long it's going to happen and how long it's going to last.
In the economy, history offers few clues as to time frame.
After the first increase in interest rates, the recession took only 11 months and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates is often, although not always, a determining factor in how the economy and financial assets respond.
This is why US central bank officials have emphasized so strongly that investors should not focus on the moment when they start to increase the interest rate but on the trajectory of the time needed for normalisation.
Indeed, in the game are multiple variables.
In the end, however, market players may find that all the unrest associated with rising interest rates has been exaggerated.
"The first increase in the interest rate decided by the Fed after the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some voices as a sign of the "cheap money" era," said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, in a note addressed to customers.
On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to more normal levels but still to be the seismic shock that all seem to fear.
But it cannot be said that there will be no effects.
Here is how it could react to a few sectors of the economy, based on historical trends:
Given the situation faced by the market in recent months, anticipating the rise in the interest rate can volatilise things for a while.
But at the time of growth, the impact is not so dramatic.
"It seems that there is a tendency for capital profitability to stagnate for 12-24 months after the first increase, which may reflect the monetary policy gap again," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study on what will happen after the Fed increases.
Specifically, over the past 35 years, the market has increased sharply - by about 14 percent - towards increasing the interest rate, quite unchanged over the 250 days after (average rise of 2.6%) after which it returns to normal after 500 days, with an average return in the last six cycles of 14.4%, according to a recent analysis published on Barron by the chief strategy of Nuveen Asset Management.
Deutsche stated that the impact on shares tends to become more pronounced later in the interest rate growth cycle and the benefits start to decline.
The recession is a reality of economic life but rising interest rates often contribute to it.
In the present situation, the Fed is facing conditions that have not existed before and that could accelerate a recession.
Specifically, the gross domestic product will approach its historical minimum point for an increase in Fed interest rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, of the 118 interest rate increases after 1950, only twice the nominal GDP was less than 4.5%.
Although in the second quarter of 2015 the value was 3.6%, few expect the situation to persist, the third quarter reaching only 1.5%, according to Atlanta Fed.
Increasing the interest rate in such a fragile economy could be risky and could raise the question "if this time is different," Deutsche said.
Market players have been preparing all year for an Fed growth decision, all eyes being focused on this week's meeting of the Federal Open Market Commission, which ends on Thursday.
While many policy-makers and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in interest rate at this meeting, forward transactions indicate a probability of only 25%.
"In our post-1950 study, all interest rate growth cycles so far have been in a super profit growth cycle, with GDP evading peaks before the recession very quickly after the recovery began," the report said.
On the contrary, this was a strange slow recovery after the worst recession of the period under review.
The current cycle is by far the longest awaited by the Fed since the end of the last recession; the record had been 35 months, and it reached 74 months and continues.
Fixed income was also volatile as the market anticipates an increase in interest rate and the pattern is somewhat similar to that of dividends.
The main difference is that the impact is faster for bonds than for shares when the Fed changes policy.
In the case of bonds, it appears that the benefits change direction as soon as the first increase/decrease in the cycle occurs.
At the end of the interest rate growth cycle, the return on bonds drops immediately," Deutsche said.
The Charles Schwab strategy is of the opinion that these interest rate increases will bring about a closeness of profitability between short-term and long-term bonds, flattening the curve.
High-profit obligations do better in such an environment, although "we are still cautious about forcing profitability," Kathy Jones, a fixed-income analyst in Schwab, said in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones is of the opinion that markets have already adapted to Fed policy expectations.
"Besides the dollar's power and the decrease in estimated inflation, there are a few signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of a more rigorous monetary policy," Jones wrote.
Short-term interest rates have increased, the yield curve is fairer, the spread of the average credit interest rate has expanded and volatility has increased - all market features when the Fed tightens policy.
Broadly speaking, companies operating in the US will gain from rising interest rates and local products will become more attractive.
Multinationals with large debts will suffer because the increase in the dollar will lead to the cost of their products in the global market space and their debt will be more expensive.
âHistory shows that âquality' stocks tend to be more profitable in the three months following an initial increase in the interest rate', Goldman Sachs said in a customer report.
Firms with strong balance sheets outperformed those with a weak balance sheet after each of the interest rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004, with an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high capital and low volatility stocks also exceeded similar companies with a lower quality, with an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
Debt will become an important issue.
Companies with a high percentage of floating debt have the most to lose, Goldman says.
Consumers will also have to earn from the dollar increase.
Those who save could also have won, although experts do not agree on how quickly this will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative Parliamentarian Andrew Bingham criticized the radio station for "prosthetic"
He says he's more and more like the commercial opponent.
He also took the BBC Music Awards' eyes, claiming they plagiarized the Brits' awards.
Comrade Damien Collins attacked The Voice, claiming that this show is not original either.
BBC Radio 3 "transforms into" Classic FM, said an important MP, putting pressure on him to prove that he does something that commercial positions don't do.
Conservative Parliamentarian Andrew Bingham also told the BBC chiefs that the public radio station "blasts" and resembles the commercial opponent more and more.
"I have the impression that Radio 3 "prostheses" - although I don't like to use the word - but I have the impression that it turns into Classic FM," he said.
He also took the BBC Music Awards, released last year in December.
BBC Music Awards, released last year, seem to be Brits under another name.
So if you're trying to do something different - these are the two examples that come to my mind that just copy what's already on the market," Mr Bingham said.
The BBC Director General denied the charges, claiming that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial opponent in terms of live music and public education.
I'm not going to find out anywhere about the classical music I hear from Radio 3.
And his commitment to live music and production has no rival.
"In addition, I think it is also important that Radio 3's commitment to discover new music and allocate new songs," he said.
In the first part of this year, BBC Radio 3, editor Alan Davey, said he must make more efforts to attract the audience from the previous period because the British have less knowledge of classical music.
But Radio 3 was not the only item under the BBC symbol criticized during the meeting of the Committee on Culture, Media and Sport because it would go after its commercial rivals.
Conservative MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the talent show bought by BBC from Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated Â£22 million.
Do you understand why there are often discussions about that issue because it is not original and is not distinguished by anything?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - having Paloma Faith and Boy George on the jury - be performed "in a specific BBC manner."
He added that he wants that Corporation to "find the golden-egg chicken in its own standings" next time he launches an entertainment show.
However, he refused to prohibit in the future the taking of new seasons from The Voice or to spend money that goes on licenses on other entertainment formats.
Internet sales recorded the lowest growth in August and the culprit could be Black Friday
In the first three months of 2015, online sales increased by 7%.
The latest month saw the slowest increase from 2000 to the present.
Online sales have grown three years ago, thanks to the use of mobile phones to shop.
Specialists are of the opinion that Black Friday of November could cause reluctance to expenses.
Over a decade, online shopping has exploded and turned British shopping streets into ghost cities.
Specialists say, however, that there are signs that online sales are falling, with the latest figures indicating an increase of only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
The total money spent in August has shown the lowest growth since 2000 to date, with only 5% growth in the last year.
Specialists say there are signs that online sales are falling, with the latest figures indicating an increase of only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
"If we look at the growth level in previous years and come back by 2000, there has always been a tendency to rationalize over time," said Andy Mulcahy, editor at the IMRG sales index, for the Guardian.
He explained that online sales went up three years ago when buyers started using their mobile phone to shop.
Thus, it increased the number of people who could shop online and could do so under various circumstances, such as on the sofa.
But now that it's slowing down a little, you might notice a decrease (growth).
The Black Friday phenomenon, imported from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for the decline in sales.
According to specialists, buyers would refrain from making purchases before the event that takes place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers crowded in front of computers to get their hands on deals, which led to the collapse of more retail sites.
Specialists are of the opinion that Black Friday, when the buyers fought on the slips, could cause the buyer's reluctance.
A study published by the British Retail Consortium found that at least Â£1 out of Â£5 is spent online.
In the case of certain products, such as TVs and washing machines, more than a third of the purchases are currently made through online shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people prefer to buy clothes and shoes online than to use fashion shops in commercial areas.
Following the sanction of the Bin Laden family, Muslims bury the victims killed after the collapse of the Mecca macarole
The bodies of 29 of those who lost their lives were walked on the streets by Muslims, the first funerals taking place in Mecca.
Saudi Arabia partially blamed the giant in Saudi Binladin Group construction for collapse.
Minister of Health said that a total of 394 people were injured as a result of the macarola collapse
In the street-walking ceremony, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed by a collapsed crane at the great mosque in Mecca.
Dressed in white, those who complained of their deaths joined the road to express their condolences, until the first death reached the end of the final journey, at the Al-Moaissem cemetery.
The sad reminder kept by the holy place, where just a few days ago a construction crane collapsed through the ceiling of the mosque, falling on the believers.
The bodies were released for the funeral after King Saudi Arabia sanctioned the Bin Laden family construction group for the disaster, which also sold out 394 wounded.
In the ceremony on the street, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed because of a crane crashed at the great mosque in Mecca.
Among the victims were the father of four children, Qasim Akram of Bolton, Great Manister, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Mr Akram was in the Great Mosque with his parents before the annual hajj pilgrimage began.
The Saudi authorities have already promised that the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca will continue, thousands of pilgrims still arriving in the city.
Today, King Salman said that the Binladin Group should not have left the arm of the crane raised when the crane was not in operation.
An Arabic version of the decree, published by the Saudi press agency, said the Binladin Group was partially guilty of collapse.
The news agency's English service did not provide that detail, but stated that the company's leaders were prohibited from leaving the country.
Earlier this week, Salman swore to reveal what caused the macarole collapse in the Great Mosque Court, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims came before the hajj pilgrimage that takes place later this month.
The Binladin Group has not yet made statements about the collapse of the crane and the Group's representatives could not be contacted for statements.
The Royal Decree blamed the group for not using updated safety measures and not coordinating its activity with the meteorological authorities.
Tens of cranes surround the Great Mosque of Mecca, as part of the massive construction effort led by the Binladin Group.
For several decades, the Binladin family has a close relationship with Saudi Arabia's royal family and is carrying out major construction projects.
Al Qaeda's last leader, Osama bin Laden, was a "renegade" son, disowned by his family in the 1990s.
The collapse occurred under strong wind conditions and rain, just a few days before the arrival of millions of people in the kingdom to participate in the pilgrimage, essential journey at least once in the life of every fit Muslim.
The authorities state that 158 people remain in the hospital.
The authorities decided that the relatives of the deceased victims would receive one million Saudi Riali (Â£174,000) and the same amount would be paid to those with permanent injuries.
Other wounded will receive half of this amount.
The advantages and disadvantages of converting credits into Swiss francs
Two offers of conversion of credit into Swiss francs have already appeared on the banking market, the main advantages being the exclusion of currency risk and the reduction of rates.
Disadvantages can come in a few years, when variable interest can lead to higher rates.
Banca Transilvania has just concluded the process of conversion of loans into francs granted by Volksbank, and Bancpost announced the offer of conversion for its customers.
According to the cumulative data of FinZoom financial portal analysts, Bancpost offers three years of fixed interest on lei, of 1.5%, the smallest on the market.
On the other hand, the conversion offer of the Transylvanian bank was accepted by 83% of clients with credits in French due to the second successive reductions: the balance with the value of the risk and management commissions paid by the client was reduced, then an additional 22.5% reduction was applied to the balance in lei.
Both offers reduce the rates of their customers, compared to the monthly plateau equivalent in lei before conversion.
Thus, Banca Transilvania reduces the rate by 42.5% and Bancpost by 33% in the first three years and, theoretically, by 18% in the following years.
Benefits
The main advantage of the debt collection in the CHF is that the currency risk is eliminated, the consumer being protected from future increases in the franc, and the repayment of the credit will be made in the currency in which he cashes his salary.
Another major advantage of both conversion offers is that the property is not re-assessed, additional guarantees are no longer required and another proof of revenue is required.
In practice, there will be no new financial and legal analysis of the credit and no additional costs as in the case of a refinancing.
Also, both banks offer a discount at the monthly rate, compared to the amount of pre-conversion customers, equivalent in lei.
Risks
The problem is that the rate in the first years is more of the interest, and the customer pays back very little of the main.
The Bancpost offer with very small interest in the first three years seems advantageous to customers.
It is not known how this interest will evolve after three years.
The margin offered to customers can be more than 3.25%, so the total cost reduction is smaller.
A possible risk for all lei loans with variable interest is that the ROBOR index will grow significantly in the following years (more than the Libor index - CHF).
For example, three-month ROBOR is now 1.44%, but in 2013 it had reached 6%, in 2009 it was over 15%, and in a few days since 2008 it has exceeded 40%!
In addition, it is possible to show other costs, unmentioned in the initial offer.
The time has come for decisions on the interest rate for the US Federal Reserve
The world looks at the meeting scheduled for two days on Wednesday and Thursday, when the US Federal Reserve will make a crucial decision whether or not to increase the interest rate for the first time after about a decade.
In a survey conducted by Reuters with the participation of 80 economists, just over half last week believed that the decision would be made, I now believe that the situation will continue for a while and that interest rates will be kept within the current range of 0-0.25%.
It's a historic event because it's been seven years since the Federal Reserve brought the rates to zero.
For the first time, we are facing a situation where a major central bank could drop the zero rate and initiate a process of normalisation of interest rates," said Angel Ubide, chief analyst at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy has evolved relatively well, recovering by bringing trillions of dollars into the balance sheet and generating a low level of inflation.
But the Federal Reserve must not ignore the less pink global situation.
He warned the markets to prepare for growth but there are signs that even they believe such a move is unlikely.
The decision will be announced on Tuesday, 20:00 CET.
Views that have lost their charm
The actor (left), along with his son Redmond (right), has gone through stressful situations in recent years.
In 2001 he fought leukemia and in 2009 he lost his partner for a lifetime, Farrah Fawcett, to cancer.
It is also rumored that the actor had faced the problem of drug use and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
All this certainly has a cost.
Player Luke Shaw of Manchester United is on the stand for a few months because of double fractures.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture to his right leg in the Manchester United Champions League match, ended with a defeat in front of PSV Eindhoven.
After the event that brought tears to the player's eye and which will keep him on the line for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains optimistic that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The accident occurred following a reckless intervention by Hector Moreno in the 15th minute, after Shaw, 20 years old, broke the PSV defense.
He received medical care for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said: "He has a double fracture on his foot and he's in the hospital."
He'll be transferred tomorrow or maybe the day after he'll be operated on in Manchester.
It's awful - a boy who came to Manchester United when he was 18, gets into trouble, then plays fantastic and now something like that happens.
In the locker room, he was put on the oxygen mask.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but at the double fracture the rest is six months and will not play in the group phase.
I hope he can play this season again.
Turns out Moreno got lucky and got rid of the red card and the concession of a punishment hit.
Arbitrator Nicola Rizzoli didn't punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian official was wrong.
You can judge yourself when you say it's faulty and red cardboard.
It was a very ugly, two-legged intervention.
A message on Shaw's Twitter account: "Thank you all for the messages, I have no words to express how weak I feel, start my way to recovery, I will come back stronger. "
Similar news: Manchester United hit by Luke Shaw's crash in the PSV defeat
The founder of the England team has an additional reason to recover to play at the European Championship in France next year in June.
Phillip Cocu, PSV coach, said: "It's a very bad accident. "
Everyone is very sad when a player suffers such an accident.
Our players never look to crash an opponent.
Moreno broke his leg playing for the Mexican national against the Dutch national led by Van Gaal at the 2014 World Championship.
"It's very hard for him because he didn't intend to hurt his opponent, and when he hears it's a very serious accident, it's not good," Cocu said.
I didn't see the thing.
I only managed to see the ball, which was heading in a different direction, so it seemed that [Moreno] touched it but I couldn't see the intervention on Luke.
In the SBS6 statement, Moreno said: "I know how difficult it is to go through this.
I feel bad, I'm so sorry.
PSV player AndrÃ©s Guardado also arrived at the hospital after an intervention by Chris Smalling.
Adam Lyth has clearly risked England's omission, but he's still holding on.
Victoria versus Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but after seeing the team selected by England for the tournament, I do not take into account a repeat of the 3-0 defeat in the test matches.
I wouldn't eliminate the option of a moving win.
Perhaps Alastair Cook's team has less experience than three years ago but has good players on the spin in the batting line and collective morale is strong; they will not be marked by the events of 2012 but will have a youthful positive attitude.
Moeen Ali evolves as a spinner and Adil Rashid, even if unknown at the test level, is an option for attack.
Similar topics: Adam Lyth left the England team for the test matches and was replaced by Alex Hales
Obviously, as his principal coach in Yorkshire, it's difficult for me to analyze the decision not to select Adam Lyth on the team.
He played the seven test matches against two good attackers in difficult conditions, and the simple but tough reality is that cricket players are judged by results.
There were no question marks related to Joe Root, for example, until the announcements were made because - and I said this before - the players are their own selections.
About fifty years and maybe Lyth would have extended his run but his destiny lies in his hands.
I hope if he makes more runs for Yorkshire he'll have other opportunities.
England's lead coach, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude even when his performance was not commensurate with his ability and I'm not surprised by it; first of all, he's a team man.
It's hard to answer the question as long as a batsman is noticed in the test matches.
Lyth had seven runs - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton had nine.
Only Compton got lucky at home and on the move.
The only displeasure you could have was that England preferred Jonathan Trott on the Caribbean tour - when Lyth was in maximum shape - but that missed opportunity is in the past.
On the team comes Alex Hales, a batsman I'm very good at.
He's a cricket player who has "X factor" and I noticed early in Yorkshire this season when he scored 236 against us at a Trent Bridge pitch.
It should be given at least the same opportunity as those before it, but this will of course depend on the composition of the team in the UAE.
The idea was launched that Moeen would open the fight with Cook, which would lead to extra spinner keeping at the same time four quicks, and I have nothing against it.
I don't see why a pitcher couldn't hit there and this left-handed player already proved he's fucked up.
Maybe Moeen didn't bring success to his district, Worcestershire, but it was number three for them, so the difference isn't great.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 test 38 games as the first drop before he opened in 2001.
He immediately wiped out three centuries and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes on the team on the spinner back-up post and, although I had limited contact with him, he struck me that he is a very impressive young man.
People could judge his early age - with an average of 31 in the fight and 35 in the ball - and they might think it's a point, but there's not a lot of spinners and the selectors have opted for youth.
He'll learn a lot from this tour.
England has also made some changes to the coaching team.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, batsman of Sri Lanka, as consultant for the test matches could be a master strike.
He is one of the best players and will bring a lot of experience, given that he has played in any situation and against all types of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white-ball league tournament and will bring both energy and unsettling ambition.
I always thought he was born to get involved in the international cricket, either as a player or as a coach, and just like Mahela, he has intuition.
Sometimes the new voices in the locker room, even if they send messages that have been transmitted and previously, can bring fresh air into the team.
Colly Durham's team-mate, Ben Stokes rests for one-day games, Root gets a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with this.
Although not all agree, coaches and selectors do not do the program.
And you have to remember, players' jobs depend on the results they get.
Such decisions are never easy to make.
Camp Brexit could win if the economy stays calm until 2017
Every day, David Cameron's renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting more and more confused, even without the choice of the genius Jeremy "Yes or No?" Corbyn in the leadership of the Labour Party or TUC brings serious criticism to Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have characters like Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
One European diplomat explained in the past days that - plunged into crises similar to that in the EU - not all being provoked internally - some Member States are fuelled by the Great Britain's agenda of concessions and treaty changes, which most do not want.
In Brighton, on the occasion of the annual meeting, TUC decided that they would not want this either if they were to erode social protection.
We could even call it Dave and George's "selfie" agenda.
The Prime Minister and the Chancellor attend summits or bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, take a picture in front of a famous local monument, with or without the local representative, then return home and declare that they have won allies for reform.
It's just about me.
My European friend, who wants a great Britain with an outdoor perspective under the EU roof - "Don't leave us alone with France", Berlin says - suggests that several ministers and officials from certain capitals have reached the point where they don't care if they stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, the most cautious German chancellor, is an ally but has been in charge for 10 years and wants to leave the position before her situation settles, as happened with Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16), who stayed too long.
In 2017, France's President, FranÃ§ois Hollande, will be re-elected or replaced.
And his power is in decline.
Poland could soon have a right-wing nationalist government, Spain one left.
It is hard to believe that they will help the English who pose, whose energy would be better used to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK - something they do not want either because most of them have similar separatist tendencies.
Thus, some ministers might even plan to intentionally make remarks that do not help, in the SNP style, in the campaign for the UK referendum in 2017 to hasten the Brexit process, my friend suggests.
âRenegotiation has been fixed' and âGreat Britain has obtained nothing of value from renegotiation'.
Europeans know on their skins how grabbing Fleet Street can be and how sceptical the barons of the oligarchic press who look to the EU with scepticism, because they did not participate in the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn who ratified our 1973 entry in report 2:1.
Perhaps he vaguely remembers Boris Johnson, the Euro-opportunist, who became famous in the early 1990s when he was correspondent in Brussels.
Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included the mix of tax-free backpackers, foreigners who fraudulently phoned and pseudo-non-domestic who own most important newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair saw them the same way, but he realized that when you're locked in a cage next to a nervous gorilla, you have to give him the bananas to distract him from the thought of eating at lunch and again at tea.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairite than Blair in opposition to Cameron's idea of a referendum, given that Blair made a concession on the principle of the abandoned EU constitution, buried by the French and Dutch voters in 2005, who offered him an exit card.
The press didn't forgive him for that either.
But Jeremy Corbyn, who touched my back Monday at Westminster - I told him to stop wasting his time with me - seems to be in danger of adopting from the ou Murdoch strategy of boycotting Neil Kinnock from the 1980s, a mistake then and now.
It may take a while, but it must develop a coherent strategy of cooperation with the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr whose position at the BBC left her on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position vis-Ã -vis Europe is what I would call indulgence evolution.
He said he would like us to remain in a reformed EU.
Most of those who disagree with conservative "anglicism " might agree with that.
That's what Hilary said "A Benn, but not a Bennite" Benn on radio and TV this week, when the researcher in him struggled not to admit that the appointment of John McDonnell by Corbyn as "dark" minister on financial issues was a bad idea.
He reminded me of the '70s, when his father fought on TV to be unfair to fellow laborers, without going too far and without losing his office.
Hilary's fight was more attractive.
But the struggle to remain "in any situation" - Benn's expression - does not correspond to what McDonnell said or to what JC said to colleagues and parliamentarians during the private meeting Monday night.
Regardless of the image Corbyn wants to convey - remember, it has sensitized me too - the discipline of messages remains important in the age of television and especially in the age of social networks, an outbreak of paranoia and betrayal.
It is right not to give Cameron a favor ticket in Europe, allowing him to take good support for the laborers in the referendum campaign, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly believes this.
But McDonnell and Corbyin's basic sophism about EU membership - in line with their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just an esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents for whom the narcissism of small differences is a central dogma.
As with his NATO sophism - Tom Watson is unfailing about the fact that JC will not campaign for resignation - foreign diplomats will be forced to try to understand.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - and there are suspicious voters - for concessions to Britain when everything could be useless?
The US is already quite disappointed about the weak military performance of the English in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a conservative government that cuts costs, as I was reminded at the launch of the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Specialists criticise the UK Department of Public Health's decision on electronic cigarettes
According to researchers, a government agency's claims that electronic cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting between 12 people, some of them with links in the tobacco industry.
Specialists in the editorial team of the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet in criticising the evidence used by the UK Department of Public Health (PHE) in its report on electronic cigarettes.
The PHE published the âreference' report last month and described it as a âcomplex analysis of the evidence'.
However, some researchers questioned the robustness of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An article published last month in the medical magazine Lancet attacked the "extraordinary fragile base" on which PHE founded its main conclusion.
Two other researchers writing in the BMJ questioned their claims and their rationale "on solid ground or on moving sand".
Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at Liverpool University, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that policies must be based on evidence of effectiveness. "
They stated that PHE claims that "current estimates show that electronic cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking" are based on a detailed analysis of evidence and models.
In fact, a single meeting attended by 12 people led to the development of a multi-criteria (MCDA) model of decision analysis to summarise their views on the negative effects associated with different nicotine-containing products; the results of this meeting were briefly presented in a research paper.
McKee and Capewell either claimed that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose executive director was said to have previously received funding from British American Tobacco for an independent study.
It also validated BAT accreditation in public health in a sustainability report, it said.
They added that one of the 12 meeting participants stated the funding received from an electronic cigarette manufacturer but not the funding that there are reports that it would have been received by the cigarette and tobacco company, Philip Morris International.
The arguments on the basis of which the panel members were selected have not been provided, but some of them include the "fronts" known in the production of electronic cigarettes, some of which even state in the work the financing of the industry.
Other meeting participants are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The Head of the Tobacco Control Section of the PHE also attended the meeting.
The group's research work "convincedly muses" that there is a lack of "solid evidence of the harmful effect of most products according to the majority of the criteria," McKee and Capewell said.
However, none of these links or limitations are mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell stated that PHE claims that "to date there is no evidence that electronic cigarettes are a factor encouraging smoking among children or non-smokers" are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, the head of the health department at the PHE, says he has responded in the past to BMJ statements.
He said: "Electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking"
One of two people who have smoked their whole lives loses their lives because of this addiction.
All evidence suggests that the risk to health posed by e-cigarettes is lower than before, but we must continue to study the long-term effects.
The PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about the information that is and does not come from the evidence, especially given the high degree of public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Annually, about 80,000 people lose their lives due to a smoking-related disease and the annual costs of the national health system due to smoking reach Â£2 billion.
Expressing clearly the current evidence - that although the use of electronic cigarettes is not without risk, they only have a fraction of the harmful effect of smoking - we do our national duty.

Advertisements Shame on Britain's Arms Trade
Follow Amnesty International's film against the arms fair.
Horrible killer drones!
Beasts for crushing your ankles!
Dispersive bombs!
And electric sticks that cause frightening pain without leaving any trace!
The joyful voice and animated images leave no doubt that this advertisement for the world's largest arms fair is an arduous charade, made by Amnesty International to highlight the desire of the British authorities to sell arms to repressive regimes through Defence and Security Equipment International at the ExCel Centre in London's Docklands.

But a separate campaign also led to the display of a large number of posters in bus stations and subways that need a second look.
"Important announcement, travel with DLR between 15 and 18 September?" says one of the announcements, using the fonts and branding of the London metro, the DLR line turning into the image of a tank.
In September of this year, a lot of arms dealers will dive into the DLR Clients are asked to contribute to the halting of the arms deal.
The 300 posters are made by artists who have exhibited their works at the Cruel Designs Museum in Dismaland, Banksy.
A group called Special Patrol Group contributed to the distribution in London using "Ad Space Hack Packs", a 6-pound package of Allen keys that says it "facilitates access to about a third of the advertising space in the bus stations on the planet."
The London Transport Authority is not amused by this "vandalism" in the form of steering wheels.
One of the parody announcements produced by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator Cruel Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists are increasingly asking questions and seeking to make political works accessible to the public outside the galleries.
Many artists are working with activists in protest movements, realizing that they have to go out into the real world to have their art impact on society.
Another poster against arms trade that greets commuters travelling by metro.
Amnesty's film had over 100,000 Facebook views in 24 hours and was created by the VCCP advertising agency that worked pro bono, and the graphic designer and artist who doubled the voice also worked for free.
The creation director of the VCCP, Matt Lever, was shocked by the silence around the advertisement for the arms fair - with an empty space in the ExCel calendar - and thought, "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They played with the creation of a more realistic commercial, but "by enriching it with powerful animations and colors, it was more striking".
"They did a great job helping us increase our interest in selling illegal torture equipment at the fair," says Tom Davies on behalf of Amnesty.
Now, the UK authorities would need to take action and ensure that torture equipment is not illegally traded and delivered to the door.
Perhaps the most creative form of art on the theme of the arms fair comes from inside ExCeL, where exhibitors offer fantastic euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab issued an order from the U.S. Army concerning "AT4CS RS with launcher with shoulder support."
This includes "a single-shaped foci that provides stunning effects behind the armor inside the target.
Whatever that means, it won't be pleasant.
Eight golden rules to live in the home
It's been 11 years since I moved to my home, when I was a 19-year-old boy, who still believed in beers and moral relativity, but I can barely now remember the forced smiles of those I piss off - and the numerous complaints about others.
Most of the things I've learned can be summed up in the form of eight simple rules.
Moving into the home can bring states that vary from nervous breakdown to horror.
The chatter is tempting: to tell people where you come from, if and where you spent a year of study break, what do you think about Corbyn and why "indeed, you are indifferent to Marmite because, for good guys, it's nothing but extract of hahaha yeast, you find me in my room."
Take a deep breath.
And help others to breathe - ask questions and be interested.
These animate the conversation and help you differentiate between people you like and those you wouldn't even talk to if the flood came and they would be the only ones who would have boats.
Don't choke people.
Bedrooms often abound with drinks parties, movie evenings and social gatherings, but they are also the place where people dress and test their underwear.

Introverts are part of special treatment at the university.
Your bedroom should be a refuge, but in many homes you build a culture of perinding through bedrooms, based on friendship, socialization and friends that last your whole life.
All of this can be terrible for someone trying to charge their batteries.
None of this culture allows you to say "I like you and I want to stay friends but I want you to go away to recover my energy that I have consumed interacting with you."
Try seizing when a colleague is exhausted from socializing - and try to send a text instead of knocking on the door.
Speaking of knocking on the door: do it.
A guy sitting in the same house with me had a policy that said if a door wasn't locked, then he was invited in.
He's seen a lot of things.
Make friends cooking.
Since you start university in Bake-Off fever, if you knock on someone's door to get to know and take a plate with blacks, it seems less strange, less like the situation of the 1950s, "Welcome to the neighborhood, I cooked you something, now smile and I ask personal questions."
Home-made kindnesses are a great way to make friends.
Your roommates will feel compelled to talk and may end up associating your figure with a tasty surprise.
Obviously, you must be a good cook.
The flour, sugar and fat coconuts will most likely cause others to pretend to be asleep when you knock on the door.
Stealing food is a common crime in student homes.
Obviously, if you wipe someone's chicken is stolen, but if you take a drop of milk to put in tea is it still stolen?
Ask the owner.
He'll probably tell you to serve yourself even if it boils on the inside.
If someone steals your things, it's annoying and I understand you - still try to tackle the problem more mature than my roommate, who dyed his milk with liquid detergent to punish those who stole it.
He's in jail now.
Do not make noise that does not let others sleep or study.
That's not just because he's got good sense, but because you're going on your own on shards.
A girl on the level with me asked her neighbor to slow down because it was 3:00 in the morning and she had a morning exam.
Their reaction was to give the music a little louder.
When they stopped the music in one final, at 5 a.m., the girl was kind and let them sleep two hours before she let the music go to full speed, locked the door and left for the exam that lasted three hours.
Wouldn't it be romantic if the future husband/future wife moved on the same level?
On the contrary, wouldn't it be extremely strange if you mistook a fellow leveller for your future husband, you'd mate, you'd break up, and you should meet each other every day and maybe even see him get all your common friends?
Of course, you can't fight your heart - but if a sexy roommate is definitely not your future husband, at least try to be rational.
The moment you realize that someone left their keys in the locked room, the line between farce and intimidation is thinner than it looks.
A successful farce is funny, but it can be denatured in a few moments.
You teach a fun and valuable safety lesson by hiding something - but never dirty someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock the door and put the keys in a glass of water that you put in the freezer - but don't stick someone's goods to the ceiling more than twice.
Violonist David Grimal: There were no world tournaments in Bach's time.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were people who worked, artists and not commercial representatives.
The French violinist David Grimal is one of the great artists of our times, known not only as a soloist but also as the initiator of a less ordinary project, right "strange", as he himself says, Les Dissonances - an orchestra made up of international soloists and talented musicians, who interprets a symphonic repertoire without having a conductor, and this makes it at least a curiosity in the classical musical landscape.
Les Dissonances was this year at the Enescu Festival with two performances: a performance on Sunday, in which soloist was David Grimal, the founder of the orchestra, and a month, when in the foreground there was the violinist Xavier Phillips, the works composed by Enescu being non-existent.
Both performances on the Athens scene showed the public another way of playing classical music.
Les Dissonances appeared on the music scene in 2004 being, at that time, the only classical musical ensemble in which there is no conductor.
The conductor is the most important musician for musicians.
It's true, on the one hand musicians need an education either to become soloists or to become interpreters in an orchestra - talking about instrumentalists, not composers.
They're trained as "specialized workers."
They themselves have the impression that they need a driver.
On the other side of the stage, for the public, all the musical fetishing focuses on the conductor.
And so, the business, the music industry, is marketing itself.
So we're not talking about music anymore.
So if we look at this world, we have skilled workers on the side, which is stupid, and an audience that can't listen, but must look, what is again stupid," says David Grimal.
The violinist recounts that this change in the way he makes music came after the "musical desires" of his solo career.
I was like a high-level athlete who had to do the same exercise all over the world with different orchestras, to earn a lot of money and to bring money and music industry.
Ten years ago, when I was about 30 years old, I found this very depressing, because I no longer found human creativity and brotherhood in this system.
So, I haven't found any sense to continue on this road.
So I decided to create Les Dissonances.
This happened in 2004, and at that time no one did this without a conductor: "The musical world, extremely conservative, did not want such projects".
"How do you imagine marketing with a collective of musicians in which there is no ego?" asked the artist.
David Grimal admits that Les Dissonaces represents "a luxury", stating that none of the musicians in the orchestra depend on the success of this project to live.
In 10 years of the existence of the ensemble, the lack of a conductor has not proved to be a hindrance in the musical act: "Curiously, the more complex we sing a repertoire, the simpler it seems, because all musicians are obliged to be present in the opera and not just in the role", claims Grimal, adding that at the Sunday show "we were 74 conductors on the stage".
In Grimal's opinion, the Enescu Festival is a "very brave one", precisely because it invited Les Dissonances: "An extraordinary festival, where are present the greatest orchestras in the world that sing and 3 times a day, and in the midst of these orchestras you invited this strange group".
In a temple of orchestral tradition, such as the Enescu Festival, there is a place and interest in something different that breaks down barriers.
Speaking of Enescu's work, the violinist admits that he feels the Romanian music of the famous Roman composer, so he did not need a special approach when introducing Enescu's works into his repertoire.
Grimal notes that Enescu's music is very instinctive, but this happens when we talk about George Enescu and Romanian music, "because there is also a George Enescu who made French music".
Grimal is campaigning to change the way classical music education is done, considering that "musician's work, as it is organized today, has an iz of death" and that "the future of music represents music itself".
We don't need to tour the world five times a year if it's no use.
In Bach's time there were no world tournaments.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were people who worked, who were artists and not commercial representatives.
For me, the organization of concerts, festivals, tournaments, the release of albums, all are formidable, extraordinary, but as long as they are done in the service of music.
If not, we're in a system where creativity suffers, there's no more freedom.
To illustrate this phenomenon, David Grimal set the example of Romanian products before and after accession to the European Union: "In Romania, before you entered the EU, you had good vegetables and meat".
To enter the EU you had to adopt sanitary laws that are not good for vegetables and meat.
Production and agriculture come into the service of supermarkets, as happens in France.
Music happens the same, it's the same logic.
Les Dissonances makes tomatoes may not be very beautiful, but when we cut them are real tomatoes.
In an ideal world, this music should return to the center and that the institutions and industries that manage this system understand that music does not need to be sold, but needs to be shared, and this can be done starting with educational policy.
"If we consider - as the Koreans, the Chinese, the Japanese do - that Western music is one of the most beautiful things of humanity, we reintroduce his teaching in school, we reintroduce concerts on television and through this education we no longer need to sell by-products of music," thinks Grimal.
Surely, there are things in classical music education that remain very communist, that everywhere, is something very militarized.
It depends on this discipline if we compare a musician to a soldier, or if we form a musician who will sing to an instrument, being above all a musician.
We are talking about a completely different education, if we want to form a soldier (this education - n.red.) it must be in a way, if we want to form a musician, it is quite different.
According to your opinion, what is more dangerous, a soldier or a musician?" asked the French artist smiling.
Grimal shows that, for artists, the reward of another way of making music comes precisely from exceeding this "soldier" status, exceeding what "they think are their limits": "The musicians discover at a certain point that they are not soldiers, and that is why after the concert they come out smiles".
David Grimal spoke about his musical project and his vision of music and the artist in the "Festival of Ideas", a discussion with the audience organized at the George Enescu International Festival by Aspen Romania Institute.
Profile David Grimal
After following Conservatoire National Superieur de Musique in Paris under the guidance of Regis Pasquier, when he received advice and encouragement from renowned artists such as Schlomo Mintz and Isaac Stern, David Grimal studied for a year at Ecole des Science Politiques in Paris before meeting Philippe Hirshorn, who changed his life course.
David Grimal has an international career as a solo violinist, who has regularly held concerts over the past 20 years on the main classical music scenes of the world and with prestigious orchestras such as Orchestra de Paris, Orchestra Philharmonique de Radio France, Russian National Orchestra, Orchestra National de Lyon, Chamber Orchestra of Europe, Berliner Symphony, New Japan Philharmonic, Orchestra de l'Opera de Lyon, Mozarteum Orchestra Salzburg, Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra and Symphony Warsaw, led by conductors such as Christoph Eschenbach, Michel Plasson, Michael Schnwandt, Peter Csaba, Heinrich Schiff, Lawrence Foster, Emmanuel Krivine, Mikhail Pletnev, Rafael FruÂ·hbeck de Burgos and Peter Eotvos, Andris Nelsons, Christian Arming.
He was the recipient of dedicated works by several composers, including Marc-Andre Dalbavie, Brice Pauset, Thierry Escaich, Jean-Francois Zygel, Alexander Gasparov, Victor Kissine, Fuminori Tanada, Richard Dubugnon, Ivan Fedele, Philippe Harrowing, Anders Hillborg, Oscar Bianchi, Guillaume Connesson and Frederic Verrieres.
In addition to his solo artist career, David Grimal also wanted to explore more personal projects.
The freedom offered by his collaboration with Les Dissonances allowed him to develop his inner universe by venturing into repertoires that are not accessible to solo artists.
Along with Les Dissonances, he set up "L'Autre Saison", a series of concerts given to the benefit and together with homeless people at the Saint-Leu church, located in the heart of Paris.
Since 2008, David Grimal has been an artist at the Opera in Dijon.
He teaches violin classes at Musikhochschule in Sarrebruck, Germany.
He also holds many master's courses and was a member of the jury of the Paris Long-Thibaud International Competition in 2010.
He received the Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres distinction from the French Minister of Culture in 2008.
David Grimal sings on a Stradivarius, "ex Roederer" from 1710, but also on "Don Quixote", a violin conceived for him by French wrestler Jacques Fustier.
David Grimal was present on Sunday at the George Enescu International Festival this year together with the Les Dissonances Orchestra, in the program being Debussy, Enescu and Beethoven.
Les Dissonances went on stage on Monday, this time with violinist Xavier Phillips in the foreground, and the program was composed of Schnittke, Enescu and Brahms.
Cinema City is looking for "Little Big Voices"
Cinema City launches the biggest challenge for children: doubling two characters from the superproduction "The Snow Crayon 3D"
Do you have a super-talented, spontaneous kid who likes movies?
Give her the chance to become a star.
In September, as part of the newest campaign dedicated to enthusiastic and ambitious children, eager to become future stars and between the ages of 8 and 16, Cinema City is looking for "Little Big Voices", offering them the extraordinary opportunity to double two characters in a famous animation film.
If the classical drawings focused on approaching the voice of the actor to the specific character of the animated character, in the last period, the creation of the story also takes into account those who are to interpret the voices, and they are usually well-known actors.
Cinema City Romania wants to discover new voices and that's why we are starting an unprecedented campaign.
We want to find the right voice and challenge parents to enroll their children in our contest.
They will have a special experience, because the characters are nice and the lines are funny.
"Children will have fun and a real chance to be part of a team of actors," said Ioana Ionescu, Marketing Manager of Cinema City Romania.
In the first stage of the competition, from September 11 to September 30, Cinema City organizes a pre-selection after which 10 children (five girls and five boys) will be chosen who will have the opportunity to take a test in a recording studio with professionals.
All the parents have to do is access the small levocimari platform.cinema-city.ro, where they can register the child for the competition and prepare him for the voice test.
Afterwards, you have to choose one of the four films available on the platform, download the texts that the child is about to read and then the child will record himself playing his own double version.
Four films about friendship, heroes of fairy tales, magic and hope can choose competitors to support the challenge: "Pene Galbene 3D", "Mune: Guardian of the 3D Moon", "Blinky Bill: Koala cel poznaÈ 3D" and "AlbinuÈa Maya 3D".
In the end, the most talented two children (a girl and a boy) will see their dream fulfilled and will double a character from the superproduction "The Snow Queen - Snow Crayon 3D", which will have the premiere in Romania in November of this year.
FedEx wins are mixed, tax forecasts are down for 2016
FedEx said disappointing results for the last quarter, the giant in the field of deliveries reducing profit estimates for the whole year as a result of the low demand for transport services and the increased costs for its land transport division.
The company also stated that it intends to hire around 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
In the same period last year, FedEx announced that it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
The company's shares decreased by about 2.5% in pre-market trading, 45 minutes before the sound of the bell opening on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said it expects to win between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year ending May of next year, with 20 cents less, according to an earlier estimate.
Analysts predicted $10.84, according to a FactSet survey.
The downward estimate is in spite of the increase in prices of 4.9% on average, with entry into force on 4 January and the larger surcharges for the land transport of large or large packages, which will apply from November.
The company said it is still expected to increase its gains from the previous year as a result of lower costs, higher revenues and the development of online trade.
President and Director General Fred Smith said that "the firm is facing a considerably weaker economic situation than expected, in particular as regards global production and trade."
The employee plans for the holiday period were announced one day after the UPS competitor stated that it intended to hire 90,000-95,000 additional workers, approximately the same number of employees as it did last year.
In the quarter ending August 31, FedEx won $692 million, 6% more than the previous year.
Earnings per action were $2.42, under the average estimate of $2.44 per action made by 12 analysts who responded to the survey conducted by Zacks Investment Research.
Profit increased by 5% to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts who participated in Zacks' survey estimated the sum of $12.23 billion.
The FedEx company has been hit in recent years by a decline in international priority transport, which has led to the stagnation of revenues recorded by its Express unit.
But the explosion in online shopping took out the results of the FedEx Ground division.
In the last quarter, the income of the ground division increased by 29% but operational revenues stagnated practically due to higher costs for large packages and own insurance.
The express unit recorded an increase in revenues due to higher basic tariffs, while revenue from the freight division decreased due to rising costs.
At pre-market trading, about an hour before the opening sound, FedEx shares had dropped by $3.85 or 2.5% to $150.15.
Tuesdays had dropped by 11% at year level and by 17% compared to the highest record recorded on 11 June.
On the occasion of the most expected meetings in recent years, policy makers in the Federal Reserve will spend two days this week around a 27-legged Mahon Honduran table to decide whether the time has come to increase a key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
Above them, at the end of the central bank's meeting room, a mural of the United States will be unveiled.
The map is intended to recall that Janet L. Yellen, President of the Fed, and his colleagues must put the economic interests of the nation above all else.
The Central Bank has received a dual task from Congress: to maximise the employment rate in the US and to maintain price stability.
But since the great economic crisis, Fed leaders have confirmed that there is a third unwritten task: financial stability.
And this third task could be factor X in a decision too difficult to anticipate, which will be announced on Tuesday, and which will determine whether the US economy is prepared to be rid of the unprecedented incentive offered by the near-zero short-term interest rate in effect since the end of 2008.
Even if most data indicate a strong growing economy, recent turmoil in global financial markets could scare Fed officials already cautious about adding volatility by increasing the reference rate to federal funds - even with only a quarter of a percentage point.
"Obviously, the labour market and inflation will be the first and main aspects they will pursue," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at the brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"However, I believe that if they were looking for an excuse not to increase the rate of interest, the growing uncertainty on the world market is enough to provide them with arguments to wait," she said.
There is no consensus as to which decision the Fed will take, which in itself leads to instability in the financial market.
About half of the recent Bloomberg-questioned economists anticipated an increase in interest rate this week.
But the financial markets expect the Fed to postpone, a key indicator showing that the probability of growth is only 30%.
This would indicate a drop on the stock exchange if Fed increased the interest rate, unless policymakers mitigated the blow by promising that it would pass a long time until the next increase.
On Tuesday, industrial average Dow Jones climbed 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
The advance was triggered by expectations that Fed decision makers will maintain stable interest rate this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be surprising for Fed to increase the interest rate at this time," Lonski said.
If the Fed decision-makers would do so, "they should act in depth in their policies to avoid panic in the financial markets".
Other experts said that an increase in the interest rate would calm the financial markets because it would remove the uncertainty about when the Fed would act.
Just a month ago, Fed seemed to be about to increase the rate by 0.25% this month, the first small step towards slow tightening monetary conditions that would confirm the strength of the US recovery.
Yellen said in the spring and early summer that he was expecting an increase in the interest rate this year despite the high objections of liberals like that he would need more economic progress.
Although job creation slowed down in August, labour market growth was solid this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest percentage in more than seven years and close to the level considered by the Fed as total employment.
Wages showed signs of growth.
And while inflation continued to fail to meet the central bank's annual target, Fed decision makers claimed that a key reason was the temporary effect of sharply declining oil prices.
The economy "can cope with higher rates and needs them, given the pressure on the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But global financial markets began to enter fibrillations at the end of this month, after China devalued its currency.
Industrial average Dow Jones fell by 16% below the peak in May, as investors feared that the slowdown in the Chinese economy would bring down global growth.
The market has somewhat declined this month, with the Dow index now about 10% below the May maximum.
For Fed decision makers, market turmoil is added to the complex calculation of the interest rate growth time.
"Without what has happened on the financial markets and the news about the weakening of the Chinese economy in recent weeks, it would be firmer in the meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, a researcher with experience at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former official Fed.
Now, he plans to wait at least a month to better manage the effects.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact will be on the U.S. economy and they almost have no data to rely on later events in China," Oliner said.
The welfare of the global economy is not one of the main interests of the Fed, so it should not be taken into account in decision-making.
But in reality, the Fed has become the world's monetary authority.
In recent years, the influence of the central bank has been huge.
The President's simple allusion since then, Ben S. Bernanke, in 2013, that the Fed could "long" its monetary expansion triggered an earthquake on world markets.
In a world where markets and economies are becoming more and more entangled, Fed officials are expected not only to monitor progress in other areas, but also to consult with other central banks and experts to better interpret the world economy.
Its decision-making process is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of the Global Strategy Department at the Envestnet Welfare Management Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., said this month that "Fed has an oversized reaction history to changes in the financial market that seem unrelated to economic bases."
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Commission for the Open Market, a decision-making body that supported the rise in the interest rate, offered as an example the decisions of 1998-99.
A financial crisis that affected Asia led Fed to reduce the reference rate by 0.75% in three meetings, "despite the implications of limited identification for US development," Lacker said.
A year later, the Fed officials returned to those falls.
The Fed should put the issue of financial stability first only in the event of a major crisis, such as the 2008 market earthquake, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England interest rate commission.
The last turbulent period does not rise to that level, he said.
"We certainly don't want to get into the situation of fearing an increase in the interest rate because markets have been upset," said Posen, President Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act continues to have a dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until something changes in this regard, I do not think that we should take premature action.

Seven's Sunrise dominates the polls, despite the Nine Channel's attempts to broadcast today's show about changing party leadership
The urgent move of Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra to convey on the subject of the consequences of the changes in the leadership of the Liberal Party did not bring a significant increase in the audience for Today.
The morning broadcast of the Nine Channel broadcast from the capital after Tony Abbott's defeat in front of Malcolm Turnbull.
The competing Sunrise broadcast, moderated by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was caught in London as part of a series of broadcasts conducted over several weeks, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This "crossing" of distance did not seem to matter much to Aussie TV viewers, Sunrise having an audience of 397,000 viewers in the five capital cities, compared to Today with 339,000.
Today recorded a slight increase compared to Monday's (317,000) and last Tuesday's (283,000) hearings, but the figures were lower than last Thursday's (343,000).
Today has narrowed the difference from Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today had an average audience of 318,000 and Sunrise of 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference varies between 40,000 and 50,000.
For the time being, in September, Sunrise has an average audience of 349,000 viewers and Today 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that happened all morning.
This morning, not only is Parliament affected by the current of change!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for the question!

The main news was the startling debut of the 800 Words series featuring former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The new drama, with the subject of a newly widowed father who decides to move with his two children on the coast of New Zealand, had a very impressive average audience of 1,219 million viewers.
Critics were wondering if Thomson was capable of dealing with a show alone without the star of Rafters, Rebecca Gibney.
The results of the hearing for the last night responded resoundingly that "yes".
The X Factor show broadcast by Seven remained in position with 1,136 million viewers, taking easy on The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven recorded jumps and descents the second night he broadcast The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (17:00 to 17:30) of Andrew O'Keefe's new moderate general culture show had an average of 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (17:30 to 18:00) climbed to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small victory in front of Eddie McGuire's show, Hot Seat (613,000).
Monday night, the first half hour of The Chase Australia had an average audience of 520,000 viewers and the second half recorded a huge figure of 720,000.
Hot Seat had an average audience of 620,000.
The decrease in the hearing recorded by Chase Australia on the second night will give silent confidence to Nine that Hot Seat will finally triumph at 5:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia replaces Million Dollar Minute, a show that failed to win McGuire's show.

Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin to meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Mihail Hodorkovski, Russia's richest man, was arrested under gun threat at an airport in Siberia.
Because he openly challenged President Vladimir Putin, Hodorkovski was convicted, his oil company, Yukos, was confiscated and his pro-democratic efforts were diminished.
4 people lost their lives after police fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets at the crowd demonstrating against the country's proposed new constitution, one official said on Wednesday.
The violence took place on Tuesday evening in Rupandehi district, approximately 280 km west of the capital Kathmandu.
According to Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the head of the district police, over 1,000 protesters gathered in front of a police station, and some of them threw stones and Molotov cocktails.
Mr. Dhakal claimed that police forces used tear gas and then fired shots into the air before resorting to the use of rubber bullets.
According to him, twenty police officers and five civilians were injured.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, which are known to kill but are usually used as a less lethal alternative, have caused so many deaths.
The clash was the last event after weeks of violent protests in the southern region of Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group claim that the new province founded under the new constitution would dilute their political influence.
Protests also existed in western Nepal, where the ethnic group Tharus wants its own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 policemen, were killed in violent clashes on 10 August,
when four major political parties signed an agreement for the division of the country into the province - a major step towards a new constitution but a highly controversial issue in Nepal, a centrally ruled country for hundreds of years.
The process of drafting a new constitution was launched in 2008, but the legislators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
This week, in Kathmandu, the legislators voted on the clauses in the draft constitution and the officials said that the new charter could be adopted on Sunday.
We won't use wire fences, dogs, cops and guns
The Prime Minister continues to exchange views with the Hungarian authorities.
At the opening of the Government meeting on Wednesday, Ponta reiterated Romania's firm position on the refugee crisis.
We make every effort to manage the refugee crisis, all institutions have a coordinated opinion.
Romania does not agree and will not apply anti-democratic measures, security dogs, wire fences or gun cops.
"It is a shame for 21st century Europe to apply methods from the 1930s," Victor Ponta said.
"The Prime Minister also said that all the data and details of the refugee crisis will be discussed and established at the CSTT meeting on Thursday." the Prime Minister concluded.
NHC announces 60% chance of cyclone south of Cape Verde Islands
A broad front of low pressure at about 560 km south of the southernmost point of the Cape Verde Islands presents a 60% probability of turning into a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, the National Center for Hurricanes in the US said on Tuesday.
Another well-defined front of low pressure about half the distance between Cape Verde and Lesser Antilles also presents a 60% probability of formation of a tropical cyclone in the next two days, the Miami weatherman added.
Weight reduction surgery could be useful for diabetics with mild obesity
The benefits of weight reduction surgery for people with mild obesity with type 2 diabetes could be maintained for at least five years, according to a new study.
It is still premature to tell whether diabetics with mild obesity live longer after weight loss surgery than those who undergo non-surgical treatments.
"It takes a long time to centralize mortality data," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, a specialist in obesity surgery, as she wrote an article about the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Operations for weight loss, also called bariatric surgery, use various methods to lower your stomach.
They reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the body's ability to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been conducted in people with morbid obesity, with a body mass index (BMI) 35 or higher.
BMI, a height-weight unit, is considered normal in the 18.5-24.9 range.
The BMI of at least 25 indicates that one person is overweight and people with BMI over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI by accessing: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers at Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used the data collected after 2007 in a trial comparing two types of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and gastrectomy in the cuff - in the medical treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in people with mild obesity.
Mean BMI in those undergoing surgery decreased from 31 to 24.5 to the end of the fifth year in the study.
In the meantime, BMI in people who have received non-surgical diabetes treatments remained close to the same level, i.e. 29.
Of those who had surgery, diabetes was completely cured at 36% and partially at 28%.
In the group treated by medical methods, by comparison, diabetes mellitus was completely cured to only 1% and partially to only 2% of subjects.
In addition, blood pressure control, triglycerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol "have generally been better in the surgical group", the authors concluded.
Researchers also monitored the blood level of haemoglobin A1c, which reflects the level of blood glucose over time.
Researchers write that the optimal level of haemoglobin A1c is below 7%.
After surgery, the mean haemoglobin level of A1c decreased from approximately 9% to approximately 6%.
However, in the group treated by medical methods, it remained at about 8%.
However, this improved "glycaemic control" - reflected in improved haemoglobin A1c levels - did not reduce the mortality rate to five years, according to Chief Researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results associated with the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, compared to the gastrectomy group in the cuff, the bypass surgery group lost more weight (18.7 versus 14.2 kg), experienced a greater decrease in BMI (7.4 versus 5.1) and haemoglobin A1c (3.1% versus 2.1%) and presented a higher probability of complete remission of diabetes (46.9% versus 16.7%).
Although the new study does not indicate a benefit in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study conducted on people with high weight in Sweden that surgery prolongs the life, says Blackstone, from Arizona University, Faculty of Medicine - Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, obese individuals who underwent bariatric surgery were approximately 29% less likely to die after 15 years than a group who tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not indicate a survival benefit in patients undergoing surgery, Blackstone stated that it is an optimistic aspect for individuals with BMI below 35 procedural stakeholders.
"This is the point where this work is critical because it states that this surgery is safe in the lower BMI group", without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease, she says.
Blackstone added that patients and their doctors should start taking weight seriously then the patient's BMI reaches 27-30.
"I think we wait too long to urge people to take this aspect seriously," she said.
I think once they've accumulated these genetic changes that short-circuited their bodies by predisposing them to obesity and diabetes, it's extremely hard to get back to normal.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT news
Europe could not receive all refugees, Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current situation of the refugee crisis is in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader sent a call to put an end to the violence in the refugee mother countries.
Dalai Lama spoke about the current problem of the refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, dedicated to ethical studies, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the UK.
He said that, in the current situation, the interests of humanity should prevail in the face of the interests of every nation and even of every continent.
He also stressed that, while admirably, the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is inadequate.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria's efforts to cope with the crisis, he stressed that it is only a temporary solution.
"The care for a few thousand refugees is wonderful, but we need to think at the same time about long-term solutions to bring genuine peace and development, especially through education, to Muslim countries," he stressed.
Basically, we need to think about ways to reduce crime in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The force never solved these problems," he added.
Regarding the problem of violence, Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions after the September 11 terrorist attacks, claiming that the US violent response generated a chain of uncontrollable events.
After the events of 11 September, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him to resolve this issue without resorting to violence.
I know his motives were strong but he used force and generated unexpected consequences," Dalai Lama said.
Four-fold increase in the number of children who have ingested hand detergent in the last 4 years
According to the Georgia Anti-Oil Center, the U.S. Anti-Oil Centers reported an increase of approximately 400% since 2010 in the number of children under the age of 12 who swallowed high-alcohol hand detergent.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, the director of the Georgia Poisoning Centre, cases of ingestion of hand detergent in children under the age of 12 reported at the anti-poisoning centres rose from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Children have more frequent access to these products and, unfortunately, a percentage of them reach the emergency room," Lopez told CNN.
Lopez said that some children drink detergent intentionally and others do it to impress their friends or to respond to challenges on social networks.
On YouTube can be watched movies that present teens as they drink detergent to create cheap drinks.
It seems that teenagers have mixed the detergent with alcohol to get a stronger drink.
Younger children may be attracted by the attractive smell of detergent.
"A child doesn't think he's hurting him," Lopez says.
Many of the most attractive types (hand detergent) are perfumed ones.
Hand detergents with strawberry flavor, grape, orange are the most attractive for children.
The hand detergent contains approximately 45-95% alcohol.
Especially in young children, only a few swallows can cause alcohol poisoning.
"It's very concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, Medical Director of the Anti-Poison Center at Kansas University Hospital, for Channel Fox 4 in Kansas City.
Thus, we avoid leaving a glass of whiskey on the table, but people leave these hand detergents in accessible places and if the little ones get to them, this is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently ingested at school the equivalent of four hand detergent sprays with strawberry flavor, reached the emergency room to receive treatment.
He had alcoholemia179, twice as much as the threshold at which an adult is considered by law under the influence of alcohol, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, a doctor in the emergency room who treated her at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah was babbling and couldn't go when he got to the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight in a separate children's hospital to identify signs of brain damage because the girl fell and hit her head because of the alcohol, Ritchey said.
"It was scary," Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, told CNN.
It could have been fatal to them.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use products or wet towels without alcohol and to stop leaving hand detergent in the hands of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some detergents have been associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after swallowing hand detergent containing an unreported toxic ingredient.
Sanitary authorities assumed that the product contained methanol, a lethal substance, and not alcohol, specified as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth - grade students in northern New York plotted to poison their "bad" teacher by "putting antibacterial products in class," according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to hand detergent and banned it in her classroom.
The police considered the plan to be "insignificant" and raised the disciplinary issue with the school inspectorate.

Hearts facing SFA regarding Neilson and Warburton's allegations is cautious about the January purchases that affected the team's unit
Dons increase the difference from Celtic to five points
The penalization of ADAM Rooney in the first round brought Aberdeen a tight victory over the Hamilton to Pittodrie, with Dons getting a five-point difference between them and Celtic.
Griffiths disassemble rumors about misunderstandings
There were rumors of misunderstandings at Celtic, dismantled by Griffiths, who insisted that he and his team should not be subjected to increased pressure as they were preparing to face the leaders of the Dutch religion.
I don't think we feel the pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
The absence of Scots in the title race bores the Dutch - de Boer
Former middleman of Rangers and former Dutch international player Ronald de Boer said Dutch football supporters lost interest in Celtic - because they don't fight for the Rangers title.
De Boer, now ambassador of the Ajax, said: "In the Netherlands I no longer transmit the summary of the matches to the Celtics; why? "
Because there aren't the Rangers there.
Here, we're not just talking about the Rangers' coming back.
They're talking about Old Firm.
They talk about both teams together and that's where the interest goes.
The tension is high in the Old Firm matches and not just the Scots want to see these matches.
I'll change the situation, promise Deila.
RONNY Deila accepted that Celtic was fighting hard, but the Norwegian chief promised to change the situation.
The defeat with Malmo and the subsequent elimination of the Champions League were followed by the defeat in front of Aberdeen who played in 10 men, now in the top ranking with a five-point advance.
But Deilah said: "Celtic have had periods before and they will recover. "
We want to get out of this situation as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and many people are extremely angry or sad about what's going on.
We feel the same way - but we have to move on.
We need the support of the Celtic because so the players get better.
It is extremely important that we remain united now.
Warburton's caution regarding January transfers
Despite comments only a few weeks ago suggesting that he would have identified some targets for the January transfers, the Rangers' chief, Mark Warburton is cautious when it comes to transfers, insisting that he does not want to affect the Ibrox unit.
Former Chief of Brentford said: "January's transfer period is very different from summer's. "
In the case of players transferred summer, there is the period before the season when they can be integrated, which you could observe this season in our group.
The team is doing very well.
Sometimes you do more harm if you bring players that aren't needed.
Celtic targets Michu after withdrawal
The striker from Swansea, Michu, associated with Celtic during the transfer period, suggested that he might withdraw upon expiry of the contract with Swans.
The 29-year-old player fought his ankle problems for two years and failed to leave Wales in the summer.
Hearts confronts SFA regarding Neilson's comments
Hearts were driving with 2-1 when Paterson was eliminated and lost with 3-2, but the background red card was then canceled - the third red card cancelled in eight months.
Neilson maintains his statements, insisting: "I did not question integrity, I did not comment on performance."
Griffiths swears to avoid Tynecastle
The invincible Hibee was taken for granted after acknowledging that he sang a song with offensive lyrics about the former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in March 2014, in a pub in the Roseburn region of Edinburgh before a derby with Edinburgh in Tynecastle.
"It was derby and it was the enthusiasm of the moment," the striker said, adding: "There's no need to say that I'm not going back to Tynecastle unless I play for Celtic."
Tannadice Council Trusts Dundee United Management - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly insists that the Dundee United Council still trusts that the management team will change the situation - but he agrees that the decline on the ground must end.
I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We'll get the boys back in shape," Donnelly said.
McInnes Is Happy for "Dirty Victory " Against Hamilton
Derek McInnes admits that the Aberdeen team must desperately cling to Hamilton Accies in order to achieve the seventh successive league victory, which brought them five points in front of Celtic due to the first penalty kick carried out by Adam Rooney.
McInnes said: "There is no team that has won anything, in the cup or league, and that has not won games like this."
Unemployment rate in Scotland remains unchanged while in the UK rising
The unemployment rate in Scotland remains unchanged, at 164,000 in May, while the number of unemployed in the UK total increased by 10,000, reaching 1.82 million in the same period.
The unemployment rate of 5.9% in Scotland was higher than in the UK, 5.5%, according to figures presented by the National Statistical Office (Office for National Statistics (ONS).
In the meantime, the employment rate in Scotland has fallen by 12,000 over the three-month period, with the number of employees currently employed being 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell in that quarter to 74.0% - a figure above the average of 73.5 in the UK.
Scottish Secretary of State David Mundell, commenting on the latest figures, said: "The long - term plan of authorities has laid the foundations for a stronger economy. "
It has been almost a year since Scotland made its historic decision to remain a part of the United Kingdom.
Over the past 12 months, we have seen improvements in the Scottish labour market, the employment rate is rising and the unemployment rate is falling.
Why I'm Witnessing an Execution in Oklahoma
Today, except for a late legal intervention, I will look at how a man is sentenced to death.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'll be in a room for observers in the Oklahoma Penitentiary Execution Room and I'll see how Richard Glossip is executed by administering the lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation came first in January, through his best friend, and although I was shocked, I accepted.
As the day approaches, the idea terrifies me.
So, why should I do it?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story of capital punishment.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists can witness executions in America and, because applications usually exceed the number of seats available, there is a macabre lottery to decide who will be chosen.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of seats reserved for press representatives from 12 to 5.
The chosen ones will look at the execution impartially.
I can't do that.
I'd sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, plus I developed my own relationship with him over the months of phone conversations and a visit that lasted two half hours.
I like the guy.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can't be a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed to have a notebook and a pen to note what I see.
I'll have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story as he wishes, get access.
I complained to her.
He acknowledged that "he could have formulated better, " but he still feels that I am wrong.
Richard Glossip disagreed with some of the things I said and wrote.
Don't tell me what to write and I wouldn't even do it if I asked.
I told him he could remove me from the witness list anytime.
But he wants an international report on the subject to be present.
He believes that if he dies, publicity will help the movement against capital punishment.
Kim Bellware, reporter at Huffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to learn more about the case, listen to the series of multimedia files that I've made.
I won't come back here on all the details.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese make him guilty of complicity.
But I think he's most likely not guilty of murder.
I certainly believe that there was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think his execution is wrong.
And I'll look at him dying from that perspective.
I can't pretend to be completely objective.
For this, you can read articles written by other reporters.
From me you'll find out what it's like to look at a man I like dying uselessly.
Peter Moody claims the stewards tried to spy on him and threatens to withdraw from the race
Peter Moody claimed that the stewarzi Racing Victoria or tried to infiltrate a spy in his stables last year and threatened to withdraw immediately from the race.
He launched an attack on the stewarzi and integrity department of Racing Victoria, claiming that they are running a personal campaign against him, the drop that filled the glass being the elimination of Lady Tatai from the race due to a treatment given on the day of the race.
Moody said to Fairfax Media that he has always tried to do what's best for the racing field and that he is put in a difficult situation when it comes to the positive result at Lidari's cobalt test, for which he has no explanation.
For 18 months, he swallowed his words about statements about spies and did not want to look like "the fox that does not reach grapes".
"I wasn't going to say anything about that and I've been quiet for a long time, but sometimes you get to a level of frustration so high that it all blows up all of a sudden," Moody said.
It's known to have continued.
Sometimes you react and you have to bear the consequences, and I will have to live with what I said.
Tonight I'll go home and sleep quietly.
I want to go with my head up and I want the owners I work with to see that you're trying to give them everything that's best.
From the moment they start to think it's not like that, I have to give up the coaching job.
At that point I'll have to think about what I'll do with my certification.
Previously, Moody dropped the bomb in an interview given for racing.com where he said the integrity department tried to spy on his stables.
"Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in a room with a man - whose name I'll tell him if I'm asked - and offered to hire him at my stables to provide information about the activity there," Moody told Racing.com.
Obviously he thinks I'm a cheater.
If so, then they should all resign because they were incompetent in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former President of the RVL, David Moodie, current President of the RVL and Bernard Sandry, current CEO of the RVL, knew at the time and know today.
Should I think it's personal?
Is it necessary for RVL to begin to have a spine and can it hold people outside the trainers accountable for what is happening in the industry?
Do I have a bad influence on the industry?
How bad is my influence on the industry?
Maybe that's how the others see it.
Maybe I have to take my license and step aside and I have no doubt that the statements I'm making right now could cause them to think about this variant.
But I got to the point where I don't care anymore and that makes me sad.
It makes me very sad.
I'm gonna put pressure on and I'm gonna make them make a decision.
My family supports me and I can leave.
The trainer's frustration increased with the long cobalt test investigation involving Lidari and the elimination led him to state that he could "put his license on the table".
Moody, whose name is most often associated with the training of the undefeated champion Black Caviar, labeled the day treatment rule as "ridical" after a mud or clay cataplasm was applied to the horses' feet, which violates the rules.
He's breaking race rules.
I have to take full responsibility for this," he says.
One of my employees accidentally put mud on his leg.
It could have happened last night.
It could have happened yesterday, what happened and happened.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody could be disqualified for three months for the day of the race involving the application of the cataplasm, for which the stewarzies opened an investigation.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all understand that rules are needed but it has gone too far," Moody said.
The driver who hit and ran from the crash site in Cobram was arrested
Police arrested a man after a collision with a biker produced in Cobram at the end of the week and followed by escape from the scene of the accident.
The biker was transported by helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital, being seriously injured after being hit on Saturday morning by a car on the Murray Valley highway.
Police representatives say that the driver of the car did not stop to help the injured biker.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man surrendered to the Shepparton police.
Apparently, he'll be charged with running from the scene of the accident, non-provision of first aid and other road crimes.
The biker, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in a stable state.
Coach Melbourne Storm, Craig Bellamy, responds to opponents on wrestling charges.
Coach Melbourne Storm, Craig Bellamy, called the criticisms of the placard tactics used by his team as "denatured subjects" brought up by NRL's top two favorites.
Coach Sydney Roosters, Trent Robinson, said the referees allowed the Storm players to "take their team to the curb" in Storm's nervously winning match in the qualifying final played Friday night in Sydney.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a slight reference to Storm after his team's victory in the North Queensland Cowboys qualifying match, played on Saturday night, when he called that game a "demonstration" of the rugby league and said that the two teams in Queensland are not very good at wrestling.
Bellamy jumped to defend the placard tactics approached by his team and said that the players simply focused on "contact" when they were placarding.
Bellamy says she got trusted after two important coaches criticized her team, which means they were worried Storm will defeat them.
"And things don't stop here - I didn't hear Trent Robinson complaining about wrestling when they beat us with score 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that I haven't changed anything all year in our defensive systems or techniques, so much so that in the last six weeks I've really focused on contact in placards and so I've changed the situation.
Trent has been in this position for three years and obviously has a wonderful team so he's probably not used to losing and it was a shock to him.
Funny how it always happens this time of year.
Bellamy contradicted Bennett's idea of "animating football", reminding his mentor St George-Illawarra Dragons of Bennett won the championship in 2010 by playing football "punctuating".
Wayne's talking about exciting football.
He argued his opinion by comparing his Saturday night game with our Friday night game and talked about how exciting the game was," Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010, St. George received a lot of criticism because he was a boring team and Wayne said he didn't care as much as black under his fingernails.
But now he has a team that can play what we consider to be thrilling football, especially because of the fast young midwives.
This kind of game you want to do when you have such players.
He brought this argument in 2010, now he wants everyone to adopt his style of play - not every team has two middlemen like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt to be able to play like that.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things because they're kind of worried about the game with us.
Six weeks ago they probably weren't thinking about us when they were thinking about important games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the match between Storm and Roosters was a sharper score-related match compared to the match between Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos match was probably a good match, haven't I seen it yet, how much was the score?
Our game ended 20-18, in our game there were two more attempts, that means thrilling game?
Or is it thrilling to pause and not score?
It's plans for me.
If they talk about us, it means that at some point we could meet them.
Storm is free this weekend because they have won the right to play home either with North Queensland Cowboys or with Cronulla Sharks in the final of next Saturday's preliminaries at AAMI Park, putting their tickets for sale from next Tuesday morning.
Stevan Hogg used the girls' phone to lure pedophiles to send pictures
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to ask for images of abused children.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone when she was asleep and then authenticated herself in an online messaging service where another user sent her a series of indecent pictures with children as the subject.
The girl woke up later and noticed the disappearance of the phone, which she found in Hogg's hand while he was sleeping.
He looked on the phone and found the disturbing messages after which he immediately alerted his mother.
After arrival, the police saw the five photos then analyzed computers found at that address and found "careful" searches on the Internet using terms to find indecent images with children subjects.
Hogg claimed that he did it to "attract pedophiles" on the Internet before he "pretends he's a cop to scare him."
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson said to the court in Dundee: "He said it's an addiction - that it's addictive to scare people.
He admitted that he did his computer searches but said he did it because he wanted to act like a cop to scare the pedophiles.
He was asked about the conversations he had with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and about the fact that he asked that person to send him more pictures.
He said he did it to lure.
He said he didn't think clearly when he was drinking and that he wanted to see images of rapes and murders.
Mr. Robertson added: "When the little girl found the messages on the phone, she cried her mother and shivered and cried.
The girl saw the indecent images on the phone and the defendant was confronted.
The girl was interviewed and told that the accused used the computer and the Playstation to talk to girls who seemed much younger than him.
Last year, on June 14, 23-year-old Hogg residing in Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to charges that he had taken or taken indecent pictures of children, and violated the conditions of conditional release on January 25 this year and did not appear before the court at the hearing on March 24 this year.
The defense lawyer, Gregor Sim, asked Hogg not to be registered in the sex offender registry because it can be said that this crime "did not involve a significant sexual aspect".
Judge Alistair Carmichael postponed the sentence until October, for reasons of social reports.
Hogg was released on bail in this file but remained in custody before appearances for other files.
It was passed into the sex offender's register before the sentence was handed down.
Robert Mugabe, President of the Republic of Zimbabwe, delivered the wrong speech in Parliament
At the beginning of the year, Mr Mugabe, the oldest African leader, fell on the steps of a podium.
But the shooting of the fall was not hurt, but it became viral on social networks.
The opening of the parliamentary session was also disturbed by opposition representatives who said that they had received anonymous death threats, threatening them not to hide Mr Mugabe during his speech.
Last month they fled during his speech in Parliament - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The head of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) parliamentary group, Innocent Gonese, said seven opposition politicians received text messages on mobile phones, being warned not to disturb Mr Mugabe's speech.
"The message was sent by a hidden number but it is called "death," he told the journalists after Mr Mugabe's speech.
It warns parliamentarians that immunity applies only in Parliament and once they leave Parliament, parliamentary immunity is worthless.
The head of the parliamentary group said that the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, is "concerned" with the threats transmitted to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will make 30,000 availabilities
Hewlett-Packard is expected to make between 25,000 and 30,000 available as part of the company's restructuring and cost reduction efforts in the service sector.
This year. HP will be divided on stock exchange into two companies, separating the computer division and printers from operations with growing corporate hardware and services.
The planned availability will bring costs of approximately $2.7 billion starting in the fourth quarter, HP said.
"These restructurings will bring the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise a more competitive and sustainable cost structure," said Meg Whitman, President and Chief Executive Officer HP, who will lead the unit after the breakup.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP today and will have a broad business portfolio that will contribute to the transition of companies to the new business style," Whitman said.
Working as a separate company, we are positioned better than ever to meet the growing requirements of our global customers.
According to a company statement, Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have annual revenues of more than $50 billion and "focus on delivering unrivalled integrated solutions" to companies.
A company founded in 1930 by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard is being divided into two companies, the object of which is the production of electrical equipment and whose garage in Palo Alto has been called the Silicon Valley league.
HP has gone through a massive reorganization to adapt to the transition from traditional computers to mobile devices.
The measure taken by HP, the second largest computer producer in the world and one of the largest technology companies in the US, is the most recent in the field, based on the idea that companies that focus their attention in a better direction have better performance.
FriendsFest: The comedy series that taught us important lessons about friendship among men
The absence of similar characters in the series is evident, since the need for men to open is now more desperate than ever, with suicide rates among young men reaching the top of the last 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the leading cause of death in men aged 20-45 in the UK, and remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an attempt to address the issue, the Campaign Against Unhappy Life (CALM) designated 2015 as the Year of Man, wanting to question the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship lies at the heart of the struggle for the success of this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2000 high school students with symptoms of depression concluded that if the patient is surrounded by enough friends "with a healthy mood", his chances of recovery are doubled.
To the same extent, for people who are not depressed, a circle of healthy mental friends reduces the likelihood of mental disorders to half.
Of course, for friendship to work, it must first be accessible.
In this age of communication dominated by social networks, where emphasis is placed on style rather than substance, the immediate nature of the response often has priority before contact with meaning.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to create the appearance of a powerful personality, open to fun and success, even if in reality isolation is the one that dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, all at the cost of intrinsic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship - which further affects our mental health.
The billionaire inventor of a video game recently explained that money really doesn't buy happiness.
The beauty of the Friends series was that it focused on this idea.
Characters were not defined by work but by their own personality, which they showed by interacting as friends.
The humor of Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, the moments when he looks at football in the comfortable armchairs and Ross' passion for Rachel came from the fact that it is known that men can associate with this situation, even though they often fail to fully explore their feelings.
As one social worker explained to me: ..."My role in listening to people with suicidal and depressed tendencies has shown how even the smallest interactions with friends can make a difference."
Often, people who call on us don't feel able to talk to friends.
The old saying to deal with yourself is strong, as is the feeling of being perceived as a weak person if you speak openly about problems.
Friends is one of the series that comes to mind when I try to offer more mechanisms for long-term psychological adaptation.
The series highlighted the small moments of friendship between men.
As much as it helps the objective, external intervention, through the telephone, people arriving in moments of despair, long-term support comes from the family and close friends.
So, if you attend this weekend at FriendsFest organized by Comedy Central, with the complete recording of the film plates to celebrate the event, why not invite your friends to a coffee in Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship could make.
Friends is broadcast by Comedy Central from start to finish - all 236 episodes - on the occasion #FriendsFest
Di Maria marks and helps PSG to turn Malmo aside
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after scoring against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria scored Tuesday in his debut match in the Champions League and helped PSG impose himself in front of the Swedish team Malmo.
Next we present the game's chronicle and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani did their duty, Paris Saint-Germain starting the series of matches in the Champions League groups, with a peaceful 2-0 victory against Malmo in the match played on Tuesday on Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored in less than four minutes from the start of his debut match in the Champions League in the PSG team, bringing the French champions to the advantage although they missed a number of occasions before securing the advantage with the goal marked by Cavani in the 61st minute.
Arriving in Group A with Real Madrid and Sahtior Donetk, Paris needed a strong start against Swedish champions because the goal of the French team is not only to qualify in the best but also to improve the course towards the final quarters in each of the last three tournaments.
However, although they took the points, Laurent Blanc's students were far from a perfect painting, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic who wasted the opportunity to empty himself after which he was replaced by the team from his hometown and the club at which he began his brilliant career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or on the move in the Champions League, so 2-0 win creates problems for our opponents and makes a comfortable difference to the next ranked ones, even if there are still aspects that we need to perfect throughout the season," Blanc says.
It's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we did it, although I'm sorry we couldn't get one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned after the accident to one of the three changes to the Paris team, with a 2-2 discount from Bordeaux's Ligue 1 home this weekend, but Di Maria took the spotlight in the fourth minute.
Last month when he was transferred from Manchester United, the Argentinian offensive middleman was named the man who will lead PSG to the next level in Europe and demonstrated this when he hit Marco Verratti's pass behind Malmo's defense before striking incredibly over Johan Wiland in the long corner on the right side of the gate.
But if anyone expected PSG to win by punching their fingers, they were disappointed.
Malmo, who defeated Celtic in the play-off to get into this stage and entered the field with nine headlines at the national teams, with a five-man defense and two half-defensive, was a strong opponent.
But their attack was not impressive, except for making the kick of Nikola Djurdjic who passed Kevin Trapp's post in minute 34.
Instead, PSG players slowed down the pace a few times, giving a few unnecessary passes and not finishing the interventions, even Ibrahimovic who missed no less than five attempts only in the first restart and was then replaced by Cavani even after the game resumed.
Ibrahimovic, however, proved to be much better at supporting his colleagues, his care being the one that Di Maria sent in a shot diverted by Wiland over the gate in the 52nd minute.
The second goal was scored in a final after an hour of the match, thanks to Cavani, Uruguayan who scored the sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic passed from Maxwell's center.
This void eliminated Malmo's hope that they would rebalance the score and only a superb stop of Wiland from a distance to reject David Luiz maintained the final score before new entry Ezequiel Lavezzi was cancelled a void in extensions.
The Norwegian coach of the Malmo team, Age Hareide, later said that PSG were with one class over and that "The last match we played in the Champions League was last December."
Since then, I have only played in the Swedish league, which does not rise to the same level.
Qualifications aren't enough.
Put the hat down for PSG.
They played an excellent game.
Glencore collects $2.5 billion in stock sales
Swiss mining giant Glencore, hit by falling stock prices on the stock exchange, raised $2.5 billion in the sale of shares as part of a massive debt reduction plan.
Glencore, listed on the London stock exchange, said it sold new shares worth Â£1.6 billion to pay the debt.
After losing 57% of its market value this year, the company takes a stand with falling prices on the stock exchange, because the decline in China's economic activity influences demand and causes market disaster.
The preferential subscription fee has increased the price of Glencore shares on the London stock exchange in Wednesday morning transactions.
The shares increased by 2.77% to 131.60 shillings at the FTSE 100 index, which opened to a value of 0.69% higher.
Glencore unveiled the sale of $2.5 billion worth of shares as part of broader plans to cover nearly a third of its $30 billion debt.
The company sold the new shares at the price of 125 shillings per share, with 2.4% less than the Tuesday closing price.
He took 1.3 billion shares out of the company, representing 9.99% of the group.
Concern over the growth of the Chinese economy in prolonged stagnation led to a substantial increase in iron ore prices by about half and coal, copper and other commodities fell by 20-40%.
Xi insists on expanding the global economy
On Tuesday, President Xi Jinping told a group charged with reforming that the economy needs to open up more to the outside world to feed growth.
"China must commit to attracting foreign investment and expertise and to improving opening policies," Xi said in the 16th Meeting of the Central Leading Group for Deepening Overall Reform.
Promoting openness and encouraging reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and bring about economic growth, Xi said.
The Steering Group adopted a number of guidelines, including a negative list of market access regulation, relaxation of customs control policies, encouragement of state-owned enterprises to absorb private capital and reorganization of the resident registration system.
According to the statement, a negative list will be drawn up identifying sectors and areas of activity where investments are not permitted.
The system will be tested gradually and improved through test programs.
According to the statement, the measure is important because it will provide the market with a greater role in allocating resources, ensuring a legislatively based business environment and providing a wider market opening.
The state authorities will also weaken the controls on the powers delegated to the companies, ensuring that these companies decide how to conduct their business.
Also, according to the declaration, China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
In an attempt to open the state-controlled sectors, several sectors will be open to private investment.
âState authorities will not change their foreign investment policy and protect the legitimate interests of companies established from foreign investment and provide them with better services', according to the statement.
In addition, it will be easier for foreign citizens to apply for permanent residence permits or so-called âgreen cards', optimizing requirements and smoothing the application process.
The meeting also discussed the guarantee of the right of lawyers to practise and the education of judges and prosecutors.
The meeting was attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement made after the meeting.
Education unions, not satisfied with the Government's proposal to raise wages by 10%
The negotiations between Premier Victor Ponta and the leaders of the education unions did not achieve any results, the government proposing a 10% wage increase, from 1 December, with payment on 1 January 2016, and the unions wanted a 15% increase, from November, or one 20%, from December.
Discussions took place at Victoria Palace on Tuesday evening, with the Prime Minister of Education, Sorin Cimpeanu, Minister of Finance, Eugen Teodorovici and Minister of Labour, Rovana Plumb.
The Government's proposal today did not satisfy us, otherwise we would not have been in a position to summon the leadership of our federations.
The 10 percent we've been promised today is less for us than we expected.
"In fact, these 10 percent are the money that we made in our agreement with the Government last year for 2016," said Anton Hadar, President Alma Mater, at the end of the discussion.

According to him, on Thursday, there will be a meeting of the FSLI in which the representatives of the Government will also participate to present to the representatives of the confederations of the country the proposal of salary increase, followed by the trade unionists to decide whether to accept the offer of the Executive.

Immigrant crisis: Tragedy in the Aegean Sea
At least 22 immigrants drowned on Tuesday in Turkey's territorial waters after the ship they were in was shipwrecked.
Among the victims were 11 women and 5 children, inform AFP, according to Yahoo News.
The boat was in the Aegean Sea and headed for the Greek island Kos.
Turkey's coast guard has reported that it has managed to save 249 people in the shipwrecked boat, but their nationality is still unknown.
Previously, on Monday, two other people died while trying to cross the Aegean Sea.
Also on the weekend, 34 immigrants, including 4 babies and 11 children, drowned on the Greek island of Farmakonisi, 15 kilometres from the Turkish coast.
The situation was similar: the boat carried more people than its capacity, so it sank.
The route has recently become popular for immigrants who want to escape war and hard life in countries like Syria or Iraq.
Over 100 stewardesses fired because they were too fat.
Air India's airline fire about 130 stewarzi and stewardesses because they're overweight, announced the company at the end of last week.
The state company announced that the decision was made for security reasons and recent government regulations, but critics say that the measure is "ridiculous" and "sorry of sexist," writes The Washington Post.
Mass concession is the most recent in a ten-year fight between the company and the fuller stewardesses.
The weight limit for these dates back to the 1980s, when Air India began to use graphics with the ideal weight and height.
In 2006, Air India fired the new stewardesses considered "exceptionally overweight", because this fact "may have an effect on reflexes and may prevent the necessary agility to perform emergency measures".
Stewardesses sued the company, won and were rehired, but the company fired them again in 2009.
"All efforts to make them weak have failed," explains a company spokesman.
A Star footballer gives lessons to Gigi Becali: What decision did he make
A footballer from Stara gives Gigi Becali lessons in promoting young players.
If the champion's financier decided to close the football academy in which he had invested a considerable amount, the Paul Papp Foundation opened a football school.
The "Paul Papp" Academy will function in the city of Dej, with local kids waiting for a first selection action.
I am extremely happy that I have reached this stage, to give the start of the Football Academy that bears my name.
For me, it's extremely important to find talented kids who can play football without worrying about training materials.
They have to have one thing to do: play football as well as possible.
Technical details don't have to be their concern.
They have to value their talent.
This is what he wants to do at the 'Paul Papp' Football Academy.
"I'm also waiting for Mayor Costan Morar at the first selection of children, to show that he's with them," said the Papp footballer for breakfast.ro.
At the Star's Behind Academy, children are expected to be 11 years of age.
The whole party wants to rule.
PSD interim president Liviu Dragnea said Tuesday that the whole party wants to remain in government, and if the prime minister wants to, the PSD Congress will formalize this decision.
I understand that Mr. Ponta is waiting for this decision from the PSD Congress, everyone wants to rule, the whole party.
If you want to formalize through a congressional decision, we'll do that too.
There won't be any kind of emotion about it.
"There were no elements, voices in the party, opinions in the party that would give someone insecure government or give someone the impression that someone in the party would not want PSD to remain in government, in the current government, with the current Prime Minister," Dragnea said at the end of the PSD National Permanent Office.
PSD announced when it will hold congress - what will be decided then
Prime Minister Victor Ponta said on Tuesday that it is important that, at the PSD Congress, beyond the choice of leadership, a clear message be given whether the government wants to continue or whether the party decides to move in the opposite direction.
Dragnea: I'll announce Monday if I'm running for a function at Congress
On the other hand, Liviu Dragnea will announce next Monday if he will run for a leadership position at the future Congress.
I will sing, on Monday, after the Executive Committee, if the date of the congress is established.
"I will announce whether I will be running for office in the leadership of the party," Dragnea said at the end of the Tuesday meeting of the PSD National Permanent Office.
Asked if the hesitation about the announcement of the candidate had anything to do with his file, Dragnea said he didn't have that problem.
I don't have the problem you're referring to, but it seems fair and honest to me to all my colleagues in the party to announce to me or not a candidacy when the date of Congress is formally set.
"It's the only motivation," Dragnea said.
The vast majority of social-democratic affiliates proposed an extraordinary PSD Congress on 11 October, and the exact date of Congress will be decided on months by the party's Executive Committee.

What's going on with Coach Darren Cahill?
Simona Halep is facing a crucial decision for her career, being forced to choose whether or not she will continue to collaborate with coach Darren Cahill.
The two worked this year as part of the Adidas Player Development program, the Australian technician being alongside the novel only on major tournaments.
Simona had only words of praise for Cahill, who seemed to be the only coach who managed to get in front of the capricious sport.
The Adidas program will close at the end of this year, and Halep must decide whether he will offer Cahill a consistent contract or give up collaboration.
We don't know exactly what's going to happen yet.
We'll talk and see.
"After Singapore I can give an answer," Simona confessed at a press conference.
Darren Cahill is one of the most expensive coaches in today's tennis, requesting a contract of about $1 million a year.
In addition, Australian is also a sports commentator, a job he would not want to give up at the time.
The last match Simona and Cahill will work on together is the Champions Tournament in Singapore.
It wasn't normal, I wasn't respected.
Victor Piturca revealed how he broke up with Romania's national team last fall.
The former selector confessed that he did not agree with FRF President Razvan Burleanu, after he took his place with Mircea Sandu, and thus made the decision to leave the country.
Eventually, he proposed to the head of the Federation to raise his salary substantially to stay, but it was refused.
I'm not sorry I left the country right now.
Then I was sorry, I was leaving a job behind.
That's how I thought it was good for me and I think it was good for me.
What happens to me when I was a selector, it wasn't normal, I wasn't respected, my work wasn't respected.
I worked well with the former Federation, but when Burleanu came to the Federation he came up with a preconceived idea, he didn't know me, he found out different opinions from the press about me.
It didn't change me because it was very hard at the time, with the results I had, plus it was the financial situation in the middle.
I continued the work, everything went very well and probably changed it and he also changed his ideas.
But I wanted to go.
If he really wanted me to stay, I proposed a contract increase.
We have around 400 and some thousand euros a year, I was going to have about 600 thousand euros.
We didn't talk to Burleanu, we talked to his right hand.
"He agreed, but only if we finish first in the group," Victor Piturca said at Dolce Sport.
Victor Piturca resigned from Romania's national team last autumn, although the team had good results in the Euro 2016 preliminaries.
The technician accepted the proposal to train in Saudi Arabia, he immediately took over the group Al Ittihad.
Armoured and water cannons at the border
The Hungarian police detached Humvee military vehicles equipped with machine guns at the border with Serbia, after the violent clashes of Wednesday, when guns with water and tear gas were used against immigrants who wanted to cross from Serbia, despite the fact that Hungary raised a fence with barbed wire.

The authorities reported that dozens of immigrants broke the fence as they passed between Roszke and Horgos and managed to cross the country.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto asked Serbia to take action against "very aggressive" immigrants from the communal border.
There are reports according to which and the Serbs have added their law enforcement forces to the border.
Following Wednesday's incidents, Budapest suspended crossing the Roszke-Horgos border for 30 days.

Rare disease that a man suffers from
The American Nick Hess was haunted by his family as an alcoholic, his wife even filming him when he was stunned, he could barely stand up and his words were hard to understand.
Although the 35-year-old man said he didn't drink alcohol, it was visible that he was in a state of drunkenness.
When she first accused me of being drunk, without drinking, I thought she was crazy.
"But friends and family thought 'maybe he's drinking alone, he's an alcoholic in secret'," he tells, according to Mirror.
When he saw his wife's footage with him, the man in Columbus, Ohio, he just didn't recognize himself: "I was looking into my eyes and I wasn't there."
'It was awful, I didn't remember anything.'
Besides, his wife, who, though doubted for a while of him, finally went with him to countless doctors, remembers that Nick's breath also smelled of alcohol.
The moment that put Nick at the top of his head was when, after a minor accident, when he had been hit by another car, he discovered that he had an alcoholemia three times over the legal limit, although one evening before he had only consumed one beer.
After years of uncounted investigations, it was discovered that Nick suffered from an extremely rare disease, "Auto-brewery syndromes".
Basically, the body causes all carbohydrates consumed to ferment, turning into alcohol.
The one who suspected this could be Nick's disease was even his wife.
The disease hasn't had a cure yet, but since she gave up carbohydrates, Nick hasn't had such episodes.
He destroyed a Mercedes with a golf club.
A South Korean man destroyed his car, a Mercedes S63, in protest against his dealer's services.
The man "attacked" his car with a golf club, causing enough damage to get the car out of use, transmits BT.
The whole scene was filmed, and the video came on the Internet, to the amusement of those who watched it.
The man claimed that the car has defects that endanger his life and his family.
His anger came when the dealer he bought the car from didn't solve his problem, as he had agreed.
The government approved, on Wednesday, the "National Strategy on Immigration 2015-2018" and the "Action Plan for the current year", documents considered to be "an additional stage Romania is going through in its efforts to modernise the process of managing immigration in the national territory", according to a press release.
The source cited shows that the strategy aims to effectively manage the phenomenon of immigration, including general strategic objectives, specific objectives and guidelines for action reflecting policies set at European level, adapted to national realities.
In view of the problems faced by states in the immediate vicinity of Romania, measures are being taken to manage the unitary and coherent situation resulting from the possible influx of illegal immigrants into the territory of Romania caused by situations of political, social, economic or military crisis.
"The Roman authorities will contribute to the creation of a flexible admission system, but at the same time they will pay special attention to citizens from states with potential migrationist or which may affect national security," adds the recalled source.
The strategy identifies a number of factors that can influence immigration and asylum, including maintaining the conflict situation in Syria, reactivating the conflict in Iraq, maintaining an unstable situation in the border areas of Romania (Ukraine, Transnistria), perpetuating and increasing the intensity of the Israeli-Palestinian armed conflict.
On the other hand, the document also sets out a number of general strategic objectives related to immigration, such as: promoting legal migration, stricter controls on the legality of the residence of third-country nationals on the territory of Romania and the proper application of remoteness and restrictive measures, and improving the national asylum system.
The national strategy shall also include specific objectives relevant to the transposition and implementation of the overall strategic objectives.
These include: facilitating access to the territory of Romania by third-party citizens who respond to the needs of employment of the labour force, promoting access by third-party citizens to higher education institutions in Romania for the areas and professions identified as deficits.
With regard to the 2015 Action Plan, the Government appreciates that it represents "a means by which concrete activities are established that lead to the creation of a flexible system to stop the growing phenomenon of migration".
Romania, in a European top on the labour market
Latvia, Romania and Bulgaria recorded a large increase in the total cost of labour for the Member States of the European Union in the second quarter of 2014, compared to the same period in 2014, according to data published by the European Statistical Office (Eurostat) on Wednesday.
The indices refer to the employer's staff costs.
Thus, between April and June 2015, the total labour force cost rose by 1.9% in the European Union and by 1.6% in the euro area.
Romania, third in the EU to increase labour force cost
The highest increases were reported in Latvia (7.9%), Romania (7.7%), Bulgaria (6.8%), Estonia (5.5%) and Lithuania (4.3%).
The only EU countries where the hourly cost of labour force fell in the second quarter of this year were Greece (minus 2.9%), Cyprus (minus 1.2%) and Italy (minus 0.4%).
The advance of labour force costs in Romania between April and June 2015 is mainly due to the increase in the hourly cost of labour force in industry and services by 7.9% and 7.6%, respectively.
In the construction sector, Romania recorded an advance of 5.8% of the hourly labour cost.
TVR management activity report rejected in committee: Stelian Tanase risks dismissal
Parliament's Culture Committees rejected Wednesday the report of the Board of Directors of the Roman Television Society for 2014.
In order to reject the report, 17 parliamentarians voted against the rejection (Senator Varujan Vosganian) and one abstained.
The text of the report will be forwarded to the permanent bureaux.
They will decide, probably next week.
The next plenary meeting will be debated.
"I believe that considering this situation will be done relatively quickly," said the President of the Senate's Committee on Culture, Georgica Severin.
He added that "he was of good sense" that TVR management should also be present at this meeting, under the conditions that no representative of TVR management was present at the Culture Committee meeting.
It was common sense for TVR leadership to be present because no one here has been subjected to personal attacks or anything like that.
The invitation has been made to CA members since last night, at about an hour that we didn't know any new time, but today, after the meeting of the offices, I personally sent a fax to the TVR management inviting her.
I believe that when you're summoned, you're paid out of public taxes, and you're called to a meeting of the committees meeting even if you don't like to come.
"Because it's your duty to serve, you're in an institution under Parliament," Severin said after the meeting of Parliament's culture-gathering committees.
He added that the financial aspects of the institution were discussed at the meeting on the basis of the negative opinion of the Budget Committees.
The debts we saw as they continued, came up with the idea that this year would have been up to date, but they didn't pay from the historical ones.
"I remind you that it's not my fault or anyone else on these boards lost that pleasure with the banks and the fissure, they're clear management problems," Severin said.
He added that after the report of the activity will be rejected by the full assembly will follow elections for a new Board of Directors, and he will elect the director general of the institution.
I don't know who will be proposed for this function.
Wonders won't be done.
It is important to make political decisions for this institution to work.
I'm not the man to lie to you, to tell you that a genius will appear who will stand by the tail here and fight.
I hope that those who decide, in Parliament, by their vote, will choose with a lot of reason the people who will lead TVR.
There must be people who know what's going on there, have experience and have a lot of fairness and respect for the institution and tradition.
I don't know who it will be, if you ask me what qualities I must have - good sense in the attitude towards wage earners because it's a curse of small people coming from employees, complaints, dismissals.
"When you get such referrals 50, 60, 70, something is rotten and we talk about the financial situation that is a disaster," the President of the Senate Culture Commission concluded.
Although it did not present itself to Parliament, the President-General of the TVR, Stelian Tanase, sent a letter to the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Valeriu Zgonea, requesting Parliament to consider a number of measures that could lead to the saving and guarantee of the economic and political independence of public television, including the indexing of the TV charge.
In its letter, Stelian Tanase requested, in addition to the indexing of the TV fee, the amendment and addition of HG 978/2003 on the tax for the public television service, for the purpose of updating the provisions at the level of technological changes per day, as well as for the regulation of the procedure on control in the field of TV payment and the detection of infringements and the application of sanctions and penalties.
He also wants to issue a provision to prevent the extension of the obligation for all electricity suppliers to become the SRTv's mandate to collect the TV tax, by involving ANRE in regulating this activity.
In its view, it is necessary to set a maximum ceiling of 5% of the commission in cash.
Stelian Tanase calls for the reduction of the VAT quota for the activities specific to the public television station and the contribution for CNC from 15% to the 3% level, but also the amendment of Law 41/1994, in the sense of the possibility to receive budgetary/financing allocations for the acquisition of licenses for major cultural and sporting events - World Football Championship, Golden Cerbul, Eurovision.
He claims that the SRTv will be unable to pay in the following months, given that the labour law obliges the employer to enforce judicial decisions, even if they are not definitive, and pay rights are honoured with priority in relation to any other obligation.
The TVR administration has made constant efforts to reduce expenditure on staff and TV production.
"As a result, travel and other cost-generating activities have been reduced, a number of commercial contracts have been renegotiated, and at the end of July the TVR News post has been closed," says President TVR's letter.
Tanase appreciates that the disastrous financial situation cannot be remedied only by its own efforts.
"Without the support of state institutions - Government, Parliament, Presidency - Roman Television will be, sooner or later, unable to carry out its public mission", is mentioned in the letter.
The leadership of the Chamber of Deputies decided to send the letter to the Committee on Culture.
The son-in-law of Vasile Blaga, put to trial
The sons-in-law of Vasile Blaga, Ionut Andrei Rudeanu, was brought to justice on Wednesday by the prosecutors of the Public Prosecutor's Office near the Bucharest Court of Appeal.
It is charged with tax evasion, in a file with damage of approximately EUR 600,000, under judicial control.
Andrei Rudeanu was arrested on May 22.
It established the Axis Corporate Security SRL security firm, together with his mother, in April 2009, a year after marrying Vasile Blaga's daughter, Agathe.
The investigation revealed that, for the purpose of withdrawing from the payment of taxes and taxes to the state budget, the representative of a company specialised in security services would have created a criminal circuit, consisting of several commercial companies, through which fictitious transactions would have been evident.
"In fact, the company's accounting would have recorded fictitious purchases of services, which, in reality, were not provided, the state budget being thus damaged by approximately 600,000 euros," the Roman Police explained in a press release.
The Seics set Sanmartean's fate
The headquarters of the Al-Ittihad Club have established the fate of Lucian Sanmartean.
Although the Arab press announces that the departure of Sanmartean from Ittihad is imminent, the manager of Ladislau Boloni, Arcadie Zaporojanu, says that this will not happen again.
Boloni is very pleased with Sanmartean.
Lucian plays match title and does it well.
The Seics also realized that he is the best and that he would be wrong if they gave up on him.
It would have been another option to bring another player, much better, but nothing came out.
"There were more discussions, like with Mbark Boussoufa, but nothing happened," Zaporojanu said for Digi Sport.
Lucian Sanmartean arrived at Al-Ittihad early this year.
Elijah Sarbu was voted Vice President of the Court of Auditors
Parliament voted on Wednesday to appoint Senator PSD Ilie Sarbu, the father-in-law of Prime Minister Victor Ponta, as Vice-President of the Audit Authority of the Court of Auditors.
According to Mediafax, 290 votes "for" and 108 "against" were registered.
The vote was secret, with ballots.
The PNL representatives were the only ones who voted against this proposal, he informs Digi24.
Moreover, the liberals criticized Sarbu's appointment in this function and announced that they would challenge her to the CCR, under the conditions that he has a DNA file, but he does not have the necessary training and experience.
Elijah Sarbu has 30 days, according to the law, to resign from the Senate, because the new function of the Court of Auditors does not allow him to do politics anymore.
Senator PSD will serve as Vice President of the Audit Authority of the Court of Auditors, remaining free after John Anton was revoked, following a decision of the Constitutional Court in September 2014, which found that he was called unconstitutional.
Surprise from one of the sexiest actors: I grew up in the kitchen
As Bradley Cooper is about to play the role of a chef in the movie "Burnt", the actor made a disclosure that his fans didn't expect.
In a recent interview, he said he grew up more in the kitchen: "I worked most of my life as a cook."
He revealed that he had worked in the kitchen since he was 15 years old when he worked for a Greek restaurant, so that then, in college, he would continue on the same path.
The actor explained that his mother has Italian origins, so the entire childhood has cooked with Italian grandmother, reports ContactMusic.
Asked what future plans he had at that time, Bradley Cooper said he was never the type of man to make plans for five years, "not even two".
"It's not motivating for me to have a map," he said.
"I have dreams, things that you would laugh at if I told you," he said, stating that what he wanted from childhood was fulfilled.
At the age of 40, the actor admitted that he sees himself in the near future directing, taking the model of Clint Eastwood, who took over the directorship all this time at this age.
Ponta, accused of uncontrolled slander and irrational claims
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto condemned harshly, Wednesday morning, the claims of Roman Prime Minister Victor Ponta according to whom political decisions in Hungary are "no better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which refugees flee".
"Yesterday, Victor Ponta lost his self-control and, through his irrational assertions, insults the whole of Hungary," the Hungarian Foreign Minister transmitted in a statement.
Civilised European politicians do not say such uncontrolled slanders.
"His remarks have only one explanation: he lost his full support in Romania's internal policy," added the head of Hungarian diplomacy, according to MTI.
In a Tuesday evening post on Facebook, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said he wants to attract attention and sanction the behavior of high Hungarian government officials, who, in his opinion, "are a shame for the culture and values of the European Union".
I do not wish to respond to the challenges of Hungarian government representatives.
"This is a shame for the culture and values of the European Union; and in anti-Semitic attitudes, and as regards the treatment of minorities of all kinds, and now during the refugee crisis!", Ponta said on Facebook.
The Roman Prime Minister added that he is the adherent of rational and sustainable solutions to the refugee crisis, appreciating that brutality and aggressive laws will not solve the problem.
The barbed wire, aggressive laws, prisons and brutality will certainly not solve the problem - they will only show that in Hungary, in the heart of Europe, there are political decision-makers who are nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which those refugees flee!
"I believe in solidarity, in rational and sustainable solutions and above all in superiority of European values - what we see in Hungary in the last few days is in total contradiction with these objectives and values!", stressed the head of the Roman executive.
Earlier on Tuesday, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto described the remarks of Roman Prime Minister Victor Ponta regarding the management by Hungary of the refugee crisis as "simple lies", appreciating that these statements are inappropriate for a leader of the 21st century, according to MTI.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy also mentioned Tuesday as the "extremist and lying remarks" of the Romanian Prime Minister regarding the internal political crisis in Romania and stated that Budapest is waiting for an apology from the Roman side.
Szijjarto referred to a statement made on Monday by Prime Minister Victor Ponta.
What I've always said and said is that I'm against the xenophobic speeches the idea of closing the borders, like everyone coming here is terrorists, they're Middle Ages nonsense and I totally oppose this approach.
If we can get more, we'll get, the problem is our logistics ability to treat those people like some people, not how our Hungarian neighbors treat them, with bat and insert.
"That's what I disagree with," said the head of the Roman executive, in a press conference at Targu-Jiu.
On Tuesday, Peter Szijjarto announced that the Budapest Government decided to start preparing in the field for the extension of the fence on the border with Romania that it is building at the border with Serbia, in order to cope with a possible change in the route used by migrants.
Later, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said that Hungary's decision to lift a fence to the borders did not solve anything about the refugee problem and "take Hungary out of Europe".
What is the connection between Osama bin Laden and the collapse of the Mecca crane?
Saudi authorities have announced that the Saudi giant Binladin Group, belonging to the family of Osama bin Laden, is "partially responsible" for the collapse of a crane, on Friday, on the Great Mosque of Mecca, accident after which 107 people died.
According to a commission of inquiry, the company "did not comply with the safety rules", reported the Saudi press agency (SPA), reports BBC.
The company's directors were banned from leaving the country until the investigation was completed in this case.
The company will also be excluded from new public contracts.
The construction company is owned by the family of former leader of the Al-Qaida terrorist network, Osama bin Laden.
The company was founded by Osama bin Laden's father 80 years ago and is currently led by the brother of former terrorist leader Bakr.
Binladen Group has been working for 4 years on the expansion of the Great Mosque to accommodate more pilgrims.
The accident occurred on Friday night during a storm, when a crane, probably unbalanced by the mighty gusts of wind, collapsed on the eastern side of the Great Mosque roof of Mecca.
Following the accident, 107 people died and nearly 400 were injured.
How Hagi shut his mouth to the challengers
Considered by a lot of the world the greatest Roman footballer in history, Gica Hagi was labeled, after withdrawing from the activity, as a weak coach, who cannot be able to achieve performance in the new position.
After unhappy experiences with the national team, Star or Galatasaray, Hagi took over, a year ago, the role of coach at Viitorul Constanta, the team he patronises.
After just a year after taking over the team, the King demonstrated that he is capable of transforming a team struggling to save from retrograde into a top.
Thus, after a year, the Future recorded, with Hagi coach, 16 victories, 11 remises and 11 defeats.
The balance sheet is one of a top team, which fights against European cups.
Things took a turn and better for the Future this season, because the team came in second in League 1, with 19 points, one less than the leader Astra Giurgiu.
The future also has the best attack in League 1, with 20 goals (equal to Astra), more than double that Star.
On the other hand, even though he brought several experienced players to the team, Hagi continued his policy of promoting young people, and in the last period in the start team names such as Ianis Hagi or Hodoropea appeared.
The club's policy made the Future a follow-up team for foreign teams, so that Hagi sold 1.5 million euros this summer - Ianis Hagi (Fiorentina - 1 million euros) and Alexandru Mitrita (Bari - 500 thousand euros).
Next to the Star, the Future is the only profitable team in League 1, according to data from the Trade Register.
In the refugee crisis, Romania has so far played as a small country.
It's a legitimate strategy, but then you can't ask to be treated like the seventh country of the EU.
The big countries come with solutions for the whole EU, says Cristian Ghinea, a member of the governing college of the Roman Centre for European Policies.
In an interview given by Ziare.com, Cristian Ghinea showed that Europe cannot be transformed into a fortress, and the purely political means will not function in this crisis: "Maybe we have doubts about the quality of the values with which these people come".
But there are masses that have started and we can't turn history back.
Migration is a reality to which we must adapt as best as possible and adapt them to us.
In Cristian Ghinea's opinion, we were at an extremely emotional moment, when politicians felt the need to show their muscles.
After he passes, Europeans will not be willing to give up free movement, but the rules in the Schengen area must be changed: "Schengen is now like an animal created in another era and not adapted to the situation now".
Where are we in the refugee crisis after this JHA council that didn't actually solve anything?
It is clear that the EC President in agreement with Donald Tusk did not want to force a vote on the Council.
All the predictions said he would have had the necessary votes.
Prior to the Treaty of Lisbon, the principle of unanimity applies in JHA and any state could block any decision.
That is why things have been very little integrated in the field of justice and home affairs.
After Lisbon, the normal procedure, in which the EC has the initiative, is applied, and the Council approves it with the vote of 55% of the states, i.e. 16, representing 65% of the EU population.
The calculations said that the votes existed.
But they didn't want to go ahead.
Because it's a sensitive issue, rejection reactions have appeared even in Germany against Chancellor Merkel's opening policy and they didn't want many countries to appear as a "EU" reaction sending migrants on their heads."
They have thus postponed, but the problem remains because, obviously, this wave creates a huge problem for the Schengen government and we will probably witness major changes there in the coming period.
So the mandatory quotas weren't really eliminated, but the subject was just allowed to cool down?
Yes, on the other hand, there is talk of a greater involvement of the Frontex agency in the management of external borders, which means a change from the individual responsibility of members on the Schengen external border to the responsibility of Community agencies.
Greece's border with Turkey is also Germany's border with Turkey, in fact, and this wave of migrants has given the limits of the old Schengen system.
Perhaps it will give up the Dublin principle, according to which migrants are the responsibility of the State in which they first enter, because it is not sustainable.
If Greece turns around, you can't say forever that it's Greece's business.
Problem and common.
Just because the problem is common, is it possible to solve it without a precise, perhaps even mandatory, mechanism of sharing the effort of reception?
No one knows exactly how the mandatory quotas will work if they get to them.
Because there's still a problem: what do you do with a man who doesn't want to come to Romania or Portugal, but to Sweden or Germany?
I don't think the European states will get to grips with migrants: you go to country X or country Y.
It will probably reach some unique filtration centres, in Greece or Turkey, where asylum applications are processed.
They're working on solutions like this.
But the problem doesn't have a simple solution.
They are strong that have decades of experience in trying to integrate migrants, they are strong without any experience, like Romania, where the problem of migrants will increase the current xenofob.
It is true that we are talking about millions of people who are in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, who are in precarious camps and who have just begun to leave for Europe.
An estimate says that only 10% have started to leave, winter is hard to pass the Mediterranean, but we expect next year at a wave maybe even higher.
What do we do with these people?
My prognosis is that we'll get used to this problem, we won't look at it as catastrophic from a media point of view.
You were talking about countries with smaller or larger experience.
Does it seem to you that there is somewhere where the integration of large groups from an extra-European culture has really been successful?
I look at the Magrebians in France, the Turks in Germany, they're still enclaved.
I wouldn't go to radical statements.
Of course their integration is more difficult than in other waves of migration, but that doesn't mean they don't integrate at all.
There was an unintegrated part that created major social problems in France, Germany, the UK.
But purely police means won't work.
Let's create the fort Europe is illusory.
We need to look at the integration mechanisms in European societies.
Here were some mistakes.
We need to be more pretentious.
Let's ask these people to learn the language, try to take the values, not to stay one foot in Europe and one foot in their home country, bringing the rest of their family even through convenient marriage.
But the immediate problem of these people must be separated from the long-term problem of their integration.
If others have failed in long-term integration does not mean that we must look at them as they drown in the Mediterranean.
Maybe we have doubts about the quality of the values these people come with.
And if there's going to be an intervention in Syria, which I don't think, it doesn't mean that the country will be restored overnight and you can take them back.
Until solutions appear, we see forts within Europe.
Border controls have been closed, walls are being erected, border controls are being reintroduced in the Schengen area.
Is the European project in danger?
The European project as such does not, the Schengen area as it was built, yes.
It was built quite minimally and arranging the rules so that the pressure was too high in the countries where they set foot for the first time these migrants.
I mean, we're running around free, but everyone's got their own problems.
In front of such a wave can't be so, because some countries don't face it.
When there are such waves of emotion, politicians want to look like they're doing something, but in the long run it doesn't change much.
After the attacks in France we do not have much more drastic anti-terrorist legislation in the EU than we had last year.
It's a wave of public emotion that sets in both directions.
And it's so unstable from week to week that you can't make decisions based on it.
We have a lot of talk, a lot of war statements from politicians at home under pressure to be virile.
And then you have the dramatic case of the child drowning in Turkey and public opinion gets excited.
After public emotion passes, we will return to the reasons why we created this space, this freedom of movement that is not only for people, but also for goods.
This is the real single European market.
And I don't think the Europeans will give up this principle of freedom of movement.
There's gonna be other rules.
Schengen is now like an animal created in another era and not adapted to the situation now.
How has Romania played so far in this crisis?
Like a small country, who thinks that if he pulls the bucket on his eyes and stuffs his ears, the theme disappears.
In front of the reality of migrant waves, you can choose to be part of the solution or say that it's not your small country problem.
That's what we did, it's a legitimate strategy, but then you can't ask to be treated like the seventh country of the EU.
You're not, you're not playing big country level.
The big countries come with solutions for the whole EU, good or bad, we are not discussing their quality now.
Just like Poland did.
On the other hand, the effect of this crisis is that the appetite of the Romans for Schengen will be greatly reduced.
President Iohannis says it might be good that we haven't already entered.
So we move from despair of entry to a more pragmatic position, but the goal remains.
There is of course a risk if Romania and Bulgaria enter Schengen as migrants to see us as an alternative route.
Which does not mean that it is a reason not to enter Schengen, but to be more pragmatic.
Romania will be part of Schengen, and Schengen will exist, but transformed into the sense that external borders will become common responsibility, will be unique rules of acceptance of migrants, unique rules of deportation for those who do not receive asylum, unique rules for countries considered safe.
The Ukrainian president said that after Russia moved its attention to Syria in Ukraine no one died.
Is there a connection between the two outbreaks, a game of Russia?
Russia has a frustrated power behavior.
She believes that being powerful means confusing Americans and Europeans.
From this point of view, yes, there is a connection.
Without the military and financial effort of the Putin regime, the Assad regime would probably have collapsed long ago.
And it was good to collapse before his main opponent was the Islamic State.
Some two years ago it was a struggle between the Assad regime and the moderate secular and Muslim militias, supported by the Gulf and Western countries.
Then the Islamic state rose and now we don't know if we want the Assad regime to fall.
Russia was able to complicate things, but it can't participate in the solution.
It creates an outbreak of instability and chaos that you can't shut down.
But you're great power only if you have solutions.
Playing off-side is just a strategy to win time.
Putin's probably waiting for him to make offers, press the buttons to solve the situation.
The offers don't come because the world isn't convinced that he can solve some sort of thing or other created by him.
But I don't agree with the theories that say these people are handled by an invisible hand.
Let's not see Putin stronger than he is.
What button will appear soon
Millions of Facebook users have become accustomed to the "Like" button, and now the representatives of the social network are preparing another opposite, the "Dislike".
Marti, Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and executive director of the company, announced on the account that this button will be available soon, informs New York Times on the blog.
Zuckerberg said the "Dislike" button would rather show a shade of what a user feels than a simple option.
However, his announcement raised the issue that Facebook might become a less friendly place.
Zuckerberg said he wants to avoid the moments when someone posts on the account or an important event in life, and someone else will give "Dislike".
The users of the network, which has reached 1.5 billion active accounts, have long requested the opportunity to express their negative emotions or empathy with something sad.
Mark Zuckerberg also said that it is not very comfortable for people to give "Like" to current events, such as the refugee crisis, or in the event of a death of a family member.
"You may not feel comfortable giving Like to that post," said Facebook representative.
The option of a new Facebook button was not welcomed by everyone.
"There's already enough hate on Facebook and social networks," Atiq Haneef said in Afghanistan, on the Facebook page of the New York Times, where the article on this topic was posted.
"I'll give 'Dislike' to the 'Dislike' button," he said.
Roger Anderson, a microbiologist from Atlanta, argued that there is nothing wrong with this button, encouraging people to have different opinions on Facebook.
Debra Aho Williamson, social media analyst at eMarketer, said it's hard to imagine that a single button can transmit a complex range of negative emotions.
Moreover, she claims, the campaign is approaching in America, and the "Dislike" button would create a total disaster.
Only 70 refugees entered Hungary in 24 hours
Hungary accepted only 70 migrants on Tuesday, one of the thousands coming into the mass at its southern border with Serbia, government adviser Gyorgy Bakondi announced.
Hungary declared a state of emergency during the day in two counties along the border with Serbia due to the flow of refugees, closing a main border crossing point and announcing that it will build a fence at its border with Romania, recalls DPA.
The measure attracted a sudden reaction from Serbia.
Even yesterday they said they would seal the border for those who want to pass, but not for those who want to seek asylum.
"As you can see, this is totally different," Serbian Minister for Refugees Aleksandar Vulin said.
Prior to the imposition of the new immigration legislation, a record number of 5,809 migrants entered Hungary on Sunday, the police announced on Monday.
More than 170,000 immigrants from the Middle East and Africa also entered Hungary in Serbia in 2015.
Many avoid being registered and try to reach the West, especially Germany.
The "New" seat of the County Council stands to fall.
Two Insolvency Builders
The massive investments made here in recent years, in order to move the institution, are falling due to the fact that they have been stopped several times.
Two major builders who worked here went into insolvency during their work.
The county council seat on Vasile Alecsandri Street will end up falling down by itself.
A year and a half after the work on consolidation and recasting of the building should have been completed, the work did not reach half.
A final stage in the building's epic was consumed in the past days, when the National Dispute Settlement Council (NCSC) rejected a complaint from the company that wanted to take over the technical project's implementation contract for the works that are still to be carried out.
The original project was drawn up by Impex Romcatel SA.
Following the insolvency of the builder and the interruption of the works, the negotiation procedures were initiated without the publication of a notice of participation with Impex Romcatel, the company to update the technical project and then a new tender for the works.
"The negotiations did not, however, end with a contract, CJ appreciating that the proposed form would have disadvantaged the institution," summarized RÄzvan Timofciuc, representing public relations in the CJ.
The CJ decision to discontinue direct negotiations was challenged in court by Impex Romcatel.
The outgoing Court sent the complaint to the CNSC, which rejected it as late.
This does not mean, however, that CJ can start looking for another designer.
Impex Romcatel has the possibility to attack the CNSC decision in the Court of Appeal, only after a final sentence of it being able to take into account the finding of another designer.
Thus, work on building consolidation could be resumed as soon as possible next year.
Our intention is to resume work as soon as possible.
In principle, the refurbishment of the technical project should not take long, but we must reach the conclusion of a contract.
"We're waiting to see if the CNSC decision will be attacked or not," Timofciuc said.
The consolidation work of the former police headquarters began in 2011.
A first contract of employment was terminated in April 2012, after work of 4.5 million lei had been carried out.
The auction was resumed and the contract was awarded by Moldoconstruct SA.
However, the firm went into insolvency, and this contract was terminated, after payments of 1.5 million lei had been made.
The work has so far been carried out in a proportion of about 50%.
Initially, work on consolidation, recasting and attenuation of the building had been estimated at 7.7 million lei.
"Cata, I'm saying everything!" - the statement that could incriminate the former head of the cadastre
One of the employees involved in the scandalous file at the Cadastre Office signed a fact-finding agreement against delayed imprisonment.
Most likely, his statements will incriminate the other defendants, in front of former chief Narciza Nedelcu
A consultant at the Office of Home Affairs and Publicity (OCPI) is accused of DNA in a corruption file recognized his telefap.
The agreement on the recognition of the facts signed by Dumitru Dasselu was registered yesterday at the IaÈi Tribunal, the judges establishing a solution in this case on 29 September.
Dumitru Daniel Dasselu was accused of intellectual false in continuous form and agreed to execute two years in prison with delay, as well as work for the community.
As regards the charges against Dasselu, the prosecutors stated that he, as adviser to the Office of the Cadastru, together with other colleagues, "failed several minutes of acceptance, by selling the contracts of services previously keyed by the O.C.P.I. IaÈi with the directors of the SC Gauss SRL, SC Grupo Five SRL, SC Topo Euro Cad SRL, SC Agency of Ca dastru and Topography SRL and PFA LipÅa Stefan, which did not really prove that the contracted services were carried out in full, under the conditions that they were not performed and were not submitted to the O.C.P.I. Iasi".
The previous days, the former head of the Office, Narciza Nedelcu, but also other former or current OCPI employees were brought to justice in this case, the charges being the settlement of services to the above-mentioned companies, although the works have not been carried out.
Prejudice exceeds 300,000 lei.
Adventures in the Stone Age
In the opinion of FRH president Alexandru Dedu, Romania can host a major handball competition only in 2024, and the preparation of the national women's handball for qualification at the Olympic Games costs a fortune.
The President of the Romanian Handbal Federation, Alexandru Dedu, said yesterday at a press meeting that it is a great pride that our country has three teams in the Champions League groups.
As for Romania's national women's handball team, "the main goal is to qualify for the Rio Olympics, but for that it must go through two stages of caudin forks, first the World Championship and second the pre-qualification tournament," said Dedu.
We really want to qualify for the Olympic Games.
There are some fantastic requirements from the technical staff led by Tomas Ryde.
The staff will be composed of seven or eight persons.
He wants second coach, doctor, two masseurs, coach of porters, physical trainer, head of delegation.
They asked us to get some qualification stuff, specifically material for physical training, which I've never heard of.
That's all to get to the Olympic Games. And I'll do whatever it takes of me to have them.
We're talking about a massive investment, there's a lot, a lot of money.
But this is the way to make performance.
Because right now we're in the stone age with the preparation.
"The teams we've been fighting with have these materials and they've had them for some time," said Dedu, who mentioned that he's trying to get the sums needed to purchase these products from MTS and COSR.
The FRH president also referred to the infrastructure in Romania and the possibility of our country hosting a major handball competition.
We don't have a hall in Bucharest.
It is a problem of infrastructure and it is shameful to be questioned by a European Gymnastics Championship.
Let's not forget that in other corners of the world, whole Olympic districts were built within two years.
Before 1992, in the current Olympic area of Barcelona there was a garbage dump, and now it has reached a mark of beauty.
The same happened in London, where the 2012 Olympics were a success in terms of investment.
"In my vision, in 2024 we can host a major competition," said Dedu.
He added that international handball organisations are willing to give Romania the organisation of a major competition.
For me, it's a priority to bring major handball competitions to Romania.
Mr. GaÈu went civilized with a project, people gave their consent in principle, but they made it very quickly clear that the hall would never be built.
And I had discussions with EHF, I told them we wanted, that we were able to organize and they said they agreed and invite them to the first game in the new hall in Bucharest and then we talked concretely.
"So we have all the opening, and at EHF and IHF, but we have no infrastructure," the FRH official explained.
The former great handbalist avoided to evaluate the chances of the female teams CSM Bucharest and HCM Baia Mare to reach the Final Four: "I have asked all coaches to be reserved in predictions, that if they do not fulfill they will turn against them".
Good road to the World Cup
Romanian Rugbiists debut on 23 September, against France
The captain of the national rugby team, Mihai Macovei, said on Tuesday, in a press conference, that all members of the Romanian lot are ready for the World Cup matches in England, where they hope to win two wins: "We are ready".
Both I and my colleagues are with the engines at maximum speed.
We've trained to do our best in the four games.
Everyone will have great expectations, because our goal is to win in two games, against Canada and Italy.
All the groups are heavy and ours is the same.
Let's take it easy, first with France and then we'll see.
But surely, if we win with Canada, the match with Italy will be our final.
I can't describe in words the joy of participating in the World Cup, it's the gathering of so many years of work.
I wish I could not disappoint anyone in the family of rugby and come home with beautiful results.
"We want you to be proud that some players, a small family like rugby in Romania, proudly represent the tricolor," Macovei said.
The Romanian national team's selection, Lynn Howells, who has first experience as a coach at the World Cup, hopes to make Romanians proud of the rugby selection: "It is a great honor for us to participate in this World Cup".
I'm sure the players are ready to take part in the tournament.
It's an extraordinary experience for me.
It's very important to me that every game makes Romanians proud of the national team.
The President of the Romanian Rugby Federation, Haralambie DumitraÈ, is confident that Romanian players can confirm the progress made in rugby in recent years.
We have a very difficult group and we want to confirm the progress made on the national team.
I wish athletes success and I believe that we will be at the height of the event.
"These boys started playing in Romania's teams at 18-19, so there's cohesion, it's a gang of friends, who set out to realize a dream," Dumitras said.
At the World Rugby Cup in England, Romania will evolve into Group D, having scheduled the following matches: with France on 23 September in London; with Ireland on 27 September in London; with Canada on 6 October in Leicester; with Italy on 11 October in Exeter.
The competition begins on Friday, at Twickenham Stadium in London, with the England-Fiji match in group A.
New Japanese culture courses organized at the University "Al.I. Cuza"

"Interested people will be able to learn how to realize harmonious floral sculptural creations (ikebana), how to surprise the soul of the surrounding elements in plastic compositions using Japanese art of painting in the cough (Sumie) or how to express their own individuality and creativity through the multi-purpose universe of beautiful arts (graphic, drawing, painting)", said Sorin Mazilu, the teacher of these courses.
Courses are aimed at all those who are passionate about art, regardless of age or experience.
Registration takes place until September 30th, and those who wish to ask for more information can do so at the phone number: 0742.027.153 or at the e-mail address: estudiantecultura@gmail.com.
14 million lei given to St. Spiridon Hospital in IaÈi to the budget correction
What will be purchased with this important amount of money?
The Hospital "St. Spiridon" received approximately 14 million lei from the Ministry of Health following the budgetary correction.
The money that the medical unit has received to use until the end of the year will be invested in works of modernization and design of clinics, but also in medical equipment and technique for which the hospital has already started the public procurement procedure.
Thus, the health unit will be equipped with a new tomograph computer, a new radiology apparatus, six surgical kits, six beds of appropriately equipped ITAs, eye microscopes and other equipment necessary to perform the medical act.
On the other hand, 5 million lei of the money received from the hospital will be directed to the construction and construction works of "Grand Ars".
From the money from the budget correction, UPU will receive 500,000 lei to complete the modernization work in the main section.
"In addition, the following days we will make the reception of works from the bridge linking UPU to cardiology, hepatology and gastroenterology clinics to ensure the proper transport of the patient from UPU to nearby clinics," the medical unit manager explained.
The hospital will soon have in the yard and the Dermatology Clinic in TarÄraÅi, which it will organize in the outpatient clinic, in the same form as it currently works.
The clinic will operate in the area of allergy, haematology and endocrinology in the outpatient clinic and will have about 30 beds.
IaÅ, mocked by RATP controllers and a flyer.
Hobbies of a tourist
A family of tourists from Cluj came to Iasi to visit him, but the trip ended with a bitter promise.
After my experience, neither I nor my wife ever want to go to your town again.
Without wanting to, they hit the wrong information in the flyers, the RAPT controllers' nonsense and, bonus, a fine "that's what the law says".
The husbands arrived in Iasi a few days ago, stayed in a hotel in the Center and asked for tourist leaflets.
They also received a flyer in which the RATP routes were passed.
"Armed" with these maps, the husbands visited Iash.
But two days ago, in the Copou, they wanted to get to Palas Mall.
Because there was no ton of tickets in the station near Copou Park, they were based on the information printed on the flyer: that they can take the ticket by SMS.
No one has told them that this service no longer exists.
Trusted in the flyer, they got on a bus and tried to text after the instructions on the flyer.
Unfortunately for them, a team of RATP controllers has appeared.
They said there's been no more service for two years and that they've announced in the press that it's been canceled.
Where do I know what was written in the local press, me coming one night before visiting the city?
I talked to the controllers, explained the situation to them, said they don't care, it's none of their business.
The attitude was very challenging.
They said all I can do is give us one fine instead of two (my wife and wife).
"I paid, I didn't want to ruin my day visiting stand at the gendarmerie and giving statements there!" Ovidiu says.
In conclusion, the family was fined because of erroneous information on the leaflet and the controllers who "applyed the law to blood".
It's not fair, and I made a referral to RATP Iasi to get my money back.
It's not about money, I'm not overcrowded, but the point is, I felt wrong.
Ghinion for the Vaslui rapists.
They had an accident and stayed in pre-trial detention.
The trial of the seven rapists at Vaslui moved from yesterday to the Court of Appeal Iasi.
The outgoing judges tried the first term of trial in a non-public meeting in which the seven young men accused of mocking an 18-year-old girl asked to be released.
Prior to the actual commencement of the trial, one of the outgoing judges to whom the file had been distributed, Viorel Munteanu, filed an application for abstention, which was admitted by his colleagues at the court.
The judge activated until this summer at the Vaslui Tribunal, where he was the president of the Chamber of Justice, he being the one who, on 9 April, admitted a challenge made by four of the defendants, ordering their placement in detention at home.
Currently, the file is judged by a complete part of which are the teachers Maricica Mititelu and Geta Sandu.
Previously, in the case file, Judge Dan An Ton formulated an abstention, on the grounds that his daughter is in a concubine relationship with one of the rape lawyers.
The two judges decided that the Vaslui rapists would remain in pre-trial detention.
The blacks will remain incarcerated for at least another 30 days, when judges will re-disclose the possibility of their release.
The next term of the trial will be held at the IaÈi Court of Appeal on 6 October.
Before arriving at the Court of Appeal IaÈi, the van with which the rapists were transported from Vaslui was involved in an accident in the district of PÄcurari, the car entering IaÈi on the belt.
The Iveco self-utility with which the seven rapists were being transported hit a Volks wagen car that had come out of Canta Road, and the driver tried to turn left.
The van is circling towards the end of PÄcurari.
The car entered IaÈi here because the employees of the Prison Administration preferred the route from Vaslui to IaÈi to Grajduri, then on the belt road.
They have thus shortened the road by a few kilometers.
Immediately after impact, the escort of the arrested called for another transport to take over the prisoners.
In a short time, a car was sent to the accident site from the Iasi Maximum Security Penitentiary, which took over the seven prisoners and transported them to the Court of Appeal.
As a result of the accident, none of the arrested were injured.
To transfer them to the other van, the guards surrounded the back of the cars, and the arrests came out at speed, two by two.
"The incident has not been reported to the police, because drivers of cars have amicably understood the damage to be paid," said Chief Commissioner MÄdÄlin ÈÄranu of the IPJ.
Major migration
Romania is not and will not be prepared for what will follow.
What about Europe?
I say this from the beginning, clearly and clearly: the 7000 refugees that Romania should and should naturalise represent, in itself, a small but huge number compared to the Romanian state's ability to manage such a project.
For Romania, even the voluntary share proposed by Bucharest, in the amount of about 1500 souls, far exceeds the good intentions of solidarity with the European Union expressed in recent months.
Certainly, if those migrants will actually agree to settle in our localities, the chances of integrating them quickly into Romanian society are extraordinaryly small.
I'm sure they'll be the first to lose their patience.
Paralyzed by interlopes and paralyzed by a venal political class, the Romanian state proves powerless in all areas.
The inability to integrate gypsies is just a trivial example.
In addition, governments of any color were unable to absorb European funds, to make roads, kindergartens or modern schools, to provide decent health care, to gather dirt on the street, to create honorable paid jobs or to keep their own young generation at home.
Why would refugees settle in another country they're fleeing from?
But what produces much wonder is especially the hypocrisy with which such a crisis is treated.
First of all, we are struck by the belligerent actions of the strong EU states, which show the utmost generosity when it comes to sharing troubles with smaller countries.
Then comes the fearful hypocrisy of Romanians who, although they have millions of relatives scattered all over the world, still do not accept the other - from another language, from another religion, from another blood.
Probably afraid not to steal anyone's national being.
Finally, there is also a hypocrisy of many migrants, who, while invoking only the horrors of war as a reason for departure, accept no other destination than Germany or the Nordic countries.
Well, not all refugees are Syrians, and in Pakistan there is no war.
Also, the simple way in which the crisis is analysed can only be taken for granted.
Causes need to be eliminated, they support some and, by placing strict emphasis on the book of political correctness, they call for peace and investment for the countries of origin of migrants.
But in Romania there is peace and sometimes there is some foreign capital in the national economy - but that does not prevent tens of thousands of Romanians from leaving their country every year.
Why is he leaving?
In this crisis, the European Union has revealed itself to us as an annihilated, undisturbed and outmoded construction.
I was sorry that Romania is not able to invent a country project, but here is no future plan for the EU either.
And improvisations and threats don't help anything.
Then what else does the EU use, if the only advantage Romanians enjoyed - the right to free movement - could be called into question because of waves of refugees crossing borders like cheese?
At some point, the war in Syria will end.
Not the migrant crisis, though.
Over the next decades, overpopulation, poverty, climate change, resource depletion, etc. will push millions of desperate migrants from Asia and especially from Africa to a better life.
With such politicians, Romania is not and will never be prepared for what will follow.
7,000 euros a year to rent the Pogor Club.
Destination, practically imposed
The concession contract shall cover a period of 10 years.
After 7 years in which he remained in prison, the club in the Romanian Literary Museum Court is offered by the County Council for a 10-year concession.
The construction has a useful surface of 134 square meters, on two levels of hoses.
CJ accepts only literary cafÃ©s, bookshops or other activities with a cultural profile as the purpose of the building.
The building was valued at 68,300 euros, the starting value of the bid being 6,830 euros per year, with a bidding step of 25 euros.
The concessionaire shall continuously and continuously operate the building and fully cover the costs of rehabilitating the building, in accordance with the technical design to be developed.
"The Club Pogor building is in an advanced state of degradation due to the fact that during the period when the public power plant was operated in these spaces and not even after its evacuation, no current repair and maintenance work was carried out as is currently required during the operation of a building", is mentioned in the documentation relating to the tender procedure.
The club's concession offers are expected until September 18.
Two brothers in TomeÈti swallowed sleeping pills.
They were taken to the hospital.
Two 9-year-olds and 11-year-olds in TomeÈti, brothers, swallowed several Diazepam pills.
They found the pills in the house and took them out of curiosity.
Their mother was being treated, and the drugs weren't hidden.
The children were rushed to the "Holy Mary" hospital in Iasi.
They're stable, as the doctors say.
EXCLUSIVE: A meeting that breaks your heart.
At the age of 20 he received a brave gift: biological parents
Lost in the hospital in unclear conditions, in the dark of the '90s, when she had only two months of life, small, sick and helpless, and then adopted by a family established in Italy, in the same years when the adoption was vaguely regulated, a young girl, now a blonde and beautiful girl, met again yesterday in Iasi with biological parents from a village of the county, after almost two decades in which no one knew anything about the others.
Crina will fulfill these 20 years, and her adoptive parents in Palermo thought to offer their beloved daughter an amazing and courageous gift: a visit to Romania, to Iasi, to get to know their unclear past.
"The Day of Iasi", which witnessed the search for the family of origin after some extremely vague clues, witnessed these meetings that practically broke your heart.
Reporting reporters, emotions of the moments, statements by those involved, their reactions are rightly moving and overwhelming.
The story of Crina begins 20 years ago in the town of Ruginoasa, when it was only two months old.
Then, because of a health problem, the girl had to be hospitalized in the hospital, in the city.
There began to be misunderstandings between parents at home, and mother had to leave home.
He decided to keep the girl and send me home.
He stopped the girl, and I haven't heard anything since.
"When I found out he was in the hospital, it was too late," recalls Alina, the girl's biological mother.
Crina was admitted with her grandmother to the municipal hospital in the Pacific, and then the daughter's father, Costica Balkan, went to work in Alexandria, Teleorman County.
Their lives would be broken up forever.
They haven't found Crina in the hospital.
After internment, Crina's father went to work in another locality, and returned after six months.
Meanwhile, the girl was transferred to the hospital in Iasi, and the father, when he returned, never found her again.
I think it's been almost nine months since the girl was in the hospital.
"She must have thought she was abandoned," a granddaughter of the family tells.
Because of the financial problems, Grandma couldn't come with Crina to Iasi, and the girl remained in the care of the doctors.
Because no one has been interested in the child's fate this whole time, it was taken over by the Directorate General for Social Assistance and Child Protection Iasi, who then gave it to the placement center in Bucium.
There were years when abandonment and adoption were more regulated than today in Romania.
At the Bucium Center was found by the Italian Salvadore and his wife, a couple from Palermo who wanted to have their child but failed.
They fell in love with the blonde Crina, and after a while she was going to move with them permanently to Italy.
The little girl had already done almost two years, while the adoption procedures lasted.
When I saw Crina, I felt she was our girl.
"As if my wife had given her life," she tells us smiling Salvadore, the foster father, while catching in his hand the girl's brotherly hand.
In the country, Crina's parents, Alina and Costica, continued separate searches, each on which he could.
The father asked the authorities in Ruginosa, but received no answer where his child might be.
The police then sent her that she might be killed, but at Iasi's parents found out what really happened to their daughter.
When I looked for her here, they told me at the courthouse that she was gone to Italy, to Palermo.
And I haven't had the conditions to look for it before.
We prayed to God to be well.
I've thought about her in all the years that have passed, but there were no possibilities to walk, to find her.
"It's hard," she tells us with tears in the eyes of Crine's biological mother.
But even though the years have passed, the parents of the Ruginoosa have not been forgotten.
In Italy, Salvadore and his wife explained to the girl where she came from and that her past ties her with Romania.
I was little when I found out.
I think I was five or six.
I reacted like a child, I was curious.
"I wanted to meet my parents in Romania," Crina says.
And her dream was going to come true.
In March of this year, Chief Commissioner Romica Ichim, the Director of the Regional Centre for Prevention, Evaluation and Counselling of Drugs IaÈi, was contacted by an acquaintance from Italy, who explained Salvadore's desire to find the biological family of Crina.
And the search only started from a name.
After the request we had from our partners in Italy, we started the first steps.
We only got one name, the Coast Balkan, then the town, Rugious.
Soon I had an activity with the city hall there, and I could ask if there was a local name received.
Then they gave me some directions, only the person they found wasn't the one they were looking for.
"It took about a month to find the girl's biological father," explains Chief Ichim.
In total, more than three months took the authorities to find Costica and Alina, especially that each had their domicile in another locality.
We started work somewhere in March, and in June-July we completed the identification of biological parents and discussions.
"Then we decided that a first meeting would take place in September," Ichim added.
On the weekend that passed, Alina and Costica first saw their daughter lost in the halls of the hospital in Iasi 20 years ago.
The father, excitedly, could barely control his tears, and his hands were trembling.
He's barely exchanging a few words with the people around him.
A week before the meeting, he couldn't sleep much longer.
He was all excited, he was shaking.
"To see your baby after all these years, there's something," says a niece, who came along with Costica from Ruginoosa.
Crina's meeting with mother and biological brother
In discussions with his daughter, who is to study at a well-listed university in Italy, Costica Balkan told him, among other things, that if he ever wants to return to him, in the village, to come quietly: he can give him something sheep, goats, to find a boy from the village and to bury a household.
Mom's excited, she's crying, and she hardly thinks that something like that can happen to her.
I'm very excited.
I didn't think that could happen.
I've seen such cases on TV, I've been thinking about these years, I've been hoping, but I didn't think I could be like that.
They're very emotional.
If he could forgive me.
I hope to visit you in the future.
"I hope we can keep a link," she says with great tears on Alina's cheeks, Crine's mother, while holding a napkin in her hand.
In him she hides her tears, happy, because soon she will see her face after so much bitterness.
On the other hand, Crina, who will only be in a few days, this month, 20 years, is trying to calm down like an emotional child.
She doesn't know what to expect, but she sketched a vague idea about her biological parents.
He thinks they're young, but now before the meeting he's trying to gather his thoughts, because he has a lot to say, but nothing to reproach.
My parents are two mothers and two fathers.
But my parents are eventually the ones who raised me.
It'll be a beautiful meeting, a wonderful experience.
"I hope to have a beautiful memory with them, because now there are so many things to say," Crina confesses.
First family reunion in IaÈi
In Unirii Square, under the sky of the early autumn, the Ruginosa family once again unites their destiny with their daughter in Palermo.
Crina is 20 years old, finishing high school, according to the Italian school model, but can start a new chapter with Alina and Costica, her biological parents.
I don't divide borders or countries anymore, but just a barrier: the one of the language.
Over who, with the help of a translator, an Italian local owner in the center of IaÅ, passed easily.
Those who have managed to make this meeting possible say that it is the first event of this kind done, and that in the future, if the opportunity arises again, they will do so.
It's the first event of this kind organized, such an emotional load, and I'm glad to be successful.
We at the Center have different activities, and most of the time we are associated as an institution that only deals with people who are addicted to drugs.
But we're trying to make societies something good back.
"If I am ever asked for such an event, I will do it with great love," says Romica Ichim, director of the Regional Centre for Drug Prevention, Evaluation and Counselling Iasi.
Behind him, the Balkans, with Crina in the middle, walk away telling stories.
I understand: they have a lot to say to each other.
Armistice weapons to the foot yesterday at PSD.
Everybody pulls their soul
The camps in the PSD's outgoing branch have closed a truce with a weapon on their feet.
After successive rounds of talks, held from Friday to Sunday, the first being the most tense, the PSD leaders agreed to temporarily suspend hostilities.
Pressed by the party's executive president, Liviu Dragnea, to present a united position, the outgoing Social Democrats will send him a full list of potential candidates to the party's functions.
Far from being over, the party's internal war seems to have only taken a break to allow the fighters to draw their souls.
The Dragon didn't give an ultimatum.
It has released a very simple and very current message under the conditions of now: try to find a solution to not endanger the party.
On October 3rd, we have elections in the party.
All functions will be made available to those who want them.
"Until then, we remain in the existing structure," said interim mayor Mihai Chirica.
The two days of the weekend talks only led to the conclusion that nothing certain was established.
In the October elections, strong competition is expected for the office of president of PSD's county branch.
On the short list of potential candidates for the main position of the party's outgoing branch is State Secretary Maricel Popa, Senator Florin Constantinescu, Senator Sorin Lazarus, Councillor Vasile Catea and interim President of the County Council, Victorel Lupu.
The mayor of Schitu Duca, Mihai Mihalache, could also be added to these.
One option is also the candidacy of the leader of the PSD county councillors, Cristian Stanciu, if Lupu no longer joins the race, sources from the party claiming that he is not interested in the function.
The only name that has not been mentioned by any of the participants in the negotiations in recent days is that of the former leader of the branch, Mayor Gheorghe Nichita.
The list of candidates is open.
According to the statute, even on election day candidates can be submitted, and no one would be surprised if it happened.
"It is important that we remain united, and we will remain even after October 3rd, when we have a new Executive Office, a new Permanent County Office and all new management structures," he said.
Until the organization of the internal elections, the management of PSD's county branch will be ensured by Victorel Lupu, a close friend of Nichita and Stanciu.
However, Lupu is on leave until 29 September, with the preparation of the elections being practically ensured by the executive secretary of the branch, county councillor Mihail Popescu, who is in close contact with Nichita camp.
Contacted by telephone, Cristian Stanciu appreciated the discussions over the last few days as leading to "partial consensus".
There is wide availability to maintain balance and unity in the party.
A partial consensus was reached to support a unitary team to deal with the county.
"However, on the other hand, there are several variations regarding the intentions related to the candidacy to the presidency of PSD Iasi, the list remaining open," Stanciu said.
A Jesuit judge refused the Vaslui rapists' file on the grounds of concubineship
The seven young men in Vaslui County convicted of rape arrive today at the Court of Appeal Iasi.
Vasluians sentenced to punishment between five years and eight months and eight years and four months will present their arguments today regarding their release, after the trial court, Vasu's Court, decided to imprison them immediately after the sentence was handed down.
The file was registered at the Court of Appeal at the end of last week, with Judge Dan Anton making an application for abstention, admitted by his colleagues.
Anton invoked that one of the defendants' lawyers, lawyer Bogdan Luca, is his daughter's concubine, lawyer Dana Anton.
Luke defends Silviu Ovidiu Burada, the one who received the greatest punishment in this file.
How Judges Motivated the Sentence
At the end of last week, the judge at Vasu's court who sentenced the seven young men motivated the sentence.
In his explanatory statement, the judge talks about the defiant reaction of the defendants, but also of those who supported them, stating that such attitudes create a strong sense of outrage among the public.
"The court finds that, after placing under preventive measure of judicial control, a restrictive measure of freedom but not deprivation of liberty, under the impact of the attitude of the defendants, their families and their local supporters, there was a strong feeling of indignation at the level of the local and national community that people accused of serious acts are being tried under a less restrictive measure", is indicated in Vasu's court's reasoning.
The magistrates also disassembled the main defence of the seven defendants who during the trial invoked that the girl they raped would not be "the church door".
"The Court points out that the moral quality of the injured person is irrelevant, an aspect that the defendants wanted to highlight through their defences, since a person's physical and sexual freedom cannot be violated under any pretext", it is further stated in the statement of reasons.
Corbyn, Brexit and Europe's future
From economic and demographic causes, the prosperity they have enjoyed in the last decades can no longer continue the same in the coming years.
By Saturday, probably few people in Romania knew who Jeremy Corbyn was.
Even today, after he became the new leader of the Labour Party in the UK, many wonder to what extent we can affect the election of a politician who, after all, is not in a decision-making position.
Jeremy Corbyn is the most radical leftist leader of post-war laborers.
Marxist declared, anti-monarchist (at one point asked Tony Blair, then prime minister, to take the royal family out of Buckingam Palace), a ferocious anti-American and a sympathizer of Vladimir Putin (he was also regularly invited to comment on political events by the television channel "Russia Today"), and of the Hizbollah and Hamas terrorist movements, he wants Britain to give up nuclear weapons and get out of NATO and the EU.
For Corbyn, who at the time considered the killing of Osama bin Laden as a real tragedy, ISIS is close to preferring the United States.
According to the model of all populist demagogues, Corbyn has, of course, miraculous anti-austerity solutions.
Things like what he said and promised and Tsipras in Greece until the moment he gave his heart to the real world and economic laws.
The economic programme of the new Labour leader provides, among other things, massive renationalisation and printing of money as a solution for financing projects for the development and coverage of very generous social benefits.
Of course, some might wonder why the solution with the printing of money is not unanimously adopted on the world, we would then have a global overall prosperity!, but who can prevent such details.
Of course, we can tax the bankers' blood, become some kind of service enemy of the left, but from what has been seen so many times in the past, not only in the former communist states or in Ecuador or Venezuela, but also in France, at the beginning of the mandates of Mitterrand and Hollande.
The additional amounts are quickly swallowed by generous, uncovered promises made by populist demagogues.
As Margaret Thatcher rightly pointed out, "the problem of socialism is that at some point other people's money ends".
Few give Jeremy Corbyn a real chance to ever become Prime Minister.
At the beginning of the 1980s another radical left-wing leader, Michael Foot, who was not as extreme in his beliefs as the party's fresh leader, failed lamentably in the elections.
And then there is still a working class in the UK, in the classic sense of the word, relatively consistent and structured.
And the unions were more sensitive than they are now.
Under the new industrial landscape, where services are dominant across the labour force, and expanded automation has led to a massive need for a highly skilled workforce in the industry, Corbyn's rhetoric has a limited appeal.
But even from the opposite, he can influence important developments that can directly affect us.
In its latest Financial Times issue, Corbyn's election increases Brexit's chances of exiting Britain from the EU.
The new Labour leader was a consistent opponent of the country's membership in the Union.
In the eyes of the radical left, Brussels is the agent of international capitalism and a promoter of globalisation that has imposed austerity on the poor.
When you combine this kind of ideas with those expressed by the radical right, with rhetorical anti-immigration and look at the crisis of refugees shaking from the EU's roots you get to an explosive mix.
And not just for Britain.
But if the British decide following the referendum, which will take place until 2017, to leave the Union's symbolic loss of capital for the entire European project and the deep bankruptcies created within it by the Euro crisis and now that of the refugees, between North and South, between East and West, leaves room for the most worrying scenarios.
All the more so as for a whole series of Member States, London was a counterweight to the Franco-German axis (in which Berlin became increasingly the dominant actor anyway).
True, the British business environment, the City, are strong advocates of staying in the EU.
But today's Europe is no longer the one of the past.
There are many resentments, which are growing in intensity even these weeks.
The problem is that Brussels, I had a sample recently in Jean Clude Junker's speech, is increasingly tending to make major decisions over the head of the vast majority of Member States by consulting with only a few European powers, mainly with Germany.
And this happens under the conditions where electoral support for anti-systemic, anti-immigration groups that are at the same time Eurosceptic increases spectacularly across the continent.
In other words, the emotional climate with negative load has reached higher odds than ever in the past.
From where and the conclusion that Financial Times draws when assessing Brexit's chances.
The pro-EU option is based on a cold calculation that departs from the national interest.
If voters make a decision on the brain, then Britain will remain in the EU.
But Corbyn's victory reminds us of the power of emotion in today's politics.
However, Eastern Europe can be significantly affected by such major developments.
Especially if, as is expected, we see a more pronounced integration of the Euro area, which will push most of the states in the region and the periphery of interest and that of the decision-making process in Europe.
Corbyn, Tsipras and Syriza in Greece, Podemos in Spain, even Bernie Sanders in the United States feed their populist rhetoric from the frustrations accumulated in casual societies.
From economic and demographic causes, the prosperity enjoyed in the last decades, the generous social benefits, can no longer continue the same in the coming years.
Under the explosive pressure of the dual crisis, the Euro-immigration zone, both caused by hasty decisions that have taken into account only the integrated political ambitions, not the ability and willingness of the peoples and governments of Europe to respond to such challenges, the turbulence on the continent, the internal tensions in the EU will increase in intensity and can further affect the situation of Romania.
And it's hard to rule out anything from the point of view of possible scenarios.
The question is whether our main political leaders are able to cope with such complicated situations.
Constantin Brancusi, the peasant god.
Rockefeller: "How can I help you?"
Cheeses: "Take and sweep the workshop!"
The great sculptor had a great dream: to be someone, to become famous, to hear about him throughout the world.
Behind his fame, however, is something almost forgotten today, when millions of success stories are delivered to us, recipes for success in life.
That something has a name.
It's called "stupid."
What do you write about Constantin Brancusi?
What else is there to say, actually?
His figure appeared on the bills.
And recently, a well-known bank in Romania hired an actor to play it in an ad clip.
Cheeses produce and deliver money almost 60 years after it's gone.
In Romania, there are hundreds of streets and boulevards that bear its name.
Moreover, even the author of this text lives on one of these streets.
And when he comes out with a drasla, he hears the following instructions: "Let's go to the park, to BrancuÈi".
The country is surrounded by its statues.
There are few Romanian personalities whose works are known by so many people, from children, to the elderly.
BrÃ¢ncuÈi's infiltration capacity is a huge one.
Nor did the communists manage to extract it from Romania's memory and culture.
Its cities today propagate the Internet, receiving hundreds of thousands of likes and shares.
And then again, what else would you say, writing about this man?
Look at the pile of books and articles trying to reconstruct his destiny, BrÃ¢ncuÈi's life seems almost fantastic, totally unlikely.
You know, there are those people who tell you that, if you haven't had the luck to be born in a big city and into a family as well as strengthened, your chances of success in life are almost nil.
BrancuÈi's life is the perfect counterexample.
And maybe here would be a key.
Maybe the next text should start from here.
With a sentence, however detestable they are.
Here's the stupid success stories, which are delivered to you daily in the newspapers and on TV.
Look carefully at this man's figure.
Do you want to know how he managed to live, how, today, he heard an entire world?
It's simple.
He's worked his whole life to be someone.
That's what he did.
Constantin BrÃ¢ncuÈi was born on February 19, 1876, in HobiÈa, a small village in PeÈtiÈani commune, Gorj County, at the foot of the Carpathians.
He is the fifth child of Marie and Radu Nicolae BrÃ¢ncuÅi.
Although he came from a wealthy peasant family, BrÃ¢ncuÈi led a modest life, but one of whom would pick up the landmarks that would guide his late artistic vision.
Remembering his childhood and the places he grew up, the artist had to confess, in a meeting with Petre Tutea, from Paris, in 1933: "At that time life was beautiful and harmonious".
For millennia, people were leading, happy, a patriarchal life.
Everything went smoothly from one season to the next.
And do you know why things have changed?
The civilization of the great city has reached us.
BrÃ¢ncuÅi's childhood was, however, far from an idyllic one.
One of the moments spent in these early years of life is extremely suggestive for the combination of purity and violence that have characterized the future sculptor of the years spent in the hometown.
The moment is reproduced in the work "BrÃ¢ncuÅi. A biography", written by Alexandru Buican.
In 1879, Constantin BrÃ¢ncuÈi was 3 years old.
In the autumn of that year, when the storm was made "at the boiler", chasing those who tasted the liquid to see if the process was proceeding properly, BrÃ¢ncuÈi caught a moment of general non-attention.
He fills his palms with tunic and drinks on the breathless.
It falls into sleep almost instantly.
The first people only notice after a few minutes.
Mother panics, then hysteria, thinking her son died.
Towards the evening, when the father, Radu, returns from the life accompanied by lauters, he sees from the distance the desperate signs of those who wait for him with their soul to mouth.
The party will immediately turn into a jam.
Father is already thinking of burial.
However, someone thinks it's good to call Baba BrandÃ£Åa, doftoroaie and servants of the BrÃ¢ncui.
The bracelet checks the child's breath, then puts under his nose the horse's balega, gathered around.
The child sneezes strongly.
The world applauds.
While the boy is allowed to sleep his drunken, joyfully, party with cobblestones continues with even more force.
The next day, the father and son meet by livada.
Radu BrÃ¢ncuÈi has Constantine gather the clouds and bring them to him.
The father settles his child upside down and, with the clouds brought by the boy, beats him to remember.
And while feeling the sting of the blows, the little BrancuÈi has the revelation that the world can be looked at from another perspective and that things around it can be turned upside down.
Especially the position of the sun, different from the well-known, makes him wonder, as he would recognize in old age, if not the star himself participated in his disorder.
Had the sun been as troubled as his father by what had happened to him?.
At the present time, the city does not work
A parliamentarian appeals to politicians to remember those who voted for them.
Independent deputy Viorel BlÄjuÈ called on PSD and PNL to stop internal fighting and refocus their agenda on the electorate.
What we see now on our political scene is a great divide and so much.
I haven't seen anything of the USL projects in 2012 that goes on.
No highway, no Regional Emergency Hospital, you see just how politicians argue about possible locations depending on real estate interests.
Let's leave a little politics aside, get together and talk.
At this time, the city doesn't work.
"If you're busy with the internal war, you don't have time for those who chose you," said BlÄjuÈ.
He appreciated that the current political class had disappointed the Yemeni electorate, resulting in a very small presence in the upcoming local elections, around 30%, representing practically the faithful electorate of the parties.
He also believes that the voters will be all about the traditional parties, expressing their reservations about new political initiatives, such as the "For Iasi" party that will be launched today.
Local parties have very small chances and will only break out of the right-wing electorate, not the PSD.
Such parties are based on civic active people, who are usually on the right.
"It crumbles even more right, which is not good for anyone, not even for PSD," said Blur.
He stated that he was not interested in a candidate for the upcoming local elections, disproving rumors about his intention to join the race for the City Hall.
I also said I don't want to run for any local office.
I'm still thinking about whether to continue as a Member of Parliament in the future term of office.
I tried to appeal to the unit for Iasi and in the talks in the lobby with the other parliamentarians, and I was accused of wanting to make an image.
I don't want to, but we can't go on like this anymore.
"If people have voted for us, it doesn't mean they're stupid to vote for us if they don't see anything," said BlÄjuÅ£, who appreciated that the main reason why the electorate is no longer interested in politics is the hypocrisy of the elected people.
A coworker from TartÄrÄÅi said he didn't get his money and he has to go by bus.
Let's not be hypocrites.
There's little money.
Sometimes I'm ashamed to pick up money from the cash register.
At the end of my term of office, I'll report on everything I've spent, other than the salaries of the cabinet employees and their maintenance.
It happened to pick up in a month and 30,000 lei, with all transport, accommodation and other bills.
"To tell a parliamentarian that his money isn't enough is pure hypocrisy," BlÄjuÈ concluded.
