What's going to happen? CSSD knows neither Voldemort nor pastry in Prague.
New CSSD elected officials at the capital's city hall will apparently have to overcome a real language barrier to understand themselves at the municipal council level with their former and new ODS colleagues.
The daily Actualne.cz has "tested" the new members of the municipal council belonging to CSSD, namely whether they know the argôt that was born in the last years at the city hall, when it was the partners of the current coalition that led in Prague.
The coded vocabulary that Prague's political cream set in motion during the previous era of Mayor Pavel Bem describes some of the personalities, situations, and causes of the metropolis.
It is surprising that it has been discovered that the new elected officials do not understand very well the terms known.
At least they say it.
"Who is Valdemort."
"I really don't know."
"I am a fast in the Pragian politics has reacted Lukas Kaucky, the culture-chosen to the test of the vocabulary of the "sponsor".
And as far as the political veteran is concerned, the elected Karel Brezina reacted in the same way.
For example, the meaning of "golf hole".
"This is the only expression among those you propose to me that I use"
Otherwise, I don't use the argon.
From the vocabulary, of which the daily Aktualne.cz published the expressions in June of this year before the pre-eectoral congress of the ODS, the editorial staff selected 6 examples, first and foremost those related to the Prague City Hall.
Socialists had to explain the meaning of "Voldemort", "the biggest golf hole in Prague", go to the patisserie, "beef-nerf", "treason of the capital" and "enter".
Three of the elected officials agreed on the quiz, the fourth- Antonin Weinert, who has to lead education in Prague in the future - promised first an interview but then did not pick up the phone.
The fifth elected Petr Dolinek completely refused the test.
"I don't care about these things at all and how the representatives of citizen democracy have fun: I won't give my opinion."
"I am currently working on how we will understand each other in our programmes," he said.
As we have already heard, the elected Lukas Kaucky would apparently not recognize in the legend above, that it is the influence of Janousek on the entrepreneurs and friends of former Mayor Roman Bem.
"Voldemort" doesn't say anything to Kaucky and the only expression he has guessed in the test is "the biggest golf hole in Prague".
"This is the Blanka tunnel," Kaucky said, adding immediately: "But I know about the newspapers."
"I'm gonna have to pay for a language course," he's joking.
Not only the matador Karel Brezina but also Lukas Plachy, the chosen one for the environment, know that the golf hole is the Blanko tunnel.
The two Social Democrats know who Voldemort really is and Lukas Plachy knows where to find the character - he thinks of "going to the pastry shop".
"It's, I think, going to a company," Plachy is ready to guess that it's the headquarters of Janousek's companies.
On the same tone Brezina recalls that he draws his knowledge rather from newspapers and not from any vocabulary he would use.
According to the candidates for the tests there is no lexicon of argument in social democracy.
"I took advice with colleagues and it turns out that we really don't have something like that."
"Sometimes names are said to be used for abbreviations and symbols," says Peter Hlinsky, President of the Social Democratic Party, who is referred to as Hulda.
"I was called Briza at school, but I don't know if my colleagues call me that," admits Karel Brezina about nicknames.
The daily Actuel.cz has tested the name and it works.
The elected Weinert is Papy for the members of the Party or the least friendly Little old, the representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to him before the elections by scams during the sponsorship of the party, is nicknamed "the little joust".
The nicknames are also the only ones that the Social Democrats admit to using within the party.
It is reported that Hulinsky does not like to hear Hulda much, but the daily Akutel.cz recorded another nickname for this Pragian president.
"Doctor in law of battling" he recalls that Petr Hulinsky obtained his title as Doctor in law JUDR. at the police academy of bratislava.
The government wants to reduce the torture of "witches", published a brochure.
In Burkina Faso, women declared witches have common features.
Rather, they are part of the old generation, cannot work for health reasons, are free and have no children.
The one who becomes "witch" is isolated so as not to threaten the rest of the village.
"Man has very rarely this fate."
"We also do not judge young women in good health because they participate in work and give birth to children," says a sister who is working in the capital of this West African country, Burkina Faso, in a special institution of more than 100 women who have been rejected by society.
The local government has decided to intervene against this unusual "social measure".
He has published a brochure that should help limit witch hunting.
The case has a "hic".
"More than 70 per cent of adults in Burkina Faso do not know how to read," the daily Die Standard warned about the disadvantage of written education.
The charge of witchcraft is common in other African countries.
In Ghana, Burkina Faso's neighbour, Ammy Hemma, a 72-year-old woman died after being tortured by three women and a man then burned with oil that they had sprinkled on her.
The BBC server transmitted this information.
The criminals say it was the wrong eye.
According to their version, the oil used for ritual anointings ignited in contact with the woman.
The oil flamed, it seems, when the team wanted to "hunt the bad spirit" of the woman.
The isolation of "witches" is approved by people at all levels of education.
The daily Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: "Human spirit eaters have always been a danger," he said.
As Burkina Faso strives to reduce witch-hunts, the Gambia has not even seen the President himself participate in it since last year.
"Gambian President Dzammi, after his aunt's death, launched a wide hunt for witches who, it seems, would have participated in his death and would have tried to kill the President as well."
"Shamans from nearby Guinea came to the rescue, brought to the presidential farm in Kanilai, under the protection of police and the personal care of the President, men and women chosen at random in the villages of Gambia," said in a message the organization "Amnesty International.
On the farm, prisoners had to drink a plant-based potion with hallucinogenic effects that in addition to other effects on the kidneys and intestines.
Two prisoners did not survive it.
About a thousand people were released from international pressure.
Bakal's tenant: The stoves are heating up, he signed a higher rent.
An imposing old man came out of the door of the RPG Byty customer center of the "coal baron" Zdenek Bakal, the largest private owner of apartments for rent in the Czech Republic.
He was holding a file with three new rental contracts for three apartments: his, his daughter's and his son's, who is serving a sentence.
The deregulation has increased the rent for these three people.
Instead of paying 3500 the son will have to pay from next year for a 2+1 apartment of second category 4100 crowns.
"And there is no hot water and the heating works with solid fuel," shows a finger on his son's new contract the man who has the signature power.
"But I signed it anyway," he explains. "He moved angry and half resigned.
The citizen association of BytyOKD.cz apartments, which described the new rental conditions as "immoral and indecent", advises tenants not to sign and wait until December 7, when a notice will be published to explain the method to be followed to claim.
But man reacts to this by a hand gesture.
"One says this, the other says something else" by rubbing the eyebrows.
The Ostrava region becomes the laboratory of deregulation.
After New Year's Eve, this is what most apartments in the Czech Republic expect whose rents do not match the market price.
Aktualne.cz has therefore decided to visit the "laboratory" personally.
RPG's waiting room on Havirovska Street is one of four in the Ostrava area and is already full on Tuesday at 9 a.m.
Right next to the door stands a guard of a security company with a device to call the customers.
A special button, "Loyer 2011", is turned on on the touch screen.
One pressure and one paper with a number coming out of the camera.
You don't have time to read your number "157" that your number already starts to light up on the big screen under the top of the waiting room.
In a fraction of a second, it's your turn.
After a short moment, an old couple arrives to inquire about the rent, but the new rents do not seem to concern people in the waiting room.
The majority of people have come to resolve common problems like everywhere - asking for repairs, insurance events and so on.
In the Ostrava region, people from more than 44,000 apartments in the RPG portfolio receive mail with new leases in their mailbox since about mid-November.
RPG Byty offers rent increases of 15 to 38 percent.
the special window for new rents has been open to the public since 18 November.
"It's been working for almost a week, so it's still on trial," the employee says, after a moment of hesitation, behind the counter when the client presents himself as a journalist.
The deregulation and the former apartments of Bakal miners are a very sensitive local subject.
The vice-president of the parliament and from the region of Ostrava Lubomir Zaoralek of the Social Democrats reported this fairly strongly before the elections and this now fills the local newspapers.
"20 years after them, I want a new floor."
"They didn't even change a pot...n board in the toilets, relief in introduction the man mentioned.
However, it is mostly, according to employees, retirees who come to make sure they will receive a discount on the new rent price if they now sign as promised RPG in a special offer.
The other tenants who have signed their new contract before December 15 will receive a refund of half the rent.
But the "deregulation" window on Havirovaska Street is really not overwhelmed by the questions.
"Among the 360 customers who came yesterday, only 40-50 came for the rent," says the employee at the counter.
And yet RPG poses both on its website and in the showcases of individual interviews on rents when it is necessary.
If both parties do not agree on the rent it is an independent court that will make the decision.
'These are not threats but only to inform about the unique and legitimate way to act legally', says RPG on its website.
"No one's going to court" thinks one of RPG Byty's employees and the man on the street in front of the customer center is right.
"I have 13,000 kroner and I have 5,000 kroner left to eat, I don't have enough to go to court," he says.
The employee suddenly feels uncomfortable.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaoralek in the media asks that no one sign and therefore people wait," she says.
Rent regulation ends in the Czech Republic with the beginning of 2011 and increases, according to RPG Byty, are an economic necessity.
"And, in addition, the current rents still do not reach the level necessary for the simple maintenance of the housing fund," recalls Pavel Klimes, director of the residential portfolio of the company RPG Byty, which is precisely the neglect of the housing fund that makes the tenant angry is the main reason for the increase in rent.
However in 5 years between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able with the rents to invest in the apartments 4 billion, in four years from 2011 to 2014 it is expected to be 5.2 billion.
The large screen attached to the ceiling in front of the padded armchairs of the waiting room on Havirosvka Street, however, repeats some information indicated in red.
'The rent increase in 2011 is 15 per cent and concerns no less than 31,200 apartments or more than 90 per cent of RPG apartments'.
"And it will always be no more than 7.50 Czech crowns per m2 per month," says the screen.
The 38 percent increase concerns only 400 apartments in the RPG portfolio.
"In these cases, this is an increase of a really low sum of 19.66 Czech crowns at m2", adds RPG.
Next year the rent will remain the same for 2600 apartments.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not cause a radical but gradual increase over 4 to 8 years.
She adds other commitments: all the money from the increase in rents (see graph) is returned to the apartments in the form of heating savings - new windows and heating.
Those who sign the agreement on the rent increase have priority.
The nursery school is also part of offices that included architects.
the administrative building Avriopoint of Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch. Design.
No one could have expected it to also house a mini kindergarten with everything you need - colorful walls, imaginative furniture, toys and finally a miniature playground on the terrace.
Since October of last year, the children of Arch. design employees can go there.
Arch. Design, a project-architectonic company whose workshops produced a large number of constructions in Brno, has imagined its mini-maternal business school since the first drafts of the Avriopoint building.
It employs about 90 people, especially the age of children, and it was important that women architects and project leaders should be able to return to work quickly.
Along with reduced time contracts, kindergarten is a bonus offered to its employees by Arch. Design as part of its social program.
Manufacturers and architects thus have the opportunity to combine work taking care of children.
It was the employees of Arch.Design themselves who imagined this kindergarten and with the support of the management they were able to obtain a endowment from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The mini-maternal school is financed through the European Social Fund through the operational programme of human resources and the State budget of the Czech Republic.
They were able to purchase equipment and appliances and, after two years, to provide qualified personnel and start-up.
After using the funding endowment (two years) Arch. Design. has the obligation after 3 years to operate the mini kindergarten on its own funds.
The preparation of the project lasted one year and it was the Economy rating company that helped to make the staffing request.
Care for children is provided by qualified staff, throughout the day a nurse and a kindergarten teacher take care of children. Children can go to kindergarten without age limitation but they are over three years old for most.
Since it is a "mini-maternal school" there can only be 5 children present at the same time, but during the day there are more who replace each other.
The operation of the school is flexible according to the needs of the parents and the children of all employees have the same right to use the school without regard to the hierarchical position.
Although individual care and education are used, the programme of the minima nursery school is comparable to that of pre-school education.
Children don't just play there, but quality education is also provided - from the beginning to preparation for school benches English is taught.
The class is equipped not only with imaginative toys and games but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of small children in society creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can control their child at any time and do not have the stress of a delay to pick up the children in a school away from the parents' workplace.
Parents therefore use their working time in the most productive way.
No wonder there is a natural relationship of loyalty between the employee and the employer.
Arch.Design.s is thus listed among the companies that offer a bonus of choice for the recruitment of new employees and who are friendly to the family and through this program strengthens HR marketing.
The house in bone still fascinates after 100 years. Take a look inside Gaudi's interiors.
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric saurian, the staircase to a dinosaur spine and the balconies to open fish mouths.
This is the Casa Battlo house in Barcelona by the architect Antoni Gaudi.
Due to its organic forms, the house received the nickname House in bone from the premises.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stones, fragments of tiles and mosaic, facade reminiscent of scales and everywhere present curves, this is all that is ypic for the New Art of Antoni Gaudi.
The front façade of the house unfolds its dream lines, its pleasant colors and textures that remind nature and animals.
During a more detailed observation one sees the geometry, rhythm and order thought with precision.
In the night the facade of the house becomes even more dramatic and is lit in such a way that the impression of brightness of the colors is reinforced.
The winding and twisting of shapes also appears in the interiors with the same measure.
The wood copies in waves the windows frames, the balustrades, the decorative elements of the doors, the eyepiece and the lamelles.
The Battlo house that stands in the Eixample district on the Passeig de Gracia street at number 43, was born from the construction of a house of 1877 by the architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
The reconstruction took place for two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, Joseph Battlo, a rich entrepreneur, first insisted on the demolition of the old construction and the construction of another brand new but quickly accepted Gaudi's idea of an unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
But the idea of Casa Battlo as a house with multiple dwellings was not thought of by Gaudi alone.
The architect Josep Maria Jujol worked with him.
It is precisely on his project that the decorations for an apartment representing the owner of the building and the use of the mosaic for the façade were born.
For the façade have also worked other artists and creators.
The joint work for the plans of Casa Battlo began with a successful cooperation between Jujol and Gaudi.
Jujol participated in the construction of Gaudi Casa Mila's house and Guell Park where there are other Gaudi works.
The locals nicknamed the house hot just after its finish because of its organic forms "the House in bone".
Others, in view of the specific mechanism of opening the windows, called it "the house that dances".
It is said that at the top of the building there is a sword similar to that of Saint George the patron of Catalonia.
Other elements of construction sculpture contain hidden religious motifs.
Gaudi thought for the house a unique system in its central heating time, with ventilation vents and typical fireplaces.
Their 45-degree inclination seems odd.
During the creation of Gaudi absolutely did not comply with the directives for the construction of those days and did not let themselves be hindered by them.
At the beginning of the construction he obtained a permit from the city to build, knowing, of course, that the data on the reconstruction plans were so vague that two years later during the finish the municipal council was horrified and asked for modifications.
For example, the members of the municipal council did not like the construction pillars to be built on the public sidewalk.
There was never any change, but, on the contrary, only 15 days after the call of the city Josep Battlo asked (and got satisfaction) for permission to rent the two highest floors.
The owner moved to the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a common living room and in the third a bedroom and a private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented from a jewelry store.
The entire six-storey house is shared by a staircase through which you access to an independent roof terrace.
All right angles and straight lines were cancelled by the basic elements of the reconstruction and their replacement by curved walls.
Gaudi also worked on the modern concept of connecting spaces.
The common part can be connected completely by opening the doors of the lounges and the high society can communicate comfortably or limit the private space for more intimate interviews.
The house with Gaudi reconstruction received in addition to new facades a non-traditional roof and two more floors.
Gaudi's play with light is also impressive, blue and white glazed tiles with which is decorated the inner courtyard and with the wells of lights.
The two-color game gives maximum light in all floors of the house.
It was enough simply to bet on the principle that white reflects more than dark, which instead absorbs the rays of the sun.
The Casa Battlo house that was registered in 2005 in the UNESCO World Heritage Fund may be visited by everyone.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and splendid apartment accessible to the public.
The owners decided to take this step in 2002 on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
They continued the visits as they found that it was a lucrative company and expanded the scope of visits to common spaces and attic including roof terraces.
The entrance ticket to the monument is really cheap and costs 16.50 euros; students, pensioners, groups and tour card holders have 20 percent discount.
The sum is still above the entry price in the other buildings of Gaudi in the city.
If you want to feel the real atmosphere of the house with its fantastic turrets, you need to quickly find a comrade among the inhabitants of the building and visit the house completely.
How to choose a mattress and a mattress: women have other criteria than men.
No ostentatious frame, but rather the quality of the area reserved for bed, so the mattress and the bedbed provide a real basis for a good bed.
They must of course complement each other harmoniously to please a concrete user.
During the choice several things are decisive: weight, size, age, health status as well as the sex of the owner.
The type of interior in which the mattress and mattress are to be placed is also important.
A typical example?
For example, in the country house where you do not sleep continuously latex mattresses are not suitable because they "heat" slowly.
They also have a higher weight than standard polyurethane mattresses.
It is necessary to return them frequently.
If they do not also have enough ventilation channels in the heart and if they remain, in addition, on a solid board, they retain moisture. Moisture can also form there.
The habit is also decisive in the choice.
Anyone who spends the light of time abroad using thick mattresses frequently with a softening layer will hardly feel well on a low and hard surface.
"That's how every hockey player who comes back from NHL complains that they can't sleep there."
"For their tired shoulders, feet and ribs, they needed mattresses with a soft layer of lazy foam."
"Such mattresses are also recommended for people suffering from diabetes who have a nervous system disorder that therefore take poorly "information" from joints and skin," explains Sylva Adamczikova, who specializes in upholstered furniture.
That's why a few years ago the mattress with lazy mousse conquered the hockeyists as well as other customers.
"Today everything works well, Tempur, Italian Magnifex but also Czech Tropico have for example suitable mattresses.
You don't need to be an NHL guy so you can enjoy a lazy mousse.
This "miracle" just works.
It optimizes its rigidity and shape according to the absorbed heat or adapts to the heat of your body.
There's nothing pressure on you and you won't turn back in the night like after a tough game.
You just sleep better.
The lazy foam also works as a protection against the squares.
For the choice of mattress according to your size, add the length of the feet, about 21/34 cm.
A man and a woman of a size of 180cm therefore need a bed of 210/220 cm.
The minimum width for each bed should be 90 cm or 180 cm in total.
For single beds, for example, it is recommended to take at least 120 /140 cm.
It's convenient in case of a visit.
'However it is a simple rule for the width of the bed: when you are lying on your back you should put your hands comfortably with slightly folded elbows. Helena Prokopova, President of the Association of Stockbrokers-mattressers and decorators who for several years dedicates himself to the problem of a healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture and the sign in specialized schools.
For a double bed each needs its own mattress and mattress, so be careful, however, while choosing the mattress height well.
Otherwise, you will only have to climb the top to different heights and this is not possible on all the bed frames.
Foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, spring mattresses at least 15 cm, this counts for the shape and ventilation layer at least three centimeters.
"When touching or sitting on the mattress you should not feel the springs," warns Héléna Prokopova.
Each mattress requires a well-defined type of mattress.
The sleeping-bed, when the mattress and the sleeping-bed are united as siamese sisters, has nothing to do in the bedrooms.
The mattresses were very bad; it should not be washed, which is commonly done today.
And since during the night you normally sweat 0.2 to 0.75 l of sweat it is clear that after 5/7 years, the mattress begins to recall a large (and clogged) sieved.
For this purpose, specialists refuse to make a claim over a 25-year lifespan for a mattress or a lifetime warranty.
But it's all about his buts.
And for this an experience advice from the sellers: for a mattress of 120/140cm, give up, for the coating of the mattress, hygiene or washing but rather add a protective mattress that you can easily remove and wash.
And even if nowadays it is common to make floor coverings with sliding closure for the whole, that is to say that after opening we have two parts (for washing and the size of the washing machine is very important!) otherwise the manipulation for the big models (and for one person only) becomes when they are removed a fight between a light weight and a heavyweight on a ring.
Do you have a rigid board in your bed instead of a bedbed?
Never!
Maximum for one bed for visitors for one night only.
However, equip the board (if there are none) with vent holes and use the spring mattress with a minimum height of 15cm with sachet springs (from Germany Taschenfederken) and an aeration layer.
A polyurethane mattress should not be part of a bed of this type.
For single position lamellar mattresses with 14/18 lamellar, latex mattresses or so-called sandwiches (perhaps the combination of latex and coconut), are ideal but it will always be better for you to have a mattress with more lamellar, 28 and above, where the lamellar are doubled in the lower part of the kidneys and thus it is possible to regulate its rigidity.
For multi-position mattresses it is not necessary to take spring mattresses because it does not respond to position changes.
Next to adjusting the stiffness of the blades, you can also install what is called a shoulder cradle.
It is a special bond of the lamelles that allows to put pressure even to tilt the lamelle so that the shoulder of the sleeper "fits in" well.
For men who have "the shoulders as wide as the back", it is really an important thing.
This is already envisaged by the mattress manufacturers who for the "male" have started to use a softening area at the shoulder level.
But they also think of women - they again offer them a softer surface at the hip level.
For the most difficult customer there are winged or plated springs with what is called a multiforce suspension.
The pressure spreads in more points and dilutes the tension.
But of course, be careful, as soon as you use a bad pillow (large and swollen with air) on good mattresses and mattresses, the "plus" disappears.
The basic rule is a simple pillow: the pillow must support the head and its tips must reach only the shoulders, so that the muscles of the shoulders can rest.
The recommended size is 50X60 cm that the Scandinavians prefer by example.
When lying on the side, the pillow should level the height of the shoulders (with the shoulder cradle of the mattress or the area softened in the mattress).
Modern mattresses still have something in common with the first straw- and grass-based mattresses.
Manufacturers still use natural materials or mixtures.
The trend is also to organic mattresses.
Petroleum-based raw materials, from which polyurethane is produced, are replaced by natural oils, such as soy oil.
Almost all known manufacturers use soybeans.
"The Bio qualifier for mattresses means that the heart is made from natural products," explains Petr Vasicek of Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are also used for mattress coatings; one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can add micro-capsules that develop scents of the forest or lavender.
There are differences between men and women.
While extracting birch plants so that the mattress coating absorbs heat and cools the body, "cools" the man, the coatings "heat" the women.
The red pepper extract accelerates blood circulation and is therefore warmer for the low sex.
Current favourites?
The mattresses made from cold foam (it has more pores with a disturbed cell structure therefore more breathable than standard polyurethane and has more elasticity.
The combination of different rigidities of cold foams gives polyzone mattresses that know exactly where the head, bottom of the back and feet are.
You will pay a quality mattress from 7,000 crowns and more.
Those who are characterized by their health parameters have less VAT and are taken as instruments for health.
In the Czech Republic, Gumotex has reached first place.
Saving for mattresses and mattresses is not easy.
From time to time, manufacturers or producers may have two mattresses for the price of one.
Like for example the company Magniflex that offers Duofreeze mattresses with memory foam sewn to the coating for 11990 crowns.
You can obviously take the second one for free.
The era of lazy or viscoelastic foams with an open cell structure and a large thickness was started with Tempur material at a "cosmic" rhythm.
This started as a material for NASA because astronauts were experiencing enormous load factors at the start.
Tempur is softened by heat and hardens, on the contrary, by cold.
It adapts perfectly to the warm human body and distributes optimal pressure.
It is ideal for this against sleeping sickness and for an increase in comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses but also for health products, such as special cushions for feet that relieve the legs and venous system.
For example, Czech manufacturers use EucathermC or Twinsaver foam or the same type.
Tracking devices are increasingly being requested by parents who want to watch their children.
Fear for their child is causing more and more people to think about monitoring them through a GPS.
The system, set up at the beginning to search for cars can be used just as well to trace the movement of people and help in some cases as by example that of the little Anicka Janatkova.
The instrument is currently as big as a matchbox but will soon be the size of a watch.
The case of little Anicka has moved a large number of people and they have begun to look for ways to better protect their children.
Even if the price is to disrupt their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that this is not about espionage but only about another way to reduce the likelihood of another tragedy," says Petr Pilin of the company MAcro Weil, which is one of the suppliers of tracking devices in the Czech market.
"I admit that there may be cases of misuse of such devices, such as putting it in the bag of a person who is not aware, but I have not yet encountered such cases."
"Most people are customers who actually buy the product for safety reasons," adds Pilin.
According to him, children should always know what "box" is used for and how to use it in an emergency.
The child psychologist, Dana Bockova, draws attention to the fact that if the child does not want to carry something like this on him, he will get rid of it.
'And even the little ones can show great creativity when it comes to getting rid of something on purpose when they don't want to be under control.'
"Mobile phones, which can be cut like these tracking devices, have already led parents to long expectations," says Bockova.
According to her, the fact that this type of device can help in the event of an attack is highly questionable.
"If it is a prepared abduction, the author will do everything in his power to ensure that the child does not have an electronic device that can locate him."
"Currently, it's the phone."
"As soon as tracking devices develop, they (the criminals) will also look for them because the sale will be supported by an advertising campaign."
"In such cases criminals will always be ahead of the police," says the psychologist.
She admits, however, that such devices can help in an attack not prepared by a pedophile.
According to Robert Cech of RC Monitoring, who provides tracking services for both cars and people, he claims that having this type of device can help, even if it is destroyed in the event of an attack.
"The device can be set in such a way that it is on regular issue after a specified period of time".
"In the event that the device is destroyed, it remains the last position of the person concerned."
'The more expensive devices also have an inclinometer that immediately signals the position of the person who slipped and finds himself in an elongated position without moving," Cech says.
According to him the so-called smart mobile phones that are equipped with a navigation system, can offer a comparable service after having formatted it with a special prologiciel.
The problem with current tracking systems is that it is either a device similar to those worn in pendants the size of a matchbox or to smaller telephone devices.
We can always lose them.
According to Pilina of Macro Weil company, this is why tests are currently being conducted to make devices that look like common digital watches.
"This will have the advantage that the possible aggressor will not be able to recognize the tracking device."
"Or he will realize it after a while, which will have given the police a little more time," he adds.
Whether the tracking device is developed in the form of a bracelet or pendant, it will always use the same technology as for tracing cars.
This is a combination of a position acquisition system using GPS (which is commonly used in self-navigation) and a mobile phone function that alerts the current position of a vehicle.
The army has so many detonating strings that it could go around the Czech Republic with. But it can only hold two years.
The army bought 445 km of ropes used for explosives.
Last year, the Ministry of Defence had already purchased 224 km.
The army has reserves for 225 years.
The problem is that the lifespan of the ropes is up to two to four years.
The army bought detonating ropes from the anonymous company STV Group for 40 million crowns.
The General Staff gave as a reason for the auction of a huge amount of detonating cords to MF DNES that soldiers use 60 km per year.
According to the reserve calculations to be carried out by the army pyrotechnicians, which MF DNES contacted, it appears that even generals, officers with command, secretaries or householders should have an annual explosives exercise.
Alexandre Vondra, Minister of Defence and Vlastimil Picek, commander of the army are no exception.
Only to argue the army's annual consumption of 60 km of detonating cords.
At this distance there are 25,000 explosions.
And even if that were true, the army reserves could support it for 10 years.
If on the contrary it would be true that for the basic training of each of the new professionals it is sufficient to more than 2 m of detonating strings, as the experts say, this means that the army with its new purchase has ensured - with also the consumption of special units and of the genius - reserves for the 225 years mentioned.
Yet the soldiers of the Rapid Intervention Brigade recently complained to Minister Vondra that they have almost no ammunition for their fist weapons and that shooting sessions are limited due to the need for money.
About the lack of body linen, we don't talk about it.
"And I don't get my head off if they buy so many detonating ropes from us."
"And it's their decision and they really know what they're doing."
"for us the army is a good customer that we strive as merchants to content," says STV Group commercial director Jan Decky.
Jan Pejsek, spokesman for the Ministry of Defence, argues that hundreds of kilometres of detonating cords have been lost because the army will have these "munitions" in reserve for 10 years.
Jan Decky of STV Group, however, reported that only four years of life of the detonating cords and pyrotechnicians of the police and army were only two years old.
"If they are perfectly stored in the warehouses, it can even go up to four years," says one who does not want his name to be published in view of the criticism of the army.
The length of time spent, each ammunition must be tested to see if it remains intact and does not threaten the soldier's life.
However, these tests are not free and still cost money.
The other argument of the ministry is a discount due to the quantity for 445 km of detonating cords.
"They cost us 60 percent less than last year's supply of 245 km," says spokesman Pejsek, who interprets the opinion of the buyers of the Ministry of Defence.
Only to compare: the annual consumption of the detonating cords of police pyrotechnicians that neutralize the munitions of the Second World War or those after the Soviet army, does not exceed 1500 meters.
And the police still only order the amount of ammunition needed to be used before the end of their life.
This has been established for pyrotechnic safety reasons and in order to be able to obtain more flexible types of detonating cords more modern and more reliable.
The Ministry of Defence today has major problems in neutralizing tens of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Pact when the Czechoslovak army of two hundred thousand men were preparing to move, heading for the Rhine.
What awaits in a few years this Czech army that MF DNES has contacted: neutralize hundreds of kilometers of old detonating cords that it buys today "at low cost".
So far I have benefited from contacts that I have gained through the competitions.
The franchise sale of his hotel helped Lukas Pytloun to win the competition of the best Individual Entrepreneur.
The winner of the competition of the best Individual Entrepreneur for last year was Lukas Pytloun, 28-year-old entrepreneur.
His adventure to success is like in a movie.
Lukas Pytloun liked to travel.
And abroad, he realized that in Libérec there was a lack of quality accommodation at a reasonable price.
From his savings on what he had earned while working abroad and with the help of a bank loan he bought a small building of 5 apartments half demolished.
Knowing that he was still a student in his third year of higher education, it was a courageous action.
"The relationship between the quality and the price of accommodation in our region has made me want to do something," says Lucas Pytloun.
He began to rent the first reconstructed apartment to foreign workers.
He reinvested the profit in the building he converted into a pension with 54 beds.
Since then, his entrepreneurial activity has allowed him to open in Libérec 4 guest houses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of nearly 300 beds of all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of them was until very recently the four-star Pytloun design hotel.
This year another of the same quality came to him.
"We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrova U Tise where we sold our concept of franchise and other candidates for the franchise of Pytloun hotels showed up," number 1 of last year's entrepreneurs.
"And for the sale of the license for the start-up of a large-scale hotel the victory in the competition of the entrepreneur of the year has served well," adds Pytloun with appreciation.
The victory brought him more popularity and to be known in Libérec and its surroundings.
"People recognized me on the streets, often congratulated me and, I must say, it was very pleasant," he recalls.
It recommends participation in this competition for all those who are trying to do something.
It is not necessary to win but any opportunity to be visible is good.
He says that he uses his contacts and knowledge to date that he could not have obtained in another way.
"With those I met thanks to the competition I began to maintain business relations regularly.
According to him, success-related fame also had an impact on employees.
And he's about 70.
"I especially observe in them the loyalty and pride of being engaged in something that has generally been recognized."
"This is not, by far, the only result of my personal work, but the result of a good work of all of us together.
"Only my name is pushed forward," says Lucas Pytloun modestly.
I wish my successor a better year than we had in Farmet.
The euphoria of victory was quickly replaced by the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the objective of the winner Farmet has the worst moments behind him.
The one who came to seek the prize in Slovansky dum for the first place of the contest for the Firm of the year organized by Vodaphone last year is Karel Zdarsky the owner of the Farmet company.
The jury rewarded the efforts with which it transformed a tooling workshop in Ceska Skalice into a company with a turnover of 100 million kroner.
'I can say that the award not only encouraged my colleagues and increased our self-confidence to fight competition,' says today the winner of last year's competition.
At the beginning of Farmet's history there was a desire to do something useful.
And so when the state offered Karel Zdrasky's father to rent the small workshop as compensation after the confiscation of property by the communists, he did not hesitate for long, refused a career in a firm where he worked at the time, and created a company with a few comrades in the surroundings of his father for the manufacture of plastic baths.
Not long after they began to specialize in vegetable oil presses.
After 18 years he became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
The company was known even in the non-specialized public after the success of the competition through the media.
"Not only have our customers started to really get to know the Farmet brand better, but also the foreign partners who started to realize that they were collaborating with a company that got the most success in their country of origin," says Karel Zdarsky.
But the past year did not happen in Farmet only in the euphoria of victory.
The company's valuation was based on the economic results of 2008 and in part of 2009.
And just in 2009 it was the most difficult year for the sale of engineering machines.
At the top of the crisis, which did not really affect citizens, companies were forced to stop their investment projects and start limiting their purchases of new materials and technologies.
"We have not, of course, escaped this situation."
"Business figures fell by 40 percent, and we had to limit our production and even lay off," explains Karel Zdarsky.
A viable society must know that from time to time unpopular action is needed.
But they managed the situation properly and maintained beneficial results even if they were inferior to those they had before the crisis.
However, at Farmet, they continued without compromise to invest in research and development.
"We built with the endowments a training and research center, strengthened the presentation of the company in international fairs and exhibitions and won the main rewards in the national exhibitions," says Zdarsky.
Everything leaves us to believe that the crisis is behind them.
The number of employees also rises with the number of employees.
"To the new winner I wish this pleasant feeling of victory but in a calm atmosphere," says Karel Zdarsky.
The investigation that removes senseless regulations.
The Absurdity of the Year investigation is for the fourth time a part of the business clan.
Some absurd regulations have been removed.
This year's unglorious winner of the Absurdity of the Year survey was the obligation to bring documents to the offices that staff members can obtain online.
More than a third of the 4,000 voters voted for this.
For example, the social affairs administrations asked for a paper extract from the trade register while the official could get it in two clicks of mouse.
It changes because of the investigation.
"The Czech Social Insurance Administration will no longer request the extract from the trade register for checks on insurance payments," said Jana Buranova, spokesperson for the Czech Social Insurance Administration (CSSZ).
To highlight all the regulations and decrees that companies and entrepreneurs must fulfill in the Czech Republic and to remove those that are absurd is the meaning of this contest of the Absurdity of the Year.
This survey is still this year for the fourth time a part of the business clan organized by Hospodarske noviny and is still more popular.
Last year's 3,000 voters showed up, at least 4,000 this year brought in their votes.
And it's not surprising, there are in our country the most diverse legal obligations that only hinder the company, and, this, more and more.
"Perhaps we are among the documents to be filled out for tax returns in the first place in the world," says Karel Havlicek of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
Simplification of entrepreneurial activity has become a goal proclaimed by all governments in recent years.
In comparison with the whole world, the situation in the Czech Republic is not improving at all.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic is 74th in terms of conditions for the company, 8 more places than last year.
The Absurdity of the Year competition was first introduced in 2006 and continues each year according to the same scenario.
Anyone can report every year the administrative and bureaucratic absurdities from April to the end of September, the last deadline before the closing of the competition.
To report there is the website www.firmaroku.cz. Then the contest organiser chooses seven candidates for "anti-price" and lets the public vote during the month of October on the website www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and on www.ihned.cz.
The Absurdity that received the greatest number of votes is declared victorious.
Until the last survey last year, it was about a hundred, or more exactly 105 regulations and decisions that lost their sense of existence.
The comments are sent by the entrepreneurs but also the professional unions and teachers.
Among the "finalists" of the competition, therefore among the nominees is for example the obligation that highway and highway maintenance vehicles pay for tolls, or that contractors with twenty employees, paint two offices and two toilets every two years.
the list of the seven proposals is published on the competition website.
The proclamation of the competition, which always begins in early November on Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of a happening in which personalities of political and public life regularly participate.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodova, director of the Association for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises of the Czech Republic or Petr Kuzel, president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, attended the culmination of the competition.
"Economic prosperity cannot work when the state puts ties in the hands of entrepreneurs and for this my goal is to delete, every year, at least three dozen paragraphs that today only complicate the company," said Martin Kocourek, Minister of Industry and Trade.
The effort to remove absurd decrets is not a sword in the water.
In 2007, what people did not like was the obligation of entrepreneurs to report three days in advance to the office for the individual company where the company is located, the intention to go to an exhibition or a pilgrimage with a stand.
This obligation was removed with the amendment of the Individual Business Act.
The second most popular obligation in 2007 to report to the Labour Office a 30-day service trip for a foreign employee was removed with the text of the Green Card Act.
And everything's okay until the third session of the contest.
The Absurdity of 2009 was the decree for physiotherapists to have a large mirror in their cabinet, a refrigerator and two automatic scales.
This was changed by order of the Ministry of Health last year- the obligation to have a refrigerator was removed.
A new category rewards socially responsible firms.
Environmental, humanitarian, training and sports projects are evaluated.
This year's new feature of the Hospodarske Noviny competition, which has been in existence for five years, is the category called the Firm Responsible for 2010.
The core of this competition is reasonable and fair business support.
"We want to support companies that monitor their company's environmental impacts and conduct a socially responsible activity," says Patrick Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile phone operator, Vodaphone, who is the guarantor and promoter of this competition, as in the case of the contest for the rebel of the year.
For this first year of this sub-category of the competition of the company of the year 2010, organized by the firm Vodaphone, have registered companies that have not succeeded with a single long-term objective for the company.
The adventure of each of them is rich in inspirations and an independent article would be to be edited.
Although the purpose of their business is different from each other, their support and forecasting activity can be seen as the denominator of their efforts.
In one case, this concerns persons with disabilities and the personal or health problems of their employees.
Among the fourteen finalists for the entire Czech Republic is not an example of the Prague Prological Society Et Netera which supports the creation of informal sports teams of their employees who then participate in many tournaments in different sports disciplines.
Another example of a firm in charge of the Pardubice region is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main contributor to the endowment fund for children with disabilities for 17 years.
With regard to employees with health problems, we can mention the old paper manufacturing plant in Podebrad, which employs more than 70 per cent of these, and for this reason has obtained the title of the firm Responsible for the Central Bohemia region and has placed third in the region in the competition of the Firm of the Year organized by Vodaphone.
In Olomouc, it was MiRyz Soft, a financial company, who won for introducing flexible working hours and even reduced up to 35 hours per week on average and, without, proportionally, a reduction in wages.
The jury also defied her title because she bought Czech manufacturers as a priority, supported a ditoy activity in the surrounding area and was concerned about the environment.
"We strive to recycle as much as possible so that our business and administration have the least impact on the environment," explains Miluse Ryznarova, the company's executive director.
the company responsible IT Enlogit of the Region of Usti also thinks about the health of its employees and has set up for each laptop a chair and an ergonomic keyboard, encourages their work at home and uses the catering services of a local protected factory for its actions.
"We also support the foundation The Man in the Shadow that helps the local Roma community," says Ondrej Suchy, the representative of society.
At the very last rank is, also for its activities, a washing and cleaning company of the Karlovy Vary region, which participates in the pension insurance of its employees in the form of bonuses above the standards.
"In our society we contribute to food, transportation, skills and leisure," says Joseph Strapac of the construction company of Bruntal Czasch, winner for the region of Moravia-Silesia.
All the regional finalists for the Vodaphone Firm of the Year competition, who had responded to the attached questionnaire of the registration document and sent it back to the organizer before August 15, were automatically registered in the Responsible Company category.
Incomplete or incomplete responses in the questionnaire were withdrawn from the competition by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the competing firms had not answered the questions, they could not participate in the competition of the Responsible firm but were not disqualified from the competition "principal" the Firm of the Year of Vodaphone".
"Independent registrations are not possible because it is a sub-category of the main contest of the Firm of the Year," explains Karel Goldman of the organizing agency Bison&Rose.
At the Lands Fund in Plzen, police made arrests during a public competition
In the Land Fund building in Plzen, anti-corruption police have made arrests in recent days.
The detectives passed the handcuffs to the local contractor and real estate dealer Lubos. G.
He had tried to manipulate a public tender for the settlement of a restitution request in such a way that the proposed land was obtained by a specific candidate.
He was supposed to pay Lubos G. half a million kroner.
"For the moment I can only confirm that the police are prosecuting a person for an insider's offence as part of a call for tenders and a public competition," said Pravo newspaper the head of Plzen Antonie Zelena's Public Prosecutor's Office, knowing that it is forbidden to provide more explanations because the investigation is ongoing.
The police released this 46-year-old contractor after 24 hours.
In order to know how it could influence a public competition, one can only speculate in view of so little official information.
On a question from Pravo, the spokesman for the Lubomira Cerna Land Fund said that the police had actually arrested Plzen in a separate workplace during the public competition.
"He was a client and under no circumstances an employee," she said.
The public competition according to Cerna has as its real name "Appeal to propose rights for the transfer of land according to the Land Law" and is put in place when several legal candidates manifest themselves.
"These persons propose, in the context of the appeal, a higher value of their rights to restitution which must be settled before the value of the land is announced."
"According to the proposed rights a ranking of the buyers is set up and the Land Fund then transfers the land to the person who proposed the highest rights," the Fund spokesman explained.
Lubos G. had, it is clear, the information concerning the persons who had registered for the appeal and since he himself was also a beneficiary because he had purchased a large number of rights to restitution, he had proposed to the candidates in the field not to participate in the competition.
And he was probably cashing in by retiring.
Which would explain why he had so much money in his possession at the time of his arrest.
Lubos G. had contacts well above the standards at the FdT (Founds of the Lands).
He was involved in the case of the former head of FdT Vaclav Sankot, who was prosecuted for publishing land for which the decision to set up a construction had already been published.
Precisely Lubos G. had obtained, for example, land for the construction of public communications, concretely in place and place where the access artery to the industrial zone of Borske Pole was to be built.
Later he exchanged it with the town hall for a building in the historic center of the city whose value is far superior.
The town hall was forced to accept it because otherwise it would put the construction in jeopardy by blocking the land.
Households will pay a supplement of about a hundred crowns per month for housing.
Households will have to pay a surcharge from January not only for all types of energy but also for water and sanitation, heating supplies and in some places rents will also increase.
From January onwards, families will have to draw from their purse up to a hundred crowns a month more than now.
Electricity increases by 4.6 percent, gas by almost 2 percent more expensive, in some locations you will have to pay up to one tenth more water supply and in many places central heating supplies will also be more expensive.
The increase in electricity is expected to be around 100 crowns per year for households in flats more than at present.
However, all suppliers have reduced electricity prices due to the sensitive development to encourage the production of renewable energy, in particular photovoltaic cells.
Gas increases moderately but of course at a time when people need it most to heat and therefore have the highest consumption.
One can also count about a hundred crowns in addition.
Although electricity and gas are increasing throughout the Czech Republic, the change in the price of central heating differs from city to city.
It is mainly the largest municipalities that plan price increases.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Kraloce will pay from January for central heating almost 50 more crowns per month, Liberian families will pay more than 1000 crowns annually.
For the inhabitants of Prague a 9 percent increase for water and sanitation is being prepared in case the city increases the rent of infrastructure.
If the rents don't change the Prags will pay a surcharge of 6.8 percent.
The price in Prague will still be one of the lowest in comparison with the whole country.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and sanitation increase by 7.4 percent.
For example, rent prices will increase significantly in the 450 thousand rented apartments starting in January, i.e. at the end of the regulation.
For example the company CPI Byty that owns at Usti nad Labem almost 2500 apartments, has decided an increase up to 100 percent.
Those who disagree with the new increase in rents will be brought before the courts by society.
The regulated rents people pay in nearly 300 thousand apartments could increase next year by 10 percent.
Czech children get drunk with rum and fernet. Beer is no longer fashionable and acts very slowly.
Fernet, rum, vodka and exceptionally also the best brand of whisky are stolen from parents.
They are drinks that most often bring those who get drunk, who are not yet fifteen years old, into the hands of the doctor.
Children who are treated at the hospital for recidivism are no exception.
This is the result of the experience of doctors who encounter cases similar to the admissions of hospital children's departments.
"Beers or wines are no longer fashionable because it takes time to be drunk."
'The trend is really strong alcohols', says Pravo Ludek Pelikan, Head of the Children's Department of Horovice Hospital in Central Bohemia.
"When they manage to chip a bottle of Dad into the cabinet, it's sometimes a wisky but it's the fernet and vodka that prevails."
"Vodka has this advantage that they can mix it with fruit juice and so don't feel it," explains the head of the department.
Eva Jurinova, spokesman for the Motol Hospital, also gives her reason.
"In general, it's rum or fernet."
"Today is fashionable alcohol, especially in elementary schools."
"In some cases, it was slivovice that they brought back from the house," added Jurinova.
According to the Head of Department Pelikan, it is normal to see drunk children aged 13 to 14 in hospital.
Before working in Horovice since last year, he was in Motol where he practiced ten years in pediatrics where ambulances brought students from the wide surroundings completely drunk.
"A girl was hospitalized four times
"She started her career at the age of twelve when she was brought in with 3.5 per thousand alcohol in the blood with an extra mix with ecstasy," the doctor described this particularly important case.
"She was at Holesovice Exhibition Park at a party."
"What's interesting is that it doesn't seem weird to the mother that her daughter is away for 48 hours," said the Director of the Department.
It is precisely the disinterest of parents or their unusual tolerance for their rejection of drinking that is the main cause of children's alcoholism.
According to experts, however, there is no mention of dependence, in its strict sense, on children.
"Under the term "alcoholic" we hear a chronic addiction to alcohol for several years with all the phenomena that result from it but that we do not find in children".
"In the case of those who use repeated alcohol, it is rather a significantly unfavourable socio-family background," explained the head of the Pelikan Department.
According to Jurinova, about forty drunk children were hospitalized this year until mid-November in the pediatric clinic in Motol.
Only cases with severe intoxication requiring hospitalization are integrated into the statistics.
Drunk children who are after emergency care taken home by parents or the police are not counted.
In addition to the cases of children who sit and drink a bottle of alcohol after school, according to Pelikan, there are three seasonal waves with which one can count: the day of witches, the Saint Sylvestre and the end of the school year.
"Or they drink in spite of bad results or on the contrary they celebrate the beginning of the holiday".
"Of course I experienced on witch day an admission of 7 drunk children at once," said Pelikan.
The drunken child who spent the night at the hospital in detoxification under medical supervision is paradoxically in a better position than the one who returned home and suffered the day after the "woody mouth".
Morning headaches caused by dehydration and glucose deficiency are eliminated by an infusion of glucose and nutrients that the body needs.
"That's why they're better off because they spend an excellent evening and then a gentle awakening and nothing hurts them."
"They are only surprised where they are," Pelikan adds, knowing that from time to time it spoils the good mood of patients at least with the note to pay for their care.
Ambulance transport and hospitalization on an intensive care bed can go up to tens of thousands of crowns.
"From time to time, I applied this as a means of education by counting to these children how much their drunkenness cost and that they could spend the whole summer in seasonal work to repay one evening," Pelikan added.
However, according to him, health insurance companies in their declining management, which should recover from parents the burden of care, do not deal with cases of drunken children.
Two L-159 aircraft are for the first time in foreign hands in Spain.
Two of the five L-159 aircraft, against which the Ministry of Defence exchanged Casa C-295M transport aircraft, took off on Tuesday for Seville, Spain, where the manufacturer of Casa-EADS aircraft is located.
This is the first time such devices have become the property of anyone other than the Czech army.
However, they have been abroad in the course of exercises or demonstration flights.
These are the two-seater versions of the L-159T1 that were up to now in service in the Czech army and were in flight condition.
The remaining three devices are single-seater versions of the L-159.
They are currently stationed at Aero Vodochody and the commercial intermediary - Omnipol - took them into account last week.
According to Jan Pejsek of the press department of the Ministry of Defence, the physical departure of Vodochody's planes is currently unknown.
'L-159 single-seat aircraft intended for exchange were taken on long-stored aircraft without causing additional charges or investments for the Ministry of Defence.'
"The two-seaters L-159 T1 were exchanged in the state," said Pravo Pejsek.
He argued that the army will not be left without two seats since the ministry signed in May 2009 with Aero Vodochody an agreement worth 200 million kroner for the transformation of four unused L-159 single seats into two seats.
The army took delivery of the first aircraft in July, the second being scheduled for delivery at the end of this year.
According to Pejsek EADS, it is committed to introducing aircraft into the equipment of some Alliance countries.
"In the contract it is clearly indicated that the one that takes L-159 aircraft into account is EADS and that they will be used to train pilots from NATO member countries."
"It is therefore the case of the one who takes into account to determine how to achieve this," said Pejsek.
Hospodarske noviny announced, some time ago, that the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 for a Casa aircraft and the purchase of three more aircraft for 3.5 billion kroner was endorsed last year by Mirek Topomanek's government.
The Ministry of Defence did not issue a tender and contacted EADS directly.
the Defence Directorate argued that the exchange ensures a future export of the L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought 72 aircraft from Aero Vodochody and only used 24 of them, wanting to sell the rest.
The purchase of Casa aircraft will probably have legal implications.
The European Commission has, however, lodged a complaint against the Czech Ministry of Defence with the European Court of Justice, since the aircraft should have been selected as part of a European tender and under no circumstances by contacting a manufacturer directly.
The army has already taken delivery of three Casa planes, the last one should arrive at Prague Kbely airport in two weeks.
A longer index than the annular is a sign of low risk of cancer
Men who have a longer index than the annular are at a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published on Wednesday by the British magazine Cancer.
This may depend on the level of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our findings show that the relative length of the finger serves as a simple test of prostate cancer risk, especially for men before the age of 60," said the co-author of the study Ros Eeles, professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help determine which men should undergo prostate cancer testing, including by combining with genetic risk or other aggravating factors such as family health history, added Eeles.
During the period 1994-2009 she followed with her colleagues in Britain more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer and at the same time nearly three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the study participants had the index of the right hand shorter than the ring finger.
For them as for the 19 percent of those who had fingers of the same length, the same probability of prostate cancer was found.
For those with longer indexes than the yearbook, however, the risk fell to 33 per cent, for men before 60, the risk reduction reached 87 per cent.
The length ratio of the two fingers cited - formed during the prenatal period - indicates, among other things, different levels of sexual hormones to which the child is exposed in the uterus.
Unless testosterone corresponds to a longer index.
Previous research has shown that testosterone helps to develop prostate cancer.
Professor Vacla Paces, a renowned Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, told CTK that he is aware of this study but that it does not seem to him that the relationship between finger length and cancer is "completely demonstrated".
The Czech Republic is under snow, the D1 and D5 motorways are closed.
Czech Republic, like most of Europe, is snow-covered this Thursday morning.
On roads and sidewalks, there is most of the time compact snow, shredders have worked all night in many places.
The D5 motorway is closed in the morning between the 89th and 93rd kilometre in the direction of Rozvadov due to several truck and car accidents and the D1 motorway in Brno in the direction of Prague suffers the same fate.
The dispatcher of the Central Automobile Club (UAMK) told the information
On the 91st kilometre a truck was hit, on the 93rd two heavy goods vehicles hit, the accident injured.
Several cars also found themselves in the ditch.
The problems are also on the D1 motorway at 185th kilometre towards Prague.
Two trucks hit it.
Drivers should exit just after Brno at 190 km or go to Brno and then enter the 182 km in Kyvalka.
A row of cars of several kilometers formed in this place.
Also on the D11 motorway, there is an accident and, this, just on arrival in Prague.
In Prague, there is a layer of snow several centimeters thick, thermometers indicate - 7 degrees Celsius.
For example, lines of cars are created in Prosek, Sterboholska Street is also clogged.
The safest means of transport is the subway.
The trams are delayed, for example, on the line between Charles Square (Karlove Namesti) and Peace Square (Namesti Miru).
At eight o'clock in the morning, the Prague crisis headquarters are still to meet.
There are also problems with railways and the airport.
The Czech Railways have already had to remove 7 rapid connections due to snow.
For example from Prague to Kralupy or from Prague to Beroun have problems
Travellers should monitor the current situation.
Ruzyne Airport has been closed since Wednesday 11:00 in the night until 5:00 in the morning.
Most roads in South Moravia are already rolling but increasing vigilance.
On the road to Vyskov, three side roads are impractical, on the road to Brno there begins to be snow gusts in places and on the road to Blansko the chains are mandatory to pass certain channels of communication in the places placed above.
The Vyskov region has been one of the most affected areas.
Until now the axes are closed: Rousinov-Slavkov, Bohdalice-Kucerov and also Saratice-Milesovice
To clean them it may be necessary to send snowshoes and strawberries.
We can't estimate when they're rolling.
On the road to Hodonin the prudence is rigorous in the white Carpathians region.
On roads that are, with respect to nature protection, maintained only by the spraying of inert products, there is still a 5 centimetre layer of snow warns TKC.
In Chechnya, it fell between two and 10 centimetres of snow; it fell the most in northern Bohemia, with often up to 18 centimetres of snow.
In the region of Moravia-Silesia, it fell up to 15 centimetres of snow.
The snow is gradually disappearing in Chechnya.
The Americans have a new "smart weapon"
The U.S. Army sent a new "intelligent" weapon to Afghanistan, known only as code XM-25.
The generals believe that this new automatic rifle will have an influence on the conflict there with the Taliban and will "change the game" to their advantage.
The new weapon is like a super precise cannon.
Its projectiles are laser-guided with a precision of a few meters.
The 25 mm special ammunition developed for this rifle and containing a highly breaking explosive actually works as small grenades.
Ammunition can be programmed in such a way that it will explode in contact with the target but also at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
So we can use it against an enemy who hides behind an obstacle, a wall or a ditch.
It is also not protected from above and when it falls upon it a deadly rain of steel flashes, it can also put it out of combat.
According to Richard Audette who took part in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon to use "intelligent" technology.
"The soldier uses it essentially in such a way that he finds the target, sends it a laser beam that determines the distance, thus obtaining a precise point of sight, that he corrects his target site and presses on the relaxation.
"Let's say you targeted 543 meters."
"When you press the trigger, the weapon loads and pulls at a distance of 543 meters or more 1, 2, 3 meters," said Audette.
400 jobs relocated
The Fujitsu group relocates its Bad Homburg subsidiary to Frankfurt.
Next year in July, 400 employees will transfer their workplace to Astro Park, which is currently located at the Place Mareinbader office building in the Bad Homburg area.
The Japanese group Fujitsu relocates its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the giant specializing in the manufacture and maintenance of computers said on Wednesday, next year in July, the workplace of 400 men and women, located so far on Marienbader Square in the city of Bad Homburg, will be transferred to Astro Park, a huge office complex located on Lyoner Straße Street in the Niederrad District of Frankfurt.
A Fujitsu spokesperson explained that in the medium term, the group should bring together another 100 jobs scattered so far in the region.
The rental offer has been extremely attractive. In addition, Astro Park's open-air offices are better suited to the employees' way of working.
In Bad Homburg too, Fujitsu was just a tenant.
Director-General Bernd Wagner said: "Frankfurt-Niederrad is for us a prime location with a remarkable infrastructure".
He claims that connection to the airport is precisely of great importance for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new move of an important company within the region caused the joy of the winners and the disappointment of the losers yesterday.
The head of economic affairs of the municipality of Frankfurt, Mr Markus Frank (CDU), said that once again a "planetary actor" had been conquered.
It is an "extraordinary profession of faith relative to the place of establishment".
Fujitsu is suitable for the city and its location is an important impetus for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (the Greens), regrets Fujitsu's decision.
Management informed the municipality of this intention very early.
"It goes without saying that we have offered our assistance to this company," said Mr Korwisi.
However, friendly relationships could not have changed the computer manufacturer's difficulties with the owner of the Place Marienbader building.
In the end, the economic reasons would have been decisive.
It is now a matter of preventing such an exceptional place from remaining unoccupied for a long time.
"I hope the owner and lessor of the building will be cooperative."
Ten years ago, the building of the Place de l'Hôtel de Ville, used so far by Fujitsu and the nearby "small vertical" and the rest of the buildings of Place Marienbad, were part of the controversial construction project of the spa.
The result of a joint project of the municipality and a private project developer, a new entrance of the city was created between the railway station and the Town Hall, which aroused many criticisms, not only because of the impressive layout of the surfaces that used to serve part of the parking, but also because of the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the rating and investment advice company, Feri, the computer manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, and Fujitsu, a computer manufacturer still associated with Siemens, moved into the buildings.
In 2006, the German group of Frankfurt Immobilien-Chancen bought the buildings occupied by Fujitsu at the same time as the Morgan Stanley real estate fund. A year later, these buildings were sold to the Spanish company Falcon Real Estate Investments SA based in Madrid.
The Fujitsu group based in Tokyo is considered to be the world's third-largest supplier of computer products.
For example, it makes computers and servers available to businesses and also provides essential service.
Its branch established in the Rhine-Main region is one of the most important in Germany: Fujitsu certainly has many more employees in Munich.
The branch, Fujitsu Technology Solutions, leaves Bad Homburg to move to Frankfurt-Niederrad. The other subsidiaries on this site are Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
For this, 7,000 square meters have been rented in the Astro Park building.
This 20-year-old complex, named after its star-shaped plan, houses, among other things, the headquarters of the Confederation of the Electronic and Electrotechnical Industry.
Expulsion of the server by Amazon - Threats against Mr. Assange
Wikileaks is experiencing more and more difficulties.
The Internet service provider Amazon has expelled from its servers the site specialized in the disclosure of confidential documents.
This attitude may conceal political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic notes.
Wikileaks' founder, Mr. Assange, apparently lives in England.
In the United States, the Wikileaks site is being attacked with increasing force.
The Wikileaks group of cyberactivists no longer has access to its server hosted so far in America and is now looking for a host in Europe.
Meanwhile, the prominent U.S. Senator, Joe Lieberman, called on other countries and businesses to boycott Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is wanted by Interpol, is probably staying in Britain, according to newspaper reports.
"Wikileaks excluded from Amazon server."
"Freedom of expression in the country of freedom", said on Wednesday (local time) cyberactivists at the origin of the revelations via the social network Twitter.
Shortly before, the e-business, Amazon, had deleted Wikileaks documents from its servers.
Following the publication of the secret diplomatic notes, cyberactivists used the Amazon Web Service (AWS) to reach as many access to documents as possible.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks continues his revelations: "Forbidden, our dollars are now spent on caring for people in Europe."
When freedom of expression poses a problem for Amazon, "they should stop selling books".
CNN, citing Mr. Liebermann's office, reported that Amazon banned Wikileaks from using its servers after the investigation by Senator Joe Lieberman's collaborators.
The chairman of the Senate Commission for the Protection of the Territory had threatened the Amazon site to orchestrate a boycott against it, reported the British newspaper, "The Guardian".
"I would have liked Amazon to take this step earlier in view of previous Wikileaks publications of classified information," the honourable senator said.
At the same time, Mr Liebermann called on other countries to refuse the use of servers by the platform.
"Wikileaks acts illegally, monstrously and unscrupulously. In doing so, it puts our national security at risk and endangers life all over the world," said an independent senator's statement.
"No company aware of its responsibilities, whether American or foreign, should help Wikileaks to disseminate the contents of stolen documents."
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr Assange, who is wanted by the Swedish authorities because he is suspected of rape, is on the list of people wanted by Interpol.
According to information from the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian lives in Britain and Scotland Yard knows exactly where he is.
The cyber-activist has constantly described as intrigues orchestrated by his detractors the prosecutions brought against him by Sweden.
Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that threats were made against the site.
"Calls have even been issued for the murder of Julian Assange."
That's why Assange fears especially for his safety, said Hrafnsson.
That's also why Wikileaks' founder continues to hide.
Hrafnsson was clearly responding to statements made in North America.
In America, former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, demanded that those responsible for Wikileaks' revelations be prosecuted and executed for treason.
In Canada, the advisor to the Head of Government, Mr. Stephen Harper, said on television, clearly ironically, that Mr. Assange should "be killed" and that Mr. Obama could "use a Drone."
Meanwhile, a controversy broke out between the White House and Mr. Assange.
Robert Gibbs, spokesman for US President Barack Obama, described as "ridiculous and absurd" the fact that Mr. Assange demanded the resignation of Secretary of State Hilary Clinton if she was responsible for the order given to diplomats, and recently disclosed, to engage in espionage activities.
"I don't know exactly why we have to deal with the opinion of an individual who owns a website," says Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than the assertions of a website."
The U.S. government is now fully testing the protection of its databases.
According to a White House press release, Mr. Russell Travers, Deputy Director of the Counter-Terrorism Centre, was appointed responsible for combating leaks.
Mr Travers is responsible for putting in place "the necessary structural reforms" made necessary after the disclosure of diplomatic cables by Wikileaks.
The White House also has the will to verify the means by which the entire administration exchanges and protects information.
In addition, the U.S. government announced that it wanted to take care of the security of dissidents and activists if they were ever threatened by Wikileaks' revelations.
"We have made every effort to get in touch with them," said State Department spokesman Philip Crowley.
"We are prepared to protect them if necessary."
The University of Ice
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna, ice confectioners are prepared for the best seasons of the year.
The three-day induction course for future glaciers was very successful and attracted visitors from all over the world.
By the way, where did all the ice come from?
Glacier and ice machine.
The glacier, that is, in German the slightly outmoded ice-cream confectioner, makes the cream according to all the rules of Italian ice-making art.
The ice turbine removes the ice cream from the refrigerated window using a spatula, disposes it in the waffle and then starts selling it.
To find out, you don't need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to know more about the ice, cannot avoid "Gelato-University" of the Italian firm Carpigiani.
The manufacturer of sorbetières founded the ice university in 2003 so that the ice creams released from its machines meet the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day induction course for future glaciers was very successful and attracted visitors from all over the world.
Special courses on chocolate ice are also offered over several days, and practical sessions are organized in private ice cream.
In the middle of the 40's crisis, a number of people dream of a new career, others simply risk realizing their burning desire on the smooth ice.
This time there were 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia to Hungary.
Jacky, professor of artistic education from California, is proud of the Slow Food movement. He wants to offer a quality European product in the country of Industrial Ice in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a business management consultant and, after a few years, she wants to learn something unique from this hard-working business for her nerves.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening an ice cream shop in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil would like to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars, and the Canadian maid came because her children love Italian ice cream.
The master icemaker Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal characteristics of the perfect ices.
Not only good flavor is decisive, but also silky flexibility and good consistency.
However, Luciano does not forget during the training the cherry on the cake of the national superstructure and, in general, from the south: "Italian ice is simply the best: and then it still retains a sacred dose of romanticism."
The first step in manufacturing seems quite simple.
Luciano pours the basic ingredients, such as milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large blender that heats up to 85 degrees by means of an electronic program, then immediately cools to four degrees.
It then opens a tap installed on the machine: it comes out a pasteurized white base cream, the foundation of all kinds of milk ice cream.
The trainer is immediately attacked by a question: Is it possible to make ice using only natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can one give free course to the personal pleasure of experimentation?
Luciano warns against being misled by the spirit of time.
Anyone who speaks only of ice "made from natural ingredients" may have used stabilizers: most often a natural product, e.g. guar seed flour obtained from guar beans.
It is obviously possible to make ice without using a stabilizer, only to sell it within 24 hours, otherwise it collapses and the customer will not chew anything but ice pellets.
Some changes in the base mass are permitted.
This becomes more exciting with aromas.
Master Luciano makes the difference between the ingredients that are acquired in the fruit or confectionery department of the supermarket.
In addition, there is powder and pasta.
"the suppliers will all try to give you dozens of flavoured ingredients."
"However, you should just try."
Either in the fruit sorbet recipes with sugar and fresh fruit.
Either in ice creams made from the white base mass which, by adding eggs to it, becomes a yellow cream and, when adding cocoa powder, forms the basis of all possible chocolate desserts.
Now, all participants in the course must switch to the use of ice machines.
Luciano invites them from time to time to make four kinds of ice cream: vanilla, chocolate, moka and hazelnut with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla flavor or other natural ingredients.
The different kinds of fruit ice creams are also subject to the same experience.
More aromatic substances, more fruit purées: from the point of view of taste, this is not absolutely better.
Hazelnut ice does not necessarily taste like nuts, when it consists largely of hazelnuts.
Kiwi ice, very popular, is made from the group using more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
"Only a balanced mixture correctly raises the taste of an ice," Luciano says.
Icemaking is a calculation exercise: if you use fishing mashed with lots of sugar, the amount of sugar must be reduced in the basic recipe.
A sugar supplement is needed for lemon ice cream.
Luciano presents a device with which it determines the sugar content of the different types of fruit (the winegrowers use it to measure the degree of Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, the tables facilitate calculations.
The manufacture of ice no longer requires, as in the past, as much physical intervention.
It is not only the machine of automatic manufacture of the base mass that helps.
There is also a device that simultaneously beats the available ice mixture to make it smooth and bring it back to negative temperatures.
Despite all automations, slight failures are not excluded.
The Brazilian Gustavo shaves with fruit purée from head to toe and, thus, splashes his fellow students when the control of the colossal mixing bowl escapes him.
Master Luciano is of the opinion that such an "incident is likely to occur during each course: it is only a matter of time."
Controllers in an ambiguous position
According to some sources, the industry experimenting with the cultivation of genetically modified plants has cored the European Food Safety Authority.
This accusation is now formulated by the Testbiotech expert group, which is considered an independent institute for the assessment of the consequences of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we're getting a lot of information," said Mr. Christoph Then, Testbiotech Director, in Munich on Wednesday.
Some information indicates that the Chair of the Efsa Expert Group on Genetically Modified Plants, Mr. Harry Kuiper, and other Efsa experts are under contract with the Ilsi Pressure Group.
The latter is funded by groups such as Monsanto, Nestlé and Bayer.
Mr. Kuiper has been instrumental in developing the Efsa test requirements for genetically modified plants and is therefore clearly in a situation of conflict of interest, according to the criticisms made by Mr. They.
The requirements developed correspond textually, by paragraph, to the positions taken by the pressure group Ilsi and thus bear the mark of the industry which, at the bottom, would be controlled by the authorities installed in Parma in Italy.
This is already the second time that Testbiotech has denounced a conflict of interest.
A senior Efsa official recently joined the Swiss food group Syngenta without conditions or transitional period. In doing so, she changed camp.
A short time ago, even Central German Radio (Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk, MDR) had revealed the existence of personal relations between the European Union supervisory authority and the industrial lobby, which aroused suspicions both from the German Federal Environment Agency and from MEPs.
However, the Efsa does not admit the existence of any conflict of interest.
An opinion indicates that all reliable data, including industry data, are used as long as they are of good professional quality.
Experts working on behalf of Efsa are not prohibited from making contact with this sector of activity.
But they should make them public.
Mr. Kuiper admits that he works for the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) based in the United States.
This body is seen as a neutral forum for experts who, among other things, belong to the field of science, industry and policy in order to assess the risks of biotechnology without being at the expense of a lobby.
In this case, independent experts such as Mr. They disagree with the fact that genetically modified plants are accepted without any feeding trials in animals and that the impact of these plants on the environment has not been tested.
"We want to know what, for example, the effects of genetically modified maize cause in the field," says Mr.
The current practice is to test only isolated proteins and not the entire genetically modified plant, which does not produce reliable results.
"If we don't look for the risks, how can we find them?" asks Mr. Then about an accusator tone.
That is also Mrs Angelika Hilbeck's point of view.
This scientist has been carrying out research in the field of genetics since 1994 and is currently working at the Polytechnic School in Zurich.
In this region, as in the United States, and now also in Europe, the industry sector is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists.
For this reason, there are hardly any researchers who are not linked to societies.
In the opinion of companies, critical studies would not be published.
Ms Hilbeck said that "the industry controls safety research".
The Stone Trace
Uli Gsell obtained some 400 kilos.
On Monday afternoon, she was in front of Stuttgart train station with her tube on her back.
There was a demonstration.
It was snowing.
The story is known: By September, the excavators had come and started to demolish much of the north wing.
The world of Stuttgart was no longer the same: several thousand people protested against the S21 project, the transformation of the central station of Stuttgart into an underground station that will cost several billion.
Much of the wing was in ruins when the demonstrations resulted in the shutdown of construction work.
Broken into 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
The Muschelkalk (the shell limestone) of Crailsheim, a soft and coarse pavement poorly built between 1914 and 1920.
Mr. Gsell is a 43-year-old sculptor residing in Ostfildern.
He got a few fragments of it.
"These stones are relics."
"They must not disappear."
He says with enthusiasm: "a modest, cheap, simple and terrestrial rock."
He claimed that by cutting it with a saw, he felt the smell of cigarette smoke.
He still doesn't know what he'll do with this fragment.
The rocks have time.
Uli Gsell too.
the traces of the stones of Stuttgart lead to an old ammunition depot of the French army in a forest near Tubingue, where Manuel Rongen built his empire of stones.
This 44-year-old man trades old stones.
He bought all the stones from the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were crushed or disappeared in the dump," he says in his office in a hut, which was once a guard post.
He reports that he was insulted and threatened when in September the newspapers reported that he had bought the rest of the north wing from the demolition company.
But he negotiated for days with the opponents of the S21 project.
And he explained to them that he could do nothing to oppose the demolition.
And if it happens, then the most reasonable thing would be to continue using the stones.
Approximately 200 opponents of the S21 project later took one of the stone parallelepipede weighing an average of 80 kilos with a value of between 6.50 and 14 Euros.
Some keep it as a souvenir while hoping also to be able to return it during a reconstruction.
Rongen had acquired 500 tons, 25 full loads of a truck.
About half of them are still crowded in the forest, the rest of which has been sold for a long time.
Owners of gardens, landscape gardeners, Private individuals.
They came from all over and took everything they could get into the trunk and the trailers.
These scandal stones of Stuttgart have for a long time been transformed into "Mäuerle" or into limitations of grass shelves.
"By the way, this stone is nothing special," says Mr. Rongen.
"hadn't been that political component."
He enters his car all the way, he goes around his vast empire of 20 hectares.
He did some law studies that he dropped out of. Later, he began to study biology before eventually becoming interested in computer science and eventually becoming a carrier.
And a stone lover.
The warehouse stores 40,000 tons.
He collects treasures everywhere in Germany.
He claims that he is the greatest merchant of ancient stones.
He's slowing down.
Sandstones carved with art are laid on the snow.
"They were once part of the Marienbrücke Bridge in Dresden."
Elbsandstein, yellow, warm, he says with enthusiasm.
"My favorite stone."
He takes the path that goes up through the forest.
It shows a pile of finger: Stone of red sand, formerly part of the Karlsruhe station.
And so on.
"Nice travertine."
The parallelpiped was once part of the gallery of the Stuttgart Neckarstadion.
Everywhere in the snow of stones and stories, the travertine of Cannstatt from the police prefecture, the reddish granite from the Cathedral of Saint Blasien, the tuf from the hospital of Heilbronn.
What work, what efforts, what sweat!
When Mr. Rongen thought that the stones were once hand-carved and moved with simple sticks and carts pulled by oxen, he became quite respectful.
"It would be a scandal if such a heritage were to be destroyed."
He didn't get rich, even less rich.
But this carrier now employs 14 people. In addition, stone tailors, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glass blower and a gardener settled in the forest.
"We work hard, but it's rewarding," says the waste recycler.
Soon, he has to go to Cologne.
There too, there are stones to save.
Fighting talent to conquer high potentials
The counter is very busy.
16 students are busy buying salmon buns, tomato sauce and white-eaters.
The technical university of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Volkswagen invited students in design and mechanical engineering to a workshop.
As part of a kind of competition of ideas, they have to talk business about the car of the future with VW designers, and, by the way, know the Volkswagen company.
Nowadays, many companies do not hesitate to go to the body by body in the competition to find better brains and to engage, like Volkswagen, in a multifaceted cooperation with universities.
Their mission: To recruit the most talented graduates as much as possible in the amphitheatres before they reach the job market and are courted by others.
And since universities do not publish statements about the performance of their students, we try to identify and retain outstanding talents in practical projects.
On the second day of the workshop organized at the technical university of Brauschweig the automotive group amated talents.
A young lady in the staff service shares the pens, candy and cards with the Volkswagen logo.
She talks about the schedule of professional internships and student jobs for young talents; she shows them the paths to access the group's premises.
Nico Selle of the Technical University of Braunschweig is responsible for the project with Volkswagen.
For him, there are reciprocal advantages for both parties: "Students come into contact with this industrial sector and gain experience."
"As for the Volkswagen group, he can get to know the students, look more closely at the serious candidates and appreciate those who take into account as a collaborator."
According to Mr.Selle, such cooperation is unusual.
What's new is the offensive we're trying to attract students with.
"In the past, the focus was on the professional project," says Selle.
The struggle for the conquest of new graduates will become much harsher.
In goods in sectors, companies can no longer recruit their employees by sorting on a kyrielle of candidates.
But they must boast of their reliability and, above all, court the highly skilled workforce.
It is mainly graduates from engineering fields who are in an excellent position to negotiate.
According to the association of German engineers VDI, more than 40,000 engineering positions remained unoccupied in October.
And according to VDI's forecasts, the vacuum for engineering positions will widen further.
Roman Dykta goes to the talent hunt on behalf of KPMG, audit firm, accounting and consulting expertise.
It organizes expensive events aimed at recruiting talent, such as the KPMG-Race cruise race, a kind of rally-paper where competitors have to find their way with GPS coordinates.
The company will thus send eight promising students next year so that they will travel through the United States in this way.
Participants may also visit KPMG's subsidiaries and know the company.
The person to participate in the selection process shall decide in advance after two selection procedures.
Only the cream of the many candidates will fly to the United States.
According to Mr Dykta, the means used for the search for high potentials in universities are increasingly important.
"We want to emerge from the lot through the cruise race."
"For us, a simple cruise was too little."
For the talent hunter Mr. Dykta, the count seems to be there.
"To this day, we have remained in contact with all those who took part in a similar action last year."
"Some of them are about to complete their studies and want to apply to our company soon," he says.
Apart from the direct crowding on campus, small and medium-sized enterprises are doing their business in a very classic way by taking part in the trade fairs where they hunt for brains.
"We try to reach the graduates by participating in the trade fairs."
"For example, at the solar technology fair," says Sita Stübe, Director of Human Resources at Solarworld, a manufacturer of photovoltaic panels.
This company based in Bonn employs about 1500 people in Germany.
Mrs Stübe is aware of the problem of succession.
Currently, 35 positions are placed in the competition on the company's website.
"At the moment, it is very difficult to fill vacancies."
"It costs a lot of money and takes a lot of time," he says?
Another way to make contact is through university professors.
Solarworld has established cooperation with various higher education institutions, for example, the University of Fribourg.
"Teachers indicate that the student has the opportunity to undertake professional internships or to write his or her completion project at home."
Onerous advertising campaigns are announced among solar specialists.
This is why the company tries to advertise by highlighting other qualities: personalized atmosphere, flat hierarchy and easy communication.
"Often, a large group cannot do this," says Ms Stübe, Chief of Staff.
Money has long since lost its primary role in job search.
Flexible working hours, child care or good promotion opportunities are the other determining factors.
According to a study conducted by the Great Place to Work Institute, Solarworld ranks 55th among Germany's top 100 employers.
The Institute is an annual honour table for German employers.
To this end, he asked employees about their level of satisfaction with their work and context while looking at the framework conditions of employees.
The Head of Personnel Mrs Stübe hopes that this placement will enhance the image of the company with job seekers.
"I think that candidates rely primarily on external evaluations for a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of German Academy DEBA (Deutscher Employee Branding Akademie, DEBA) advises companies that want to build a good reputation as an employer by applying a long-term strategy.
He advises his clients to show more authenticity.
And, according to Mr Kriegler, this means first and foremost taking internal measures.
"The best way for an employer to become attractive is to go through his own employees," he says.
This is called, according to the jargon used in the sector, the internal image strategy, i.e. the creation of the employer's brand image within its own workforce.
"satisfied employees are the best messengers."
When they treat their employees well and identify with the company, they advertise their employer to their friends and acquaintances on their own.
"It's like playing in an orchestra," says Mr. Kriegler.
Obama Stops New Oil Drilling · Global Voices
There will be no new oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Florida, southeastern United States, in the coming years.
The Washington government has issued a ban An equivalent ban and thus permanently cancels its original plans.
Even off the Atlantic coast, new drilling remains prohibited for the time being.
Interior Secretary Ken Salazar made this announcement on Wednesday.
It was the explosion in April of the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform that led to this strict ban, which must remain in force at least for the next five years.
Faced with this accident that cost the lives of eleven employees and led to the biggest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and this sector of activity, had indicated his willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
Supporters of this solution thus want to reduce the dependence of the United States on foreign countries in terms of oil supply.
The question of who bears the responsibility for the devastating black tide in golf is not, to date, definitively resolved.
The British oil group, which is facing several billion claims, is at the centre of the charges.
A commission of inquiry set up by Obama must present its findings in December.
In October, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar lifted the freeze of the drilling decreed after the platform exploded.
As a result of this decision, various oil groups had immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With tighter controls and tighter security orders, Obama and Salazar want to prevent a new catastrophe.
The competent supervisory authority, which has discredited itself after numerous allegations of corruption, is currently undergoing extensive reforms.
At the same time, Obama announced that they would remove the lucrative tax niches of gas and oil groups.
The actors in this sector of activity now publicly warn against the fact that the flow of power in the Gulf would be significantly lower than has been the case so far.
"The government's objective is to put a stop to the rapid growth of the oil and gas sector" according to the result of a current survey carried out in the sector by the BDO audit firm, before the ban on drilling pronounced on Wednesday.
Moreover, the American Enery Alliance deplores the uncertainty that characterizes this sector: "No one knows exactly what will change with regulation."
Investments in new support projects have been postponed until further notice, to the detriment of growth.
The Ogoni country is dry
The water that flows into the rivers is oiled brown; it emits a smell similar to that that that exists in the gas station: Due to a leak, billions of litres of crude oil destroyed the Ogoni country in Nigeria.
Men live by theft, corruption and oil refining.
Celestine Akpobari has a good intention.
"Don't exhaust yourself," the environmental activist told journalists to calm them down: "You still have enough oil mud in front of the water lens today."
The 37-year-old Nigerian tried to photograph a young man stuck in muddy water to the chest, as well as the fat sled around him: This scene seems almost beautiful in the radiance of water in the color of the rainbow.
It can't be seen that the basement is full of brown crude oil.
On the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River, Esther Badom tells us that once she collected shrimp by whole buckets here.
But in the meantime, the calm waters have gone completely dry.
Five years ago, a huge amount of oil came out of an oil pipeline that exploded in the huge swamp.
Fishermen living in the nearby small town of Bodo must now row for six hours to reach the fishy waters: The Ogoni country located in the heart of the Niger Delta is considered to be one of the most polluted regions in the world.
The full extent of the ravages jumps into the eyes when you go through the mangrove marshes crossed by streams.
Instead of a clear water, the motor boat splits a Crading brown water. Whoever dives his hand removes it all covered with oil.
The roots of small mangroves emerge from the ground like licorice sticks. The isolated palms sadly let their palms hang.
Bird clouds are sought in vain, as is usually found in wetlands: As soon as the outboard engine stops, a ghostly silence falls on this ancient paradise, which resembles a gas station by the smell it emits.
"What is happening here is a war on the environment," says Mr. Celestine Akpobari in a sad air: "Our life is characterized by a permanent danger to health."
The comparison of wars is made.
The Ogoni region has been a besieged battlefield for decades: More than 60 years ago, the first European explorers entered the region; the first resistance was organized in the 1980s by writer Ken Saro-Wiwa. The latter was executed later. In 1993, the Shell group had to stop its production activities in that region because they had become very dangerous to its employees.
Today again, the return to Ogoni country is forbidden to this society: While more than 2 million barrels of black gold are pumped daily thanks to more than 5000 drilling wells and 7000 kilometres of pipelines throughout the Delta region, three times as big as Switzerland, the oil fields of Ogoni country are untapped, because the situation there is too unstable for this oil group.
Every few hundred meters stand in the water of steel treteaux like strange sculptures: The heads of drilling holes are very affectionately referred to as "Christmas trees".
They are up to 50 years old, most of them are gnawed by corrosion to the mark.
Akpobari believes that a drilling head of this nature breaks from time to time, because a constant flow of crude oil flows into the water.
According to expert estimates, more than two billion litres have spilled over the ecosystem in 50 years: Each year, the amount of oil equivalent to that that that happened in the sea during the accident of the super-oiler "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago off Alaska, one of the greatest environmental disasters in the history of mankind.
Who should bear responsibility for persistent environmental pollution? the answer to this question divides the actors.
For the Shell group, the sabotage and siphoning of the pipelines are responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution. Environmentalists, for their part, consider the blasts of drilling heads and perforated pipelines as the main causes.
In 2008, American researcher Richard Steiner blamed the Shell group for applying substantially lower safety standards to Nigeria than anywhere else in the world: Only the failure rate of the pipelines is "still much higher than theirs".
Some forms emerge from mangroves in a place that, seen from afar, looks like an abandoned workshop, full of camouflage and installed in the open air: They are completely naked and covered with camouflage to the neck.
A fire sparkles under one of the many barrels that sometimes connected to the pipes, sometimes scattered without motif on the site must be spotted: a small underground refinery.
We heat crude oil in the barrel for several hours, explains Michael, the team leader.
At first, gasoline enters a container through pipes, then at the end of the kerosene drip line falls and finally diesel is obtained.
This is how Michael and his four collaborators produce four 300-litre Diesel drums daily: "This brings us 34,000 Naira", about $22.
The people of the Delta benefit from the chronic shortage of fuel in the largest oil-producing country in black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
Illegal refiners can sell at a lower price than the ridiculously low price of just 40 cents of Euro per litre of Diesel: For they acquire their raw materials free of charge.
According to experts, the country loses at least 16 million litres of crude oil throughout the Niger Delta.
Only a very small part of the provisionally stored raw material is illegally purified: The organized crime networks that also include among its members politicians and high-ranking military personnel, charge the lion's share in tankers and brazen it on the world market.
Activist Akpobari considers that the debate on whether to attribute the environmental disaster or rather subversive activities to the population or to the lax mode of production is purely academic.
"If oil companies were not perceived as intruders and if the foundations of fishermen's lives were not so deeply destroyed, there would be no sabotage, no theft and illegal refineries."
In the meantime, however, Ogoni's relations with Shell have deteriorated so much that it was no longer about the withdrawal of the group. "Perhaps operators with other nationalities, such as Chinese, will prove to be better."
So Michael gets nervous.
"It's high time you got rid of it," announces the robust oil worker.
"Soldiers may appear at any time."
If the illegal refiners are surprised by the special units of the armed forces, they will certainly not be arrested, but at most they will offer them bribes.
Even soldiers mainly from the north of the country intend to benefit from raw materials like all Nigerians.
"In any case, this damn thing has brought down our country very low," Akpori regrets.
Investigators discover construction defects in A380 reactors
The A380 clearly suffers from a major security problem.
By examining an aircraft that made an emergency landing, the investigators discovered a possible construction defect that could lead to "catastrophical failure of the reactor."
The Qantas airline now wants to file a complaint against the reactor manufacturer.
At the beginning of November, Airbus passengers belonging to Quantas had so far been visibly more fortunate: In its investigation, the Australian Air Safety Authority found that the reactors of some A380 aircraft presented a serious safety problem, and cautioned against a possible construction failure.
This potential failure could have serious consequences: It can cause fatigue cracks and leaks in connection with the connection of the oil pipe, it is indicated in a position taken published this Thursday by the administration of the ATSB.
It could have led to a "disaster failure of the reactors".
These are the Rolls-Royce reactors and 20 aircraft of the A380 series.
Quantas Airbus, which had to land urgently on 4 November in Singapore, is one of these.
The Australian airline has now initiated legal proceedings against the English reactor manufacturer.
She filed a legal complaint with an Australian federal court based in Sydney, giving her the opportunity to take further legal action against the company.
Quantas Director Alan Joyce stated that his company would claim damages for the incident that occurred in early November.
Parts were detached and the bearing surface damaged during the engine fire.
According to Rolls-Royce, it is the inflammation of oil that causes the damage.
After this incident, at least 40 reactors must now be replaced in the world.
Australian investigators have announced that additional safety tests will be carried out on superjumbos that are also equipped with the reactors in question.
The safety recommendations are the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, ASTB spokesman Martin Dolan said.
The safety issue is considered to be important enough to inform all parties concerned.
After the emergency landing of its aircraft, the airline Quantas had immobilized its entire fleet of A380 on the ground for a week.
Singapore Airlines temporarily immobilized three of its eleven A380.
Lufthansa replaced, as a precautionary measure, the reactor of an A380.
The two-story aircraft is the largest airliner in the world.
Snowfall throughout the country causes chaos in transportation
Germany all covered in white: In one night, snow fell on almost the whole country.
Chaos reigns on all roads, trains and planes are immobilized.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
Winter makes Germany chill: By cold temperatures, almost the entire republic is covered in snow on Thursday night, leading to chaos in many localities.
In the north and east, the snow cover reaches 15 centimetres in places.
Traffic is severely restricted on several motorways and on many roads.
On the A7 in Flensburg, winter service staff worked on a permanent basis, but they couldn't get out of the snow that was constantly piling up.
In addition, violent gusts swept the Baltic Sea coast.
The Federal Office for Maritime Navigation and Hydrography (DSH) expects that the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein with water levels of up to 1.2 m above normal will take place during the tsunami.
Snow heaps on highways and federal roads have caused serious problems in Saxony.
That's why the Weather Alert Center Metemomedia announced the level of violet alert was announced in Saxon Switzerland: in fact, it is the highest level.
In places, it fell 30 centimetres of fresh snow that the strong and cool winds dispersed.
Several trucks and cars were stuck there at night.
Even in the Saxe-Anhalt Land, police authorities have announced serious disturbances on the roads.
On the A2 motorway, snow and wind caused traffic disruption and corks.
In Thuringia, snowfalls hit motorways A4 and A9.
According to the Deutscher Bahn, serious disruptions of rail traffic took place in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are snow on railways, trees falling on railways, catenaries or destroyed needles.
In Saxony, interregional transport in Leipzig-Nuremberg had to be halted.
In Sallfeld, Thuringia, an ICE train to Munich had to stop its journey.
Firefighters and paramedics had to supply the 165 passengers on the train with blankets, food and drinks.
Snow winds swept the roads.
Snowfalls have resulted in numerous flight cancellations at Germany's major airports.
According to a standard spokesman and flight information, some cancellations are already announced in Munich.
A spokesman for Fraport indicates that 40 flights have already been cancelled in Frankfurt on the Main.
The winter service provides a permanent service.
It is true that passengers trapped at the airport are no longer numerous, although only 400 beds are available.
Accidents occurred on many roads on Wednesday afternoon.
In the evening in Ostholstein, a truck driver lost his life in a collision with a train at a level crossing.
The driver of the train was slightly injured.
Due to the snow layers on the roads, a similar accident occurred not far from Nuremberg: even here, a truck was hopped to a level crossing because the vehicle was immobilized there.
The driver lost his life.
Four passengers were injured in the train, which is why the road from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was closed until morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died when her car barreled on a slippery road in Aschaffenburg.
However, meteorologists announce good news: Snow will always be soft and powdery, but it will whirl in case of slight gusts.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea will be plagued by rapid and violent winds.
However, it is very cold, up to less than 15 degrees in places.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers.
The Deutsche Bank seeks to separate itself from its emblem: According to reports from newspapers, this financial institution is looking for buyers for its two office buildings located at its seat in Frankfurt.
This building could bring up to 500 million euros.
The Deutsche Bank has just embellished the group's headquarters: The twin towers located in the Business District have been upgraded; meanwhile, the bankers had to return to their former place of service.
From now on, the financial group clearly seeks to recover the costs of renovations and it is looking for a buyer for its two buildings, as the newspaper "Financial Times Deutschland" quotes a spokesman.
The Spokesman did not indicate the reasons for the planned sale.
He said "we check whether it is more interesting to occupy the buildings ourselves or to sell them, and to rent them again later."
For example, Germany's largest financial institution has already given up its head office shortly thereafter.
It was only in mid-2007 that the bank had acquired the twin towers for an amount of EUR 272 million from the holders of own funds and then rehabilitated them.
Energy optimisation transformations have, according to some indications, swallowed around EUR 200 million.
A sale would obviously bring a lot of money to the bank.
According to information provided by the newspaper, experts in this sector estimate the value of the towers, renamed in the meantime "Green Towers", at about 500 million Euros.
According to the Spokesman, it is currently unclear whether the real estate will be sold again to a bank-owned fund or an independent investor.
Thousands of people mourn the miners who have perished.
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people have had a thought for the buried miners who have been declared dead as a result of several explosions in a mine.
We had not yet been able to reassemble the bodies because the safety situation of the disaster well continues to be precarious.
Just two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred in Pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 minors between the ages of 17 and 62 had been buried underground.
A probe had been introduced into the disaster well, but no trace of survivors had been found.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and other explosions that followed, no rescue teams were able to descend into the mine for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and the administration had considered that minors no longer had a chance to survive.
So far, the bodies couldn't be reassembled.
Today, parents and friends organized a feast in memory of the dead.
Thousands of people had gathered under a bright sun in Greymouth south of New Zealand Island.
They observed two minutes of silence.
In memory of the 29 buried miners, 29 tables were installed on which the names, helmets and lamps could be seen.
Photos and personal effects, including clothing and surfboards, were also included.
The flags were set in jeopardy in front of all the public buildings in the country.
New Zealand's Prime Minister John Key told the participants at the commemorative celebration that New Zealand had nurtured the hope that the miners would rise to the surface.
"But they never came home."
Mr. Lawrie Drew whose son Zen was buried in the pits stated that he cannot resign to accept his son's death until he has seen his remains.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the relatives of the victims, several foreign diplomats took part in the commemorative celebration.
Minors of South African and British origin also buried during the first explosion on 19 November.
The rescue workers began to extinguish a fire inside the coal mine on the South Island of New Zealand.
Police chief Gary Knowles told journalists that when the masses of explosive gases are displaced, the burning temperatures inside the mine begin to fall.
Go to hell, warrior!
Is the movie Splatter an artificial film?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn explores the boundaries of the ancient genre through his film, "Walhalla Rising", the combatant's epic.
Which audience was the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn able to think by turning "Walhalla Rising"?
A Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) with only one eye is made prisoner; he frees himself from his executioner and, with almost supernatural force, eliminates his opponents one after another. This seems ideal for young male spectators in search of a bloody action, precisely because our hero uses brutal methods of murder. When he is in a bad mood, he rips out the intestines of his enemies without waiting for them to die.
On the other hand, until the end of the film, the bogne does not say a word about its real name. Even the other characters let escape, at most, to the detour of one or two sentences some horrific cries of agony.
Otherwise, nothing is said and celebrated in Scotland's incredibly beautiful mountain landscape, which is the setting of the Viking universe about a thousand years ago.
It would be more ideal for mature filmmakers with an interest in existentialism and excellent travel.
When a film targets several target groups, it is a pity that they mutually exclude each other.
The director Winding Refn has been considered, since the release of "Pusher", his trilogy relative to the drug dealer fierce and full of style, as a sort of Danish Quentin Tarantinon, but he refuses to bring a little more mood to the mainstream or introduce a little less brutality to the art and essay cinema.
Most art cinema sympathizers must experience horror in the face of the brain that spreads all around and to the intestines.
Action movie lovers die of boredom, when the bogina embarks, for reasons that can be freely interpreted, with a group of violent Christian missionaries on a ship to Jerusalem; they are drowned for an eternity by calm and mist before the crew arrives in America and continues to remain silent.
It is not surprising then that "Walhalla Rising" did not find any film distributors in Germany and that it exists only in DVD format.
It is mainly because of the magnificent images of poverty that deserve some attention, but also because the image of a thrilling film, from time to time, hides behind a pretentious and bloody appearance.
It is not about dialogue in this film, nor about coherent action, everything is atmosphere, a feverish dream transformed into film.
The viewer can't escape.
Refn barely gives him a moment of relaxation and slowly cuts his throat with icy images and a gloomy soundtrack, but above all with an elusive hatred that comes out of the hearts of the characters.
Only a young blond boy, who stands loyally beside the bogne, preserves a certain innocence, all the others are animated by anger.
More than anything else, the staggering hero whose motives are never known, but who returns from hell at any time to fight enemies and temporarily allies by turning himself into a warrior, is perhaps sent from the devil himself.
It represents rot, but perhaps also, only for those who are, in any case, rot.
"Walhalla Rising" is an enigmatic film that one can hate or admire, which has as its goal the appeasement, enthusiasm and astonishment.
It's a traumatic experience.
Mysterious works of earthing
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has new indications regarding a nuclear programme developed by Syria.
But this country refuses to take a position on this subject, let alone submit to the Agency's controls.
On the night of 5 to 6 September 2007, around midnight, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter aircraft attacked a mysterious cubic-shaped building on Syrian territory.
It is located on the bank of the Euphrates; the largest town in the vicinity is 30 kilometres away: it is Dair as-Sur.
Its name is included in the IAEA documents, as it refers to the reactor that Syria has built with the help of North Korea in stone parallelepiped, hidden in a valley marked by the absence of electricity.
According to a briefing by the U.S. intelligence services, the CIA, dating from late April 2008, the current reactor, known as the neighbouring locality, al-Kibar, would be well suited to producing plutonium, which would make atomic weapons.
On the other hand, this technique has been valid since the 1950s.
The CIA showed a presentation video featuring blurred satellite images.
Through computer-assisted animation, it indicated the likely location of each component of the reactor prior to the destruction of the power plant, which represents a miniature copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
In addition, she presented the photos showing the building located nearby, or even the interior of it.
It seems that the reactor was about to be put into operation, but it was not yet equipped with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the Israeli bombardment, little more information is available than at the time, and even, over time, the mystery thickens more and more.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that prior to this attack, the CIA was certain that Syria had built a reactor in al-Kibar, but had little evidence to show that the country was developing "an active nuclear weapons program."
Some intelligence officers in Europe prefer to be more cautious about this and speak only of a "presumed reactor", even though they regard the CIA's presentation as "plausible".
They lack tangible evidence, as well as the IAEA.
Asked how he ensured that he was dealing with a nuclear reactor, a senior United Nations diplomat gave only a laconic answer in the summer, claiming that the IAEA had "sufficient documents to ask questions".
The Syrians certainly hastened to remove the rubble of the "unused military building" and proceeded to a methodical flattening of the ground.
However, in June 2008, a team of IAEA experts led by former Chief Inspector Oli Heinonen discovered traces of uranium produced by men at al-Kibar.
In addition, the IAEA received from a Member State satellite images from commercial providers showing the moment that directly followed the attack. It seems that the latter are more eloquent than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photos are not available on the market because the anonymous sponsor, perhaps Israel, acquired them exclusively.
It is therefore impossible for the IAEA to establish their authenticity objectively.
Syria has always assured that it has never carried out a secret atomic program and that it has not built a reactor.
Damascus claims that the uranium found on the site comes from weapons used by Israel.
But the IAEA rejected this argument after the particle analysis, calling it improbable.
Since then, damas has refused to discuss this issue, as well as satellite images.
In addition, Syria does not allow controllers to carry out a second inspection at the El-Kibar site and refuses access to the rubble of the building destroyed by the bomb.
But even Israel keeps a stubborn silence.
Confirming the official position, Ehud Olmert, then Prime Minister in office at the time of the attack, recently said: "We will never comment on this."
For example, the investigation into this case has been long since June 2008 without a result being achieved and "is increasingly becoming a serious credibility problem for the Agency", as recognized by a senior Western diplomat serving at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna, this is ultimately a serious violation of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.
The IAEA considers that in order to achieve progress, it is necessary to clarify the existence of the other three facilities which must have "functional relationship" with the alleged reactor.
So far, the inspectors have not indicated what facilities they are dealing with here, or what their function or what they are suspected of containing.
According to information published by the newspaper "Süddeutsche Zeitung", they are known within the IAEA respectively as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah also by the name of neighbouring cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington identified these localities and discovered on satellite images a complex near Masyaf that would most likely be one of the suspicious objects.
It may be located in or directly next to a military base; that is exactly why Syria refuses access to the IAEA inspectors at all three sites.
In Vienna, it is said that Syrians fear that the inspection group will in fact be spies who would be sent on behalf of the United States by the IAEA to spy on military installations.
In fact, it is intelligence provided by U.S. secret agents that attracts the attention of nuclear inspectors.
The IAEA has information, including satellite photos, indicating that vehicles have made shuttles between the three sites and the stone parallelepipede to transport substances.
A high-ranking Western diplomat said in Vienna that at least one of the facilities could "serve fuel production".
It would have no "indications about sensitive activities", such as enrichment and reprocessing of uranium; processes that are indispensable to the production of atomic weapons.
This type of reactor certainly works thanks to unenriched uranium.
Nevertheless, there are plausible assumptions about the following fundamental issues: where uranium should have come from and where the plutonium needed to make the bomb would have been separated later.
It is not known whether the rubble, which could hide traces of high value, has been stored at all three sites.
Once the hundreds of trucks loaded with land have disappeared, no information will be available on the location of the gravel storage.
For the IAEA, it is unlikely that Syria had examined in 1998 the al-Tibni salt mine, located only a few kilometres from al-Kibar, on the other side of the Euphrates, to see whether it could be suitable for the storage of radioactive waste.
In a recent analysis of satellite photos taken on behalf of the famous Jane's Intelligence Review magazine, the former IAEA inspector, Robert Kelley established a link between them and the reactor in question.
Satellite photos, however, show that Syria has undertaken grounding work at the three suspicious sites and moved huge containers when the IAEA began to demand access to these sites.
It may be a coincidence, but this has not helped to rule out suspicion.
He said in the diplomatic community that the IAEA had spent several months drawing up a plan for the inspections to be carried out there, which was intended to enable Syria to preserve possible military secrets, and only the time spent showed how much interest the inspectors had in the matter.
Meanwhile, Damascus also ignored this proposal.
A year ago, if Western diplomats in Vienna had not mentioned the destruction of the reactor, the urgency would not be reported in this case, says, for example, Glyn Davies, the United States ambassador who for the past few months has mentioned what is known as special inspections, one of the most powerful means available to the Atomic Agency to implement its controls.
The IAEA director, Mr. Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, has, of course, already mentioned "an option to which I am open in the future", but he still hesitates.
This means a huge risk: on the one hand, it requires a majority in the IAEA Board of Governors and many of the 35 countries represented in it have no desire to see the situation escalate.
on the other hand, like this diplomat who gives thought: "It would be useful for this, if in the end they find nothing"
Love in Time of War
It's been bad since Angelina Jolie made her debut as director in the summer.
She wrote the script herself: it is a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a man of Serbian origin.
We don't know anything more about this story, but that's enough to cause discomfort.
A persistent rumour indicates that the woman, a Muslim, fell in love with her Serbian executioner during the war in Yugoslavia.
The federations of Bosnian women immediately protested. In response, some shooting sequences planned in Sarajevo were moved in the last minute to Hungary.
Meanwhile, the film is shot in Hungary, but in the post-production phase, protests are still continuing in Bosnia.
According to information published in a Bosnian newspaper, Bakira Hasecic of the organization of women victims of war sent a correspondence to Angelina Jolie through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and she demanded to meet the actress. Jolie herself is a goodwill ambassador of UNHCR.
She is not a diplomat. A few weeks ago, she proposed to these women to meet with them in Hungary, but they declined this offer.
"The meeting must take place in Bosnia," says Hasecic.
There have been no love stories in the concentration camps, and Jolie's script tells a long story about her attitude towards the victims.
The Guardian reports that Hasecic's organization subsequently recommended to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights that he withdraw the status of Ambassador of Goodwill to Angelina Jolie.
But, by the way, what kind of scenario did Jolie write?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which received copies of its script, granted a permit to shoot in Sarajevo after a few hesitations, but it is not known why it did not come after this permit.
The young author herself assures that she does not pursue political objectives with her film, that it is by making a lot of efforts that she has become aware of the Yugoslav conflict. She maintains that she wants to highlight the terrible consequences of the war and give all the parties involved the opportunity to express themselves.
However, it remains vague about the content.
This is how a second synopsis of the film circulates on the Net. It is quite different: Lovers knew each other well before the beginning of the war. They meet again when the woman, a Bosnian Muslim, is deported to the Serbian concentration camp where the man works as a guardian.
This still makes a big difference with the version "a rape victim falls in love with his executioner".
That Jolie's movie started long before the war, of course.
The pressure exerted on her, Jolie says, is "unfair and based on wrong information".
Now, only Hollywood fanatics can bring him peace: By illegally putting this scenario on the Net, like many others before.
Let's get out of here!
Tonight, everything's fine again with the Irish.
There's no sign of dismay.
This is why the local team overly dominates visitors from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
Fans scream with joy at the bottom of loud music, they trembling feet.
Baileyu-Pub from Cork in southern Ireland vibrates because players launch and manage to drop table tennis balls at a distance of three meters in beer cups from the opposing team.
This weird show is called "pong beer." The winner pocketes 500 Euros plus an airplane ticket allowing him to attend in January in Las Vegas at the world championship of pong beer.
Cian Tanner is a quiet individual; this subtle drinking game and the reserved computer scientist, these two behaviors really don't go well together.
And yet, despite this, the 26-year-old seeks to have fun, to turn away from the terrible question, which will lead to the future.
The pleasure of playing in Las Vegas is not part of his projects. In January, he will lead hiring interviews in New Zealand.
"I have a strange feeling," he says.
"The home country is so far away, and I don't have a job."
Finally: His girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland, "in less than two, she got her desired job as an event project manager, perhaps a good sign," the young man smiled.
Due to the bleak prospects in the country, two of Tanner's three sisters tried their luck abroad.
Her sister Yvonne, a social worker, resides in Sydney, her brother Colin now holds a position as a computer consultant in London.
Young people leave: The situation of most families living on the island is similar to that of tanners.
Experts from the Institute for Economic and Social Research indicate that 100,000 Irish will soon leave their country.
They even expect 200,000 emigrants by 2015.
This represents a huge loss for a small country of 4.5 million inhabitants.
If these forecasts are achieved, it will be a current of emigration comparable to that suffered by Ireland in the 1980s.
After a decade of economic boom in which the Irish enjoyed great ease, grief has now taken its place.
The economic crisis is, however, particularly affecting well-trained young Irish people who have experienced only moments of happiness so far.
The loss of employment and social deprivation seemed absurd in the years of economic boom.
Everyone had a job, there's too much money.
In the meantime, however, three out of ten people under the age of 30 are unemployed.
The Irish Times published a lot of letters from readers written by young emigrants, who complained: "In Ireland, everything is drifting away."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but the one who has the opportunities, goes away and our country so a whole generation."
"The last one to leave will turn off the light."
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Student Union, sees a darker future as the government just throws powder in the eyes and offers no prospects for the future for young people.
"They reduce minimum wages, but they have no strategy to create new jobs," says the 20-year-old student.
She sees how her comrades crawl from one unpaid practical internship to another.
She says that it is her biggest concern to emigrate herself in four years.
"It's a sad and depressing thought."
However, men like Stephen McLarnon try to approach this theme positively.
McLarnon organizes the trade show "WorkingAbroadExpo" which offers full support on the theme "Working Abroad".
"But work abroad is an extraordinary opportunity for new people in the profession to take the first steps in the professional hierarchy," says the manager.
Its website shows photos of surfers in Australia and snow surfers in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a galley, but it also guarantees freedom and pleasure.
For six months, Seán O'Donovan has known what it means to be based elsewhere.
Since there was nothing more to be done in Ireland for this 29-year-old engineer, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues in the construction sector and Germany.
A fashion house just came out of the ground in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he will continue to work on other Hannover or Berlin projects.
Meanwhile, O'Donovan rarely visits his home country, as he participates in an additional workstation, in order to be able to complete the repayment of the credit contracted to build his home in his home country.
"The situation is already a little crazy," he says by crossing the threshold of his home for the first time after a long time.
"I make money in Germany to build a house in Ireland where I hardly live anymore."
It bursts from a embarrassed laugh through the cold rooms.
The small house is located in a residential area with well-kept front gardens, expensive cars of great brands are parked on the access roads.
Four years ago, O'Donovan bought the house in common with his sister for an amount of 380,000 Euros, financed at 100 percent by the credit.
"These were moments of madness, without a doubt, money was easy," he says.
Is he afraid that everything will collapse because of the credit?
O'Donovan ponders for a moment, raises hot tea and says: "I don't have children to care for and I'm young; even everything goes wrong, I can go back to scratch."
The building engineer does not like the lamentations he has heard in recent times.
"No one should suffer from hunger, but our situation is not as dramatic as what we once experienced here on the island," he says.
"Working for a while abroad is not what can happen worse, maybe that's what we felt first Irish.
He laughs and then talks about his father who went to England during the last major economic crisis.
"He was back after seven years and, in Ireland, life was just going on."
This idea pleases Cian Tanner.
Leave the future and discover how life happens elsewhere.
In his record, he already has a few years of work in London. That's why life shouldn't be that easy in New Zealand for him and his girlfriend.
But there is one more thing that worries him very much in recent days: the celebration to be held on the occasion of his 27th birthday in Dublin.
He's afraid she can't turn into a good-bye party.
"Only not a lot of emotions," he said, drinking a long sip of beer.
"Good-bye, it still seems worrying."
"Let's call it a good-bye evening, relaxed, gathering some friends, with some drinks and some games."
Democratic routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to increase, as does support for private enterprise.
Crime has become a greater concern than unemployment.
And Brazil is seen as more influential than the United States in much of the region.
These are some of the conclusions of the latest Latinobarometer survey taken in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
As the survey has been conducted on a regular basis since 1995, it follows changes in attitude in the region.
Two related elements emerge from this year's survey, conducted in September and early October.
The first is the rather sunny mood of Latin America.
The second is the growing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased significantly in several countries around the South American Pacific (see table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6% a year since 2002, support for democracy has increased from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also increased in Mexico, where the economy recovered after a sharp decline in production last year.
But only about half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the region, are convinced democrats, which lowers the regional average (see Table 2).
Some 44% of respondents in the region expressed satisfaction with the way their country's democracy worked in practice; this is the same figure as last year but with a strong increase of 25% in 2001 (Chart 3).
Some 34% said they had confidence in their country's parliament and 45% in their government, the same as last year in both cases; but a sharp increase compared to 2003 (respectively 17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, the economic problems in Latin America shook support for democracy.
While this has been successful during the global financial crisis, it is certainly due to the fact that many countries in America have suffered only a short recession and have benefited from a strong recovery.
In addition, a social security network has helped to protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty increased only slightly in 2009 and again decreased this year to 32%.)
But the mood varies considerably from country to country (see Chart 4).
Brazil's good economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, translates into a widely shared sense of progress
This is rarer in Mexico and Central America where the recession has been more severe and violent crimes have worsened.
It is only for the second time since the survey began that more respondents across Latin America as a whole have cited crime rather than unemployment as the most important problem for their country (see Table 5).
Approximately 31% say that they or one of their relatives have been the victims of a criminal act in the past year; however, this figure is down from 38% last year and is the lowest since 1995.
More robust economic performance is reflected in the increase in support for private enterprise and the market economy: about 71% of respondents in the region say that private enterprise is indispensable for development, compared to 56% in 2007 (see Chart 6).
Some 58% believe that the market economy is the only system that will make their country developed, compared to 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela are of this opinion (and 80% support the private company); although their left-wing president, Hugo Chavez, expropriates many private companies.
Brazil is the largest leader in the region, mentioned by 19% of respondents (compared to 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged from last year) and Venezuela (9%, down 11% since last year)
But the United States is considered the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and most of Central America, while Venezuela enjoys this distinction in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A dirty vote
No one expected to have perfect general elections in Haiti on 28 November.
But it was much worse than the outsiders who wanted to help the sinister and fearful country.
Voting boxes and a new ballot were presented, ballots dispersed in the gutters, ransacked polling stations and intimidation.
The polling stations were open late in the evening.
Many Haitians, including many who were displaced as a result of the January earthquake, wandered into the neighbourhood to find where to vote.
Some of them eventually gave up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several alleged supporters, denounced the fraud and called for the cancellation of the election.
Protests, sometimes violent, have exploded across the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the senior official in Haiti of the United Nations, considers the event "a fairly good election in many respects".
Observers for the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community cautiously stated that they "did not believe that these irregularities, however serious, necessarily invalidated the process".
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, whose opponents are indebted to René Préval, unpopular outgoing president, and his candidate, Jude Célestin, must announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The second round expected is scheduled for January.
All hope in the election is not lost.
The two opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rap musician, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, withdrew from their initial appeal for the vote to be declared null.
But there may be problems if Mr.Célestin, who has little or no perceptible support among voters, is declared by the electoral authority to have reached the second turra reached the second round.
With a cholera epidemic raging, and more than 1 million earthquake survivors still living in tents, there was a fear that participation would be.
As a result, many Haitians wanted to vote but were prevented from voting because of the disorganization.
Nearly 250,000 identity cards needed to vote were not yet distributed shortly before the election.
The stakes are important.
Donors see the election of a popular and legitimate government as an important step in Haiti's reconstruction.
And so, of course, Haitians do it themselves.
The tip of the feet towards the center
The weeks after she suddenly became a widow, Cristina Fernández, president of Argentina, benefited from a wave of public sympathy that improved her approval rate by 20 points, to more than 50%; this is her highest level since she was elected in 2007.
However, turning this into a successful campaign for a second term in an election next year might depend on the choice of Mrs Fernández, visibly in mourning, that she would abandon or not abandon the intransigence of her late husband, predecessor and former political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And, in this regard, the signs remain confused.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued to manage economic policy, even after his wife succeeded him as president, used to draw up budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend additional income at will.
Mrs Fernández's government lost its majority in Congress last year, on paper.
But the opposition is divided, and the situation fell into disarray following Mr. Kirchner's death from a heart attack on October 27.
Some of the dissident members of the peronist movement in power joined Mrs. Fernández.
But after chaotic sessions (where one parliamentarian struck one of his peers in the face and others accused the government of corruption), Congress does not have to approve the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to fight," the president said.
At present, the 2010 budget will be applied next year, leaving the President even more room for manoeuvre to spend at will.
The economy is overheating: it is likely to grow by almost 9% this year.
The official inflation rate now stands at 11.1% but many private estimates and union wage claims see this figure as close to 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina feared an economic collapse, made growth and poverty reduction a priority rather than inflation control.
He refused to deal with the IMF, harassed the private sector and purged INDEC, the statistical office, which falsified official inflation statistics.
Can Mrs Fernández now moderate these policies?
She called for talks between private companies and trade union leaders.
And its officials say they want to limit salary increases next year to 18%.
The economy has been stimulated by high world prices of Argentina's agricultural exports.
But inflation eroded the growth boost following a strong devaluation in 2002.
That is perhaps why Mrs Fernández is showing signs of wanting to restore Argentina's financial relations to the rest of the world.
This year, the government entered into an agreement with bondholders who had refused a prior forced debt restructuring for which Argentina had not settled its debts in 2001.
Now Ms Fernández seems to be edging towards an agreement with creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which it owes some $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners have always insisted that this could not involve IMF supervision, as usual.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economy, announced that the Fund would provide "technical assistance" to design a new national index of consumer prices, which resembles a prelude to the sanitation of INDEC.
It is not clear whether Mrs Fernández wants to remain in politics beyond the end of her term, now that her husband is no longer with her.
If it does, it needs to gain support from the middle class, among which Kirchnerism is highly advocated.
When the Argentinians returned from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy for her will have refluenced.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether or not to repudiate, without noise, many of her husband's policies.
A half-hour for China
Taiwanese voters have moved towards a kind of closer union with the continent.
What does Taiwan think of his big brother on the other side of the Strait?
More than 7.5 million voters came forward on November 27, or 70% of eligible people, to elect mayors and councillors in five urban districts, as part of what is considered a general assessment by the President, Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma himself has become a substitute for feelings towards the continent, having forged innovative business ties, including a partial free trade pact, in the largest reorganization of relations with China since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but that's right.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) won three of the five town halls, he failed to win the majority of the votes.
Instead, the Progressive Democratic Party (DPP), which has focused on Taiwan's full independence, has won nearly 50% of all votes for the 45% KMT.
Had this been a presidential election, Mr. Ma would have been in difficulty.
Since he was elected two years ago, his party's voting share has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP attracted voters, even with the KMT in municipal councils.
The event unveiled most of the main topics of the Taiwanese elections, including upholstered country trucks and mass gathering flags with girls dancing in minimal outfits.
An attempted mandatory mysterious assassination was also carried out.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, Honorary President of the KMT, conducted an election tour for a KMT candidate on the eve of the election.
A man from the crowd shot the young Mr. Lien, purely through his face, wounding him and killing a passerby.
Strangely, it was not determined whether the shooter wanted to harm Mr. Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
Anyway, says Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PDP, the murder had consequences on the election by directing suspicion on the DPP and turning voters to the KMT.
Maybe the biggest winner of the election was China.
It was striking to see how absent the question of the continental part itself was.
Instead, the candidates played with plans for public housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates China's military threat.
Thus, the KMT tends to avoid stalling its ties with the Beijing government.
But this time, the DPP has also refrained from stimulating the anti-Chinese sentiment.
This is the response to a new awareness that Chinese companies are indispensable to Taiwan's economic survival.
Mr. Ma, for his part, claimed confirmation as to whether his Chinese policy was acceptable to the Taiwanese majority.
It can be expected that the Beijing government will continue to provide trade facilities, in accordance with its strategy to lure Taiwan back to the fold.
China has not wasted time sending a negotiator to Taipei to hold a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
Of course, she would also like to see political integration; but let's start with the beginning.
Better to wait for this after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP has reinvented itself anyway.
Two years ago, he went wrong: his former leader, Chen Shui-bian, had been sent to prison on charges of corruption.
From 2000 to 2008, he was a provocateur for explicit independence.
But a new generation of moderates has emerged under the leadership of Ms. Tsai and the PDP is making every effort to attract professionals and youth.
Ms. Tsai was hailed as a DPP presidential candidate, such as Su Tseng-chang, who served under Mr. Chen.
Their party is doing its best to show that it can also engage with Beijing.
Ms. Tsai announced plans for a panel of experts to act as a point of contact between the DPP and China, provided that their interviews could take place without preconditions.
Ms. Tsai told the Taiwanese public that her party presented a "trustworthy alternative" to Mr. Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems exasperated by this change.
In a statement from his cell, he stated that the PDP candidates would have achieved better results if they had insisted that Taiwan was a separate country.
He even ordered Mr Su, a pragmatic, not to fight the presidency.
Even without Mr. Chen's intervention, it will be difficult for the DPP to choose between its potential candidates.
The KMT must do an introspection of itself.
Mr. Ma's assessments were weak; despite dizzying economic growth, KMT candidates did not want to campaign with him.
Its unpopularity seems to be largely due to unemployment and the widening gap between rich and poor.
A KMT spokesman said that his office and local offices would be redesigned.
The PDP's good results suggest that Taiwan's support for rapprochement is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, an eminent editorialist, "the point of no return has already passed."
Grammy Awards nominations: jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a selected surprise in the category "best new artist"
Perform at the request of a president, and people are required to know about it.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer handpicked by President Obama to perform at his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, marked one of the Grammy Awards' surprises this year with a large-scale nomination in the category of the "best new artist".
Considering that Spalding has been a well-known figure on the jazz scene since his 2008 album "Esperanza", the appointment remains somewhat mysterious but it is compatible with the Grammy Awards rules that an artist should not release more than three albums before the recording; this "establishes the public identity of this artist."
His ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", certainly marked a step forward and, given his slightly engaging vocal style, his skillful hand of pop and funk and his Latin influences, it is possible to draw at least one dotted line in Spalding compared to the lightning success of Norah Jones in 2003, the closest equivalent for the voters of the Grammy Awards taking into account jazz productions in this category in recent years.
Elsewhere, the voters of the Grammy Awards rightly honored "Historicity" by Vijay Iyer Trio in the category "instrumental album", a turn on a thrill invigorating of a recording that was one of the primary favorites last year.
Among these Iyers, "Moody 4B" of veteran saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" of keyboardist John Beasley will be in competition.
Trombone Shorty, favored by the raucous voice of New Orleans and frequently invited to HBO's "Treme", was honoured in the contemporary jazz category; which also leans strongly towards a certain fusion with the albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Secret Society of the Wild Darcy James Argue, familiar with steampunk, won some well-deserved recognitions in the great category together; in competition with the rich chamber-jazz of Billy Childs Ensemble and the eternal adventurer Dave Holland whose album "Pathways" of his byte's live was a fine example of this bassist's democratic hand as a group leader.
Grammy Awards nomination: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey lead in classic categories
The classic nominations for the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards include a mix of landscapes of musicians and composers from all over the world.
At the head of the appointments are "God Ex Machina" by Michael Daugherty, for piano and orchestra, with five "yes"; and "Dreamhouse" by Steve Mackey, an electric orchestral work, with three "yes".
Among the nominees with links to Southern California, there is Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his Symphony #4, "Los Angeles", a work that was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra and opened the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The Madolin Concerto of Los Angeles-based composer Avner Dorman is also in the standing for a reward.
The classical appointments are divided into 13 categories covering recordings of orchestra, opera, choir and solo.
A category for the classic producer of the year features five candidates: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
The nominations for the classical album are the Nashville Symphony Orchestra's No.3 and 4 symphonies; Steven Mackey's "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" by Daugherty of Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey's "Dreamhouse" by the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrifium - the art of Castrati" featuring various artists; and the Verdi's "Requiem" by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the opera category, the nominees are "Lulu" by Berg of the Royal Opera House Orchestra, "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Adolf Hasse of Ars Lyrica Houston; "L'Amour de Loin" by Kaija Saariaho of Deutsches Symphony-Orchester Berlin; "The Enchanted Wanderer" by Rodion Shchedrin of the Orchestra and the Choir of Mariinsky Theatre; and "Ivanhoe" by Arthur Sullivan of the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
The composers who are in place for the Grammy Awards for contemporary composition count Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Wanderer Enchanted".
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 had its first at Disney Hall in January 2009 in a performance recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra, led by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The work of about 30 minutes is nicknamed "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovski, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concerto" was nominated for his instrumental solo performance with an orchestra.
The composer of Los Angeles said that he aviat wrote the 15 minute work especially for the performer at Mandolin Avi Avital, who played the concerto with the Metropolis Ensemble, sitting in New York.
"I wrote it using sounds from the Middle East and a lot of North African ranges and rhythms," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
Orchestra chief Pierre Boulez, 85, received an appointment in the category of orchestral performances, for having directed the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in a recording of Stravinsky's works.
Among the instrumental soloists who received an appointment were pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs, violinist Julia Fischer and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
This year there are only solo vocalists; here they are: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucie Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classic mix category, Soprano Jessye Norman received an appointment for her recording "Racines: my life, my song"
The Temecula Mosque project was approved by the Planning Commission.
A mosque project in Temecula received unanimous support from the local planning commission after more than five hours of public testimony, often passionate.
Criticism has come up against the project by claiming that it was promoting both terrorism and traffic jams.
But the commissioners ruled on Wednesday evening that the new religious center respected local laws and that it would be aesthetically impressive.
"Many people have come to support him: Christians, Jews, Baha'is, you mention him," said Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley, speaking on Thursday morning.
"I'm proud of it, as an American citizen."
"It shows that justice prevails."
"The opposition is really minimal," he added.
"They just have very strong voices."
"We have good people in this valley."
The session began at 6 p.m. and lasted until almost midnight with, most of the time, people pronouncing themselves for or against the centre, speaking at about the same time, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper's website.
"There is no more America," one speaker wrote.
"This is another planet of monkeys with Miss Liberty dead in the sand."
"America has fallen."
The planned Islamic centres also provoked protests in other parts of the country, including at Ground Zero, the site of the 11 September 2001 attacks in New York City.
Imam Mahmoud Harmoush denounced violence in the Temecula Valley.
Her congregation of 135 families co-existed without incident in Riverside County for years but wanted a larger and better space than the warehouse she rented on a shared property with a water filtration system manufacturer.
The new mosque of 24,943 square feet with Mediterranean-style architecture would consist of two minarets and would rise to 43 feet high.
It would occupy a 4.32-hectare site on the Nicolas road about two miles east of Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal this project to the municipal council.
A microbe that tolerates arsenic raises the possibility of new types of life on Earth, or elsewhere.
The discovery of a strange bacterium, which can use arsenic as one of its nutrients, broadens the field to find new life forms on Earth and perhaps beyond.
Although researchers have discovered the unusual bacteria here on Earth, they say that this shows that life has possibilities beyond the major elements that have been considered essential.
"This body has a double capacity."
"It can develop with either phosphorus or arsenic."
"That's why it's very special, even though it's far from being a truly "foreign" form of life," commented Paul Davies C. W. of Arizona State University, co-author of the report in Thursday's online edition of Science.
Six major elements have long been considered essential for life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
But researchers have discovered that the bacteria, discovered in Lake Mono, California, are able to continue to develop after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
"We wonder what is still possible," said Ariel Anbar D. of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
The discovery is important in the research of life beyond the Earth because researchers must be able to recognize life, to know what life looks like, says Anbar.
The study focuses on a microbe found on Earth.
However, the announcement of a press conference to discuss it, which did not disclose the details of the finding, generated widespread speculation on the Internet that the report might disclose the discovery of an alien life.
That was not the case.
The discovery "shows that, in other planetary environments, organisms may be able to use other elements to activate biochemistry and that the "standard" set of elements, which we consider absolutely necessary for life, may not be fixed," commented Charles Cockell, professor at the Institute of Planetary and Space Scientific Research, Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is new because it shows the substitution of one element to another in basic biochemistry and biochemical structure," Cockell added.
It wasn't a random discovery.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA's Institute of Astrology, which led the study, chose Lake Mono because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar; thus, it has speculated that a microbe exposed to both substances may be able to substitute for each other.
"Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behaviour is really similar to that of phosphorus."
"As a result, it is difficult for organizations to distinguish these elements separately."
"But arsenic is different enough that it doesn't work exactly like phosphorus; it penetrates inside and somehow erases the work of our biochemical machine," Anbar explained.
The researchers collected the bacterium known as GFAJ-1 and exposed it to increasing arsenic concentrations to which it was able to adapt and grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus but the fact that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that one form of life using arsenic can occur naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or the moon where arsenic is more frequent.
Jamie S. Foster, Assistant Professor of Microbiology at the University of Florida, said that the idea that arsenic could be replaced by phosphorus was not new; but nothing ever showed that it could work.
Arsenic was more common at the beginning of the Earth's existence, she said; thus, researchers hypothesized that the first forms of life could have used it.
This suggests that there may be other ways to form life, not just the way life on Earth was formed at the beginning," said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was funded by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Institute of Health.
The last two stolen exposure dogs were found in Compton
The other two exposure dogs on four robberies outside a motel in Bellflower were found, and the Los Angeles County sheriffs announced it on Thursday.
The four exhibition dogs - two akitas and two Welsh pembroke corgis - disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole the Chevrolet Express van in which they had spent the night outside a Bellflower 6 motel, the authorities announced.
Two of the dogs were recovered on Wednesday afternoon and the other two were found at the end of the evening on Wednesday, told Steve Whitmore, the spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is dogs are fine," says Whitmore.
"They're in good shape."
"They were returned to their rightful owners."
Whitmore refused to say exactly where the dogs had been found, in what neighborhood, and what were the circumstances of their discovery.
"An investigation is under way."
"We don't want to say it," Whitmore said.
"We follow orders."
Dog owners Kristina Rickard and David Peek could not be joined to comment on Thursday.
They were reunited Wednesday afternoon with their two Akitas in an animal shelter in Downey County.
The sheriff's deputies found the van and the two dogs separately at Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old female - were safe and sound, the authorities announced.
But Bunny and Peter, the corgis that Rickard and Peek planned to show at regional competitions this week, on behalf of the owners of the Japanese dogs, were missing until their discovery on Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend as part of the national championship "AKC/Eukanuba" in Long Beach, where they planned to present Trace.
The other dogs were expected to participate in the competitions of other events scheduled in the days before the exhibition "AKC/Eukanuba", Peek told the Times on Wednesday.
South California is one of the stops of the canine exhibition tour of almost a month of the couple.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked the motel.
They often stay in motels and park their van outside, right next to their bedroom window.
They took three other dogs - a boxer puppy, a Parson Russell burrow and a Breton Spaniard - who stayed with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and the corgis, with thicker fur, in the van where it would be cooler.
They opened the windows a little, so the dogs could have fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported that the van was stolen at 6 a.m. on Tuesday.
Peek said they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to the corgis, with an implanted microchip to identify them.
It is unclear whether a reward was awarded on Thursday.
The lion is ready to blush again, the restructuring of MGM is only waiting for the final green light of the court
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got the green light to start again at zero.
A federal bankruptcy judge in New York officially rented on Thursday the "pre-packaged" plan by creditors that approximately $5 billion of debt would be erased; paving the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to focus its efforts on the production and distribution of films and television programs.
With Thursday's decision that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy code, there are no longer any legal obstacles before MGM to re-float under the supervision of the founders of Entertainment Spyglass, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the general directors of what will be a light studio.
Staff will be reduced to about 320 out of 400 at the start.
MGM will not really emerge from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase has concluded a $500 million credit facility to fund the new operations and productions of MGM.
It is currently licensed by the investment bank, which is running at $75 million and is expected to be funded by mid-December.
The restructuring process of the studio began in May 2009 when the investment bank Moelis & Co. was engaged to advise management on how to place its finances as it did not have the means to pay interest amounting to $300 million per year.
In August, Director General Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and a remedial expert known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's attempts to solve MGM's financial difficulties and satisfy the more than 140 creditors in the studio took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, the parties agreed, at the end of 2009, to put the company on sale.
However, auctioning attracted few bidders, none of whom were willing to pay the sum of an additional $2 billion that creditors were looking for.
In the spring of this year, everything had to be done again as the MGM team had begun to work on a restructuring plan that, after months of internal disagreement and debate, was finally approved by creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially came out of bankruptcy in the following weeks, Moelis and Cooper companies received several million dollars in premiums for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper's companies, which have raised $375,000 a month for their corporate management services, will receive a "success award" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to relaunch the production of MGM, which only released one film this year, and set up an annual list of seven or eight films that would be released from 2012.
They also intend to co-finance two films based on "the Hobbit", with Warner Bros
The studio must enter into a separate loan between $265,000,000 and $275 million to fund its share of these two films, which must be made by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns about 18% of MGM's debt, attempted to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the main shareholder.
However, recent discussions between the two companies have not resulted in an agreement.
Tech Toys to keep your gift budget in balance
Although the main candidate for this year's most wonderful toy is the IPAD, followed, perhaps, by Microsoft's video game system, Kinect, both can make a big gap in your gift budget.
Consider that, for the price of an iPad, you can buy five BMX bikes at $99 and a Kinect game costs the same price as 10 classic pearl jump ropes, or about 48 boxes of Play-Doh.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget in balance.
Recently, I visited three national toy vendors - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and Wholesale Club BJ - to see the electronic toys I could buy for less than $80.
It is clear that Moore's Law has evolved, this year's technology toy is likely to have more strength; while costing the same price if not a little less, compared to last year.
In addition, while there are generally fewer new toys associated with websites, two of the best known of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And the button battery toys are on the rise, as well as rechargeable battery toys.
Here are a few recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise stated.)
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13 for 3 years and over) are stuffed toys the size of a pig from India that sing a note when you press them on the belly.
A pressure is equal to a note, and a second one makes it possible to compose a song.
If you buy several, they will sing in harmony.
Be careful: once you start pushing, you can't stop.
To combine singing with dancing, Dance Mickey Star (Fisher-Price, $60 for 2 years and over) is the best choice.
Inspired by last year's Elmo Live technology, the 14-inch animatronic doll plays role-playing games like Simon Says and can do lunar dance thanks to its innovative articulated feet with wheel locks.
The children who tried the toy used Mickey as a dance instructor while their parents complained of a lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, you will remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
It is back (Hasbro / Playskool, $40 for 3 years and more), with a backpack filled with game cards questionnaire designed to turn a ride into a session with a self-correction and a valve binder.
If you are suspicious when your child holds your smartphone, here are three stand-alone alternatives.
The VTech Mobigo ($60, for 3 to 8 years old) is the cheapest and easiest to use, with a qwerty keyboard, although the games do not educate as effectively as the Explorer Leapster ($70, for 3 to 12 years old), it is the first major revision of the Leapster range, with a more recent and brighter screen.
No version is compatible with the old cartridges.
Fisher-Price iXL ($90, for 3 to 7 years old) uses an iTunes-type system to offer games and e-books and has an SD card entry that allows you to display family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for 8 years and older) is a set of five blocks just bigger than a matchbox, each with its own LED screen.
The goal is to form words by placing the blocks online before time runs out, it's ideal for an impromptu spelling contest.
Increasingly, toys have a kind of online connection.
Based only on their presence in toy stores, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child an online pet from Club Penguin, for example, you can get a Penguin Disney Club 2"Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5, for 6 to 12 years old) which includes a piece marked with a hidden code.
When you buy back the code online, your child receives enough credits at Club Penguin store for two items to choose from.
It can be roller skates or a Puffle pet toy.
Slightly larger than the hair at the end of your toothbrush, Hexbug Nano ($10, for 5 years or more) is the last button-battery micro-robots.
The false beast is rapidly moving on 12 vibrating silicone pastes in random directions.
It's fun to make a maze of blocks to see if she can find her way through.
It's also solid.
Ours resisted a fall from the kitchen table and even a momentary passage into our dog's mouth.
Bringing a softer side to law enforcement in China
Tang Shenbin was surveying a city square as an urban sergeant in training by severely inspecting his nervous loads, issuing low-pitched orders with a military authority.
He wanted the female members of Chengguan - imposing public order officials in China, feared and despised for their arbitrary repression and penchant for violence - to convey a certain impression to a group of spectators.
"Stay straight!"
"Be sharp!"
Show them, he says, "What do pretty girls look like!"
Four girls who had barely passed adolescence in white gloves, dressed in identical olive-colored jackets and trousers, froze in your care.
Four pairs of black heeled shoes, aligned to the rule.
Four well-kept hats perfectly perched on the top of hair tied by a striped knot in blue and white.
"Personally, I think they have an average appearance," said Mr. Tang, with disdain.
"The models are pretty."
More than one government has tried to refresh the image of China's urban inspectors.
One city required that all new recruits have a higher education degree.
Guangdong Province traded grey-green uniforms against a so-called more engaging blue.
Wuhan, in Central China, replaced the down-eyes with the strong way:: in 2009, a report reported that 50 officers had surrounded an uncontrollable snack cart by throwing black eyes, firmly for half an hour, until the colporteur repacked his business and left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, chose to do a major imaging operation.
Since 2003, the district has completed its street police in urban areas with 13 women, specially chosen for their appearance, colour and young age.
The idea is to give the police a softer, more feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson might have trouble looking at this underground urban brigade in China.
And because of it, the critics will say.
Unlike the police, these officers are allowed only to enforce municipal orders by imposing fines or other administrative sanctions.
But the Chinese media portrays the news of a different reality.
In January 2008, inspectors in the Hubei province beat an observer to death after he used his mobile phone to film them dispersing a protest against a waste dump.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing inspectors, stolen and posted, describes how to effectively defeat offenders without blood.
This year in Shanghai, a watermelon colporteur was abandoned with a brain injury after a fight with five officers.
A video game impregnated with violence, available online download, shows Chinese inspectors trained to assault street vendors.
"Chengguan marked the government," lamented China Daily last year, a national publication, after an umpteenth polemic on tactics.
The paper called for "true complete cleaning."
Sceptics say the approach is far from it.
After the district made an announcement in October to find eight new female recruits, an editorial, published in The Beijing Evening News, wondered whether women had real jobs or were just a tourist entertainment.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The district announcement required female candidates, aged 18 to 22, to have a beautiful silhouette and "the five strokes of the face in the right order."
They must be larger than average in size, 1.6 metres or 5 feet, 2 1⁄2 inches.
Retirement at the age of 26 is compulsory.
The officers stated that the work was physically too difficult for women over 25 years of age.
"It's their image that's important," said a district officer at Rednet.com, a quasi-government website.
"First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine whether they are suitable; they are the size, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes the temperament and the "inner qualities."
Chengguan women are like flower vases, he said, adding: "In addition to being vases, they will have other responsibilities.
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Director of the City District Management Office, does not adhere to this description.
But he noted that height requirements were the standard standard in many Chinese job offers for both sexes.
This is the case with the requirement for the order of facial features.
What this means is beautiful is a subject of debate among the Chinese.
Certainly, persons with disabilities or disfigured must not apply.
"We can't let a boxer or a boss come and serve here," says Zheng.
"He wouldn't give a good image."
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old and has cheeks with a finely curved mouth.
She does not consider the enhancement of her appearance to be sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked for a disillusioned look.
Xu Yang, his 21-year-old dimples colleague, says: "Our job is to present the image of the city."
They do not object to their mandate being limited, they said, because they nurture greater career ambitions than simply hunting vendors in the alleys where they are supposed to limit their activities.
Every morning, the team confronts a dozen walking merchants who move quickly on foot or by bike, trying to sell as much bread as possible or bowls of tofu before fleeing.
"Master Wang, you must leave."
"We've already told you several times!" said Ms. Xu when a salesman ran off on foot, temporarily abandoning his noodle cart bike.
The officers describe their duties rather as monotonous than arduous.
"It's about the same thing every day," said 20-year-old Huang Jing, who studies marketing after work.
"Great routine."
One reason is that female agents do not have the power of their male counterparts to confiscate sellers' property.
They can only threaten to report offenders to their male superiors.
This tends to protect them from sudden public displays of animosity against bureaucracy that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, revolted after the spread of false rumours that Chengguan agents had killed a seller.
In one night, more than a dozen police officers and Chengguan officers were injured, 14 government vehicles were shot or shot.
Xindu has so far escaped such violence.
But calm is hardly guaranteed.
Just two blocks from the placid Baoguang Square, where female officers patrolled that morning, more than 50 people gathered at the corner of the street.
The officers confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk rather than in a store, as required by the regulations.
The owner of the bike was yelling at the scandal.
A 15-minute iron arm followed before the police officers, with their sinister faces, crossed a elbow road to their vehicle and left at full speed with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator attached to the men's team, stayed behind, his white badge returned to hide his name.
Like female officers, the coordinators - men aged 40 and over - play a purely supportive role.
Unlike them, they are not trained to maintain a waxy image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," says Mr. Li said in a neutral tone.
"Most of the time, it's the audience that starts."
Prosecutors will not charge Senator Ensign
The Department of Justice prosecutors have lifted the criminal charges against Senator John Ensign, arising from a case involving an assistant in an old campaign and his efforts to obtain lobbying work for the wife's husband, announced the Senator's lawyers on Wednesday.
The decision puts an end to the most serious legal threat faced by Mr. Ensign, the Republican of Nevada who was considered a possible Republican candidate for the 2012 presidential election until the scandal surrounding his case made the big national headlines last year and damaged his career.
Mr. Ensign's office stated that he was "very happy" with the decision, the result of a one-year investigation.
The honourable senator could still be exposed to disciplinary action by the Senate Ethics Committee.
Mr. Ensign's lawyers stated that the Department of Justice had "informed that Senator Ensign was no longer the subject of the investigation and that he did not intend to maintain any charges against him in this matter."
The Department of Justice has refrained from commenting on this issue.
The announcement came as a sort of surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Department of Justice that there would be significant evidence that Mr. Ensign would have conspired to violate a federal criminal prohibition on lobbying.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents, first released in October 2009 in the New York Times, indicated that Mr. Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, get a lucrative lobbying job to win the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the senator's affair with her.
Ms. Hampton once served as treasurer during a campaign in Ensign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political funders to find work for Mr. Hampton and then defended their rights after they hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them; in accordance with the documents and interviews.
Since Mr. Hampton had recently been a collaborator of Mr. Ensign, he was prohibited for a year by law from lobbying with his former employer or the Senate as a whole.
Ethics experts argued that the unusual agreement between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were close friends prior to the case, appears to be in contradiction with the so-called lobbying gate ban.
According to evidence made public, "there appears to be prima facie evidence of a conspiracy to violate and substantially violate the law of the revolving door," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients from a government investigation.
Although the department's judge refused to explain the reasoning behind the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said that the department seemed to be wary of political prosecution after a number of high-level setbacks by its Public Integrity Section, including last year's decisions to drop the prosecution of former Senator Ted Stevens accused of lack of prosecution.
Federal prosecutors are clearly afraid to take up arms, said Melanie Sloan, the Chief Executive Officer of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a defence group that received several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the case.
"This basically says high-ranking government official can now assume the laws don't apply to them", she added.
Mr. Ensign's Senior Counsel, Paul Coggins, stated in an interview that he had received a telephone call from a prosecutor from the Department of Justice on Monday and a follow-up the following day, telling him that the Department was not looking for charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign's team of lawyers had cooperated with prosecutors to try to persuade them that the senator, as his office reaffirmed on Wednesday in a statement, "had acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused to clarify the legal arguments he had made to the prosecution.
"I'm not comfortable going into the details of my discussions with the Department of Justice, except to say that we think they made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Elections Commission decided to abandon an investigation following an independent complaint by the ethics group, arguing that the payment of $96,000 by Mr. Ensign's Hampton parents violated the federal election law.
The Electoral Commission stated that it did not have enough evidence to prove that money was anything but a gift.
NV Energy, an important Nevada corporation that has long supported the senator, is a company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find lobbying work.
An e-mail sent in December 2008 showed that, after the company welcomed Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensign's chief of staff, John Lopez, contacted Mr. Hampton and told him that he "martelized" the Ministry of the Interior on a matter in dispute.
Mr. Ensign also attended a luncheon with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada client, Allegiant Air, and asked the Secretary of Transport to set up a meeting on behalf of the airline after engaging Mr. Hampton to lobby.
When the news of the case surfaced last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned from his position as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After maintaining a low profile for several months, Mr. Ensign stated two weeks ago that he intended to serve a third term in the Senate.
In announcing that Mr. Ensign was no longer the target of a criminal investigation, his spokesman, Jennifer Cooper, said that the honourable senator hoped that the ethics committee would quickly follow the example of the Department of Justice and end its investigation.
Senator Ensign looks forward to continuing his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada, she says.
Cheshire's call will point to Twitter
About half a dozen of them were typing away in the rows of the courtroom.
They sent every minute of reports of horrible testimonies via Twitter.
In the end, the defence said that there were more than 140,000 messages about the rape trial and the children tied to their beds in a house that was burned down.
On Thursday, the widespread trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three Cheshire family members in Connecticut, should lead to an official end in which the judge would impose the death penalty, voted by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already filed evidence with the court that outlines arguments for appeal, which could occupy the courts for years.
What is provocative is that the intense reports about the trial - as well as the widespread and widespread use by Twitter journalists - have created a "circular atmosphere", a saturation so widespread and instantaneous with incendiary details that the jury has been badly influenced by the passions of the public.
The request could prompt appeal judges to discuss whether new technologies require new rules in courtrooms.
"I have experienced this in this trial; I think there is a real danger, the introduction of new technologies into the courtroom violates human rights in a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullmann, lawyer for Mr. Hayes, chief lawyer.
The trial judge, Jon C. Bleue of the Superior Court of State, laconically rejected the claims in the judgment rendered last week, claiming that the media were "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury was driven by passion.
But that does not seem to be the last word on the issue.
Courts of appeal have recognized for decades that media coverage of well-known cases can raise questions about the fairness of a trial.
In a landmark judgment in 1966, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the conviction of a Cleveland osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, arguing in his decision that there was a "carnival atmosphere at trial" because of the media.
The crime is considered by some to have been the inspiration for the TV show and the film "The Fugitive".
Some lawyers have stated that the appeal courts seized to review Mr. Hayes' conviction half a century later may be curious given the argument that new rules may be needed to manage the media in the courtrooms, unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a general reason to worry about the impact of the new media" in large-scale trials, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that it was arbitrarily applied.
Professor Donohue argues that some appellate judges may be intrigued by the idea that limiting instant communication from courtrooms could lead to more just trials.
The case of Twitter is only one of many described by Mr. Hayes' lawyers, which is likely to be discussed for years, delaying execution.
Defence lawyers also claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes would have suffered harm when Blue J. refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them macabre pictures of criminal scenes during the selection of the jury.
Some of the jurors claimed to have been horrified by the photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11 years old.
The defence lawyers claim that they will also challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty and argue that the judge unfairly expelled one of the jurors, who had been critical before the prosecutors, and that he abusively pressured a verdict by making the unusual decision to get the jury to deliberate on a weekend.
The jurors weren't kidnapped.
But their arguments about the effect of the intense media coverage of the trial could be the greatest source of interest.
They noted in a challenge against the verdict, filed last month, that the case dominated the media scene in Connecticut and that it was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for the position of governor and the United States Senate.
They maintained that the computer media were constantly stirring the flames of the emotion of the case.
"The daily hustle of media tweets, cameras and journalists in front of the courthouse," the lawyers wrote, "were nothing like what had been seen here before, in New Haven, and perhaps even at the national level."
Their focus on Twitter coverage is controversial.
In the interviews, some journalists stated that the assertion that the instant news was more incendiary than the news releases delivered more slowly was a luddist view that would impoverish the Court's policy of media coverage of future trials.
But some lawyers stated that courts of appeal were often attracted to arguments that social and technological changes required court adaptation.
Mr. Hayes' lawyers insist on this claim.
In their case, they referred to the 1966 Supreme Court decision that overturned Dr. Sheppard's conviction because of the media coverage of the trial and stated that they would invoke the need for new rules for the new media.
"This case," they wrote, "represents Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can civilization bridge the divides?
After a campaign marked by invective and negativity, a minimum of civilization broke out in Washington this week.
Is this a foretaste of genuine bipartite cooperation towards the front or an illusory moment before the rapid return to the partisan struggle in the capital?
Tuesday's meeting between President Obama and Congressional leaders did not yield any breakthroughs on the major issues that need to be addressed during the "wrong duck" session.
But obviously, there was at least a polite discussion about the differences between the two parties as well as the recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than another episode where each camp wanted to score points.
The public meeting on Wednesday of the Committee on the President's deficit was just as civilised, despite the political differences that remain between the members.
It seems clear that the close interaction of several months has created mutual respect that transcends the ideological divide; but that, however, still divides the members.
This is hardly enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
Both sides are now in a period of trial and mutual testing to obtain signs of cooperation and compromise, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and voter patience for a renewed partisan war.
That is why the Tuesday meeting and the participants' subsequent comments revealed a minimum of requirements or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and Republicans are too large and too deep to suggest a rapid change in the climate that has existed over the past two years.
Whether it is taxation, spending, health care or rights, both parties remain miles away.
Yet the November election had moderated Washington, at least in the short term.
"There is no doubt that things have changed in tone," said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official, now alongside the Centre for Ethics and Public Policy.
"It's inevitable after the election.
The elections arouse partisan passions and then they fade away.
That's good."
On certain issues, including those on the agenda of the "sucking duck" session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush's tax cuts will expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of that.
Both sides want to find a way to preserve part or all of it on a permanent or temporary basis.
Similarly, a compromise is possible on the extension of unemployment benefits, even because Republicans cannot afford to give the impression that they are in favour of tax cuts for the rich, while refusing unemployment benefits to unemployed workers.
After Tuesday's meeting at the White House, more optimism was expressed about possible agreement on the issues raised during the session on "the lame duck", with the ratification of the "New START" pact.
But William Galston, of the Brookings Institution, warns that fruitful cooperation on the most pressing issues of the "duck blade" session will not necessarily lead to better agreement between the two parties when the 112th Congress meets in January.
Instead, he said, a period of disagreement is likely, if not inevitable.
"Once the things that need to be done will be done, psychology in the short term will return to one of the confrontations," he said.
Wehner also expressed his widely shared scepticism that civilization would lead to true cooperation.
"I consider most of what is happening between today and 2012 as a pre-show or a shadow-boxing compared to the main event of 2012, he said.
The reasons for this are closely linked to the composition of the new Republican majority in the House and to the voters present at tea who contributed to its creation.
However, Republican leaders are aware of the dangers if they go too far, they know that they must try to live up to their promises to reduce public spending and repeal the new health care law.
These partisan positions are already clear in the first reactions to the recommendations of the deficit committee, which include reforming the tax code and increasing certain taxes, raising the retirement age and reducing expenditure.
Co-Chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have chosen one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and, in their view, have imposed the deficit issue on the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the 18-member committee to issue their plan as an official recommendation, and they have had difficulty reaching that number.
The greatest resistance remains among the elected members of the group, suggesting that there should be little reason or willingness to compromise on tax issues, at least today.
Galston foresees two phases in the fighting between the White House and the Republicans of Congress.
The first will come next year in the form of partisan confrontations, as Republicans challenge Obama in terms of budget, taxes and health care, and then be followed by a period of greater bipartite cooperation.
What would be the cause of change?
Public opinion.
It is widely proved that, despite the partisan spirit of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see the two parties work together.
If the confrontation leads to an impasse, as in 1995, then both parties will carefully observe the reaction of the public.
Anyone who is judged to be a loser will have to change course and find compromises.
However, that would be an optimistic point of view.
The partisan spirit and polarization are larger today than they were in the mid-1990s and there seems to be a greater ideological gap between Obama and the Republicans of Congress than there was then between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, activists of both parties see 2010 as a mere prelude to a more consistent election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civilization exposed this week could be appreciated by many Americans.
But it will take much more effort on both sides to find a common ground on the issues that still divide them.
U.S. documents released describe Moscow as a haven of corruption
The control of the city is in the hands of a "Kleptocracy" and passes through the Kremlin some of the bribes and the protection money it collects, reported the US Embassy in Russia in a note in February.
The police and the Federal Security Service carry out huge rackets that help explain the high cost of living in Moscow, he said.
They raise money not only from legitimate businesses but also from organized criminal groups.
Every layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called the "vertical of power" - takes its share as money moves up the ladder.
The memo, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted by Wikileaks on its website on Wednesday.
The note is based on sources whose names have been purged.
It was written while Yuri Loujkov was still mayor of Moscow; and he is largely held responsible for corruption.
He was fired in October by President Dmitri Medvedev but there have since been few traces of cleaning.
Loujkov and his wife, Elena Batourina, who owns a leading construction company, have always denied the charges of corruption over the years; and he has won several defamation lawsuits on these charges.
In September, he told a Russian television station when he was interrogated about a documentary suggesting that he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's to throw away, it's anything."
The Russians believe, by an overwhelming majority, that their society is corrupt; according to polls.
But it is unusual to find the information in an embassy report; and it is unexpected to think that it would be for diplomats from a foreign country to do so.
The direct link between the Moscow city government and crime has led some people to call it a "dysfunction" and to claim that the government worked more like a kleptocracy than a government," according to the Embassy's note.
"Criminal elements enjoy a "krysha" (term used in the criminal world/mafia that literally means "roof" or protection) that passes through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior (MVD) and the prosecutor's office, as well as through the entire bureaucracy of the Moscow city government.
" Analysts identify a three-tier structure in Moscow's criminal world."
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"The FSB, the MVD and the militias are on the second level."
"Finally, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
"This is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill a void in certain areas where the city does not provide certain services."
The report indicates that the FSB raises the money of the largest companies and that the police target the small ones.
One source, he said, "explained that Moscow business owners understood that it was better to get the protection of MVD and FSB (rather than organized crime groups) because, not only do they have more weapons, more means and more power than criminal groups but they are also protected by law."
"That's why the demand for protection from criminal gangs is no longer so high."
The note states that, although the collection of money is extended, the protection itself may be uneven; even those who pay are sometimes subject to arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly see their business closed under one pretext or another.
Medvedev mentioned several times the fight against corruption but he admitted the little progress.
The Embassy's note provides reports of men bringing suitcases, probably filled with money, to the Kremlin.
"In its fight against corruption, Medvedev depends on the bureaucrats," said Gueorgui Satarov, director of Moscow's think tank Indem.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
"It is not part of a political class because it does not exist in Russia."
Without politics, without opposition, without separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
According to Indiam, the costs of corruption would amount to more than $300 billion a year across Russia.
The country was ranked 154th in a recent survey on the overall perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (countries are ranked at least at the most corrupt).
The release of the note of the American embassy, which was only made yesterday, late in the evening, Moscow time, will certainly stir up discontent within the Russian government; although Loujkov may be blamed, to some extent, for Moscow's failures, it could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to show that it is resolving the problem.
Interviewed by CNN by Larry King, Putin hypothesized that WikiLeaks' documents could be a fabrication and reacted with anger to the statements that US diplomats had made by calling him Batman and bringing Medvedev closer to Robin.
"The problem lies in the fact that this is our interaction, an important factor in domestic policy in this country," he says.
"But to be honest with you, we did not suspect that it would be achieved with such arrogance, such pressure and, you know, in opposition to ethics."
The Khmer Red veterans forced to face the past
In a poorly lit classroom with decrepit concrete walls of poor quality, the director of Anlong Veng High School spoke of the man who had built it, the last Khmer Rouge leader, Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader; and he cared about his people," said 42-year-old Sreng Kor Ma.
Known as "the butcher" for his brutality, when he was at the head of the Khmer Rouge, this commander remains popular in this isolated stronghold of former Khmer Rouge in north-western Cambodia where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure; and where thousands of former soldiers of the organization still live today.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge went to the government, long-standing loyalty is finally being called into question at Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum for truth and reconciliation allowed victims to face publicly the people who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed a high school handbook that, for the first time, teaches the history of the Khmer Rouge to the children of its former soldiers.
And in July, a Cambodian court, jointly headed with the United Nations, handed down its first sentence concerning a former Khmer Rouge member, sentencing, to 35 years in prison, the former head of the notorious torture centre of Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as "Duch".
Faced with this development, anxiety has increased among the Khmer Rouge veterans of Anlong Veng, complicating reconciliation efforts and their desire to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
"There are resentments and fears among the ancient Khmer Rouge but they are powerless to do anything," said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodia Documentation Centre, an independent organization that conducts research on the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious but the regime became a symbol of evil."
"The situation generates divisions within families."
During the reign of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, about 1.7 million people were executed or died of hunger, disease or overwork.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrowed the government of Pol Pot-Unis in 1979, the rest of the regime and its army fled to the border of Cambodia with Thailand.
There, they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last of the movements went in December 1998.
While Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary were leading the guerrillas from their base in the mountains of western Cambodia and the jungle, Ta Mok was preparing a suite at Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace agreement led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to defect to the government, culminating in the surrenders of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998 and Ta Mok, who had stood up to it, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the mountains near Dangrek.
He died in a prison in Phnom Penh in 2006 pending trial.
Without their benefactors, most Khmer Rouge veterans have fallen into black poverty, common to rural areas of Cambodia; and many remain nostalgic in the movement.
Although some Khmer Rouge elite officers have retained their positions as local leaders in exchange for laying down weapons, they are low-grade, unskilled farmers.
"These people received very little follow-up after the capitulation," said Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which organizes public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They are imbued with the agrarian utopian ideology of the diet."
"They were raised in a framework where doing business is a foreign concept."
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settling in 1998 as a poor rice farmer.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Ta Mok feeds everyone."
But now life is difficult because we have to support our own needs."
The ongoing Khmer Rouge court has also caused concerns here.
The court should, at the beginning of next year, start the judgment of Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Red Minister.
The court's mandate is to try senior leaders and those responsible for the crimes, but he did not say whether he was continuing beyond these four cases.
It would take more to calm the fears at Anlong Veng.
The latest media speculations turned to 64-year-old Im Chaem, a former district chief in the province of Banteay Meanchey during the Khmer Rouge rule in the 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Cambodia Documentation Centre that she had overseen the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project where thousands of forced workers would have died.
Recently, during a torrid evening, Im Chaem was returning from work to the field near his wooden house on stilts, on a dirt road outside Anlong Veng.
While the sun cast long shadows on the dried grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss his past within the Khmer Rouge.
If the court summoned her, she said, she would refuse to go.
"Cambodia is at peace and stable," she said.
"If there is more prosecution, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, also warned on several occasions that instability would occur if the court pursued several suspects; although experts and historians contested this.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But facing the past is all Cambodia has to do to move forward, says Youk Chhang, from the documentation centre.
"Reconciliation in Khmer terms is to reconnect broken pieces," he says.
"We have to put these pieces together so we can understand."
The centre produced the first government-approved manual on Khmer Rouge, "A History of Democratic Kampuchea, composed of 75 pages."
He distributed it in Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the history manuals of the Ministry of Education, designed for high schools, which contained less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As in most of Cambodia, Anlong Veng's youth know only a few details about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's ties to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new manual helped students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted skeptically when he came home with the book to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the manual and the court," he says.
"They're wary because they don't know exactly how many people the court will continue."
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, said Sok Leang.
But public forums, the manual and the court are beginning to have an impact, he said.
Yet the Khmer Rouge retain a powerful attraction here.
In the heights of the Dangrek Mountains, a path, invaded by weeds and sprinkled with plastic bags, leads to a black soot rectangle, covered with a rusty sheet roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a mobile phone saleswoman on the roadside, said she didn't know much about the man who was cremated there.
"But he has a great spirit; and many inhabitants go there to pray," she says.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and later that day, she planned to walk to the last resting place of Pol Pot where she would leave a bouquet of ripe bananas in the hope of bringing luck.
Belarus agrees to renounce its military-grade uranium stock
The government of Belarus announced Wednesday that it will abandon its stock of highly enriched uranium, an essential component for nuclear weapons; this deceleration is part of a surprise victory of President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear materials around the world
The agreement was disclosed in a joint communiqué issued after Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met here with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov on the sidelines of a security summit.
The U.S. government had tried for years to convince Belarus to give up highly enriched uranium and seemed to have cleared the horizon last spring.
But US officials told the Washington Post that some classified operations have been carried out with Belarus over the past two months to eliminate 187 pounds of military-grade uranium from a Belarus research centre.
This paved the way for an agreement on Wednesday to eliminate the remaining £500, according to an official who referred to the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue.
The agreement appears to be one of the most important outcomes of the 47-nation Nuclear Security Summit, organized at the initiative of Obama, where Belarus was excluded.
Apparently, it was beneficial to provide an invitation to the former Soviet Republic following the summit in 2012.
"I am really fascinated by the fact that they want a seat at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit Nuclear Security Summit."
"This proves to me that this process works," said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Partnership, a nuclear security promotion group.
Clinton described the agreement as a "very significant, important step" by Belarus.
Obama committed to Prague in April 2009 to secure all vulnerable nuclear materials around the world in the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of the Obama Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexandre Lukashenko said that the nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have kept highly enriched uranium, hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially military-grade uranium and low-enriched uranium," Lukashenko said.
"It's our product... we're not going to make dirty bombs, and we're not going to sell it to anyone."
"We're going to use it for research purposes, that's all."
Belarus approached the United States a few months ago, however, expressing interest in reaching an agreement.
The first implementation to eliminate uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated as the equipment had been slightly irradiated, officials said.
It was loaded on a special train that travelled more than 1,300 miles to an installation in Russia to be stored and disposed of, officials said.
The second operation was completed on Monday and was carried out by air, according to the officials.
The U.S. government spent $13 million in its efforts, largely to replace Belarus' research facilities with low-enriched uranium; unsuitable for weapons.
"A thorough coordination and organization has been implemented with a view to building confidence," leading to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Biliawski, a head of the Department of Energy specialized in Global Threat Reduction.
According to estimates by the James Martin Non-Proliferation Study Centre, Belarus had at least 88 pounds of military-grade uranium this year, as well as hundreds of kilos of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus is seeking to eliminate its stockpiles by 2012, according to a joint statement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly because of the harsh repression by Lukashenko of human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggested a potential renewal.
"While welcoming progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus have acknowledged that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains essential to improve bilateral relations; and essential to the progress of the country and its citizens," she said.
The government has not objected to CIA flights
The government has not objected to CIA flights with Taliban prisoners and Al Qaeda in the direction of Guantanamo across Spanish territory, according to a telegram from the US ambassador to Madrid.
This is demonstrated by the documents filtered (cable) by Wikileaks in the daily El País, which add that the first vice-president of the government of that period, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, had asked that the Spanish Executive be informed "to demonstrate that they exercised adequate vigilance on foreign aircraft crossing Spain".
In June 2006, after a report by the Council of Europe which accused a dozen countries of complicity in practices contrary to human rights, including Spain, a meeting took place between former North American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The Vice-President acknowledged that the Council's report "surprised the Government of Zapatero out of the game" and stressed that Spain had nothing to hide.
"De la Vega has emphasized that Spain has no objection with regard to intelligence flights over Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed" to avoid being "taken away," says Aguirre in a cable.
The incumbent of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of that time, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, told the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "wanted to give this case the lowest possible profile, even though, as it was in the hands of the judges, the Government had a limited capacity of influence".
In turn, in January 2007, Prosecutor Vicente González informed the Embassy that he was not going to block the judge's initiative to request the declassification of the documents of the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence on CIA flights.
"These reports contain no incriminating elements, no sensitive information," the Embassy explained after talking with the prosecutor.
However, the United States has expressed concern about "the apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" rather than about the declassified information of CNI or the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to handle the case discreetly between governments," regrets Aguirre.
In March 2007, during a luncheon between the US Ambassador and the Minister of Interior, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he commented that "although the Spanish judges are madly jealous of their independence and will do what they consider appropriate", he had given instructions to his collaborators "so that they avoid the comments of a fiery rhetoric, trying to lower the temperature".
The Ambassador also expressed concern about the PP's action in this case.
"Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience suggests that PP will certainly take advantage of any indication that the Government of Zapatero has tolerated or deliberately ignored the actions of the United States that could be interpreted as possible violations of human rights, even if those revelations have negative consequences for the Government of the United States," she points out.
The parishioner who confessed complained in the network of the "burdening" of being a mother
The girl was talking about the child when he was already dead and she had a blog: "Galician Terror"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" in the network.
With this nickname she used as soon as she was a little girl, she contacted a cousin and at least a friend; both from Noia, the village of Coruña from which she came.
Messages date back to 2008.
To hear them, one must know his sentimental life, which ABC builds with the help of his parents' testimonies.
The 30-year-old Galician girl had started a relationship in 1998 with Iván Túñez, an industrialist.
Their relationship lasted a year.
Soon after they split up, we knew she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him take the DNA test.
We found another new boyfriend shortly after that.
The elect was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighbouring municipality.
She lived with him for a long time.
Caesar had lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to survey the labour market, the boy stayed with his partner, who even accompanied her a week in Palma.
But according to the content of his communications, it is understood that their idyllic fractured, they separated.
In March 2008 she was in Minorca alone, and wrote: "Alberto is very strange and upset about the fact that I came to work there."
"When I told him, it seemed like a good thing, but of course, he now realizes what it means to be with the child all day and not to have the freedom to do what he wants."
And then she's talking about a mobile message that she just got: "I want you to come home this month or give me an address to send you the child."
Ella complains: "If he doesn't like it, let him leave the kid with my mother, and I'll take it when I get home," she alleges.
In May, she talks about the return to her village: "This week I'm leaving, but I'll only stay there until the 19th, because on the 20th I have to report to a workstation so that I don't lose it".
She explains that if everything went well, she would have taken her elder with her.
"He will remain with the right person, that is, with me, and I will never leave him out of my life with another person if that person is not my mother," dubious intent, taking into account their bad relationships.
In July, there's another post.
When she slaps him, it is assumed that the child, who had arrived on the island on the 1st of that month, and was allegedly murdered on the 10th, died.
"César is happy on one side, but he is not happy on the other."
"On the one hand he's with me and he likes this place a little bit, but on the other he goes to school almost every day."
She's talking about a trip to Majorca.
"He will go there (the child) a few hours in summer and so I save a little money from the babysitter."
On the 17th, greetings and complaints.
"A very big kiss from Caesar, who asks me when will you come."
"Alberto says he sent you I don't know which videos to the email, you see, when he wants to, he finds me, shit."
On the 30th, another: "The child is fine, he goes to summer hours to learn Catalan.
On Victor, his current partner, there's one: "He's giving me money."
On the Internet she has messages in blogs dedicated to animation and manga.
She had one of her own in the MySpace universe, now blocked, where her name was "Muki the prison liberator."
"Galician Terror (Epigraph)."
The last man who lived with her, vigilante, declared his regret for feeling guilty.
He doesn't want to think that everything happened so she didn't tell him that she was a single mother.
Mónica entered yesterday the prison in Palma, from the centre of judicial detainees in Minorca.
Lawyer Carlos Maceda explained that she does not remember how the facts had happened, "and she did not intend to harm the minor either."
Before she confessed to drowning Caesar in the bathtub and putting his body in a suitcase.
The defense and the prosecutor filed for psychiatric trial.
The members of the Popular Party would gain 4 seats in Congress and the PSC would lose 9 seats.
With the results of 18-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After the significant increase in votes and deputies registered in the last autonomous elections, the Catalan PP has already targeted the generals because, even if there is progress or not, the prospects are more than positive, because the number of votes that this formation obtains in these comedies normally doubles the number that it receives in the Catalans.
For example, the Catalan people obtained 610.473 votes at the 2008 generals, while at the 2006 autonomies they obtained 316.222.
Last Sunday, the PPC won 384,091 votes.
If we maintain this upward trend, which is the desire for a diversion of votes from the PSC and the retention of the PP electorate, the analysts of this formation calculated that, if there were general elections, the CFP could increase from 8 to 12 MPs in Congress, while CiU would also gain four (it now has 10) and PSC would lose no more than 9 MPs (it has 25).
These calculations would find that the Catalan place is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
According to popular analysis, ERC would lose one MP - he has three now - while ICV would keep one MP or earn one.
But if the electoral agenda continues, the next meeting would take place in May 2011 for the municipal councils, where the popular can also be decisive at the end of socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in their relay at the head of the General Council of Barcelona, one of the administrations that manipulates the higher budget - 661 million euros for 2011-.
Both the nationalists and the populars agree that PSC could lose the municipalities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the socialists would not obtain the majority either the possibility to resort to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Taking into account the republican debacle, it would not be fanciful that this formation loses its representation in the city hall of Barcelona - it is necessary to get 5% of the votes-.
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced that they can be the protagonists of the fall in the capital of Tarragona, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP recorded only a 500-vote difference from PSC, of which the mayor, Angel Ros, maintained very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the latter campaign, they met several times.
Populars have also made progress in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels and Reus.
The PP is now present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists in a maximum number of localities.
The Catalan cell has facilitated thousands of passports to Al Qaeda
Apart from the seven detainees in Barcelona, Thailand there were three
The seven Pakistanis and the Nigerian held by agents of the General Information Police Station of Barcelona formed a jihadist cell that, led from Thailand, facilitated passports to various Al Qaeda groups, including "Tigers for the Liberation of Tamil Land" (LTTE) and "Laskar e Taiba" (Let), the last of which was responsible for the Bombay attacks that killed 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs has given great importance to these investigations, to the point of ensuring that "Operation Kampai" has "weakened" Al Qaeda's falsification apparatus at the international level and "therefore, its operational capacity".
The investigators estimate that the cell, in the two years it was active in Catalonia, was able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, or they were falsified and then distributed to groups that included the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda so that its "combatants" could cross the borders of Europe and other Western countries with total impunity.
The dismantled cell is not the only one that the jihadist network operated in Europe, that is why in the investigations participated, apart from the Thai services, other European police units, that is why in the territory of the European Union there could be the following days similar blows to that recorded last Tuesday night in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (Pakistans Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were detained), another was carried out in Thailand, with the capture of Pakistanis Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
They were the ones who led the cell in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network - part of which was hit in 2009 - mainly stole from tourists passports that met the conditions marked by the so-called "World Islamic Front".
In other words, the documents had to be in the name of young men aged between 25 and 45, with a validity of several years and without stamped visas.
The investigators point out that so far no details have been found that connect detainees in Catalonia with the Bombay attack, even though the perpetrator of this attack, "Laskar e Taiba", was one of the receiving groups of passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it must be remembered that a few days before this attack was committed, from Catalonia, a few thousand dollars were sent through a transfer agency that were "invested" to buy mobile cards that were used after by the "commando" integrants who killed 106 people.
The police seized a lot of documentation.
PP asks Mas to suspend tax complicity
The leader of PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to personally expose to Arthur Mas his conditions to support his inauguration as president of the Generalitat, identical to those exposed during the campaign and which are simply to give priority to the recovery of the economy and the lack of philo-sovereignist adventures as is the economic complicity that the nationalist leader wishes to address to half of his mandate.
The president of the Catalan people arrived at the meeting with Artur Mas with the security that gives the fact of having obtained 18 deputies in the elections last Sunday, a number more than enough to be loved, because the candidate of CiU requires that at least one of the formations that the opposition will exercise abstain in the vote of the nomination.
A possible agreement with the PP depends on the future alliances that the nationalists want to maintain in Congress during the general elections, but, for the time being, the conversations that Mas has these days with the rest of the political leaders are being held in Catalan key.
And as far as the president of the PP is concerned, to support an investiture "we should eliminate all sovereignist and independentist discourses", and the economic complicity - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the convergent leader wishes to submit even to the referendum.
The two leaders have in common their bets to weaken the political apparatus of a very exaggerated autonomous administration and the elimination of the tax applied to estates and donations.
Details of the Mas investiture negotiation will be handled by PC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a hard opposition - , Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will do so with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatric states that the deaths were not due to the "lack of measures"
The owners of the centre of Olot do not eliminate the possibility that their night nurse killed more than 11 elderly people
The officials of the geriatric La Caritat d'Olot (Gerona) yesterday offered a press conference to highlight the harm caused to the institution by the criminal behaviour of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who killed at least eleven elderly people for whom he was responsible in the interval he worked there.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, presented himself with the lawyer of the center, Joan Cañada and announced that "the desire of La Caritat would be to be able to charge the person responsible" for the dead but "legality and responsibility oblige us to assume the procedural situation of civil officials".
And apart from the social discredit that the entity may suffer for failing to detect the night nurse's criminal activities in time, the great threat to La Caritat now takes the form of significant compensation that the legal representatives of the victims' parents already calculate.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that from that day on he did not stop killing.
The judge mentioned in the sentence that he ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former geriatric patients - who suspected that in many cases no doctor personally explored the deceased but, given the age and pathologies of the patients, the formality took place by telephone.
The Caritat, through its director, categorically denied this situation yesterday and mentioned that "the lack of measures can at no time have been the cause of what happened".
Counsel for La Caritat added that "in this case there is only a hint of imprudence on the part of anyone other than the accused."
The person already baptized as the "Angel of Death" confessed before yesterday 11 murders and detailed that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009 and a month and a half later he killed a second grandmother.
In this case he caused her death by injecting her with an insulin overdose, unlike the first crime he committed with a mixture of sedative pills.
The director of La Caritat mentioned the fact that it is complicated to control the access of the centre's staff to medicine.
Insulin injections and the cocktail of sedatives had been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in his desire to relieve the suffering of inmates, used to kill them.
But laboratory analysis will clarify whether Vila does not lie by saying that he sought for his first victims a less cruel death or instead he burned them inside by giving them laundry as he already confessed that he did with the three women he killed in the October 12 to 17 interval.
The Caritat does not believe the statements of the night nurse, nor the number of murders confessed, they do not eliminate the possibility of the number being greater and justify their attitude by the different versions that Vila gave in his visits to the Court of First Instance and the lack of logic in the change in the way of killing after having successfully committed eight murders.
That is why they state that they will remain at the disposal of justice to clarify the scope of the facts.
ECB threat
Investors reacted abruptly yesterday to Trichet's threat that "markets should not underestimate our ability to react".
The peripheral differentials have closed to force and the actions of the European banks have suffered more than 5%.
However, we must also not underestimate the ECB's ability to make a mistake and the euro has barely recorded an increase, which is a worrying signal.
What happened yesterday is typical of a liquid market that in the same way that it collapses, it recovers, but motivated by fences of short and very speculative positions.
The institutional investor will soon lose fear.
A month ago, the ECB called on us today to withdraw liquidity measures and it will have to withdraw tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and those that remain.
Bundesbank required the completion of the public debt purchase plan because of its inefficiency and the elimination of all extraordinary liquidity measures over time and leaving only unlimited access to the week.
After the Irish crisis we hope that the current liquidity measures will be extended "at least until March" and that the quarterly open-access auction will continue at the end of the quarter to guarantee liquidity at least until June.
We hope that we will continue with the bond purchase program and even give the signal to intensify it.
If they do not meet the expectations generated, they will reverse the excellent market reaction yesterday and if they remain blind to withdraw the liquidity measures, God help us!
As well as during their May meeting in which they stated that they had not even considered the purchase of bonds and collapsed the markets, the story could be repeated tomorrow.
ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the bazooka Monday and Wednesday he said he had already bought a lot, causing a new collapse on the market.
Yesterday the auction of trades at one year in Portugal was very poor.
The Consolidated Revenue Fund issued only 500 million at 5.28% compared to 750 million at 4.81% of the previous auction.
Even so, the guys in Portugal dropped 30 basis points throughout the curve, and clearly reflecting a change in market sentiment after Trichet's words.
In Ireland, the figures for Allied and Bank of Ireland's hole were published.
The estimated figures represent 10,000 million in the short term and 15,000 potentials and they have a deadline until February to obtain private capital or they will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not detecting the problem in July with the stress test, the figures are assumable in the Assistance Plan and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the Government will have to obtain parliamentary approval of its new budget and it does not yet have sufficient support, so Ireland remains in a state of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel moderated the tone of her speech to release tension before the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December, in which it is necessary to find a political compromise that demonstrates that we are a union and that we all interpret the same partition.
The problem is that Germany wants to interpret Wagner and the rest the anthem of Beethoven's joy.
In Spain, the President had the opportunity to present yesterday the plan of measures that the Council of Ministers will approve on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous communities and financial entities, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to reactivate employment sound to the ears of investors like the four seasons of Vivaldi.
The double effect Trichet and ZP explains the fact that the Spanish Stock Exchange suffered 4.5%, double that the rest of the European Stock Exchanges.
Unlike February, the response of the Government and the Bank of Spain has been rapid and radical and we benefit from the surprise effect.
Today there is a key three-year bond auction that will benefit from the Trichet effect, therefore we hope that it will be resolved with strong demand and helps to dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain asking for a Assistance Plan would be a self-immolation.
They would give us a liquidity line we don't need, the Consolidated Revenue Fund has more than 40,000 million cash available, three times as much as March, to very expensive types and they cut off access to the sine die markets.
Nevertheless, the strategy must continue to be that of Caesar's wife, "other than being, to appear".
Courage, we can get out of this!
The president of Eulen will challenge the council of Vega Sicilia requested by his sons
The storm does not stop in the open conflict within the Álvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, founder of the group, will contest, because he considers it "no law", the judicial council of El Enebro the next 16, solicited by five of his seven sons in which they will try to assert their majority and seize the management bodies of the owner firm of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José give their legal battery for the new chapter of their dispute for control on the part of the group.
The founder of the largest holding company business services does not seem to be willing to give in to his dispute to be present in El Enebro's management bodies.
From his board of directors he was excluded by five of his seven sons who appointed themselves directors at the shareholders' meeting on January 18 this year whose challenge is recorded in the Trade and Corporations Registry.
The El Enebro Judicial Council for the next 16th, convened by the Commercial Judge Number 2 of Madrid, reopened the box of thunderstorms within the Álvarez family.
The use of the judge to fix the assembly is, until the conflict resolves, the only mechanism that guarantees the convening of the assembly.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is described by David Álvarez as a "desperate resort of the plaintiffs his five sons to try, through a procedural argument, by clearly defrauding the Law and abusing the law, to validate and correct the radically nil assembly on January 18," according to his official spokespersons.
This argument will be the basis for the assembly to be challenged once it has taken place, considering it to be "nothing of its own right".
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, have already tried unsuccessfully for the magistrate to convene an assembly in June.
In El Enebro, a heritage company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, the sons of David Álvarez control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the service group nevertheless solicits usufruct on 51% of the capital, according to familiar protocols.
This case is the substantive issue that the judge must decide after the hearing on the request for challenge for which there is not yet a specified date.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
A software creates improvements on real-time cars.
As soon as Red Bull entered Formula One in 2004, his story in this select world of speed was marked by surprise and success.
At first, nobody took into account the options of a new stable that had just arrived, despite the ascending trajectory of the last seasons, last November, in the last phase of the championship they all bet on the Ferrari triumph of Fernando Alonso.
Without diminishing the skill as the champion's driver, German Sebastien Vette, nor the ability of the Renault engine that propels his car, in the world of Formula 1 we speak of the legend of the "secret weapon" that the multinational company Siemens has put in the hands of Red Bull to turn it into a winning team.
This is in fact a powerful process simulation software that the German company launched on the market in 2007 with objectives far removed from high automotive competition.
Named PLM, this powerful computer tool has been used to create assembly chains of factory manufacturers from all over the world, power stations, high precision instruments.
The objective is to reproduce, faithfully simulate the product or process before building it in a real way, thus avoiding avoidable defects and costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon's cameras, Sukhoi aircraft or Nissan's most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens Industrial Division, explains the fact that the use of this computer device in his Formula 1 plant allowed Red Bull to create and execute "in a few hours, almost in real time", the changes, changes and improvements detected during the races and trials.
Russwurm explains that the 1992 stables had an average of 10 technicians in their teams who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements on the vehicles each season.
The Red Bull team now employs 180 young high-skilled professionals who, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyze and project all kinds of changes on the reels.
Siemens's leader explained that PLM software is capable of analyzing and improving all elements of Red Bull's reels except the engine, which is the exclusive responsibility of Renault.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
Changes can move from virtual reality from simulator to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
As the only limitation of this insanity of technological development there is the amount of $40 million that each Formula 1 team can spend as a limit each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has set up the high-tech plant to create and produce its pellets in a locality 50 kilometres from London.
These are two buildings where visits, especially for journalists, are restricted.
Everything that happens there is considered top secret.
The staff for this duty includes 580 people, including two pilots, Champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
Red Bull's Formula One hero, no doubt, is the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the immense technological resources that the brand of energy drinks has put at the service of its participation in the circuits, there are other hidden protagonists, whose activity is invaluable and the notoriety null.
The factory's technology director, Steve Nevey, said five years ago it could be said that R & D progress in racing cars accounted for 50% of the victories and the drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have changed and technology accounts for 85% of the success, while pilots bring 15% of the added value.
Nevey admits that the Vettels or Webbers will never be replaced by computer, because "they are unpredictable gladiators".
HP will install in two years 20 clean stores with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened its first exclusive store in Barcelona in collaboration with its partner Pont Reyes.
It will be the first of the network of 20 shops between 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational plans to install in Spain over the next two years.
The company will account for this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-brand centers such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The vice president of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, gave as an example the redesigned store located on the Gran Vía in Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with which she has been collaborating for 30 years.
The North American group has prepared a plan to implement 200 branding points in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes the 20 Spanish establishments.
The first open were those of Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, the one of Barcelona being the third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the next possible stores, even though she admitted that Madrid could be the next destination.
The director of HM personal systems has assured that the philosophy for the establishment of stores will always be the same, with the support of a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American group advises and takes care of the design of the exclusive furniture of the stores (with products that can be touched in an interactive way), which in Europe will hold an identical image.
In addition, HP covers the training of the staff of the institutions.
Helena Herrero denied that this is a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive network of shops claims to "improve the service offered to customers and SMEs in purchasing, assisting, after-sales and even packaging".
The Barcelona store includes a space with a world-class pioneering pilot program that solves the possible problems of HP's computer equipment in warranty.
An online service connects with a technical centre located in Maastricht (Holland).
"So, in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can often take even two days."
"This system is specially designed for MPEs and users, as large companies have already contracted technical assistance services," said Helena Herrero yesterday.
Sabadell bets on 'flying' a million customers to his rivals in three years
More optimistic than other leaders, Banco Sabadell's managing director, Jaime Guardiola, believes that 2011 will be a tough year for the banking sector, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the passive war.
Despite this, it foresees a collapse of interest margins, which will be partly offset by increases in commissions and credit prices.
Sabadell expects to capture in three years a million particular customers, his task to accomplish.
Sabadell has found a way forward for the next three years to survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will launch a new three-year management plan in 2011.
The objective, apart from surviving without having to resort to FROB's public subsidies, is to gain a market share by attracting a million new customers - 700,000 if you deduct those who can leave the bank -, its great task to be accomplished, because so far this bank has spoiled SMEs and companies more than the particular customer.
This year he picked up 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share to individuals is 3.5%, while to companies it exceeds 10%.
Another basis of the 2011-2013 plan is the productivity bet, or what is the same thing, of austerity, with the reduction of costs as objective, whose provocations will be explained by the bank when presenting the results of the exercise.
Few banks now dare to set targets and make them public, as the financial crisis has disturbed all plans of the global banking sector.
Sabadell, in fact, will finalize this year its Optima management plan, establishes four years ago, although initially the plan was for three years, but the market situation has determined its extension for an additional exercise.
Clients who let the savings banks escape will be its main objective.
During a breakfast organized by APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a "difficult and transcendental" year.
The executive, in fact, thinks that the exit from the crisis in Spain "will be slow".
Moreover, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create jobs", which is fundamental to the survival of the banking business, he insisted.
And even if he thinks that the passive war - which penalizes the margins - is shrinking, the price of the risk premiums that banks and banks pay for its issues to obtain liquidity is already moving at the credit price to compensate for the fall in the margins.
"The liquidity and financing aspect is structural and will be a pressure on credit."
"We didn't tighten the tap, but the differentials are higher," said Guardiola.
Banesto has already given orders to its network to limit long-term credit and increase the price of differentials - see CincoDías of 22 and 27 November-.
He also admitted that the trend of the banking sector now "is to increase commissions", but "there is a competitive framework".
Sabadell's management plan is based on organic growth although, as always, the group does not eliminate the possibility of carrying out corporate operations.
It is not in vain that he assures that in Spain "we will ask for larger dimensions."
"Everything will move next year," he assured.
He claims that capital needs "increase enormously" and some Spanish financial entity could enter red numbers.
And he mentions that FROB can replace the market in raising funds in the case of new recapitalisations.
Having assured Sabadell that he can survive the time closure of markets, he has diminished the importance of the fact that some banks are already predicting a new liquidity crisis.
He points out that one cannot issue, but, contrary to what happened in June, one can obtain short-term financing through rest, which alleviates the crisis.
ECSC rejects the possibility of a second wave of mergers between the caisses
The Director-General of ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of a new wave of mergers of savings banks and again stressed the speed with which the restructuring of the sector is carried out.
When the Spanish savings banks' merger proceedings began, there were several entities that ensured that they would not participate in the first phase and that they reserved for the second phase.
Nevertheless, the Director General of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday the possibility of producing this new wave of operations.
"I think that most of the mergers have been made, it cannot be said that the incorporation of Cajasol into the group of Banca Cívica is a second phase, they are adjustments."
"Most have been completely achieved; it is possible that instead of 17 we go to 13 or 14, but all the major processes have already been carried out under the supervision of the Bank of Spain, which has collaborated a lot in this operation too," the leader said.
In the statements during a breakfast of the Association of Directors and Executives of Aragón (ADEA), Olavarrieta explained that the process of concentration is carried out "at the highest possible speed and we must be very satisfied with the way it is carried out within the deadlines set in the past, not now, in the business plans with the Bank of Spain", he emphasized.
"The passage of 45 caisses with an average of 28,500 million volume of assets to 17 with 75,500 million is an unparalleled trial in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% so that they are much larger to conform to Basel," he stressed.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a series of rather unhappy opinions about the slowness of the process" which demonstrate "a lack of serenity and sense", because "what the Bank of Spain is doing is reminding us that the deadline must be respected before the end of the year".
The Director-General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, said yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in Europe and "probably" in the world and has attributed to those who question it a "lack of knowledge".
The leader mentioned that given the current economic situation, "we can remain very calm" with the situation of financial entities and savings banks, a system that has started a process of concentration "very important" and "go at the greatest possible speed".
He also recalled that the Spanish banking sector has made good use of the stress tests that the ECB carried out in July.
Zapatero and the German Red Line
Berlin has chosen to remain in the euro, but it has laid down the conditions for the whole Union.
Tensions in the markets caused a twofold government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has announced new methods of adjustment, which vary from tax reductions for SMEs, regulation of private investment agencies or abolition of 426 euros of assistance to the unemployed without professional contribution to the privatization of 49% of AENA, of the management of the airports of Barajas and El Prat and of 30% of the State Lotteries.
On the other hand, Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, joins the critics of Chancellor Angela Merkel as regards her responsibility to detach the current crisis.
How should these movements be interpreted?
It should be noted that Merkel's position is not an error in his communicative policy.
On the contrary, it is another restriction of the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And here Germany has a radically new vision of what its future must be, which clashes with that of maintaining the old traditions of most of its partners.
Faced with European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate on the three possible exits from the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by itself, Austria and Holland, among other countries, and the south would abandon the monetary zone.
The second, the recovery of the Mark, even though now it seems of science fiction, with a very favorable current of opinion, almost 50% of the population.
The third, a new conception of the euro, in line with the German proposals for greater macroeconomic control, fiscal rigour, fines to the countries that violate them, possible suspension of payments of one of them and extension of the costs of potential adjustments to the private sector.
The German position is clear and it has long been defined, therefore now there is no room for excuses.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission were stimulating deficits, the German Government invented a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of divergence between what Germany thought should be done (plans of fiscal rigour and stability of public finances) and what its European partners, including France, were doing.
The second blow of the Central European country was when Merkel hardly prolonged the decision to save Greece.
From that moment on, she was the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public opinion and the published opinion were against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, towards the end of October, Merkel once again expressed a clear position, calling for the reform of the Union's treaties in order to make it possible to rescue a country and at the same time oblige private lenders to bear a share of the cost.
This position was interpreted as anti-European, as it precipitated the Irish crisis and the rest.
But his proposal, although somewhat sweetened, has been approved and in the following months we should see the process of reforming the Union that makes these measures possible from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not think it will cross.
And it tells us all that, even if we now have to take measures with which we may not agree too much, from that date on the old functioning of the euro would have ended.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary zone, in which countries that violate the rules will be severely penalised, they may be forced to declare themselves in default of payments and, in this case, the private sector will also bear a share of the costs.
Germany points out that we must follow a severe path of growth with high savings and investment rates, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
An alternative based on debt and construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, like the one that presided over Spanish growth in the boom years, will simply not be tolerated.
The bet is clear.
And it would be wrong not to hear it.
It is not just a question of bringing the public deficit back to 3% in 2013.
What we're being asked is a lot harder.
And what he absolutely must not do in these circumstances is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will lead to a greater peace of mind.
And let us know how to seize the opportunity we were given, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero also heard it in this form and its double declaration (the reforms promised after the meeting last Saturday with the big companies and yesterday's announcement of new measures) suggests that, despite Merkel's criticisms, we have opened the way to the thesis that we must put order at home.
But the red line Germany has drawn is there, and they don't seem to move it.
And among the possibilities we are considering, we cannot rule out abandoning a monetary zone that is too crowded with countries that are not serious.
And in that case, Germany will always be able to tell us that she had warned us.
Sport and fraud of the law
The ruses similar to that of Alonso and Ramos against Ajax demonstrate the ingenuity but not the will to escape a sanction.
The urdious expulsion in principle by two players from Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) during the match of 23 November against Ajax in the Champions League caused a lot of ink to flow on the anti-sport character of such behavior and whether the two players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As we know, a few minutes before the game ended (which their team was already clearly winning), the two players deliberately wasted time when they made mistakes to determine the referee to show them the second yellow card.
Thus, and given that Real Madrid will eventually be the leader of its group, the two players will fulfill the regulatory sanction during the next game of the barrage match against Auxerre and will be able to pass without cards in the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee sanctioned with two games the team coach, José Mourinho and various economic sums to the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances like this one or similar is not a new practice, if not rather frequent in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, of the unwritten rules, but followed, of this sport.
Part of the debate that appeared in the case is due to the fact that this had as protagonist a team of the entity of Real Madrid (which in its anthem displays nobility and honor and which on past occasions has sentenced its players to a fine for similar acts) and to the orchestrated dramatization, it seems, by Mourinho, which adds another episode to its dilated history of histrionic and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate asks whether this type of behaviour is not expressly prohibited by the regulation contradicts the principles of sport, i.e. whether such actions involve the commission of a fraud of law, because they are actions which are respectful of the sports regulation, but seem to circumvent its meaning.
The question is to examine the type of harm they cause to the sports spirit.
One of the assets that understands the sports spirit is the physical integrity of the opposing players, an aspect that with these actions has not been put in danger, that is, there has been no violent play.
Another of these assets that are alluded to with the right game is to prevent the offending players' team from taking unfair advantage of the opposite team, which is not the case either.
However, the paradoxical fact of the action of the players of Real Madrid is that it does not conform to what is normally characterized as cheating or fraud of the law, because its violation of the rules has not been carried out in hiding to try to avoid the sanction, but their action has precisely tried to be as obvious as possible to receive the penalty of the arbitrator.
They were waiting and they gladly accepted the sanction.
Another issue is the type of benefit that offenders get from the intentional mistakes examined.
Here it seems necessary to note that you do not put yourself in a situation of disadvantage to the rival and you do not get an advantage in the same game either, because obviously the result of the action presupposes leaving their own team with fewer players.
And it's not a useful strategy for the next game either, because the club couldn't count on these players.
Of course, the advantage is that the players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future match.
But this is a long-term advantage, with some degree of indeterminateness, because the team could be eliminated all at once and apart from that, with this action the players perform a penalty game and pass to the second cycle of cartons, in which the suspension due to the accumulation of cartons occurs with one less than the first cycle.
So, climbing the ladders, it's not so clear that it's an advantage.
In the end, these actions are not contrary to the sporting spirit, which is still part of making strategic decisions that promote profit to the maximum of what the rules allow.
In our case, the players did not act to avoid the application of the penalty (it would indeed be a clear case of fraud of the law),m otherwise they chose rather the time at which they submitted to it.
They made a strategic decision without losing the penalty or running away from it.
Although the border between genius and law enforcement fraud is widespread, on this occasion I think we've had a clear case of genius.
It seems to me that the controversy arises because of two factors: because there have been two self-expulsions and because of the way in which the director transmits to provoke them.
The evil caused to the principles of sport by these actions is not as ethical as aesthetic.
Offensive offers to capture Christmas dinners for groups in BCN
The calendar dictatorship concentrates this year an avalanche of reservations for days 16 and 17.
There is a proliferation of self-funded celebrations by employees who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the bull and the lottery, when December comes also come back the dinners of groups before Christmas that continue to be the oxygen balloon for the restaurants and entertainment of Barcelona, but that because of the crisis have led to an offensive price adjusted to be able to capture the majority customer: almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros in dinners or meals, coincide the businessmen and associations of the sector interviewed.
To complete complicating accounting, this year's calendar (as the night of the Saint Sylvestre falls on Friday) has concentrated requests in the week of December 13, resulting in so far an avalanche of dinner reservations for peak days (on 17th and 17th) and almost nothing the previous week.
Since 2008, which is the origin of difficult times, there are many companies that have eliminated collective dinners for budgetary reasons.
To maintain tradition, many employees organize them by paying for their own pockets.
Whatever the situation, they all ask for battle prizes, confirms the president of Gremi de Restauració of Barcelona, Gaiete Farràs.
The employer's representative, now, dares not predict what the holidays will look like this month.
"People think a lot before they book."
"They want to go out but they pay a lot of attention to the prices," he says.
The case will go well "for those who give quality at good price and with good service", he adds, and recalls that customers tend to go down a step with the crisis, so that the tranche around the 25 euros has become majority in demand.
In a survey of various institutions in the centre, there was a collapsing demand for the night of 17.
The Soteras group indicates that there is an authentic request boom for that Friday, with the claim to spend less than 30 euros, to which they responded by adapting their menus to the situation, with complete formulas of 25 to 35 euros.
In the case of another group of the most powerful, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar assumed more advance bookings, even from the beginning of November.
"We did the impossible to maintain the same prices last year, with menus for all tastes from 19.95 to 30 euros," they said.
AN Grup, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 premises, remains optimistic after having detected an increase in billing since the second semester and good, although concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources from the group mention that the 18th will also be a hyper-active day at the level of groups of friends who celebrate the holidays in advance.
To their six group menus they added one for Christmas, with 30 euros or more as a famous budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend 10% more than last year instead of requiring more details, such as Catalan wine made according to the Champagne method - 'cava'.
They also see the first signs of improvement in some companies again inviting their employees and the feeling that the volume of groups has increased a little.
On the part of the employers Fecasarm (which includes entities such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Entertainment of Barcelona), its vice-president, Enric Gomà, confides in the possibility of starting to see the end of the tunnel and maintains that overall the reservations are "animated", even if the customers "negotiate as much as possible".
That is true, hope for the festivities has not fallen, regardless of who pays, he says.
Pakistan's nuclear programme is causing great concern in the United States
Islamabad produces atomic weapons at "a faster pace than any other country".
Wikileaks leaks confirm the connection between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the US Embassy of Pakistan and the United States Department of State filtered through the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concerns of the Pakistani nuclear programme in Washington.
Apart from the illuminating and tasty details on the content of the conversations and thoughts of North American diplomatic representatives accredited to Islamabad, the documents reveal the fact that cooperation between the two countries in the field of atomic security, instead of increasing, "decreases" and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons "at a faster pace than any other country in the world".
The peculiarity of Pakistan's nuclear program - the fact that weapons are not assembled, but are stored by components to make their destruction difficult in the event of an attack - is one of the main concerns in Washington.
The Ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, lists in a report prior to the visit of former National Security Advisor James Jones: "The proximity of certain nuclear facilities in the Taliban-affected territory, the dispersion of nuclear materials whose noise runs and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials."
The large number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programmes is envisaged, not only by the United States, but also by Russia, as a proliferator and a reason for maintaining custody.
"Pakistan has had to hire staff with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear installations; given the decline in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people working in nuclear or missile programs," said expert Yuri Korolev of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs during a meeting with his American counterparts.
The new documentation filtered by Julian Assange's portal is the ever-reduced cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in the field of nuclear proliferation and the high level of production of nuclear weapons in Pakistan.
An Embassy dispatch in May, which describes communication with Pakistan as "frustrating", supports the following: "Transparency is frequently non-existent; offers of aid remain unanswered or are eliminated".
In another message, Peter Lavoy, official of the National Intelligence for South Asia, notes that "despite the economic disaster, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world."
Ambassador Patterson also asked Washington, during a visit by Chief of the Army, General Ashfaq Kayani, to make it "very clear" to the head that "the Pakistan Army must end tacit support for terrorist groups".
Hunting for the Wikileaks leader
Obama will number a senior counter-terrorism officer to avoid further infiltration.
Interpol issues a red alert to track movements and locate in Assange.
All aspects related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, form a complicated maze where it is difficult to have a certainty about the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red alert" to "localize and track the movements" of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest warrant.
In addition, it is not new, otherwise it is dated November 20.
And it has nothing to do with the last leak of more than a quarter million diplomatic documents from the United States but with the accusations of sexual abuse that the Australian faces in Sweden.
In addition, Wikileaks' creative lawyer, Mark Stephens, assures that "the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange".
On the 20th the international police force having its seat in Lyon (France) issued the order at the request of Sweden, but it did not make it public until yesterday, after having received the authorization of the authorities of that country.
Thus, the 188 countries of Interpol have received the indication to identify or locate Assange "in order to obtain his provisional arrest and extradition".
Although Interpol cannot give the arrest warrant for an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, according to the organization's explanations, consider the Red Notice call a free way to arrest -- which the national police force must carry out -- especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case with Sweden and England, where it is believed that Assange is located.
The movement outraged Assange's lawyers, who yesterday published a letter denouncing the fact that the founder of Wikileaks, 39, was willing to respond by video-conference to questions from the Swedish authorities.
They also recall that Assange applied for and obtained a permit to leave Sweden from the prosecutor's office of his case, compared to the famous Lavrenty Pavlovich Beria, head of Stalin's security.
"This seems to be a hunt, not a legal persecution," the missive denounces.
While the world is looking for him - and in Australia his mother defends his son's innocence - Assange continues to be in an unknown place, but he does not keep quiet.
On Monday he gave an indeterminate interview to the director of Time magazine through Skype, a conversation in which he requested the resignation of US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If we can show that she was responsible for giving orders to American graduates who are spying on the UN in violation of the international treaties that the United States has signed, she should resign," he said.
His opinion was insulted yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who described the resignation application as "ridiculous and absurd".
"I'm not sure why a guy's opinion with a web page should interest us," he said to CNN.
Obama himself commissioned a senior counter-terrorism officer, Rusell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
The attempt by President Barack Obama's spokesman to reduce the importance of Assange contrasts with the views that conservative politicians and commentators proclaim these days.
Peter King, the congressman who will be chairing the National Security Committee in the Lower House from January, asked the State Department to consider including Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations "to confiscate its funds and prosecute anyone who provides them with contributions or assistance".
Further further, Tom Flanagan, an advisor to Canadian President Stephen Harper, who had to go back to his statements after saying that Assange would have to "be murdered."
"Obama should turn it into an objective and use an unmanned aircraft or something similar."
One person who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"He who is in the Government who leaked the information is guilty of treason and anything that is not an execution would be too lovable a punishment," he said for Fox.
Puigcercós is looking for peace in ERC with eyes to the followers of Carod
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe to solve the umpteenth internal revolt inside ERC, without north because of the loss of 11 MPs and half of the votes.
The party president is aware that his threat of resignation is not enough for the followers of former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but at the same time he knows that the influence of this sector is now as diluted as its liar and that it absolutely cannot give him any headaches that he had with other extinct currents.
This is why the leader of Esquerra will try to win his new criticisms with winks that allow him to blind himself to the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 national ERC advisors will be able to decide on its continuity in secret.
By ballot papers, not by raising your hand.
If the carodists want to convey a certain penalty vote to the president, they will be able to do so without any fear of reprisals.
In fact, the leader wants to avoid the image of division and submission to his person.
In several interviews he said that he would not consider himself ratified with half plus one vote, but he added, without mentioning the percentages, that a "Bulgarian" result would not be good either.
People close to Carod demand a little more than putting their position at the disposal of the militancy, a gesture that is not worth when Puigcercós controls the maximum organ between congresses.
But because they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will try to agree with the executive on a road map until May.
To this end, they hope to participate in the development of the strategic reorientation document that management will submit to the National Council for voting on 18.
Its intention is to support Puigcercós in exchange for the latter's promise to schedule the congress for the fall of 2011, which the leaders consider to be a safe fact.
The leader of ERC has admitted that "polyphony" affects stability and that its objective is to make once and for all the organization be able to wash its laundry room with the family.
In this line, the article that current advisor Josep Huguet has signed in his blog is symptomatic.
Considered the ideologist of Puigcercós, the holder of Innovació thought that the fact that the leader will be ratified "in exchange for various objectives" is as if it had been done.
And he listed five of them, two of which he pointed out.
The first, "recompose" the executive to represent at least 90% of the militancy, that is, include new figures that come from the adepte sector of Carod.
The second may be the character of great news.
Huguet proposes that ERC liquid once and for all the assembly as a mechanism of operation.
Thus, it advocates a reform of the statutes that allows the realization of congresses through delegates elected by suffrage.
Ending with the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, was an obsession of the Puigcercós team, which has already fought in this direction in the last two congresses.
In fact, the 2008 conclave convulsions instructed management to revise the assembly model at a specific convention to reform the statutes.
This meeting remains unfinished, as the internal tide of recent years did not recommend addressing this issue.
Now, without critical sectors on the lookout, the time could be good to take it back and shut it down forever.
23 executed in November; 290 in 2010
According to the State of Mexico's MILENIO, there was a decrease of 4 cases compared to 2010.
In November, 23 people were executed in the State of Mexico, four fewer than the previous month according to MILENIO of the State of Mexico.
Among the murders were those of three women and the discovery of two cut bodies in Valle de México.
During the last month of the year, 390 deaths were recorded in theory related to organized crime.
Among the cases, one mentions that of a corpse found in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, municipality of Toluca.
The subject had at least three gunshots and the blow of grace to the head, apart from the feet and hands tied with a cable.
The next day, the corpse of a subject was found in a suitcase inside the trunk of an abandoned vehicle in Mixtecas Street in Colonia Santa Cruz Acatlán, in the municipality of Naucalpan.
Very early in the morning Thursday, on the fourth, the owners of jointly exploited land found a body with signs of torture and at least three lethal shots in the thorax, on the highway near Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal, in the area that crosses the municipality Villa Guerrero.
Near the body we found a message signed in theory by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
One day in Nezahualcoyotl a 50-year-old man was murdered with eight shots when he was leaving his house to initiate garbage collection work.
On November 7, two 30-year-olds were killed by an impact of a gunshot to the head each in the San Pedro Xaloxtoc colony, Ecatepec.
In Chalco, with the blow of grace in the front we found the corpse of a man on a lonely road to Colonia El Naranjo and under the body we found a bullet struck with a 25-caliber gun.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were found in the black water canal of the Plaza Golondrina colony.
The emergency corps carried out a thorough search for the rest of the body members, but they were not found.
The residents of Tepotzotlán warned of the discovery of a corpse in Peña Colorada, hands tied behind and eyes blindfolded.
The man had a gunshot wound to the neck.
In the middle of the month two men were reported executed who had been wrapped in blankets and abandoned in the trunk of a vehicle in the streets of the Villas de la Hacienda department in the municipality of Atizapán in Zaragoza, and two death warning messages were discovered with the victims.
One day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes settlement in the municipality of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby colony, the rest of the body was wrapped in a black plastic bag with a message signed by L'Incorrigible.
On the 17th, covered in blankets, two women were found in the hamlet of Zoquiapan in the municipality of Ixtapaluca, and the following morning a man's body was located in Huixquilucan, which had been wrapped in a yellow and blue blanket, being in principle identified with the name Mario Ríos, according to a message that his executors had left beside him.
In Ixtapaluca, with gunshots to the back of the neck, a woman's lifeless body was found in the hamlet of San Francisco Acuautla.
On the skin of the woman we detected tattoos of Santa Muerte and necklaces with his image.
Towards the end of the month, a man's body was found on the edge of a car in the town of Zinacantepec with at least three bullet hits and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the bodies of two men with their heads wrapped up and a message were found in the community of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the bodies there was a message signed in principle by a criminal organization, which said: "This is what happens with those who do not align."
In Ecatepec, with signs of torture and with hands and feet attached, two bodies were found inside an abandoned taxi behind the Justice Center of the San Agustín colony.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were found in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcóyotl.
The first had been beheaded in the Cuchilla Ancón colony and had been wrapped in black plastic bags, tied with a cinnamon ribbon and a message next door; while the second had been tortured and found in a plastic bag in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Near him, the agents found a Bristol with a message.
China Maintains Targets to Reduce Greenhouse Gases
The representative of that country at COP16 assured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and that it was continuing its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by between 40 and 45 per cent until 2020.
China maintains its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by between 40 and 45 per cent by 2020, said Su Wei, the country's representative at COP16.
In his first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country had made tremendous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and convert its industry.
In fact, he said, over the past four years his country has invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Nevertheless, he made it clear that China will not change its objectives, but it will continue to work together with the international community in this area.
He mentioned that China's climate change strategy is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity building; institution building; and support for pilot programmes.
Progress has been made in all these areas, including last year's approval of a new Energy Act, which recognizes the objectives addressed with respect to greenhouse gas reduction, he said.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, federal authorities worked in a coordinated manner with government and local governments to achieve energy savings, efficient energy use and emission reduction goals.
In addition, he said, there are various multi-year plans under way or completed, both funded by the Chinese government and by the governments of other countries.
For example, he mentioned the Energy Efficiency Programme, which has been implemented over the past five years and has received investments from the United Nations (UN), government and private initiative.
There is also a provincial climate change project, another for the change of filament lamps by saving lamps, and another for mitigation and adaptation, he explained.
At the same table, Martin Krol, a scientific advisor to the country's government on climate change, said that China's efforts have been greater than we think.
For example, he said, the per capita emissions of greenhouse gases in China are three tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9% of the historical contribution to contamination.
Similarly, it has made unprecedented efforts in the use of energy, how to increase energy efficiency by 20% over the past five years and plans to make it a similar one by 2020, he said.
Legal expulsion of Espino: César Nava
The national leader of PAN has detailed that the former Panist leader has the right to address the National Order Commission to demand what is rightfully required.
The national leader of PAN, César Nava Vázquez, has assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos has been legal and that the former Panist leader has the right to address the National Order Commission to demand what is rightful.
In the interview prior to Gabino Cué Monteagudo's taking of protest as governor of the state, he said that in any case, Espino's expulsion is a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Sonora Order Commission."
"Mr. Espino has the right to address himself, if necessary, by making a complaint to the Order Commission of the National Council, so that it is a decision taken within a competent body," he noted.
On the other hand, he clarified that this is not the time to think about 2012 and there has never been an alliance on the negotiating table for the presidential candidacy.
Nava Vázquez said he was convinced that Acción Nacional would be stronger after the internal elections on 4 and 5 December, where a successor should be elected.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is an aspect that has never been on the negotiating table, at least for the time being, it has been an approach to local elections that has been successful and has achieved its goal," he said.
The Panist leader mentioned that PAN is supported by 71 years of dialogue, which is why "internal competition does not scare us; on the contrary, "we enjoy it and make us stronger," he said.
He said that perhaps the council will be able to elect the best leader that Acción Nacional needs for the next three years, so it would give the office "to the person determined by the council."
"I am completely quiet and open, I would be proud to leave the party president's office to any of the five."
He predicted that the revival recorded by the party in the past elections on 4 July would be reflected in the next fight, even though "this is not yet the time to think about 2012."
"For the moment it is a question of accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments that emanate from alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a reason for observation throughout the country, so that we have made "a lot of hopes for them, and I am sure Gabino will be up to expectations".
When asked about PRI criticisms against President Felipe Calderón because of his speech during his four years of government, Cesar Nava asked the PRIs to reflect on the six years of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo y Salinas have been better than those of Fox y Calderón; that they begin to defend them; that they come out of 'armoire'," he said.
He stated that the holder of the Federal Executive can make expressions such as those he made in his speech in the National Auditorium, because in the country there is no gag, let alone censorship.
Obama promotes law in favor of undocumented students on Twitter
"If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to approve this legislation," Twittted the U.S. President in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama met today at the national mobilization to support the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message in his personal Twitter social network account.
"If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to approve this legislation," Twitté Obama said.
His short message maintains an open cyber link with a broader document that asks the public to contact senators immediately, as voting on legislation is imminent.
"With a vote that is expected soon, now is the time to listen to your voice," he says.
The message was released after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote on any legislation if the extension of Bush's tax cuts and government funding continue.
Such a blockage, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Asked about the Republican blockade of the Dream Act and other projects, presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said it is confidential that once the tax problem is resolved we can set an agenda for the rest of the projects.
"I think we have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that this tax problem must be resolved before the end of the year..."
"I think we can get an agreement at some point in this direction and then we can plan the sequence of the rest," he said.
The Leader of the Democratic Majority of the Senate, Harry Reid, announced Tuesday that he would ask for a "vote to close the debate" for the Dream Act, which is why the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted on from next Thursday in the Senate, even if the most likely would be next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act or the American Dream Law would legalize 800 thousand young people who arrived in the United States before the age of 16, remained in that country for the past five years and were accepted by a higher education institution or the Army.
But supporters need 60 votes to approve the initiative, which is why they need the help of a large number of Republicans, at times when pro-project supporters' organizations are actively lobbying to ensure approval of the Act.
The Democrats, the majority of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
Nevertheless, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against and only one Republican expressed support for the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
That is why the supporters of the Dream Act require the vote of several Republicans if other Democrats decide to vote against the initiative.
Among the most courted Republicans are Senators Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and outgoing Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who completed Senator Mel Martínez's term.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but they said they will not support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who supported him, John McCain, has not yet defined his position.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the larger obstacles to the Dream Act are in the Senate.
With literature, we put our finger on the wound.
The second stage of the Language Pleasures was a walk in which participants spread the story
"The sex in the tongue, I understand it, but... the finger on the wound? what do you expect of me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second stage of the pleasures of the language, a cycle that celebrates the literature in Spanish and that this time used the subtitle of his question (during another fair the round table was dedicated to the sex in the language, she explained).
The finger on the wound "... puts us in embarrassment", the Argentine writer gently threw to the public, most of the young people, who had gathered at the International Book Fair of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this moderated table by Marisol Shultz and in which Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio that Shultz defined later as a great story, with Luisa as the protagonist who seeks to know what the "pleasure" is, she goes from one doctor to another, without getting an answer, only leads in the same narrative thread.
From the infectiologist she comes out convinced: "Patience is not my strength, it may be my wound".
In the end, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologist who cut his breath in the middle of the corridor, but who explains that the wound is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst that reveals the mystery: "the wound is what is actually open, the symbolism is the scar".
The protagonist sighed and concluded: "on the wound I was only able to know that it is the one that is open in reality and that it does not exist", but convinced that the pleasures and traps of the language must be very related to each other.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both of them.
Nicaragua's Sergio Ramírez also presented a delightful narrative that he called Praise for the invention, where the finger on the wound is not numbered but at some point is discovered.
With hints of magic realism, he speaks of a famous sorceress who touched clouds, sent people back who had gone far or repaired the virtues that a lady had lost, a narration that she turned to speak America, the great news that had had her own columnists from the beginning and quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticized the excesses of the narratives of the conquering captains.
"Cervantes who invented us all (the writers) mocked the false witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but in an arduous way we would never have told the history of America with an imagination that lacked even indecentness."
Nevertheless, he stressed, "crazy people and liars have the best imagination" and here reality converges with the lie, it is no longer known what part of the narration belongs to one band or another, where fiction literature reaches its peak.
This is actually called the 'Tradition of Cervantes'.
"It's because of his legacy that we're told."
In turn, the writer Mayra Montyero noted and applauded the variety of interpretations provoked by the invitation of the FIL with its round table Le owes on the wound.
The Cuban-Portuguese woman has put hers on the great plague of social violence that her country is going through - and Latin America shares - produces disputes of drug trafficking and sale.
"I think that good literature, good poetry good songs contain a tacit commitment that is of course not premeditated," she said, noting that the reality of literature is communication and the dimension of the commitment between the author and the readers, and that it is a "chemical reaction" of the author.
The evening ended with the intervention of the Spanish poet Luis García Montero who also emphasized "this must on the wound of the committed writer".
He considered that in a world that lives at high speed also in terms of intellectual habits and control of consciousness that turns to the advantage of dogmatisms, "behind every statement there is a small no and behind every denial there is a small yes".
"To be masters of our own feelings and to be masters of reality, we must nuance: and nuance means many times putting a finger on the wound and disturbing people who feel very comfortable thinking about caricature, in black and white, in established ideas and without nuance and also disturbing the powers that prefer a world in black and white," he said, inviting us to regain the sense of writing.
Romano hunting his first title
Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in finals he had highs and lows in his career, but he managed to reach three times the decisive series.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, there are in addition two different styles that confront each other, marked by their technicians, which find a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in the finals, he had ups and downs in his career, but he managed to reach three times the decisive series, even though so far he hasn't put in the mile and that's why this opportunity is very special for him.
The Argentinian ended up comforting himself with the sub-champion medal, he remained a step behind the winners and curiously with the same team he played consecutive finals.
The santist strategist arrived at his first final as coach in the 2002 Opening Tournament, when he held the reins of Morelia with which he lost with a total result of 4-2 against Toluca; later, in the 2003 Closing he also arrived at the decisive duel and lost again with the overall result of 3-1 and this was precisely against Rayados.
With Santos Laguna already, in the 2010 Bicentennial Tournament again against the Diablos, Rubén again suffered a setback, as his team made an equal match of 2-2 against the Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the penalty series he got an advantage for 3-1 with two opportunities to get the title and finally three of his players missed 11 meters and he suffered the jump to the result of 4-3.
Rubén lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his rival at the tournament, therefore he does not want to have the same fate, he tries to get away from the evil so that he can celebrate a title for the first time, even if he claims that for him the institution is more important.
"I want to be champion, I don't want to break any statistics, it's for a club, not for a passion I have and therefore I will get the title, but what I mentioned before is more important," commented the helmsman when asked what his weaknesses would be in the finals.
He remembers a lot of the final, of which he assures that he has learned a lot, "the only lesson we can remember is that until the referee whistles the final, we can't celebrate, we are prepared in the line, the players too, because the last time, with two penalties to pull we were already prepared to run and I believe that this is a lesson, before the end of the game we can't celebrate".
He knows that this series could be defined by penalties, which he does not worry about, because he confides in his players: "We never seek to arrive at the series of penalties, we try to finish in the regular time, but sometimes we only have to prepare ourselves, the previous tournament we have been prepared, unfortunately fate has made a wrong turn, sometimes it is the emotions or anxiety to hold the title in our hands, hands it has escaped us, it has served us as a lesson for this final and we hope that we will no longer arrive in this situation".
Romano now has the opportunity to no longer be a sub-champion technician and taste for the first time the glory offered by titles.
The European Union changes the rules for obtaining the visa
Persons must go to Visa Applicant Service Centres prior to interviewing the Consular Section; the cost of waiting time will be reduced.
As of January 10, 2011, the visa processing procedure at the US Embassy and Consulates will change.
With the new procedure, the majority of applicants will be required to report to the Visa Applicant Service Centres (CSA) prior to their interview in the Consular Section.
CSA staff will take the applicant's biometric information, which will be reviewed by the Consular Section prior to the interview.
The new procedure will have some advantages for applicants, including the following:
The total cost to process the visa will be lower, it will no longer be necessary to make a payment to get an appointment, another payment for processing the visa and another for the mail service to deliver the document.
The aspirant will make a single payment covering all three services.
The current rate will remain the same: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visa with application (including temporary worker visas) and $390 for merchant and investor visas.
Those who wish to renew their visa will not be required to present themselves to an interview with the Consular Representative, they will present themselves only to the nearest CSA where they will present the documents and take their fingerprints.
Due to the fact that biometric information will be taken in the CSA, applicants who want a second appointment to be interviewed in the Consular Section will remain there for less time than before.
Similarly, visa applicants at the Consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra service fee of $26.

NASA to announce the discovery of extraterrestrial life
The United States Space Agency has quoted the press to present tomorrow a discovery that will have an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States will communicate tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery, which could prove the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented in a press conference tomorrow Thursday, at 1:00 p.m. at NASA headquarters in Washington for experts in astrobiology, science that studies the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
When she quoted the press, NASA assured that she would present who would have an impact on the search for extraterrestrial life", which led to speculation from experts from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures similar to us and in hostile environments that we thought were uninhabited and put on the table the possibility of becoming intelligent beings like humans if their living conditions are improved.
It seems that a microbe discovered at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, lives in an environment that was thought too venomous for any form of life, because the lake is rich in arsenic.
In any case, the creature uses arsenic as a way of life and this ability makes us think that a similar life could exist on other planets that do not have our voluntary atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, this proves that "there is another form of life, a second form of life, different from the one we know."
The space agency will communicate the true scope of the discoveries in tomorrow's press conference on Thursday.
The conference will be attended by geobiology Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (the largest satellite in Saturn), from the perspective that his chemistry is similar to that of the Earth.
Germe PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patrono 'block' opponent
With reforms to the Organic Law of Congress, the arrival of 'bipartism' is possible, it is denounced.
The 60th had just settled when in Congress an opposition bloc appeared led by the deputies of PRD, PT, Convergence and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who declared himself independent and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of 'bipartism' in the Chambers.
Before starting the session of installation of the 60th Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergencia; Ezekiel Reynoso Esparza, of PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of PRD; and Patrón Montalvo, 'tonned' against the reform of the Organic Law, because it excluded them,
With this reform, they reiterated, we initiate 'bipartism' because now there are two people, of the same number of parties, who control Congress.
These four MPs, alongside Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, PRD coordinator, were the only ones to vote against the Executive Board chaired by PANiste Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, as vice-president.
Corvera Quevedo mentioned that these institutional reforms constitute the political marginality of PRIs and NAPs.
He mentioned that the following days they would speak to PAN and PRI representatives to change the pattern based on political will and if they did not, they would again be enslaved by both parties and thus end the opposing coalition.
"So far (the opposing coalition) has arrived, that's what I'm looking at, because we're excluded from any decision, they don't even have the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, de Convergencia mentioned that with PRD, PT and Patrón there are coincidences and that is why they form a plural group.
We cannot allow, he continued, that the Congress, after having been monopolistic, is now "duopolistic".
"It is not the spirit of law reform that there is an eternal bipartisanship in Congress."
To begin with, this group starts with 5 legislators and they are now talking to other colleagues to make them more numerous, the Convergence abounded.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, from PT, explained that the Congress has now turned into a 'butine' between two, alluding to PAN and PRI.
"Before there was only one party, now they divide it between two."
Patrón Montalvo asked to respect the personality of the MP, to give him his place to the negotiating tables.
"That they do not leave by cupular agreements outside to 5 that will probably be 9 deputies, now to the five that we are seen, separated in different fractions, we have decided to unite to look for a place in the negotiating table, that is the problem, that in the reform that they have made, that they have decided, we are outside and we do not agree with this reform."
$200 million more for "the supplier"
The Town Hall of Mazatlán pays another check to the owner of the electrical equipment company.
Another check of about 200 thousand pesos in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the City Hall.
With this one, the amount paid this second semester to the owner of the electrical equipment company amounts to 1 million 200 miles pesos.
According to the transparency page of the Municipality, this last check number 9258447 was issued last November 16 for the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 pesos, in concept of "liquidation of accounts suppliers".
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had said that the Commune would pay other amounts to this supplier, which was observed by the Audit Superior of the State to sell at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total debt and, therefore, how many cheques will still be issued to Camacho Palazuelos.
"We didn't buy anything, we just pay him what we owe him, like the rest of the suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last cheques "reappeared" during the last quarter of the year: September 24, two on October 15, October 19, October 29 and November 16.
Even if the supplier has not yet published in the Official Gazette of the State, according to the Act when a company is questioned by ESA, to prevent other governments from using its services, the Treasurer has assured that they have not used its services again.
All this, after July 25 Northwest had published a revision of the cheques that the City Hall issues to its suppliers, revealing that in the interval March 2008 - July 2010, in the triennat of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the Municipality paid Camacho Palazuelos more than 10 million pesos, through 42 cheques.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, cashing cheques of more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist sites must be treated
Tourist entrepreneurs regret the accident of the foreign tourist due to the bad conditions of the roundabout Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlan.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a hollow of the Sánchez Taboada roundabout, the tourist sector of Mazatlan asked the authorities to pay attention to areas and sites that are in bad condition and project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Zona Dorada Association of Traders, recalled that they have repeatedly called for the image of the destination to be treated and new activities must replace others that tourists find bad.
He said that the poor condition of the streets and sidewalks affected because tourists come to walk there and they see the mess and avoid the nearby shops.
"Politicians don't know what it means to close a business one day and they don't know how much money you lose, elsewhere they don't do the work for so long and without proper planning."
Hotelier José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the tourist's fall exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance on the part of the City Hall.
"The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and avoid it happening again, how to do it, so through a preventive interview and only do the corrective," he said.
"We want to enjoy a clean city, because not only because of the fact that it is a tourist area we must maintain it, but as inhabitants who deserve a clean place to live there and the Town Hall must change its strategy to maintain the city well."
There are other sites that are neglected and incomplete, he said, as for example Escudo and Venadito de Mazatlan.
"Today, because the tourist comes, it depends only on promotion, there must be a good product, a city that has cleanliness in its beaches, boulevards, permanent maintenance of tourist attractions," he said.
"They have not been given the attention they need and this type of fact highlights something that is well known to all, maintenance is necessary."
Raúl Llera Martínez, under Secretary of Tourism Promotion, said the recovery of the tourist sites of Mazatlan is urgent, as they are not used properly and project a bad image.
He talked about a series of places that need to get together with the municipality and be a priority to have the city up to date, clean, tidy and attractive because it has a tourist vocation.
"Happily Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites and places that we should first order, clean and put us online to make them attractive so that we can add them to the inventory we have to promote this destination."
IP asks for results in Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CCE, proposed that MEPs assume the great responsibility of being an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations it faces.
Mazatlán's business sector is calling for a decent and free working legislature between the parties and the government executive, because Sinaloa is being convulsed and faced with major problems.
Yesterday the 60th Parliament was established, formed by seven political forces, 19 MPs from PRI, 13 from PAN, three from the New Alliance Party, two from PRD, one from PT, one from Convergence and one from PVEM, in total 40 popular representatives.
The list of expectations that the new members of the Government Congress is a clean and committed management with society and the different sectors that need responsible legislative work and that the same models of party spirit or paternalism do not repeat.
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CCE, proposed that MEPs assume the great responsibility of being an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations it faces.
"We hope that the deputies will actually exercise their right, free of agreements between the parties because the custom is that they make pacts to ensure their own interests and they turn into carnival masquerades of the rulers and leaders of parliamentary fractions."
That is why I ask them to certify the commitment to establish the necessary bridges that the current Governor is making.
"We will ensure that they do a decent and especially committed job with society and sectors because the people of Sinaloa gave them their vote of confidence in the past elections.
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotels Association, considered that one of the great provocations of the 40 popular representatives is to push and add forces in seeking the economic growth of the state, because the economic situation is now very complicated.
"The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, generate incentives for investment and infrastructure, and that in a way will stimulate the generation of jobs."
With regard to tourism, he asked that the new legislators give it the importance it has in the government budget to consolidate the Governmental Tourism Secretariat.
"I understand that it is the second Secretariat of the State with a smaller budget and that it is incongruous as an important economic activity and generating currency and investment and that it competes directly with agro-industry."
Apart from the fact that resources have to be classified for detonating tourism projects that help to provide security to the state and update the Alcohol Act that previous legislatures have not been able to solve.
We're looking for King Mage.
Dolls, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the wishes of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For their parents, the next day of the Magi will be difficult to fulfill their illusions, because their home is made up of no more than 12 people and a goat.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchior, Balthazar and Gaspard will wear the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family lives in a humble house in Colonia Salvador Allende and they live day by day because their father does not have a stable job.
"Sometimes it's very difficult for us, because my husband doesn't have a job, but we sell mandarins and potatoes...and in the afternoon I go out with the 'plèbes' for sale in the street," says Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Adelaida, 4 years old, wants a doll or a bicycle, and her sister Isabel, 3 years old, would like a Barbie doll.
In turn, José Alfredo, 10 years old, has long aspired to have a 'monster truck' and for his little brother Jesús, 8 months old, Cayetana suggests clothing size for a year.
"He told me (José Alfredo), 'I'd like to have this monster', but I told him 'we'll see, my son', because he was very dear", recalls Cayetana with sadness.
For older children, who were in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
María Guadalupe, 11 years old, shoes the size 12; Isaías, 10 years old, shoes the size 10, while Miguel, 8 years old, shoes the size eight.
José Juan, 14, needs a pair of sports shoes, so a pair of size five and a half or six would help him a lot.
If you want to help make the dream of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family come true you can participate in the campaign On Search King Mage, giving a toy or money at the reception of Northwest.
14 alleged drug traffickers arrested
About ten searches were carried out in Estrie on Wednesday as part of the dismantling of a cannabis production and sale network.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
The searches were conducted in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly in drug production locations.
"Approximately 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, money and production equipment were seized," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesperson for the Sûreté du Québec.
A total of eleven men and three women were arrested, including the two alleged leaders of this network, two men from Sherbrooke.
Persons arrested were to appear at the Sherbrooke courthouse within hours of their arrest.
They could face accusations of cannabis production, possession for the purpose of trafficking, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These searches were carried out following a long-term investigation, which lasted almost a year.
"It was information received from the public that allowed us to make these arrests," said Mr. Ruel.
Some 70 police officers from the regional investigation module of Estrie de la Sûreté du Québec, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Board took part in this police operation.
Illegal migration can continue without problems
The Conservative bill, which the government believes should address the problem of ships loaded with illegal migrants, is clearly going to be defeated when the three opposition parties announced Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I rely heavily on the Charter."
"I stand with a party that created granite under your feet," said Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, while he was surrounded by MPs after the weekly caucus meeting.
The Liberals claim that the proposed bill, which would allow for up to one year of possession of any person from a ship identified as carrying illegal immigrants, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The Chief of the Bloc Québécois, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that he could not support the bill, because he was attacking the wrong target.
"We are against it and it seems that all opposition parties are against it, so we will see what the government will do," said Duceppe.
The NPD's criticism of immigration, Olivia Chow, rejected from the back of her hand criticisms that her party was not strong enough about illegal immigrants.
"New Democrats agree to take action against smugglers, and that's what we do through another bill, the C-35," said Chow.
"We do not support the Conservative bill because it attacks refugees and imprisons children for at least a year," Chow said.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused opposition parties of playing politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
"Canadians tell MPs massively that they do not tolerate this kind of clandestine migration, these criminal operations that target Canada and treat the country like a clown."
"They expect Canada to take firm action," said Minister Kenney.
The government has not announced a vote of confidence in its bill, which could have led the country to elections if it were rejected.
However, one Conservative told the QMI Agency that the government was going to ask for a vote so that every MP who objected would then explain himself to his constituents.
The new unit is not unanimous
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a permanent unit to combat corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the establishment of a public commission of inquiry on the subject.
The Minister of Public Safety, Robert Dutil, argues that this idea was not dated yesterday: Quebec would have consulted the Department of Investigation in New York on this issue as early as January.
The metropolis has had a permanent unit on corruption since 1870.
Yet, Tuesday's announcement surprised more than one.
It must be said that at a meeting of the Permanent Council on Police Services in Quebec on October 29, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
It was no more necessary for the pequistian public safety critic, Stéphane Bergeron, to call this announcement "a bunny out of a hat" and "bricky solution on the corner of a table".
Minister Dutil responded to those who fear that political power will have too much influence on the possible future unity.
"You'll see the result when we announce it, just say so."
"We are aware of this problem."
For the Chairman of the CSQ, Réjean Parent, there is nothing to replace the setting up of a public investigation.
"The more Mr. Charest insists on not wanting to set up this commission of inquiry, the more people think like you and me that he has something to hide," he explains.
"The only way to have a commission of inquiry is Jean Charest's resignation," says Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To get out of this impasse, he therefore suggested that Quebec give a special mandate to the Auditor General to investigate collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to broaden the mandate of the Auditor General," he says.
He also felt that Quebec could give the auditor the same powers as a commissioner, thereby enabling him to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent squad is not the only project in the Charest government cartons.
Quebec would also ask Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code in order to be better adapted to this type of crime.
This request would emanate from the prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the jurisprudence is not explicit in such investigations.
The Federal Minister of Public Safety, Vic Toews, confirmed that his Justice colleague, Rob Nicholson, is currently considering some amendments related to this matter.
During Operation Spring 2001, which struck motorcycle groups, even if the Criminal Code was not adapted, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently passed the Gangsterism Act.
Rivers under high surveillance
Several streams remain under high surveillance due to heavy rainfall in several areas of the province since Tuesday.
A landslide occurred on Wednesday afternoon in Shawinigan, Mauritius.
Two houses were evacuated in a preventive manner.
In the evening another slip would have occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, Lanaudière.
A road went down.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, heavy rainfall fell on several regions, ranging from 40 to 70 millimetres of rain.
An additional 20 to 40 millimetres of rain were expected by Thursday evening, depending on the region.
The areas north of the river and in the Outaouais Valley were the most affected.
They could receive up to 100 millimetres of rain in total.
As it is necessary to add these precipitations to the snowmelt already accumulated in some areas, there is a fear of overflowing several streams.
Flood alert warnings were issued on Wednesday evening by the Quebec Civil Security for the Ouareau Rivers and the Achigan Rivers in Lanaudière.
The rivers of the North, Saint-Jérôme, the Laurentians, and the Oak, Lotbinière, were flooded and remained under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, heavy rainfall has led to the flooding of some lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a temporary bridge was carried away due to heavy rains.
Ten residences had to be evacuated by preventive measure.
In Outaouais, the overflow of some lakes resulted in the closure of several roads, notably in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
Civil Security remains on an alert and monitors the situation closely, said Annik Bouchard, Security Advisor.
On Wednesday, the Quebec Flood Centre issued warnings of heavy floods for several rivers, including Maskinongé, L'Assomption, Ouareau, l'Achigan, Batiscan and du Loup.
Partially blasted Dupont
Quebec radio host Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial setback before the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council (CCNR) for controversial remarks about social assistance and Haitians as well as its crude language on the air.
The CCNR considers that Mr. Dupont and his team from CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their opinions, but that some statements contained "inaccurate information on social assistance, unduly negative representations of Haitians and rude language that is not suitable for broadcasts during the day".
The Commission also concluded that a discussion on suicide, including the dissemination of the names of two persons who had committed suicide, did not violate broadcasting codes.
The CBSC had received several complaints about comments made during programming broadcast between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint by the Frente comun des personnes aideés sociales du Québec.
The group complained that the amounts cited in the program were inaccurate.
The facilitators must present solid rather than misleading information.
Regarding suicide, host Stéphane Dupont thought suicide was a cowardly gesture.
The majority of Committee members concluded that the message conveyed was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life's problems.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes at issue of "Down at noon" have addressed a sensitive subject in a fair and appropriate manner."
Therefore, no blame has been held against him.
The last dispute concerned statements that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had then given themselves to a media face-to-face that had sparked a lot of reactions.
The facilitator of CHOI said that he had made no donation to help Haitians because one could not know with certainty that the needy people would really receive the money.
The Committee believes that these comments were not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes an unduly negative representation of Haitians.
"I've already purged my three-day suspension on that."
"My file has been blank for a year and a half," the facilitator said.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the dissemination of coarse language.
In each case, the broadcaster CHOI-FM collaborated "beyond its obligation".
The consequences are minimal for the station, which will, among other things, have to announce these decisions once during prime listening hours within three days.
Kung-fu King in Montreal
The Montrealer of Algerian origin Nacereddine Zemmal has an extremely special journey.
The athlete who excels in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and Thai boxing climbs on the tatami and rings of the world in search of new challenges.
"I started practicing martial arts like kung-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria," explained Zemmal, who has been based in the metropolis since 2008 to evolve among professionals."
"In my case, I'm looking for battles everywhere, since for those who don't like the ground play in mixed martial arts, competitions are rare in North America."
Recently, the man who works as a security officer and as a clerk for the UPS company has just given bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) Amateur World Championship from October 23 to 30 in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won the categories of full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing," he explained.
"Currently, I'm preparing to go to China for the San shou World Cup."
"The fighters who finished among the top four in the last world championship in each category were invited."
"I won bronze in 2009 in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished eighth."
"In 2007, in China, I finished the tournament in fifth place, while I arrived third in Toronto in 2009, he added."
"What's interesting is that I've made progress in every competition."
"At this rate, I will be first this time or next year!"
The "san shou" or "sanda" is a discipline native to China where punches and feet, as well as projections on the ground, are allowed.
The duels originally take place on a platform and more rarely in a ring.
The most renowned fighter from this form of combat is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, well known in the martial arts world.
If Nacer Zemmal has only one event to remember in his career, he will certainly respond to his presence at the "King of Sanda" tournament, the kung-fu Super Bowl.
"This competition is the highest and most prestigious in China," explained the friendly guy."
"It's kind of the equivalent of the Lumpinee Stadium (the biggest stadium in Thailand)."
"It was a great experience."
Zemmal won his first fight, in the semi-final of his category (80 kg), before losing in the final.
"He who defeated me was a real pro," he said.
"There are four combatants per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals compete in the finals of their category."
"Then the winners of each category face each other in order to crown a single champion, the king of kung fu."
450 million in contracts without invitation to tender
Hydro-Québec has committed $450 million in contracts to engineering firms for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts is a consortium formed by BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor that obtained the most important, that of the project's stewardship, for a sum of $295 million without invitation to tender.
This consortium, known as Energy Stewardship, was established in 2004 in conjunction with Hydro-Québec's choice to entrust the private sector with its responsibility to manage this important $5 billion hydroelectric project.
In early 2005, the Managing Energy consortium won the lucrative contract without a public tender.
For the Parti Québécois, the use of business consortia poses a serious ethical problem that risks eliminating competition and causing price increases.
"This is the new way of collusion and cutting down competition."
"That is, people, instead of doing it secretly, now do it openly," said the Polish MP Sylvain Simard yesterday in a press conference.
Earlier in the morning, Mr. Simard raised the issue in the National Assembly because he said that it was difficult to see how the public interest could be served in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, responded in the afternoon, strongly denying that there was collusion for this contract.
"I'm starting to get my trip," she said, arguing that the QP had been "bad" and "lacked rigour."
She said that "it would be the least of things" that the PQ apologizes.
The consortium formula is a common practice around the world.
It is usually a time-limited alliance that allows two or more companies to pool their respective expertise in order to respond to a call for tenders for a complex project.
The Eastmain project has a high level of complexity given the scale of the work.
The construction site is in progress and is scheduled to run until 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without competition; negotiations took place.
Also, the consortium formula is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir revealed last week, the consortium formula in the consulting engineering sector is being investigated by the government.
A quick overview of the Quebec business register allows more than 200 consortia to be counted, some of which appear to be permanent.
For example, Dessau works in partnership with most of its major competitors, including CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin and others Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens, brings back to one and the same legal person, Dessau.
With respect to the Energy Stewardship Consortium, Minister Normandeau noted that "the territory of James Bay responds to specific labour dynamics and that Hydro-Québec responds to them in a particular way since the 1970s."
The major owner of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, of the James Bay Energy Corporation (SEBJ), gave an explanation that highlighted the fact that the project's stewardship contract was granted voluntarily.
"If you go to tender and there are few bidders, your prices will be higher."
"You have two choices: either you take the people who are in this market and you say: we will negotiate a satisfactory agreement and with a good price."
"But the idea is that it is not the price that is important, it is the competence of people," said Mr Laporte.
This contract awarded to the consortium Energy Stewardship is part of a long list of contracts over $50,000 obtained by the Parti Québécois.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, Le Devoir counted 109 engineering consulting contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to firms or their subsidiaries, including soil laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin broke 22 contracts, Génivar got 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, not to mention his participation in Stewardship Energy.
All contracts were negotiated.
They total $449,783,344, including the Stewardship Energy contract of $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard suggested that the four firms that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "well known to the Liberal Party of Quebec."
Minister Normandeau dropped the fact that the QP is also linked to those firms that "finance" it, before stating that it was rather its leaders.
Responsible consumption barometer - The "green" label does not inspire confidence
Greener, but frankly skeptical.
Quebec's consumer has very little confidence in sustainable development players, but also in fair brands and ecologic certifications to guide their choices.
Worse, even if he bathes in a media world where messages in favour of more responsible consumption fill, he deplores a lack of credible information, which he even calls a brake on his commitment, says the Barometer of responsible consumption, whose first reading was delivered yesterday.
Although they increased the consumption of so-called socially responsible products in 2010, Quebecers seem to be lending very little credit to those who are trying to sell them.
Two thirds of them say they do not believe the environmental commitment of companies as well as the green advertising of companies, reveals the measurement tool developed by the Responsible Consumer Observatory of Sherbrooke University.
Another finding is that half of consumers doubt the reliability of official certifications on so-called fair products, but also the credibility of products and brands appearing to be eco-responsible, says the Barometer.
In the same vein, politicians' discourse on this subject is taken seriously by only 14.6% of Quebecers.
However, responsible consumer information seems essential to stimulate this segment of consumption currently driven by almost a third of Quebec consumers.
Indeed, the vagueness and dubiousness of the information would calm the ardour of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the Barometer, after the higher price of these products.
In addition, one third of Quebecers also say they are wary of the alleged performance of the green products or services they are trying to put in their hands.
On another note, consumers were almost half in 2010 to have changed their habit and, above all, changed the brand of one or more products to meet their belief.
At 61%, they also promoted purchases from shopkeepers in their neighbourhood and preferred the purchase of food products grown in their area, says the Barometer.
Greener and more responsible - the responsible consumer index has reached 64 out of a maximum of 100 for this year - the Homo consumerus of Quebec likes to present itself as the king of recycling who seeks to reduce its environmental footprint by worrying about the protection of animals.
But his social and ecological consciousness seems to remain outside his car, says the Barometer: in 2010, barely 28% of Quebecers reported using public transport or advocating carpooling to defend their green interests.
Walking and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of participants in this extensive behavioural survey, which has just taken its first shot.
A State loan for the purchase of eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which has been asked to commit financially to the purchase of the eXcentris film complex by the Angus Society and the Parallel, agrees to cooperate, but with only one loan.
The Angus Development Society and the Parallel, who hoped for a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to buy Daniel Langlois the eXcentris film complex on St. Lawrence Boulevard by giving him his full film vocation, did not get what they demanded.
The government agrees to get involved in the matter, but on its own terms.
Rather than the expected donation, the Government of Quebec is proposing a loan that would be lower than the original expectations, which could be a viable solution on advantageous terms, at least in the opinion of sources from state offices.
A first action plan and a request of 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, but the requests have since been revised downwards.
A proposal and action plan were sent to Minister St-Pierre by the President of the Society for the Development of Cultural Enterprises (SODEC), François Macerola, who is piloting the eXcentris file.
He sent him a final report about ten days ago.
But the cabinet's counterproposal reached SODEC on Tuesday.
The Parallel and Angus have until December 31 to respond.
It seems, however, that the assumption of the gift of the State really needs to be ruled out.
It should be recalled that the Association des owneres de cinémas et de cinéparcs du Québec opposed a direct investment by the State to support the purchase of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture does not have to finance real estate projects, which it did not do for other cinemas.
On the contrary, several stakeholders in the community called for substantial economic assistance.
Daniel Langlois, the master of céans, for ten years put an end to the cinema of author in his premises of the complex after having financed his own construction, which could justify an exemption from the Treasury Board.
The lack of cinemas for independent films is crying in Montreal, and eXcentris had been able to retain its clientele.
The Angus Society and the Parallel, led by Christian Yaccarini, are piloting a private financing campaign, hoping to raise $700,000 to push the acquisition wheel.
Since the spring of 2009, only one of the three screens, The Parallel, continues to broadcast films at eXcentris.
The goal of future buyers is to reopen the three rooms on February 27th by screening Xavier Beauvois's beautiful film Men and Gods.
But Christian Yaccarini did not recall Le Devoir and we do not know what he and his group think of the downward proposals made to them.
The veil lifted on a complex Canada...
New U.S. diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks lift the veil over what the U.S. sees as the Canadian inferiority complex to the Americans, but at the same time betrays the U.S.'s sense of superiority towards Canada.
Thus, American diplomats are surprised that every Canadian voter does not have Canadian-American relations in mind by going to vote and believe that President Obama's visit helped the Conservative government to get its budget adopted in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, spread out on the public square yesterday, offer more crisp details than substantial content to put under the tooth.
A cable dated September 22, 2008, which is in the midst of a federal election campaign, tells us how much the United States is not part of the issues discussed by the political leaders.
To the astonishment of the American ambassador stationed in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins offers some explanations for this situation.
"A near-inherent Canadian inferiority complex may condition Canadian political leaders to talk about internal issues of everyday life rather than bringing this election to the United States (as in the 1988 Free Trade Campaign), " he writes.
The United States is therefore, he concludes, "the proverbial elephant of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to talk about it."
The Ambassador understands all the less this "deafening silence" because the two countries have an intense political and economic relationship.
"Logically, he believes, the ability of a candidate, a party and even more of a party leader to manage this essential relationship should be a key factor that voters have in mind when going to vote."
The other expression of this sense of importance is read in the cable sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, Business Manager in Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help ensure the government's survival in the early February vote of confidence in the federal budget, by which Canada will post its first deficit in more than a decade because of a $30 to $40 billion stimulus plan," says Breese.
No mention is made of the fact that the government had to extend Parliament before Christmas to avoid being overthrown by the coalition and that the opposition parties made their survival conditional on the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another communication, dated January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins, warns Washington of the increasingly negative image that the drama series broadcast at CBC refer from the United States.
The Ambassador is concerned about Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence, and H2O programs, where there are subtle references to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or CIA muscle-interview abductions.
Another cable reports that, at their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked his French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe was ready to welcome some prisoners from Guantánamo.
Mr. Kouchner replied yes, but on the basis of "case-by-case".
At the end of the meeting, it is written, "he gave a paper to the Secretary of State about Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The secretary agreed to review the file."
Finally, let's note that the spirits are warming up about the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a former advisor very close to Stephen Harper, said on CBC's airwaves that the person responsible for this massive leak should be "murdered."
He echoed Mike Huckabee in the United States.
A global plan to renovate lighting
Yesterday in Cancun, the United Nations proposed a plan for the renovation of domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries with a view to achieving a greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction, which is almost one third of the additional reduction needed to stabilize the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is in line with the major concrete projects that the United Nations hopes to adopt in Cancún to offset the lack of binding reduction commitments by the industrialized countries.
According to the plan filed yesterday, if the incandescent bulbs that still monopolize from 50 to 70% of the market were replaced by fluocompact bulbs or, better, by light-emitting diode bulbs (DEL or "LED"), the bulk of the 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of GHGs emitted on the planet to illuminate humans would be avoided.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This is the equivalent of 70% of global fleet emissions.
In Copenhagen last year, major issuing countries, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans that are expected to increase overall GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But we will have to subtract from this 5 Gt balance sheet in order to stabilize by 2020 the climate rise to 2 degrees centigrade in order to prevent it from becoming out of control.
In incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy dissipates in the form of heat and the remainder, i.e. 5%, produces light.
With fluocompact bulbs, the energy expenditure is reduced by 75% and with the new LED bulbs, this need for energy is reduced by twice.
Fluocompact bulbs last an average of 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, like those launched by manufacturer Philips this week - this company has also participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, giving an idea of the possible economy with a replacement plan that would apply to 100 countries.
These brand new bulbs can also work with rheostats and emit very little heat.
And they contain no mercury.
Several experts have posted reservations about fluocompact bulbs as they contain mercury and need to be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries unless manufacturers put in place instructions.
But, the report says, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the fluocompact bulb, but rather coal-fired thermal power plants, which emit a lot of mercury to produce wasted electricity in incandescent bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury per year.
The report details the gains that each country would make through this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save one billion dollars a year in electricity purchases and eight million tons of CO2, the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants that would cost it 2.5 billion.
Côte d'Ivoire looks forward to the announcement of election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called for the publication "without delay" of the results of the presidential election in Côte d'Ivoire, after the deadlines had expired.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and announce the provisional results without further delay," said a spokesman for the head of the UN."
"It calls on all Ivorian parties and institutions to show responsibility and refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the election commission dropped the deadline of Wednesday midnight without publishing the results, three days after Sunday's election.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the CIS president had said on television that the commission "continues to work" to announce the results.
The calls have multiplied on Wednesday in the world so that the CIS finally proclaims the name of the winner of the second round between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and the opponent Alassane Ouattara.
But the Gbagbo camp is counting on the cancellation by the Constitutional Council of "fraudulent" votes in the north, held by the former rebellion of the Forces nouvelles (FN) since the failed coup d'état of September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, campaign director of the Ivorian president, said that the intimidation of voters by the FN in the north of the country had discouraged the supporters of the outgoing president from voting.
The entire election could be cancelled if Gbagbo's complaints were retained by the Constitutional Council.
Gbagbo's opponents believe that the country's highest court is not neutral because it is headed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man of the North who denies any connection with the former rebels, considered the delay in announcing the results "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but he did not go so far as to claim victory.
His allies claim that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows that he has lost and that making a complaint to the Constitutional Council, after preventing the electoral commission from disseminating the results, would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential election on Sunday was supposed to mark the culmination of the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country that remained divided into two for years.
The United Nations warned the Ivorian political class on Wednesday that it could be held responsible for possible violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished at the head of the first round on October 31, with 38% of the votes against 32% in Alassane Ouattara, who received public support from former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remained stable in France in the 3rd quarter
The unemployment rate in France within the meaning of the International Labour Office (ILO) remained stable at 9.3% in the metropolis (9.7% counting the overseas departments), showing the seasonally adjusted data (CVS) published on Thursday by the Insee.
The number of unemployed is 2.631 million in the metropolis.
The data for the second quarter were confirmed at 9.3% of the working population in the metropolis and 9.7% with the DOM.
Over a year, the unemployment rate is rising by 0.1 points.
More broadly, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter but wanted to work, whether or not they were available within two weeks to work and whether or not they were looking for a job.
The situation of young people in the labour market has deteriorated further, with a further rise in the unemployment rate, rising to 24.2% in the metropolis (+ 0.9 points over three months, + 0.5 points over one year) and 25% including the DOMs.
In the third quarter, 637,000 young people aged 15-24 were unemployed within the meaning of the ILO.
Seniors experienced a slight rise in unemployment, to 6.4% in metropolitan areas (+0.2 points over three months and over one year), or 482,000 people aged 50 or over, and 6.6% with the DOMs.
Only the 25-49-year-olds benefited from unemployment stability in the third quarter, at 8.3% in the metropolis (-0.1 point over three months, +0.1 point over one year) and 8.8% throughout France.
Insee no longer publishes monthly unemployment rates since 2006, after a controversy over its method of calculation.
Eurostat, the statistical agency of the European Union, on the other hand, continues to do so and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% for France (including DOM) in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini indicted and detained
Alexandre Guérini, 53 years old, the leader of waste treatment companies and brother of President PS of the General Council of Bouches-du-Rhône, was questioned and found guilty at the Luynes prison, near Aix-en-Provence, as part of an investigation into alleged fraudulent public procurement.
Alexandre Guérini was indicted for abuse of social property, misappropriation of funds and public property, concealment, active corruption, trafficking in influence and possession of ammunition, says her lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is combative and wants to explain himself on all the questions the magistrate is going to ask him, not fantasies."
"It is easy to prosecute him for a multitude of reprehensible leaders, it is another thing to prove them," his lawyer, Florence Rault, told AFP before her client's hearing.
Mr. Guérini, brother of the PS's strong man in the department, Jean-Noël Guérini, had, through his lawyers, to send the judge before his hearing a memo to explain himself.
One of his relatives, Philippe Rapezzi, was also screened on Wednesday evening and nailed.
According to his lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, his client has never done anything other than run the landfills he had to manage.
As for the award of contracts or the destination of funds related to their operation, he never knew about them, said Simon.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former Director General of the Aubagne agglomeration services, was questioned on Wednesday for misappropriation of public funds and complicity, and was released under judicial supervision with a ban on meeting the protagonists of the case.
"My client has been able to explain the facts against him."
"The investigating magistrate took this into account by not depriving him of his liberty," said his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux.
Four others had been indicted and released on the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, with two of them under judicial supervision, said Deputy Prosecutor Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Director General for Cleanliness of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is being prosecuted for "influence and passive corruption".
Two officials from the agglomeration of Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are being questioned for "substruction and diversion of public goods by a person in charge of a public service mission", and for "complicity of misappropriation of public funds".
Finally, Alexander Guérini's companion, Jeannie Peretti, was questioned for "recel d'abuse de biens sociales".
Among the people who have faced Mr. Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently stranded in a parallel case of fraudulent public procurement affecting Corsica.
Investigators suspect his companies have been used to launder money from big banditry.
The investigation is carried out in the context of several judicial information opened against X in April 2009 following anonymous mail, for alleged fraud in the procurement of public contracts, in particular in the waste sector.
From a source close to the investigation, the investigations focus in particular on the conditions for the allocation and operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne as well as some cities in the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss case: the Elysée exaggerated Syria's mediation
For more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher arrested in Iran for "spying", held the opinion in breath in France, alerted diplomacy, and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the watchful eye of the diplomats of the United States.
The American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal some below this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée explained its strategy to the Americans, going so far as to give them advice for the treatment of their own "hostages" crises in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how the French officials sought to convince Washington that the release of the young French woman had not been matched by the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and wanted by US justice for trafficking in materials for the benefit of Iran's nuclear program.
Finally, they put the way in which the French Presidency sought to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad had played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss.
Actually, it wasn't.
A diplomatic telegram written on 12 August 2009 in Paris is entitled "Iran: French comments on how to manage hostage cases".
The Elysée advisor for strategic affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, meet with American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method to him.
They advise Americans to do the same to return their own forcibly detained nationals to Iran.
"Make noise," they say, "bring constantly" in the media the words "fundamental human rights", "innocency", "immediate liberation".
It is necessary in order to embarrass the Iranian regime, sensitive to its image.
"Do it all the more so as the Iranians ask you not to do it."
Because, after the attempts to talk through discrete channels, "silence will not fix anything", the Iranians are "masters in dilatory maneuvers".
Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is "a familiar Iranian tactic: hostage-taking for political blackmail".
He announces that the release of Clotilde Reiss prison (which will take place on 16 August, the day she takes refuge at the French Embassy) "will require a large amount of money to be paid to Iranians" (230,000 euros in bail).
And he reports that the Elysée anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon that "will worsen".
The Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of the approximately 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss has been out of prison for 12 days, but remains stranded in Iran.
Information is disseminated: Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose United States claims extradition for illegal trafficking of sensitive electronic material to Iran, is released in Paris, on a decision of a judge.
The American embassy, like many observers, questions this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, which is tracking Iranian clandestine networks for the acquisition of nuclear programme equipment, Majid Khakavand's enlargement is bad news.
Has France accepted a bargain?
The liberation of the Iranian against the liberation of the French?
In a new interview with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September, François Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he said, not only "was completely taken by surprise by the judge's decision," but sought to oppose it.
"There was a lively exchange between the French Presidency and the guard of seals" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot return to the judicial decision", he notes.
Mr. Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand remains under the "close" supervision of the French intelligence services.
The councillor of the Elysée composed a telephone number, hung up, then informed the American diplomat that the Iranian "is currently located in buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian embassy".
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée does not spare its efforts, through press releases and "flights" organized in the media, to make believe that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad plays an "important" and "influence" role as "mediator".
The Americans observe this activity not without irony, and note that manipulation bears fruit since several press articles echo the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 refers to "the 'blitz' media of French officials".
On what is so much "gratitude" expressed towards Mr. Assad, the embassy in Paris asks.
"Despite their laudable statements, French officials privately acknowledge that they have only a vague notion of what the Syrians have actually done."
The paper then looks at the reasons that prompted the Elysée to pour into this fiction.
The intense communication effort "is aimed at validating Sarkozy's policy of opening up to Syria," he analyses.
A policy launched in 2008, which "was then perceived by many critical voices in France and abroad as premature and undeserved".
By "exaggerating the Syrian role", Paris seeks to "demonstrate to Syria what praises it can attract by playing a constructive role in the region".
The aim is also "to sow seeds of discord between Syria and Iran".
The American embassy knows that from a good source.
On August 11, François Richier entrusted him with: "Of course, we do not know if the Syrians have done anything."
"But we thanked them anyway."
"This should at least sow confusion among Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy received her at the Elysée.
In a statement, he thanked the Presidents of Brazil, Senegal, and Syria for their "active role in the liberation of our compatriot".
No online games for Korean youth past midnight
The South Korean government will pass a so-called "Cinderella" law that will prohibit teenagers from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, said government officials.
A bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to ask online gambling companies to block access to these games after midnight, to young people under the age of 16, reported representatives of the Ministries of Culture and Family.
"Many children play these games all night and then have trouble studying at school and having a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to guarantee their health and their right to sleep," said AFP Jo Rin, the minister responsible for the bill.
Online games will again be available at 6 a.m.
Companies will have one year to prepare for law enforcement, he said.
The government is also considering asking companies to limit the daily access time to these games for young people whose parents request them, added the head.
It will also make available to people who demand it free software that allows to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly report various facts related to intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the undisputed champion of world online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, against 58 other nations.
2018-2022 World Cup: Fifa designates organizing countries
In full torment due to suspicions of corruption, the Fifa Executive Committee names Thursday the organizing countries of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, an eminently political choice where struggles of influence and lobbying risk to take over the technical criteria.
One thing is certain, the 2018 edition of the competition queen of the Fifa will take place in Europe, traditional bastion of discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
That of 2022 will be much more exotic, with the International Federation hoping to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a first on the African continent in 2010, or to continue its establishment in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities from the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch heads of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) shows the economic and political stakes of a World Cup.
Behind-the-scenes treatments are therefore likely to last until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy between candidates.
According to Fifa's assessment report, English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) files have better arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations will not weigh very heavily for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the vote.
The Sunday Times, at the origin of the revelations that led to the suspension for corruption of two members of the EC (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could have ruined the chances of his country, the cradle of football that hosted the World Cup only once, in 1966.
On Monday, the BBC released a cover film featuring three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
What is to dissatisfy the Fifa and embarrass the English officials, who have embarked on intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron on the front line.
The head of government hopes to re-edit the coup by his predecessor Tony Blair, who in 2005 had obtained the organization of the OJ-2012 for London.
Will this intense activity be sufficient to restore the coat of arms of England to the EC?
Nothing is less certain because the duo Spain-Portugal does not lack assets with its already ready stadiums, its expertise (Mondial-82 in Spain, OJ-92 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the dark economic and financial prospects of the two countries could shower their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English and the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal only increase Russia's share, which has become an outsider of weight despite the shortcomings of its file (states, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to make the trip to Zurich and denounced "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote", in an allusion barely veiled to the accusations of the English press against the members of the EC.
"We cover them with mud, we try to compromise them," Mr. Putin said.
For 2022, the United States, with the experience of 1994, appears to be the logical favourites.
First world economic power, home to the main sponsors of the Fifa, the country seems to be ahead of Japan and South Korea, which have built a very beautiful project separately.
But these new applications appear premature for two countries that co-organized the test in 2002.
Another threat is the granting of the 2026 World Cup to China, ardently desired by the Fifa, which would in fact make the Asian chances by 2022 obsolete.
With Qatar, which came out of the big game by proposing futuristic stages, and Australia, the Fifa would continue to expand to new areas, but these two countries are more at risk than certainties.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also suffer from the weakness of the TV rights paid (because of the time lag) by European countries, the nerve of the war for the Fifa.
Second term: evidence
De Gaulle really hesitated.
Mitterrand had made him think he was hesitant.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac had no hesitation whatsoever.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than they are.
One warrant at Elysée calls for another.
So the current head of state will be running for office in 2012.
But the evidence does not make good sense with the mystery part attached to the presidential function.
Then we have to pretend that the doubt still exists.
One way or the other.
In 2006, even without believing it, Jacques Chirac's friends claimed that a third term was not excluded.
On November 15, with a serious air, Nicolas Sarkozy assured that he would make his decision "somewhat in the autumn of 2011".
What he mentions in front of UMP parliamentarians, Tuesday night at the Elysée, the prospect of "two mandates" has sown a little febrileness.
Was it the official announcement of his candidacy?
We were a long way from it.
The President merely recalled that the 2008 constitutional review limited the number of five-year years to two.
He was making a statement, not an announcement.
This is not the first time he has mentioned the presidential, in the tone of humor, in such encounters.
"At worst, or at best, you're still seven and a half years old with me," he had launched them in July 2009.
Rebelote in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not thinking about the next step."
His words of the day before yesterday make him no more candidate than the day before; they make him no less.
If they raise comments, it's for a two-fold reason.
Acceleration of the running for the PS, on the one hand.
But it is not Ségolène Royal's entry into the league that forces Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
This is because his 2012 candidacy is clear that many in the PS are calling for an earlier than anticipated battle order.
Wrong polls, on the other hand.
For the first time right-wing voters would prefer François Fillon's candidacy to Nicolas Sarkozy's (46% versus 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion at the UMP about it," the Prime Minister immediately and cautiously reacted to.
"If he believes the defeat is possible, he will not be a candidate," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always believe he can win," corrects Alain Juppé, clearly resigned.
Euro: the ECB forced to maintain its purchases of state securities
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year was to be an opportunity to clarify the modalities for exiting the crisis or, at least, to announce the cessation of many of the non-conventional monetary policy operations to be completed by the end of the year.
In the wake of the sovereign debt crisis in Europe, the Frankfurt issuing institution will probably not be able to afford to be as peremptory as it is under pressure to aggravate a more tense situation on European bond markets today.
The political cost would be even higher.
Yesterday, at a press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde welcomed the ECB's active role in resolving the state debt crisis in Europe.
She did not want to say whether she felt that the central bank should do more, for example by increasing its sovereign bond purchase program.
"I reserve my thoughts to my European partners (...) ".
The day before, in Brussels, at its hearing by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not appear more dissert about his intentions, merely stating that the programme for the purchase of State securities in the secondary market "was continuing" and that "we will see what we decide" at the meeting on Thursday.
Only certainty: the ECB will keep its main management rate unchanged at 1%, its lowest historical level since May 2009.
In fact, purchases of Treasury bonds by the ECB doubled last week to nearly €1.35 billion.
And, according to the indiscretions of market operators, she would have made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese securities yesterday.
A total of EUR 67 billion has been purchased by the Eurosystem's central banks since May 2010.
Among market operators, there is no doubt about the expectations of a continuation of purchases (see page 29).
Nor do economists expect any significant change in course.
While more than three months' lending operations have already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, the ECB still makes unlimited liquidity allocations on generous terms and for periods ranging from one week to three months.
Economists today expect this device to be extended by a few months.
"I can't imagine that she's significantly changing her program."
"If not, it would take the risk of creating new tensions in the short term," says Michael Schubert, economist at Commerzbank.
"A gradual release announced in the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely," says Sal's economist Norbert Bräms.
Oppenheim.
In terms of its interventions in the public debt market, "the ECB should maintain a purchase volume of these bonds in order to animate an atoning market", adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the importance of European banks' exposures to sovereign debt markets in the euro area, the issuing institution has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It is necessary at all costs to replace the lack of investors in the market and to act in such a way as to prevent an embalming of the returns paid by the most fragile states," testified an important bond manager yesterday.
Because if interest rates fly, the states will be all the more embarrassed to reduce their debt, if not stabilize it.
The safeguarding of the euro is at this price.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government is turning its back
After a worrying start of the week for Italy, the situation relaxed somewhat yesterday, with the flow of bond rates at 10 years.
A return to precarious calm.
After a meeting with the Minister of Economy, the regional presidents said that they had heard Giulio Tremonti describe the situation as "indecipherable" and expect a "unpredictable" weekend, which he then denied.
On Tuesday in any case, the difference with the German long rates had reached the record of 210 basis points and the price of cover contracts against the risk of bankruptcy (CDS) had flown at 263 points, causing a certain crowding in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi pointed out that in Spain the difference with German rates was more than 400 basis points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, declared himself "very concerned" with "market turbulence" and possible contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy in the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that it is like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly, its problem is the lack of growth and the atony of tax revenues that goes with it, making the state run the risk of no longer being able to cover its financing needs.
Brussels' latest forecast was a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is now expected at 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget under review in the Senate is set at 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, the European Commission calculates, the public deficit will still represent 4.3% of GDP next year (compared to 3.9% planned by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the rumour of a new budgetary collective that could be set up after the holidays, for an amount of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, new austerity measures will have to be taken," says Economic Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn.
For the time being, Italy receives the support of international institutions.
"The fundamentals of his economy are in order and his accounts are good, we have been repeating it for a long time," says Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator at the International Monetary Fund in charge of Italy at the IMF.
"There is no immediate problem, either in the short or in the long term, because despite its large debt (119.2 per cent of GDP in 2011, NDLR), the stabilization efforts requested from Italy are lower than those requested from other countries," observes Pier Carlo Padoan, OECD Chief Economist.
The question of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure in the Chamber of Deputies, following which early elections could be held at the end of March.
A period would then open up which would not be conducive to decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans reflect on the strengthening of anti-crisis mechanisms
Christine Lagarde again hammered him yesterday at a press conference in Paris: "The Europeans, I believe that we have demonstrated it again Sunday in the day and in the night, are obviously united, determined, committed to defending their currency and their currency zone."
Although all relative, the relaxation recorded yesterday on the rates of European state bonds brought water to the mill of governments and the ECB.
But we can't talk about a start to normalization yet.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's announced that it could degrade Portugal's debt score, the most targeted target today by speculation.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political visibility, which weighs particularly on banking systems," says economists from Exane BNP Paribas.
All the more so because "political time is much slower than market time".
Aware of this hiatus and its dangers, European countries are intensifying discussions to strengthen existing anti-crisis mechanisms.
Informal consultations between the finance ministers most directly concerned and, more broadly, with their G20 peers are on track.
This is also in view of the Eurogroup and Ecofin meetings at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
On the menu, the fate of the non-conventional measures supporting the euro area countries in the market collimator (see above).
As for the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, started a tour of Asia in Singapore on Tuesday to inform the Far East investors of the developments of the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, it certainly prepares the ground for them.
The first issues of the EFSF are expected next month.
Yesterday, a U.S. official told Reuters that the U.S. would support a possible increase in funds mobilized by an additional direct commitment from the IMF.
The countries on the front line, Portugal and Spain, for their part, are preparing to adopt structural reforms, particularly in the field of labour market organisation.
Reforms in addition to austerity measures with closer effect.
Lisbon and Madrid want to take a different path from that of Greece and Ireland.
Both are keen to avoid seeking international assistance before setting up their own budgetary corrections and deciding on structural reforms that are essential to restoring lasting confidence.
Finally, European donors are discussing the options available to speed up the process of standardising sovereign bond markets.
In Paris on 24 November, Axel Weber first proposed the idea that if the EUR 750 billion mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to hand over its hand to the portfolio.
The economists of Barclays Capital, a leading player in the European sovereign debt market, believe that an extension of around EUR 100 billion would suffice, "preferably" in the form of direct liquidity injection.
The vehicle exists: it is the European Financial Stabilization Mechanism, which has so far received €60 billion.
A council that has every chance of being examined carefully in the European capitals.
Especially if market conditions worsened.
Snow and ice: 24 departments in orange vigilance
Snow episodes still cause traffic difficulties, particularly on the secondary network in Brittany, and may disturb certain economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in orange vigilance due to the risk of snow and ice.
The Eure, the Eure-et-Loir, the Deux-Sèvres and the Vienne, have joined the 20 departments already in orange vigilance, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, later in the night.
According to Weather France, sustained snow showers affect the north of the Gironde and the Charentes and it snows weakly on the Ile-de-France.
Snow layers ranging from 2 to 5 cm, occasionally from 7 to 10 cm, are expected for the departments concerned, and from 1 to 3 cm, or up to 5 cm for the Paris region.
The departments concerned are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions of Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
Snow episodes are remarkable enough to cause traffic difficulties and disrupt certain economic activities, warns Weather France.
In the Côtes d'Armor, several departments were banned from heavy goods vehicles of more than 7.5 tons, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axes.
Traffic on the secondary network in Brittany is very difficult according to gendarmes who recommend taking their vehicle only in case of necessity and the circulation of certain TER cars has been suspended for the day.
School transportation was banned for Thursday in Picardie.
No specific measures were envisaged on Wednesday evening to restrict the movement of heavy goods vehicles.
The prefecture "invites all motorists to the utmost caution on the roads and to adapt their driving accordingly".
The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGAC) has asked airlines to cancel Thursday 25% of their flights at the Paris airport of Roissy and 10% in Orly due to the coming snowfalls.
DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their company.
In Britain, Gatwick Airport, south of London, and Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate on the modernisation of transport in Ile-de-France has been full, the billions have been raining.
In the discussion at least.
In particular, we mention 23 billion for the Grand Paris metro that the Société du Grand Paris has to build.
To start this GSP, the state announced a capital allocation of €4 billion.
In the theoretical scheme, it is this sum that will then allow the GSP to borrow part of the financing of its double loop on the markets.
Today, we finally get to the first additions.
The 2010 Amending Finance Act, discussed in the National Assembly's Finance Committee this morning, contains the arrangements for finding the beginning of this money.
They are two: the creation of a special equipment tax and an increase in the tax on offices in Ile-de-France.
The first, read in the text of the bill, section 15, is "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
It is calculated as follows: "The proceeds of this tax are EUR 117 million per year".
The second is a realignment of a tax on offices that already exists "in order to modernize it, increase its product and allocate this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that bring?
Mystery.
It's not encrypted in the text.
We're a long way from $4 billion.
"It is specified that these tax resources are added to the 4 billion euros of the capital endowment that will be mobilized by the state and brought to the Société du Grand Paris as the project progresses", can be read in the explanatory statement.
At the GSP, we don't find this system shocking.
"From the moment you create recipes (the two taxes, ndlr), you can cover the studies over three years and then type in the 4 billion after, one explains."
"It will be included in the budget and drawn as it progresses."
The GSP estimates that the $4 billion will begin to be recorded in 2013 for Budget 2014.
This arrangement, in which the promised 4 billion are still missing subscribers, risks causing a somewhat turbulent parliamentary debate.
First public meeting on 7 December.
Avenger hackers and spies in diligence
The WikiLeaks case has a double value.
On the one hand, it turns out to be an apparent scandal, a scandal that appears as a scandal only in the face of hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at the international level, and foreshadows a future dominated by regression.
But let's proceed in order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation that each file made up of a secret service (of any nation) consists exclusively of press clippings.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about Berlusconi's sexual habits only bring back what could have been read in any newspaper for months (except those owned by Berlusconi), and Khadafi's sinister caricature profile had long been for the artists of sketch material cabaret.
The rule that secret files should only be made up of news already known is essential to the dynamics of secret services, and not only in this century.
If you go to a bookstore dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that every book repeats (on the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templars or the Rose-Croix) exactly what was already written in previous books.
And this is not only because the author of occult texts does not like to do unpublished research (or know where to look for news about the incessant), but because those who dedicate themselves to occultism believe only in what they already know, and which reconfirms what they have already learned.
It's the mechanism of Dan Brown's success.
Same for secret files.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or of limited mind) the head of the secret services (if not he could be, what do I know, editor at Liberation), who retain as true only what he recognizes.
The top secret information about Berlusconi that the American Embassy of Rome sent to the State Department was the same as Newsweek published the previous week.
So why did the revelations on these files make so much noise?
On the one hand, they say what any cultured person already knows, namely that the embassies, at least since the end of the Second World War, and since the heads of state can call themselves or take a plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small exercises of representation, have become centres of espionage.
Any viewer of investigative films knows that very well, and it is only through hypocrisy that one pretends to ignore it.
However, repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy, and serves to place American diplomacy in a bad light.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can capture the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world is a significant blow to the prestige of the State Department.
So the scandal does not put both the victims and the "bulls" in crisis.
But let's come to the deep nature of what happened.
Once, in Orwell's time, we could conceive of all power as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
The Orwellian prophecy had been completely proven since, being able to control every movement through the telephone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the highway borrowed and so on, the citizen became the total victim of the eye of power.
But when it is shown, as it happens now, that even the crypts of the secrets of power cannot escape the control of a hacker, the control report ceases to be unidirectional and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - elected as the avenger of the citizen - can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that no longer has the opportunity to keep its own secrets hold?
It is true, Georg Simmel already said, that a true secret is an empty secret (and empty secret can never be revealed); it is true, too, that knowing about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is indeed an empty secret, because it is in the public domain; but revealing, as WikiLeaks did, that Hillary Clinton's secrets were empty secrets means removing all power from him.
WikiLeaks did no harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but made it too great for Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound inflicted on a very powerful power?
It is obvious that in the future, states will no longer be able to put on-line any reserved information - this would mean publishing it on a poster glued to the corner of the street.
But it is just as obvious that with current technologies, it is hopeless to be able to maintain confidential reports by telephone.
Nothing easier than finding out if and when a head of state flew by plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How can private and reserved relationships be maintained in the future?
I know that, for the moment, my prediction is science fiction and is therefore romantic, but I am obliged to imagine agents of the government who move discreetly in due diligence to uncontrollable routes, carrying only messages learned by heart or, at most, hiding the rare information written in the heel of a shoe.
The information will be kept as a single copy in locked drawers: in the background, the attempt to spy on the Watergate was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is now moving forward in crabs, that is, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet restored a wired telegraph (telephone).
Videocassettes (analogs) had allowed cinema researchers to explore a film step by step, going forward and back and discovering all the secrets of editing, while now CDs (digital) only allow to jump from chapter to chapter, i.e. by macroportions.
With high-speed trains, we go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while by plane, and the trips it includes, it takes three and a half hours.
It is not extraordinary, therefore, that communication policy and techniques should return to horse-drawn cars.
One last observation.
In the past, the press tried to understand what was going on in the secret of the embassies.
It is now the embassies that ask for confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France stifles its financing promises
One year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to examine the fulfilment of the promises of rapidly released financing (such fast start or early financing) made by developed countries.
And the big French trinkets are revealed.
In the Copenhagen agreement, developed countries committed to providing $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has pledged €7.2 billion over three years and France €1.26 billion (i.e. €420 million per year).
At the opening of COP16, the EU came out with the big game to persuade its partners of the reality of its commitment to fast start financing: a report detailing the action of its member states, press conference, big side event, distribution of brochures...
The transparency exercise was appreciable and appreciated at its fair value: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same with the same level of precision.
In 2010, the EU announced €2.2 billion, putting it on the right track to meet its commitment of €7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look at it in detail, things are more complicated.
This money must, according to the Copenhagen agreement, be "new and additional", in order to ensure that an additional effort is made without being at the expense of official development assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission had proposed harmonisation, some Member States whose France blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that suits him best.
For example, the European Commission has considered 2009 as a reference year: international funding is maintained and adds 150 million over three years for fast start financing.
Other countries have chosen similar references in terms of year or level of official development assistance.
In contrast, France believes that the financing of "all new projects" for 2010 is "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to expenditure in previous years or to the overall level of official development assistance.
In concrete terms, France's total support to developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease), it claims to respect its commitment to "new and additional" financing...
Another crucial element is the distribution between donations and loans.
Again, there is no rule and each chooses its method of calculation.
Some, like France, consider that 1€ loaned is equivalent to 1€ given.
Of course, this is hardly justifiable: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often projects related to the mitigation of emissions that rely on more efficient technologies), it is misleading to present a euro that will be recovered as equivalent to a euro that is given... At most, it should be counted under its commitments only the cost of the loan to the lending country (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has nothing to do with such reasoning: it "respects" its commitment of €420 million by making 91.5% of loans (€388.8 million) and 8.5% of donations (€36.1 million) - see the EU document to check for yourself.
It is the only country in the Union to use the loan so massively.
Germany requires 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (in others) meet their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union spends €1 to meet its commitment, France spends only 10 cents and considers the effort to be comparable.
Nice pass round!
In short, in its fast start financing, France operates a double scam: on the one hand on the evolution of action over time and on the other on the reality of the financial effort.
By spending only €36.1 million, she can make it appear that she spends 420 million "new and additional" in line with her promises.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that it is Bercy that has carried out the arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why would the other Member States continue to give if it is enough to lend?) and in the negotiations since the developing countries are not completely fooled...
The chapter on early financing is only a small, relatively short-term issue in relation to all climate discussions.
But it could be one more grain of sand in the huge machine that the UNFCCC is.
Let us hope that will not be the case.
In any case, it is essential to learn the lessons of this first year of early funding.
First of all, France could announce a change in its method of accounting for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its commitments and fairness with the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France could advance discussions on long-term financing issues (another crucial chapter currently discussed): there will be no escape from the question of "additionality" or the method of accounting for loans.
France could change its position to become as progressive on these issues as it is on others.
Hope therefore rests on the new Minister of the Environment, Ms Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement about France's fast start and its vision of "additionality" and the use of loans would increase the level of international confidence needed to advance the discussions.
Alert to pesticides ingested by children
A 10-year-old ingests 81 different chemicals in one day, according to a study published this Wednesday by the Generations Futures association (former Movement for Rights and Respect for Future Generations).
The association, which warns that its results "have no significant statistical value in relation to the small number of samples analyzed, but are illustrative of the problem addressed", bought between July and September the foods generally consumed in four meals and one snack in one day by a ten-year-old child, in the supermarkets of Oise and Paris.
These standard meals, including official recommendations - five fresh fruits and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water per day - as well as sweets, were examined by laboratories looking for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The balance of the plate is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, 42 of which are classified as possible or probable carcinogens and five substances classified as certain carcinogens as well as 37 substances that may act as endocrine disruptors (EPs), according to studies from several institutions such as the International Centre for Research on Cancer.
"Even if, in almost all cases, the legal limits for each individual chemical are not exceeded, it is clear from our investigation that the reality of consumer exposure to potentially carcinogenic contaminants and/or PE is of concern," notes the association.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible carcinogen residues and three proven as some carcinogens as well as nearly twenty residues likely to disturb the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, predicted as an encas by the study, has traces of six chemicals, including a fungicide that is banned in France.
The same applies to Kenyan green beans, included in lunch, on which the study detected traces of a powerful insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, chopped steak, canned tuna, and even bread baguette and gum were stuffed with pesticides and other chemicals.
Nitrate and chloroform were found in tap water.
For dinner, salmon steak was the most "rich" with 34 chemical residues detected and even examination of the plastic plate used to heat the meal in the microwave was not exempt.
The final risk to the consumer of this "contaminant cocktail" is probably underestimated, according to the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecologie-Les Verts (EE-LV), for its part, proposed "in the face of the urgency of the situation" to establish a moratorium on the use of pesticides, in order to stop "the increase in diseases of civilization".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) reported the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
