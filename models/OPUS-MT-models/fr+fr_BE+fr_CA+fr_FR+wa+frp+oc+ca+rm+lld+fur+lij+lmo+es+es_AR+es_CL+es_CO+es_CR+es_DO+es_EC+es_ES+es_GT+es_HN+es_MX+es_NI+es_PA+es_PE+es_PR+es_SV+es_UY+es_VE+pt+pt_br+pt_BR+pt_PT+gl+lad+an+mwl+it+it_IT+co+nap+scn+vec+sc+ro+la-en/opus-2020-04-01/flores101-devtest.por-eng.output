The American gymnastics team supports the letter of the United States Olympic Committee and agrees with the absolute need for the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the USOC's statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs, and their sports, can be better served by moving forward with significant changes within our organization, rather than decertification.

This not only confirms that at least some of the dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already well accepted, but also offers details that are not found so often in fossils, such as colors and the three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists claim that the upper plumage of this animal was brown and the lower part was clear or carotenoid.
The discovery also gives clues about the evolution of feathers in birds.
The feathers of dinosaurs, known as raccus, do not have a well developed stem, but have other characteristics, such as farpas and barbulas. In view of this, the researchers concluded that the raccus was possibly the result of an evolutionary development subsequent to these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight, but rather to display or regulate the temperature. Researchers suggested that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample has the plumage of an adult, and not that of a cub.
The researchers suggested that, despite the ass being from a young dinosaur, the sample reveals an adult plumage, not a penuge.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made by the sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team sought would be caused by the tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts an attraction on Earth, causing the tides, the Milky Way exerts a force over the galaxy of Sagittarius.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
This theory states that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located around a galaxy in a kind of halo and is composed of several tiny particles.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and deposit a pre-print sheet indicating the candidate of their choice in an envelope.
After the officers verify the identity of the voter, the voter inserts the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting list.
French electoral law codifies procedures in a very strict manner.
Since 1988, voting ballots must be transparent so that voters and observers can testify that no envelope is present at the beginning of the vote and that no envelope is added, except those of the duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to observe all parts of the process. During the night, votes are counted by volunteers under careful supervision, following specific procedures.

His other race, the Giant Slalom, got the tenth position in the group of seated women with a combined result of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 slower than the first placed Australian Claudia Loesch and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth placed Gyöngyi Dani of Hungary.
Four women's skiers failed to finish their races, and 45 of the 117 skiers in the Giant Slalom failed to qualify for the race.
Madhya Pradesh police recovered the laptop and cell phone stolen.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said, "We'll take five people who raped Switzerland and get their cell phone and laptop back."
The accused were named Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
The defendant appeared in court with his face covered, declared police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki.
Although three people were inside the house when she was hit by the car, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered severe head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while the emergency services released the driver of the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Later, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has been in the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court ever since, charged with the murder of her son.
She is in custody while awaiting indictment and trial, but any evidence of an eyewitness may be compromised because her image has been widely disclosed.
This is a common practice in other parts of the UK, but Scotland's justice acts in a distinct way, and courts consider the publication of photos to be potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee University notes that "journalists seem to go in a dangerous direction when they publish photos, videos, etc. of suspects."
The Crown Office, which is in general charge of the proceedings, has indicated to journalists that no further comments will be made, at least until the indictment.
The document, according to the leak, will refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants based on the borders before the Six-Day War in 1967.
Other matters covered include the future state of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel requires a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years as soon as an agreement is signed, while the PA agrees to leave that presence for only five years.
The shooters in the additional pest control test were under close supervision of forest engineers while the test was monitored and its effectiveness was evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited, according to the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, NPWS's Interim Director of Conservation and Park Heritage, the four shooters selected for the first hunting operation received comprehensive safety and training instructions.
Yesterday, Martelly promised a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) of nine members.
It's Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential committee recommended the previous resignation of the CEP as part of a package of measures to advance the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the general protests organized against the regime. The demonstrations began in October.
Occasionally violent protests were triggered by the failure of elections, some planned since 2011.
About 60 cases of iPods with overheating problems were reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with light burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (METI) said it was aware of 27 device-related accidents.
Last week, METI reported that Apple had informed him of another 34 incidents of overheating, which the company classified as "non-serious".
The ministry responded by calling the postponement of Apple's report "truly regrettable."
The earthquake hit Mariana at 07h19min, local time. At GMT time, it was on Friday at 21h19min.
The emergency management office of the Northern Mariana said there was no reported damage in the country.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Alert Center said there was no indication of tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman kidnapped a tourist bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, and held them hostage in Hong Kong.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed as dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released earlier, as well as Filipino photographers.
Then the photographers later took the place of an old lady who had to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot down.
Liggins followed his father's footsteps and entered a medical career.
He was educated as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
Although he was working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating premature births in his spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone were administered, it would accelerate the foetal lung maturation of the baby.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two "black boxes", flight data recorders, on Wednesday.
Other fighters also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first Queen of the Extreme. My first entrepreneur. Luna died on a night with two moons. Something exceptional, just like her. Strong woman".
Dustin Goldust Runnels said, "Luna was as crazy as I... or maybe even more... I loved her and I'll miss her... I'll take her to a better place."
Among the 1,400 people interviewed before the 2010 federal elections, the percentage of those opposed to change in Australia, to become a republic, has grown 8% since 2008.
Prime Minister-in-Office Julia Gillard said during the 2010 campaign for the national election that she believed Australia would become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those who participated in the research share this vision, wishing Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
At the end of the survey, 29% of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as quickly as possible, while 31% believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim in the 100 and 200 meters free and in three turns at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his physical condition was questioned.
He did not manage to take the necessary medicines to overcome the pain, since these are prohibited at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the Central University of Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number until January 25th.
Several people proved the discovery using different types of hardware and software, in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water distribution to the earth along with organic matter that can develop proteins and make life possible.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, since comets have collide with Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his government earlier this year and signed a law in the last month legalizing marriage between people of the same sex.
He referred to rumors as "politicism and nonsense"
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that FAA says would let aircraft fly on shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon production.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to the older ground radar-based technology to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide more accurate information to pilots.
There will be no extra transport and surface trains will not stop at Wembley. Parking and public transport connections will not be available.
The problem of lack of transport increased the possibility of the game having to be performed at closed doors, without the presence of the cheerleader.
On Thursday, Science magazine published a study reporting the discovery of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands, Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University, USA, and Uppsala University, Sweden, reported that the new species evolved in only two generations, although it was believed that this process would take much longer, due to reproduction between an endemic Darwin, Geospiza forts, and the immigrant cactus fort, Geospiza conirostris.
The gold can be worked in any form. It can even be rolled in small formats.
It is possible to stretch to form a thin thread, which can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or wrapped in leaves.
It can be very thin and glued to another metal. Because it is so thin, it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted paintings in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called chemical PH. You can make a marker using purple cabbage juice.
The cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H at pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that had their electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two powders and, with clean hands, mold them into the shape of a ball.
The moisture of the hands reacts with the outer layers, which causes a strange sensation and forms a type of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had a sanitary seat with discharge in almost all houses, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remaining parts of sewage systems were found in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece.
There were also toilets in Ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public toilets, frequented by both men and women.
When you call someone who's thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then redirects it back, almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts part of our light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket over 30 meters high to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel changed the world in amazing ways. The biggest thing the wheel did for us was give us a much easier and faster transport.
He gave us the train, the car and various other forms of transport.
Below them are medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including loose pet cats) who eat small, much more numerous animals, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The revelation to their success is the concept of niche, a special function that each cat makes them prevent them from competing with each other.
Lions are the most social felines, living in large groups called alcateas.
The flocks consist of one to three adult males of the same family, along with up to 30 females and cubs.
Women tend to be intimately related to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion packs act in a similar way to groups of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other large cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
A well-balanced athlete, the tiger can climb (although not well), swim, jump great distances and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is in the same group (Genero Panthera) as lions, leopards and ounces. These four cats are the only ones who can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not like the roar to every voice of a lion, but more like a phrase of shouted and snoring words.
The jaguars like to eat small animals. They capture monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they succeed. Almost all the animals that the jaguar hunts are much smaller than her.
Scientists believe that the jaguars follow and find their prey by smell, sniffing where they have been by the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision and can also move stealthily. The jaguars hunt their preys mixing with the environment surrounding them and then attack their preys.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) separates from the main population where they came from (for example, they transpose a mountain chain or a river, or they go to an island from which it is not possible to return easily), they often see themselves in an environment different from that in which they lived before.
This new environment has different resources and new competitors, so the new population will need to acquire different characteristics than it already has and adapt to become a strong competitor.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it is becoming less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process of speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe and absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e., they expire)
Plants use the sun as their food through photosynthesis. They also offer shade.
We build our houses using plants and make our clothes using plants. Most of the food we consume is plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
The Mosassaur was the alpha predator of his era, so the only thing he feared were other Mosassaurs.
His long jaws were nailed with more than 70 sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the sky of his mouth, which shows that nothing that crossed his path could escape.
We're not sure, but you may have had a forked tongue. Your diet included turtles, large fish, other moosasauruses and it might even have been a cannibal.
He also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T-Rex would not be a match for him.
Although most of their food was familiar to us, the Romans still had their share of strange or unusual foods, such as boars, peacocks, snails and a type of rodent called arganaz
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate sitting in chairs, rich men liked to have banquets together where they lay aside while making their meals.
Food in ancient Rome did not include supplies from America and Asia to Europe, as it did in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman has ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians made a primary temple for each of their gods, who were considered the home of their respective gods.
People took sacrifices to the gods, and priests sought to meet the needs of these gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary where only priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramids shaped like towers, called zigurates, were built to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the Hebrew family life was in the open air.
The women were cooking in the courtyard, the shops were only open counters facing the street. Stones were used in the construction of houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so the wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland had its colonization in a scattered way. In the Nordic saga, they say that Erik, the Red, was exiled from Iceland for murder and, as he traveled west, found Greenland and gave it that name.
But regardless of their discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.
Although all countries were "scandinavian", there were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie The Legend of Lost Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was drawn at the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words "Declaration of Original Independence, dated 4 July 1776". The text appears in the bottom corner of the document, head to head.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that, at the beginning of its existence, the great scroll document (he measures 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up to be stored.
Thus, it is likely that a note was simply added as a label.
The landings and subsequent battles on D-Day liberated northern France, but the south was not yet free.
It was ruled by the French "Vichy". They were French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragon".
In just two weeks, the American and Free France forces had liberated southern France and were turning towards Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a large significant group of people who live and work cooperatively, a society.
The word civilization comes from Latin civilis, which means civil, related to civil Latin, which means citizen, and civics, which means city or city-state, and which also, in some way, defines the size of society.
The cities-state are the pioneers of the nations. The culture of civilization follows the transfer of knowledge for different generations, a lasting cultural reach and a fair dissemination.
Minor cultures often disappear without adequate historical evidence and are no longer recognized as civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government — the Congress being its only component — according to the Articles of the Confederation.
Congress lacked power to demand tribute, and because there was no national executive or judiciary, it trusted the state authorities, which generally did not cooperate, to enforce all its laws.
Moreover, there was no authority to repeal tax laws and tariffs between states.
The Articles needed unanimous consent among all states before they could be amended and the states gave so little importance to the central government that their representatives were almost never present.
Italy's football team, along with the German team, is the second most successful player in the world and was FIFA World Cup champion in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rúgbi, cycling, ice hockey, skate hockey and F1 races.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has about 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to Japan's cluster/group of islands, Japan is often referred to in a geographical position as an "archipelago"
The foundation of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when Europeans who sailed the region baptized the place as Formosa Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company opened a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation in Aboriginal grain production practices and employing Chinese to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it yielded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the boundaries of the complex were rebuilt to offer tourists a better idea of what they were like originally.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was recovered, and this recovery continues to this day.
As an example, the most common form of static image photography on the planet is that of 35 mm, which was the size of film that most had in circulation at the end of the analog film era.
Currently it is still produced, but the most important is that its proportion was inherited by digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format is, in fact, confusingly, 36mm wide by 24mm high.
The proportion of screen of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the lowest ratio between integers) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS family of formats, for example) are equal or very close to that proportion.
The rather abused and often demoralized third - party law is a fairly simple guideline that provides a dynamic while maintaining a relative order in a figure.
According to him, the intersection of lines that divide the image into vertical and horizontal thirds (see example) is the most effective place for the main subject.
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, went through scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion united the European states, despite differences in language and customs.
All were affected by their influence force, from the king to the commoner.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's monetary funds are there specifically for that reason.
The central leadership of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this principle was being fulfilled.
Right after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade on Germany.
The strategy proved effective, with the cutting of vital supplies of military and civilian, although this blockade has violated international regulations generally accepted and arranged in several international agreements in the last two centuries.
Britain has mined international waters to prevent any ship from entering entire areas of the ocean, bringing danger even to ships with a neutral flag.
Germany, since there was limited response to this tactic, expected an attack similar to its unrestricted underwater war.
During the 1920s, the predominant attitudes of the majority of citizens and nations were those of pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, the nations wished to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1884 Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States without a penny, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (the head of his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of demonstrating different times; each stage of China or every family in power was a distinct dynasty.
Moreover, between each dynasty there was an unstable era of divided provinces. The best known of these periods was the time of the Three Kingdoms, which took place for 60 years between the Han and Jin Dynasties.
During these periods, a fierce war took place among many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of ancient China, thousands of people died fighting to sit on the throne of the great palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, a change from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
In addition, after the Revolution, vacancies were opened to all male candidates, enabling the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same applies to the military, since instead of patents based on the social class, they were now based on character.
The French Revolution also inspired many other repressed people of the working class from other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond worldly life. He used to frequent a cave that became known as "Hira '" in the mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
the cave itself, which survived the times, gives a very vivid image of Muhammad's religious inclinations.
Resting at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find it, even if it's known to exist, once inside the cave, it's a complete isolation.
It is not possible to see anything beyond the clear blue sky above and the mountains around. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from within the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only of the seven wonders of the world that still exists today.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century B.C., the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built to honor dead Pharaohs.
The Gizé Plateau, or the "Necropolis of Gizé", in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, has several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples and the Great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the pyramids, tombs and smaller temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and relatives.
The mark of the "arc pointing up" has its appearance similar to a V, and the "arc pointing down" has its appearance similar to a staple or a square without the bottom side.
Top means you should start at the tip and push the bow; bottom means you should start at the heel (which is where you hold the bow) and pull the bow.
In general a bow up produces a softer sound, while a bow down produces a stronger and assertive sound.
You can write your own notes, but don't forget that printed arc notes exist for a musical reason, so these should be respected.
On October 6, 1789, the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Mary Antonieta, her two young sons (Maria Teresa, eleven years old, and Louis Charles, four years old) and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced to return to Paris, leaving Versailles, by a crowd of women from the markets.
In a carriage, they traveled back to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people screaming and shouting threats against the king and queen.
The crowd of people forced the King and Queen to keep the windows of their carriage wide open.
At one point, a protestor waved with the head of a dead royal guard in Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The war expenses of U.S. imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Philippine people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to pay a large part of the expenses and interest on floating-rate securities on behalf of the Philippine government through the Wall Street banking houses.
It is clear that the excesses resulting from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the basic gains of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that led to the creation of order.
The time when such events took place is commonly called the High Middle Ages, a period of European history between the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages was preceded by the Lower Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which, by convention, ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a series of ideas in practice, from the supply of technology or from the technological imperative to a strict notion that human destiny is determined by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share 2 general ideas: the first is that technological development itself follows a path that goes beyond cultural or political influence; the second is the idea that technology, in turn, has "effects" in societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, someone can say that the car necessarily results in the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for just a few cars, so new production methods are developed to reduce the cost of having a car.
The possession of mass cars leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new techniques in the health system to cure injured bodies.
Romanticism had a great element of cultural determinism, extracted from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
Geography, in the context of Romanticism, caused citizens to be molded and, over time, the customs and culture linked to this geography, which, being in harmony with the place of society, became better than the laws eventually binding.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a luxury epicenter began around 400 A.D. and lasted until about 1100 A.D.
Its status declined during the 12th century mainly due to the fact that the participants of the Crusade had returned bringing presents like silks and spices, which were worth more than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at that time that the title of Capital of Fashion from Constantinople was transferred to Paris.
Gothic language reached its peak in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and also in the 14th century.
At first, the garments were heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the eastern region.
However, due to slow communication channels, styles in the west can stay behind for 25 to 30 years.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began the development of its own style. One of the greatest advances to the time was that, as a result of the crusades, people began to use buttons to close their clothes.
Subsistence farming is agriculture carried out for the production of sufficient food to meet only the needs of farmers and their families.
Subsistence farming is a simple, generally organic system that uses native ecorrigean preserved seeds, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize production.
Historically, most farmers have been involved in subsistence farming, and this is still the case in most developing nations.
Subcultures bring together individuals of similar mentality who feel neglected by the patterns of society and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinct due to age, ethnicity, class, location and/or sex of members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signify their affiliation by means of a distinct and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, mannerisms and jargons.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to resort to the few unfortunate cases of children who were, through negligence, misfortune, or intentional abuse, unsocialized by adults while growing up.
These children are called "feroze" or wild. Some of these children were confined by people (usually by their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of this child occurred to the rejection of the child by the parents because of their severe intellectual or physical disability.
Children who are revolted may have suffered serious trauma or abuse in childhood before being abandoned or fleeing the home.
Others are supposed to have been raised by animals; they say that some have lived on their own in the jungle.
When completely reared by animals, the wild child exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely similar to those of the pet, such as fear or indifference to humans.
Although project-based learning makes learning easier and interesting, the scaffolding method goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but a help for students who are going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer or starting a new project.
The scaffolds can be virtual or face-to-face, in other words, a teacher can be considered a scaffold, just like that little Microsoft Office talking clip.
Virtual scaffolding is internalized in the software with the aim of questioning, alerting and explaining procedures that can be challenging for the student to deal with alone.
Children are placed in foster homes for a multitude of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment that does not nourish, care for and educate, but that happens.
We see the Family Reception System as a safety zone for these children.
Our adoption platform has the duty to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, regular education and guaranteed medical care.
It is assumed that the adoptive care meets all the needs that were lacking in the home from which they were taken.
The internet combines interpersonal and mass communication elements.
The distinct features of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approach to uses and rewards.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are indicated as important motivations for the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "continuing relationships" were also identified as new motivational features by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied public reactions to web pages.
The use of video recording led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one person can detect whether another person is lying through the correct interpretation of micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, indicated how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are, however, able to assess sincerity accurately.
He even suggests that such human behavior interpretation skills can be shared by animals as domestic dogs.
20th century research concluded that there are two ways of genetic variation: secret and manifest.
The mutation adds a new genetic variation and the selection removes it from the expressed variation grouping.
Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two bases with each generation.
In savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans, consuming the available plant resources, to satisfy their amino acid requirements.
Moreover, failure to act in agreement has serious consequences: severe depression, malnutrition and, ultimately, death.
The resources of plant origin with greater accessibility would be proteins in leaves and legumes, but they are difficult for us primates to digest, unless cooked.
However, foods of animal origin (formigas, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide proteins in large quantities that contain all essential amino acids.
Taking all this into account, it would not be surprising if our own ancestors have solved their "protein problems" more or less as the chimpanzees of the current savannah do.
Sleep interruption is a process of deliberately waking up during the normal period of sleep and falling asleep immediately afterwards (10–60 minutes).
This can easily be done using a half-quiet alarm clock to bring him to consciousness without waking him up for good.
If you see yourself redefining the clock while you sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you out of bed to turn it off
Other possibilities based on the biorhythm include drinking plenty of liquid (especially water or tea, a diuretic) before sleeping, as it forces the person to get up to urinate.
A person's level of inner peace correlates in an opposite way to his level of bodily and spiritual tension.
The lower the tension, the more positive is the present life force. Everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can reach enlightenment. The only thing that hinders this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on Buddha's teachings, but they were expanded by the way of Mahayana's love and by many Indian Yoga techniques.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the way of comprehensive love.
With the Kundalini Yoga, the kundalini energy (illuminating energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The central part of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are clean, the chakras are activated and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common villain in the Second World War, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the US. With the end of the war, system shocks, processes and cultures led to the disintegration of countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies, and the Cold War began.
The goal was to last for the next 40 years and, in fact, there would be leadership of replacement troops in the battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already destroyed and the only way out was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian bridge head.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Agression Pact, and other international, bilateral and multilateral treaties.
The use of ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move people and goods on a large scale through the oceans.
The work of the Navy has traditionally been to ensure that its country maintains the ability to move people and goods while, at the same time, interfering in the ability of its enemies to move their own people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the Battle of the North Atlantic of World War II. Americans were trying to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the organisation of the German Navy, mainly using U-boats, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have the capacity to conquer Britain as it did with the rest of Europe.
It seems that the goats had their domestication for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
The ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them in order to facilitate access to milk, hair, meat and skins.
The domestic goats were usually kept in herds that walked in the hills or other grazing areas, often cared for by shepherds who were usually children or adolescents, similar to the best known shepherd. These grazing methods are still used today.
The wagonways were built in England from the 16th century.
Although the wagons consisted only of parallel wooden boards, this allowed the horses to pull them to reach higher speeds and carry larger loads on the roads a little more rough.
Sleeps were implemented right at the beginning, to keep the tracks in place. Gradually, however, it was realized that the tracks would be more efficient if they had a metal cover at the top.
This became a common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first fully iron rails were introduced.
The first known means of transportation was walking. Humans began to walk upright two million years ago, with the emergence of Homo Erectus (which means "man erect").
His predecessor, the Australopithec, was not standing upright as usual.
Bipedality adaptations are found in the fossils of Australopithecus dating from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago. However, the Sahelanthropus may have been standing, with both legs, long before, seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more friendly way with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to reduce future suffering to some degree.
This is exactly like symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we do not want to have only a temporary solution, we must find the origin of the problems and end them.
It is obvious enough that the world has changed greatly because of the scientific and technological advances of the human race, and problems have become greater because of man's overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle.
After the adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten sketch, signed by Congress President John Hancock, and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to a few blocks away for a John Dunlap graphic.
During the night, around 150 to 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap attacks".
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon, in the courtyard of the Independence Hall on July 8.
On 6 July, one was sent to George Washington, who read it to his troops in New York on 9 July. A copy arrived in London on 10 August.
The 25 Dunlap attacks that still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original hand-made copy did not survive.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and is alive until today. We call them birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are still many similarities between birds and dinosaurs.
They have legs with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on their two back legs, like a T-rex.
Almost all computers currently used are based on manipulation of information that is encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, that is, 0 or 1, and these numbers are classified as binary digits - or bits, using the language used in computing.
Inner poisoning may not be apparent immediately. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are so general that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The greatest indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container with medication or toxic chemicals for domestic use.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions related to that particular poison.
The term "insects" is used by entomologists in a formal sense to treat this group of insects.
This term derives from the ancient familiarity with pervejos, which are insects structured enough to stick to humans.
Both barbers and bedbugs are nestlings, adapted to live in nests or shelters of their hosts.
In the United States of America, there are about 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the main neurological disease in young people and adults
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is composed of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to have multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple can decide that raising a baby is not in their interest, or that of their child.
Such couples have the permission to decide to make a plan to adopt the baby.
In an adoption, biological parents rescind their parental rights so that another couple can take care of the child.
The main objective of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. It is this method that guides scientific research.
It is not, in fact, just experimentation; an experiment is a test used to eliminate one of the possible hypotheses or more, to ask questions. Making observations also guides a scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Latin Bible.
All scientific thoughts of Aristotle were accepted, including psychology.
As the knowledge of Greek receded, the West was far removed from its philosophical and scientific roots.
Several rhythms observed in physiology and behavior usually depend primarily on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not absolutely responses to external periodic stimuli, have been observed for most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological watches are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to function for a continuous cycle period, even without interference from the environment.
Hershey and Chase's experiment was one of the main indicators that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase use pheasants, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into the bacteria.
They did two experiments that marked either the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations may have a variety of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected piece of genetic material and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be transmitted to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Natural tourism attracts people interested in visiting nature areas with the aim of enjoying the landscape, including fauna and flora.
Examples of local activities include fishing, taking pictures, seeing birds, visiting parks and studying about the ecosystem.
One example is to visit, photograph and learn about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, by car, people leave the small towns of the interior, to go to work in other cities, and meet other people who work precisely in these small cities from where they came from.
In this dynamic transport bus, everyone is somehow connected and supporting a transportation system based on private cars.
Science today points out that this carbon-based economy has displaced the biosphere from the stable state that had allowed human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone also complains about these transport systems.
In developed countries, similar levels of water quality complaints or bridge falls are rarely heard.
Why do transport systems generate such complaints, why do they fail daily? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
Traffic Flow is the analysis of the movement of drivers and individual vehicles between two different points and the interactions they make between themselves.
Unfortunately, studying the traffic flow is difficult because the driver's behavior cannot be predicted with a hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a relatively consistent band; thus, traffic flows tend to have some reasonable consistency and can be represented mathematically.
To better represent the traffic flow, relations were established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
Such relationships help in the planning, design and operations of road installations.
Insects were the first animals to go into the air. Their ability to fly helped them escape more easily from enemies and find food and partners more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along the body.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that can't bend their wings back are dragonflies and ephemerals.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarco said the Solar System was moving around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite; that the Solar System was moving around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
That sounds sensible, because planet Earth doesn't seem to be moving, does it?
The Amazon is the largest and second longest river on Earth. It carries more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the largest river on Earth, sometimes almost 10 km wide.
A total of 20% of the water from the rivers of the planet to the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River has 6,387 km (3,980 miles). It receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Ancient Empire, the Giza pyramids were never surpassed in size and in technical excellence of construction.
The ancients of Egypt of the New Empire marvelled at the constructions of their predecessors, who until then were well over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City has about 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world, and with the smallest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its official laws and communications.
Italian is also the common language used by most of those working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican city are Roman Catholics.
Since ancient times, people have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper, because they can all be discovered in nature in natural form and are relatively simple to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything is a mixture of one or more four elements, which are earth, water, air and fire.
This was more related to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, although he has also theorized that they become new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are simply a mixture of two or more metals. Do not forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
It is considered that elements such as calcium and potassium are metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
You also get alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
All things in the universe are made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are so amazingly small that it would be possible for trillions of them to fit at the end of this sentence.
So the pencil was a good friend to many people when it was released.
Unfortunately, as new writing methods appeared, the pencil was relegated to a less important role and use.
Currently, people write messages through computer screens and don't need to get close to a pointer.
We can only imagine what the keyboard will become when something new comes up.
The fission pump works based on the principle that it takes energy to build a nucleus with several protons and neutrons.
It's kind of like walking with a heavy cart up a hill.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to separate with little or no incentive.
The surface of the Moon is composed of stones and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called a crust.
The crust is 70 km thick on the visible side and 100 km thick on the invisible side.
The layer is thinner under the seas and thicker below the mountains.
There may be more maria on the next side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what motivates people or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they reach adulthood.
These theories analyze what is in certain people that makes them want what they do and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular theories of content are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Herzberg's Two Factors Theory.
In general terms, two behaviors can flourish as managers begin to lead their former coworkers. One side of the spectrum tries to stay as "part of the group of guys" (or girls).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, adopting disciplinary measures, performing performance evaluations, delegating and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, a person becomes an impossible individual to recognize that he feels he should change everything the team has done and do his own.
After all, the leader is responsible for the success and failure of a team.
This behavior several times ends in conflicts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams have to maintain the same standards of excellence of the teams considered conventional, however, there are some subtle differences.
Virtual team members usually act as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams may find themselves in various time zones, which may not be understood by local management.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team for which each member must report. The invisible team defines the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the difficult process of establishing an organizational learning? One of the practical objectives of the concepts of organizational learning is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively used by all functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity are transparent.
As a result, the process of an organization that works in a team to overcome a difficulty can lead to a new innovative process that meets the customer's need.
Even before an organization is innovative, leaders need to create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) clarifies the Continuum approach as a methodology used to help organizations reach higher levels in their performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. Therefore, they narrow the research area and make it much more accurate.
The correlation between brain and behavioral pathology bases scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injuries and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes never seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to design simulation models that help us understand the processes that exist in our mind.
Although AI has a strong connotation of scientific fiction, AI forms a very important branch of computer science, addressing behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
AI research involves the production of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent activity.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer questions and diagnoses, as well as the recognition of writing, voice and speech.
These things have become separate disciplines, focusing on providing solutions to real - life problems.
The AI system is often used in the areas of economy, medicine, engineering and military, as it is integrated into various home computer software applications and video games.
Study visits are very important for any school class. Often teachers would love to take their students to places where a bus trip is not an option.
The technology offers the solution with virtual field lessons. From the classroom, students can see museum pieces, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art.
Sharing a field trip virtually is also a great way to reflect on a tour and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, students from Bennett School, North Carolina, develop a website about their trip to the state capital. Every year, the site is remodeled, but the old versions are kept online to serve as a souvenir book.
Blogs can also help improve student writing. Since students often start contact with blogs using bad grammar and spelling, then the presence of a public usually changes that.
As students are often the most critical audience, the blog author begins to strive to improve writing and avoid criticism.
In addition, having a blog "forces students to become more knowledgeable about the world around them." The need to feed the interest of the public inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Writing in blogs is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students, so that they extend learning far beyond the traditional day of instruction.
The appropriate use of blogs "can make students more analytical and critical; by actively interacting with Internet content, students can position themselves in the context of others' writings, as well as define their own perspectives on specific issues (Orvec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming and bilingual capital and has a series of art galleries and museums that demonstrate the past and present Canadian.
The Niagara Falls are further south; the north has untouched natural beauty of Muskoka and much more.
Because of all this and much more, Ontario stands out as what people from outside regard as the essence of Canada.
Large areas further north are also quite sparsely populated and some are virtually uninhabited in nature.
For comparison of the population that surprises many people: there are more African-Americans living in the US than Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are in the Indian Ocean, a distance from the East African coast.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and a continent by itself, when it comes to wildlife.
Most smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known as luxurious beach hotels.
The Arabs also took Islam to the lands, which gained much popularity in Comoros and Maiote.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the Cape of Europe Route to India.
In the north, the region is limited by the Sahel, and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all travellers say they are married, regardless of the current marital status.
It is also useful to use a ring (only one that looks too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can cause acts that they would consider as harassment, and it is not uncommon to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm in refusing men. Do not be afraid to stand firm (whether by cultural differences or not, this does not mean that everything is fine!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name of White House, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, which was named Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established commercial bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in Morocco as a whole.
Near the historic part of Medina it is easy to find traditional Moroccan goods such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, narguilés and more a lot of bugigangas, all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, on the far east, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried a large part of the city's streets, mainly the center.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside Goma must be studied to understand the state of battle that persists in the province of North Kivu.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, along with some of Africa's cheapest mountain trails with gorillas.
You can use a boda wedding (mototaxi) to walk through Goma. The normal (local) price is about 500 Congolese francs for a quick ride.
"Timbuktu" was used as a metaphor to refer to distant and exotic lands, in view of its relative inaccessibility.
Today, Timbuktu is a impoverished city despite its reputation as a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was placed on the list of the world's assets in danger, due to the danger of desert sands.
It was one of the main stops during Henry Louis Gates' Wonders of the African World, broadcast by the PBS channel.
The city contrasts strongly with the rest of the country because it has a more Arabic than African touch.
Kruger National Park is located in northeastern South Africa, along the Mozambique border to the east, from Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River on the southern border.
The park covers 19,500 Km2 and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each supporting different animal species.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the banner of the National Parks of South Africa (SANParks).
There are fees for entry and conservation of the park, as is the case with all national parks in South Africa.
It can also be very useful to purchase a Wild Card. With it you can have access to various South African parks or to all South African national parks.
The island of Hong Kong gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place that many tourists regard as their main attraction.
The parade of buildings that form the Hong Kong horizon has already been compared to a glittering bar graph that is visible by the presence of Victoria Harbour waters.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, get off the island and go to the edge of Kowloon, on the opposite side.
Most of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely concentrated on recovered land along the north coast.
This is the place the British colonizers chose to live, and so if you're looking for evidence of the colonial past of the territory, this is a great place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest mangrove range in the world, stretching for 80 km (50 mi) towards the interior of Bangladesh and India from the coast.
Sundarbans has been declared UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park
But forests do not only count on mango swamps - they have some of the last large jungles that have already covered the remaining gangetic surface.
The Sundarbans covers an extension of 3,850 km2, and one third of it is covered by areas of water / swamp.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans are a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengal Tigers and about 30,000 deer seen in the area.
There are several bus departure times from the interdistrict bus station (on the other side of the river) during the day, but most, especially those going east and Jakarta/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since interdistrict buses are almost always crowded, it is advisable to buy the ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by Japanese coastal microbuses, which are comfortable and resilient.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The bridge of the Oiapoque River is a long bridge. It crosses the Oiapoque River to connect the cities of Oiapoque, Brazil, and São Jorge do Oiapoque, French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long and two slopes of 3.50 m wide.
The vertical break under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011 and did not open for traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to go into operation in September 2017, a date scheduled for the completion of customs inspections in Brazil.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group that inhabited what is now the east of Paraguay, living as semi-gamous hunters who also practiced subsistence farming.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaicurus and the Paiaguás, who lived from hunting, collecting and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called "The Giant Province of the Indies", emerged from the meeting of Spanish conquerors with native indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the creation of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has succeeded in the permanence of many of its characteristics and identity of indigenous peoples.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December in the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Small tournaments and games can also be seen here at other times of the year.
To learn more about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, consult the Argentina Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falklands is the pound of the Falklands (FKP), the value of which is equivalent to one British pound (GBP).
The money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands that is located in Stanley, in front of the FIC West store.
The sterling pound is generally accepted anywhere on the islands and in Stanley are accepted credit cards and US dollars.
On remote islands, it is unlikely that credit cards will be accepted, although British and American coins can be received. Please contact the owners in advance to find out what method of payment they accept.
It is practically impossible to change the current currency of the Falklands outside the islands, so change the money before leaving the islands.
As Montevideo lies south of the equator, there is summer, while it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical region; in the summer months, temperatures above 30 °C are common.
Winter can be disappointingly cold: temperatures rarely fall below the freezer, but the combined wind and humidity make the feeling colder than what the thermometer shows.
There are no particularly "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rain remains basically the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to the presence of humans, they are still wild animals that should not be fed or disturbed.
Following the instructions of the park authorities, keep at least 100 yards/metres of bears and wolves, and 25 yards/metres of all other wild animals!
Despite its docile appearance, bison, moose and bears, as well as all large animals, can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they have not kept an adequate distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so do not approach.
Moreover, know that the smells attract bears and other wild animals, however, avoid carrying or cooking foods with a strong smell and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and is the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the scene of a known naval impasse in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave it.
All the ships were sunk, except for a cruiser from Britain. Almost 200 lives of Germans and Americans perished.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the city resulted in the murder of the supreme chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, due to Auckland being between two coves. The most popular ones are in three areas.
The beaches on the north coast (in the North Harbour district) are bathed in the Pacific Ocean and go from Long Bay to the north to Devonport to the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches with safe swimming, and many have shadows from the pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located at Waitemata Harbour, in the sophisticated suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, in central Auckland.
These are sometimes family beaches crowded with a wide variety of shops around the coast. Swimming is very safe.
The main local beer is 'Number One'. It is not an elaborate beer, but it is pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called 'Manta'.
There are many French wines to enjoy, but New Zealand and Australian wines can come down better.
Local piped water is completely safe for consumption, but it is easy to find bottled water if you are afraid.
For Australians, the concept of "flat white" coffee is strange. A short black coffee is "spresso", the cappuccino comes full of cream (not foam) and the tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is in accordance with Belgian standards. Natural juices are expensive, but great.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and injuries from any of these causes, which occur in the reef, are rare.
Keep following the authorities' reminders, obeying all signs and paying close attention to security alerts.
The cubedusa occurs near beaches and river estuaries, from October to April, north of 1770. They can occasionally be found in other periods.
Sharks do exist, but rarely attack humans. Most are afraid of humans and tend to swim far away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean. Their main habitat is the estuaries of the rivers that lie north of Rockhampton.
Early booking gives the traveller the peace of mind that he will have a place to sleep when arriving at his destination.
Travel agents usually do business with specific hotels, as much as it is likely possible to book other types of accommodation, such as camping parks, by a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, or even packages combined with flights and hotels.
They can also guarantee your reservation if you need time to think about the offer or gather other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, if you have any change or request, it should first be sent to the travel agent, and not directly to the hotel.
In some festivals, the vast majority of participants in music festivals decide to camp on site, and most of them consider this a fundamental part of the experience.
If you want to stay close to the action, you'll have to come early to get camped close to the music.
Remember that even after the closing of the music on the main stages, some sections of the festival can continue playing until late.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the north of the Baltic in winter, check the location of the cabin, because when crossing the ice a terrible noise is generated for the most sensitive.
Cruises in St. Petersburg include city tours. Passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see terms).
Casinos usually make a lot of effort to maximize the time and money spent by their visitors. Generally there are no windows or clocks, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually have special offers of food, drink and entertainment to keep guests in good mood and to keep them on site.
Some places offer alcoholic beverages on behalf of the house. However, drunkenness harms the judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of maintaining sobriety.
When driving in places with high latitudes or on roads over the mountains, consideration should be given to the possibility of facing snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
On roads with ice and snow, the friction is low, and you can't drive as if you were on the clean asphalt.
During the snowfalls, it is possible to fall snow enough to keep you locked up in very little time.
Visibility may also be reduced due to falling or windfall snow, or by condensation or ice in the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic remains almost uninterrupted throughout the year.
The safari are probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and girl in the eyes of many visitors.
The term "safari", in its colloquial use, refers to trips by land to observe the impressive African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars and the basic equipment allows for good visualization.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy, and you'll see them better with binoculars.
Also known as "walking in the forest", "walking safari" or "passing", a walking safari is equivalent to walking, whether for a few hours or many days.
The Paraolimpiadas will take place between August 24 and September 5, 2021. Some events will be hosted in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia to have hosted two Summer Olympics, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you have scheduled your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement is announced, you may have a complicated situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but at the end of March most cancellation policies because of the coronavirus did not extend until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with normal tickets costing about 7,000 yen.
Passing wet clothes can help dry. Many hotels have iron and board to pass clothes for loan, even if there is not one in the room.
If an iron is not available, or if you don't like wearing socks, you can try using a hair dryer, if available.
Be careful not to let the tissue heat up too much (which can make it shrink or, in more serious cases, cause burns).
There are different ways to purify water, some more efficient against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is enough; in others, many minutes are needed.
The quality of the filters varies and, if you are in doubt, it may be good to consider buying gallons of water from a trusted company.
Travelers may find animal pests with which they are unfamiliar in the regions from which they came.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or, at worst, cause allergic reactions, spread poison or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can hurt or kill people by force, usually do not qualify as pests.
Duty free shopping is the chance to buy duty-free goods and fees at certain locations.
Travellers visiting countries with high taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially in products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging conditions for drivers on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, which often pass through isolated serton areas.
If you don't have the custom of driving on inland roads, be judgmental: steep slopes, narrow tracks and sharp curves are common.
The announced speed limits are visibly lower than in previous and subsequent sections - commonly 55-65 km/h - and strict obedience to them is even more important than the opposite.
Interestingly, however, the cellular phone service is much stronger here than along many other stretches of the route, such as, for example, in Pennsylvania Wilds.
The German sweets are very good and, in Bavaria, they are quite capricious and varied, similar to those of the southern neighbour, Austria.
Sweets with fruits are recurrent, with apples roasted in the sweets all year round, and cherries and plums marking presence during the summer.
Many German bakery goods also have almonds, hazelnuts and other chestnuts. Famous cakes usually combine very well with a very strong cup of coffee.
If you want some small, but tasty sweets, try what, depending on the region, can be called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, together with meat or vegetables.
A curry can be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.

With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a range that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
But if used without other qualifiers, the term tends to mean that the food is originally from the central and eastern parts of the main island Java.
Now widely available by the archipelago, the Javanese cuisine includes a variety of plainly seasoned dishes, the predominant condiments of Javanese preference being peanuts, peppers, sugar (mainly Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
For a rider's feet to have support, stribs are used, which are hung on both sides of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but they may present security problems, as the rider's feet may be trapped in them.
If a horseman is thrown from a horse, but he had one of his feet grabbing on the stairwell, he can be dragged if the animal ends up running away. To reduce this danger, several safety precautions can be taken
First, a large part of the pilots wear riding boots with jump and smooth sole, which is quite narrow.
Then, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow a leather stairwell to fall from the saddle pulled back by a falling knight.
As Chile's main climbing destination, the Cochamó Valley is known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of large granite walls and cliffs.
The meetings include exciting views of the peaks. Mountaineers from all over the world are continually establishing new routes among their infinite potential of walls.
Snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding through snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard board fixed on your feet.
Skiing is an important activity on the trip for many enthusiasts, occasionally known as "ski booms", who plan a whole holiday just to ski in a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old—rock paintings depicting skiers, date back to 5000 B.C.!
Alpine skiing as a sport refers to the 17th century at least and, in 1861, the first recreational ski team was opened by Norwegian citizens in Australia.
Ski backpack: activity also known as skis of the ski resort, ski tours or ski-alpinism.
It is related, but usually does not involve tourism for alpine skiing or mountaineering, the latest made in steep terrain and requiring much more rigid skis and boots.
Think of the ski route as a hiking route.
In good condition, you will be able to cover slightly longer distances than on foot — but only very rarely will you get cross-country skiing speeds without a heavy backpack on prepared tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, travelling across several countries would mean having to go through visa and passport control requests several times.
The Schengen area, however, functions as a country in this respect.
If you stay in this area, you can cross the border without going through passport checkpoints again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you will not need to apply for visas for each of the Schengen countries separately, thus saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition that specifies which manufactured items are antiques. Some tax agencies define which items over 100 years old are antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit may be lower in places such as North America than in Europe.
Handcrafted products can be defined as antiques, although they are younger than similar products produced in mass.
The creation of reindeer is an important means of subsistence among the Sami, and the culture around trade is also important for many other classes of professionals.
As much as it is a tradition, not all Sami participated in the creation of reindeer on a large scale, but lived from fishing, hunting and such things, having the reindeer as, mainly, traction animals.
Today, many Sami work with modern businesses. Tourism is an important income in Sámmi, the Sámi area.
Although widely used, especially among non-Romans, the term "gypsy" is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and imprecise perceptions of the Roman people.

Travellers are strongly advised to be alert to any risk of bad weather in their region, as this may affect travel plans.
When planning a visit to a country that is considered a war zone, first the person must receive professional training.
An Internet search by 'A hostile environment course' will usually indicate the address of a company in the region.
A course will normally cover all the topics discussed here with much more details, usually with practical experience.
A course usually lasts between 2 and 5 days and involves dramatization, several first aid and sometimes training with weapons.
Books and magazines dealing with forest survival are common, but publications on war zones are rare.
Travellers planning a sex change surgery abroad should ensure that they are carrying valid documents for the return trip.
The willingness of governments to issue undefined gender (X) passports, or updated documents to find a desired name and gender, varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honour these documents varies widely.
Searches at security checkpoints were also much more intrusive after September 11, 2001.
Transsexual people who have not yet performed gender exchange surgery should not expect to pass through the scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
Return currents are the reflux of the water from the waves on the beach returning to the sea, usually in a reef or similar area.
Due to underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in some deeper sections, and a rapid stream can form for deep waters there.
Most deaths result from fatigue for trying to swim against the current, which can be impossible.
As soon as you can get out of the current, swimming back is not harder than it would usually be.
Try to aim from somewhere where you can't be caught or, depending on your skills or if you have been detected, wait for rescue.
Reentry shock occurs before cultural shock (less honeymoon time occurs), lasts longer and may be more severe.
Travellers who have easily adapted to the new culture sometimes have a special difficulty in adjusting to their native culture.
Upon returning home after living abroad, you adapted to the new culture and lost some of the habits of your local culture.
When you went abroad for the first time, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country need to adapt.
People do not imagine that patience and understanding are also fundamental for travelers who are returning home.
In the area reserved for children, one of the most interesting things is the pyramid light and sound show.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and also in the silence before the show starts.
Usually you always hear the sound of tourists and sellers. The story of sound and light is like a book of stories.
The Sphinx is defined as a background and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are displayed in the pyramids and different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, which had their discovery in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the largest number of bases, with sixteen active by 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, where the village of Villa Las Estrellas is located.
The others are Livingston Island and Deception, in which the flooded boiler of a still active volcano provides a spectacular natural port.
The Ellsworth Land is the southern region of the peninsula, coastal to the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the Peninsula here merge into the plateau, then reemerge to form the 360 km chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, cut by the Minnesota glacier.
The northern part, or Sentinel Range, has the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, reaching 4,892m on Mount Vinson.
In remote locations, without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone can be your only option.
A satellite phone usually does not replace a mobile phone, since to make a call you need to be outdoors with satellite views.
The service is often used for transportation, including recreational craft, as well as expeditions that have remote data and voice needs.
Your local telephone operator will be able to offer more information about the connection to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those who want to have a sabbatical year is to travel and learn.
This is especially popular among those who leave school, allowing them to take a year before college, without compromising their education.
In most cases, enrolling in a course abroad during a sabbatical year may, in fact, increase your chances of entering higher education in your home country.
Normally, there will be an enrollment fee to enroll in these educational programs.
For those who like boating, Finland is a great destination. In the lakes and coastal archipelagos, the "Terra dos thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands.
In the archipelagos and lakes, you don't necessarily need a yacht.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are really large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a differentiated experience.
Sailing with a boat is a national hobby in Finland, with a boat for every seven or eight people.
This is combined by Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but a very characteristic form (for example, in the Netherlands, the number is one to forty).
Most Baltic cruises offer extended stays in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for two whole days and return to the ship to sleep at night.
If you embark only on sea trips, you will not need a separate visa (valid from 2009).
Some cruises show Berlin, Germany, on the flyers. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not near the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if these people have not travelled by plane before or have never experienced a traumatic event.
It is not something to be ashamed of: it is no different from personal fears and antipathy for other things that many people have.
For some, understanding something about how aircraft work and what happens during a flight can help overcome the fear that is based on the unknown or not being in control.
Carrier companies are well paid to deliver things quickly. Often, time is very important in sending commercial documents, goods or spare parts for urgent repair.
In some routes, larger companies have their own planes, but for other routes and smaller companies, there was a problem.
If they sent things by air freight, depending on the route, it could take days to get to the landing and pass customs.
The only way to get there faster was to send as luggage unloaded. Airlines regulations do not allow them to send baggage without a passenger, which is where you enter.
The obvious way to fly in the first class or in the executive class is to disburse a large amount of money for the privilege (or, even better, making your company do that for you).
However, it is not cheap: as basic rules, you can expect to pay up to four times more in relation to the normal economic rate for the executive class and eleven times more for the first class!
Generally speaking, it is not even worth looking for discounts on executive or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know very well that there is a small group of passengers who are willing to pay a high price for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The language of the country is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member country.
Economic relations were restored between these two parts of Moldova, despite the failure in political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with approximately 3.7 million people, and has the second largest port after Istanbul, as well as an excellent transport centre.
Once the ancient city of Smyrna, now it is a modern, developed and agitated shopping center, located around a large bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide avenues, the buildings with glass facades and the modern shopping centers are marked by traditional red roofs, the market of the 18th century, and the ancient mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere that refers more to Mediterranean Europe than to classical Turkey.

Please treat the place with all the dignity, solemnity and respect that it deserves. Don't make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not damage the place by staining or cracking the buildings with punctures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Almost half of the people prefer to speak Catalan, much understand it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, most of the plates are only in Catalan, because this is the language that was established by law as an official language.

Regular ads on the subway are made only in Catalan, but unplanned interruptions are announced by an automated system in a wide variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
The Parisians have the reputation of being self-centered, rude and arrogant.

The abrupt exterior of the Parisians will quickly disappear if you show some basic courtesy
Plitvice Lakes National Park is highly wooded, mainly with beech, fir, and pine trees, and features a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
There is a remarkable diversity of plant communities, due to the varied microclimates, different soils and different altitude levels.

Rare animals can be found there, such as European brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynxes, wild cats and tetrazes, as well as several other common species
While visiting the monasteries, women are forced to wear skirts covering their knees and also need to have their shoulders covered.
Most monasteries provide costumes for women who arrive unprepared, but if you bring your own costumes, especially with bright colors, you will be greeted with a smile from the monk or nun.
Similarly, men are required to wear pants covering their knees.
You can borrow clothes at the entrance; however, they are not washed after each use, so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. For men, there is a unique size!
Majorcan cuisine, as well as that of similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil in everything.

All the nouns, along with the word Sie for you, always start with capital letters, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
This also makes reading easier, no doubt, although writing is somewhat complicated by the need to find out whether a verb or adjective is used substantially.
The pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, since most words are pronounced exactly as they were written.
The main letters to be observed are C and G, because their pronunciation varies according to the vowel below.
In addition, make sure to pronounce r and rr differently: expensive means dear, while car means automobile.
The Persian language has a relatively easy and mainly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar book will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand the phrases.

However, people who speak a bit of Spanish can quickly conclude that Portuguese is quite similar to the extent that it is not necessary to study separately.
Pre-modern observatories are mostly outdated today and remain in museums or schools.
As light pollution in their golden age was not a problem, they usually find themselves in cities or campuses of universities, easier to arrive than those built more recently.
Most modern research telescopes are huge installations in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The observation of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the eighth century.
The concept came from China, where the plum blossoms were the preferred flower.
In Japan, the first feasts of cherry blossoming were held by the emperor only for himself and for other members of the aristocracy around the Imperial Court.
Plants look better when they are in a natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove even "just one" change.
If you are to visit a formally arranged garden, collecting "specimens" will also cause you to be expelled, without the right to discuss.
Singapore is usually an extremely safe and very easy place to explore, and you can buy almost everything after arriving.

There is a tradition of spending the night of Easter awake somewhere open to see the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
The more traditional churches usually perform an Easter vigil on Saturday night during the Easter weekend. Congregations often break the celebration at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came here swimming, flying or floating.
Due to the long distance from the continent, mammals could not make the journey, which made the turtle-giant the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans in Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
If you are going to visit the Arctic or Antarctic areas in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a great opportunity to see the northern aurora, because the sky gets dark at about the right time.
As the areas are sparsely inhabited, and as a result, light pollution is not a problem, you will also be able to appreciate the stars.
In Japan, labour cultural relations are more based on hierarchy and formality than Westerners are used to seeing.
Suits are the standard suit in business, and co-workers call each other for their last names or positions.
