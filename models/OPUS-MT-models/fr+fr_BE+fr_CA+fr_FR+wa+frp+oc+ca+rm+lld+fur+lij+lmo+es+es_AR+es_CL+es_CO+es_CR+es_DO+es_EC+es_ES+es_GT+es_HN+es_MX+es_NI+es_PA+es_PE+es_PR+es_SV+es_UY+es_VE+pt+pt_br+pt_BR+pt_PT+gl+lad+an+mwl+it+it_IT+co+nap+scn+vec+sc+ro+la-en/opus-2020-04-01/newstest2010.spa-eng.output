Barack Obama to be the fourth American president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
U.S. President Barack Obama will arrive in Oslo, Norway to spend 26 hours and receive the Nobel Peace Prize, as the fourth U.S. president in history.
The $1.4 million diploma, medal and cheque will receive them, inter alia, for the exceptional effort to strengthen global diplomacy and cooperation among nations.
The chief of the White House and his wife Michelle will arrive in the Norwegian metropolis in the morning and will have much to do.
First, visit to the Nobel Institute, where for the first time you will meet the five members of the committee that, in October, elected you between 172 people and 33 organizations.
Then the presidential couple is scheduled to meet with the King of Norway, Harald V, and Queen Sonia.
In the afternoon the visit will culminate in a ceremony in which Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will be the fourth American president to receive it, although the third one to receive it in his office.
The White House has already announced that when it receives the award, it will talk about the Afghan war.
The President did not want to avoid that issue, knowing that he was receiving the prize as president of a country currently at war in two countries.
His war efforts increased further with the dispatch of additional troops to Afghanistan, which he did not forget to mention any of his critics.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive the gold medal, diploma and check of ten million Swedish crowns (approximately 24 million Czech crowns).
It is proposed to donate them to charitable purposes, but it has not yet decided to which organization in particular.
During his full program, the President and his wife will participate in a banquet attended by, in addition to the Norwegian kings, the Prime Minister and 250 other guests.
Obama from the beginning had a rather reserved attitude towards the prize.
He mentioned, for example, having the feeling that he did not deserve it at all.
He also repeated several times that the prize is not only for him, but for all those who fight for the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement he mentioned that it represents "a challenge to take action".
Defendant of nature accused of blackmail
Litoměřice police accused the president of the civic association Společnost ochranců přírody Litoměřice (Litoměřice Society of Nature Defenders) of blackmail.
Last year he appealed several times against some construction licensing procedures and to withdraw the appeals he demanded money from investors for his own benefit, said the spokesman of the police of Litoměřice Alena Romová.
The president of the Society of Nature Defenders Litoměřice is Lubomir Studnička.
He is currently detained and faces a sentence of up to three years in prison.
Brno doesn't like containers too much to separate the garbage.
In Prague, citizens can separate beverage packages and containers can be found in the villages of southern Moravia to separate garbage everywhere.
And in Brno?
It takes several minutes to find the respective containers.
I don't want to say that Brno doesn't separate the garbage at all.
It seems to me that, to be the second largest city in the Republic, the municipalities are not sufficiently interested in this problem.
Brno is completely behind in the separation of garbage, not only because we citizens can only use containers to separate paper, glass and plastic, but above all because of the number of containers for such waste.
Have you ever tried, for example, to throw a bottle of PET into the center of the proper container?
It's almost impossible, especially it takes a lot of time and patience.
The only place I've found so far is in Moravské náměstí Square, opposite the Potrefená Huse.
Don't get mad at me, Mr. Onderka and his colleagues, but that seems too little to me.
It is not necessary to mention that elsewhere it is also not easy to separate the garbage.
That's why many of my friends prefer not to separate her.
For vagrancy
The thing is, the containers are far away.
I'm not surprised.
I offered myself, after a party, to throw away several bottles of glass and plastic.
But on Kauniova Street I didn't see any red containers nearby.
Fortunately, going to the tram I found the right place.
However, the garbage was already overflowing with the container.
It's still the center of Brno, the most representative part of the city, isn't it?!
What happens is that ecology and aesthetics do not seem to be of much interest to the Socialists of Brno.
They prefer to buy the city the hockey extra league, which embarrasses us throughout the republic, and not buy any more containers or offer the separation of other materials so that Brno is cleaner.
I'm glad to be able to compare my hypothesis, after surfing the Internet a little, with official statistics.
According to EKO-KOM society, Brno is really the worst in the entire Jihomoravský Kraj region.
Paroubek's budget removed money from income and sickness benefits
After the left, despite the opinion of the government, adds funds for farmers or officials, there may not be enough money in the budget for rents, sickness grants or for building savings.
But neither for the interests of state debt or international litigation.
This will harm all those who rule in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists imposed the increase on some groups, they trusted that the government would later ask for a loan for sensitive expenses, rents or sickness benefits. "That only means postponing the problems for the future, it's laying mines," Janota says.
What happens is that when you borrow money, you have to pay higher interest and, one day, you have to return the money.
The state doesn't have a lot of options to get money.
If it does not reduce social subsidies or operating expenses of the State, it has to increase taxes.
To all who added the left now: firemen, teachers, farmers.
And later on, so did his children.
People don't have to worry about income or sickness benefits, they'll get them.
But the price to be paid will be the increase of the public debt; next year will not be lacking in the treasure only 163 billion, but more.
Despite Minister Janota's efforts, debt will continue to increase alongside interest expenditure.
The state will need money to cover them and will no longer come with a slight increase in VAT or a reduction in maternity benefits, as the government did in its deficit package.
Due to the dislocation of money for the benefit of some groups of voters, next year will also lack five billion to complete the construction of highways and railways.
These are, above all, the sectors in which the bidding has already taken place and where the construction process has already begun, whose projects cannot be changed and their price can not be reduced either.
The most you can do is keep them, which is not free either.
That means delay or cessation of the thirty large constructions; the possibility of obtaining European funds is also in danger, warns the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
ČSSD proposed a salomonic solution for the decrease of funds: it will obtain money from the dividends of ČEZ, which is mostly owned by the State, and will add the fund of transport.
The problem is that the value of the dividend is never safe nor is it a bottomless bag.
Last year ČEZ allocated 18 billion to the budget.
Each year the dividends are paid ecological damage, serve to complete the income account or serve as a reserve for the prepared income reform.
Moreover, with this trick, according to EU rules, the real budget deficit increases to the level of 5.7% of GDP.
The cash transfer carnival doesn't end here.
Almost three billion were obtained from the budget to provide several compensations to victims of communism and crime, or for litigation costs, including in construction savings.
It is not clear whether the State will need such funds.
It's a lottery.
If we lose any international litigation, we may have to pay for it, says Janota.
Then the Minister will have to save money within the spring or, in the worst case scenario, take over the government budget reserve.
One hundred million are also missing for the Státní Pokladna (State Box) project, whose price is two billion and which has already been started. It should allow online monitoring of what the various authorities are spending.
The first stage begins in January.
If the finance minister does not find the money elsewhere, the project will have to stop and sanctions will come, warns Janota.
Your future smartphone will be able to operate with two operating systems
Americans will have a mobile phone on which the user can, by pressing a key, switch between several operating systems.
The plans revealed sound promising.
With just press a key, move in seconds from Windows Mobile to Android.
Precisely this possibility is the goal of the American company VMware, which focuses mainly on the development of virtualization software for computers.
On your mobile you will be able to carry two user profiles at once.
They will be able to change between them and divide them between home and work.
Both operate at the same time, said Srinivas Krishnamurti of the VMware company in the interview for Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and was shown for the first time several days ago.
It will be launched in 2012.
The virtualization of smartphones is no longer fiction.
VMware has already successfully demonstrated to journalists how the smartphone works with two operating systems.
It was the Nokia N800, modified with a RAM of 128 MB, where the mentioned systems, Windows Mobile and Android, work at the same time.
The development of the new technology for mobile phones is at its peak.
VMware cooperates with European and US operators to test for smartphone virtualization and these phones will reach customers during 2012.
The lack of snow in the mountains worries hoteliers
Not only teleski maintainers in Krkonoše worry about snow-free tracks.
The lack of snow makes people not book ski stays in hotels and pensions.
That's why free rooms can still be found in Krkonoše for all winter dates, including Christmas Eve and Christmas Eve.
We have many visitors on our pages.
People look at the deals, check the prices, but they're still afraid to book with commitment.
And if they call us, they immediately ask about our opinion, whether this Christmas will be snow or mud," mentioned the maintainer of the Spindl information portal.Info Martin Jandura.
Those who want to spend in Špindlerův Mlýn on a New Year's Eve according to their expectations, should no longer hesitate to book the stay.
Those who prefer to save money and put the quality of accommodation in second place, can try to wait a few more days.
The hoteliers of Špindlerův Mlýn offer mainly weekly stays for Christmas Eve.
I think they will continue to offer them, but they will soon give in and offer shorter stays.
And then the free rooms will be sold quickly, estimated Jandura.
Ingotours, a Vrchlabí travel agency, continues to offer free beds for all winter dates.
Now what interests us most is Christmas week, which is not yet complete.
Half of the places offered remain open.
That's why we've already prepared some last-minute holiday stays," said Ingtours director Petr Schiefert.
Vrchlabí's travel agency can still offer Christmas Eve in Krkonoše, but there are fewer open spaces.
They are sold very well also on the first fourteen days of February, the remaining winter dates are sold regularly.
This year the interest in winter stays is damaged by the lack of snow in Krkonoše.
People are waiting to see if there's snow.
No one wants to spend the end of the year on the snowless mountain.
If the tracks stay snowy during the week, the Christmas dates will run out too," Schiefert says.
On the contrary, it is a little easier to occupy the rooms at the Horizont hotel in Pec pod Sněžkou; last year it was more difficult.
We're about five percent better.
For New Year's Eve and Christmas, we have the last free seats.
The interest increases during the Polish holidays in January and February is also well sold," said the director of the best hotel in Pec, Karel Rada.
Eighty percent of Nochevieja's stays are already occupied also at the Omnia hotel, near the central parking lot in Janské Lázně.
On the contrary, at Janské Lázně's most recent hotel on Christmas half the beds are still free.
This January was a big surprise to us, as we are about sixty percent of the capacity for occupation.
February has been a little weaker, but as soon as snow falls, interest in Krkonoše stays will surely increase, mentioned Erik Sporysch, the director of the Omnia hotel.
At the moment, however, it seems that the hoteliers of Krkonoše will pass the desire for snow waiting.
Thursday must fall temperatures and, if there is precipitation, it should snow in the mountains.
But then again the temperatures will rise, reported Jiří Jakubský of Hradec Králové, of the Institute of Hydrometeorology of the Czech Republic.
USA: Repetition Is the Mother of Wisdom · Global Voices
It is funny that Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of the smartest man, as a diligent student repeats in the Afghan question the strategy of his predecessor, whom he himself took for the dumbest.
When it finally revealed its Afghan approach, eagerly awaited, it was shown to be a copy of the script used for Iraq by Bush, created three years ago.
Not only does the same text use several times the words "equal to Iraq", but it also did not hesitate to use the title of the Bush statement of January 2007 for its own statement: "A new way forward".
It was he himself, who three years ago criticized Bush's idea of sending new military reinforcements to Iraq, the country that is suffering from the civil war, and that criticized him as "an irresponsible decision with catastrophic consequences."
The following months, however, showed that Bush's strategy, based on the recommendations of field captains, was the only possible and successful one, so that today nothing is said about Iraq in the news.
Bush's reputation did not improve, yet objectively left his successor a much more favourable initial situation than he could have expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes the miracle will be repeated.
The field captains again asked him to increase the military contingent, especially the commander-in-chief of the Afghan operation General Stanley McCristal. He, even despite traditional subordinate relations, subjected the indecisive riflemen in the White House to harsh criticism.
He asked for 40,000 men to be able to improve the situation.
The president hesitated for three months, but he didn't think anything better, so at least he fooled the general over 10,000 soldiers.
He managed to get Europe to promise him another 5,000, although he had at least 10,000 before.
The most problematic thing about Obama's whole strategy seems to be his goal, to start withdrawing troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and to finish this procedure in three years. Obama's entire doctrine generated more questions from the answers he offered.
Many doubt that the increase will bear the same fruit as the procedure in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars in recent years, Iraq's society is relatively well organized, its leaders respect the agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is different: no one can be trusted and no agreement can be reached.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, if they are used to changing bosses every day according to their needs.
Political institutions, although formally established, will remain only a people of Potemkin. After it, patriarchal tribal relations will remain.
Balancing the interests of different ethnic groups is extraordinarily complicated because of confused relationships, even more complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Not even establishing a state that is "capable of action", a minimum objective of the whole operation, seems very real.
The horizon of Obama's strategy clashes with his voluntarism.
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has continued to deteriorate and is now about to explode.
Only a romantic soul, who knows nothing about reality, can believe that the military sent to war to "come home soon", will do some miracle here.
From a political point of view, setting the date of the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible, as the Taliban will regard it as an indirect declaration of American defeat.
The latest NATO summit showed that Europeans are less and less willing to participate in military operations in Afghanistan.
European politicians do not know, nor do they want to explain to their constituents, what the security of Germany or Italy has to do with the war with the Hindu Kush.
The other factor, capable of radically affecting the situation, is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to worsen and the increased sanctions have no effect on the Iranians, the US will have to make a difficult decision: to try to solve the problem with military force or not.
It will be necessary to seek the answers precisely when, according to Obama, America begins the triumphal withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
However, each solution like this will mean a dramatic setback for the Afghan situation.
The only positive point for Barack Obama is the fact that there are three years left for the presidential elections, and that is why there is still much time to find another strategy, if this proves to be a total failure.
Goldman Sachs bank managers will never receive cash bonuses again
U.S. bank senior executives Goldman Sachs will not receive cash bonuses this year.
The entity announced it to react to the harsh criticism of its wage practices.
The group of 30 senior managers will receive, instead of money, shares that cannot be sold within a minimum of five years.
In addition, actions may be withdrawn if they have taken excessive risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs thus became the leader in the effort to combine Wall Street bonuses with long-term power.
I guess Wall Street is fully aware of the longer path it should take, mentioned former investment banker of the JPMorgan Douglas Elliott entity.
The problem is in the details, he added.
The Bank Goldman Sachs faced the criticism after having set aside almost 17 billion dollars (almost 30 billion CZK) for the bonuses, in the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of bonuses in the entity for this year, according to the agency Reuters, probably exceeds, despite the measure announced today, the $20 billion.
The high bonuses in the banking sector became, with the arrival of the financial crisis, a delicate issue in politics.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it plans to tax at once, with a tax of fifty percent, the bonuses for banks that exceed 25,000 pounds (approximately 712,000 CZK).
France is also preparing similar measures.
This year women received the Nobel Prizes in all categories except physics
Five women, which is a record figure, received today in Stockholm by the hands of King Charles XVI Gustavo of Sweden this year's Nobel Prizes, in specialized categories and in literature.
In addition to the four scientists, a German writer of Romanian origin, Herta Müller, was also among the winners.
The Nobel Prize in Medicine was received by two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, as well as his fellow countryman Jack Szostak for research in the field of chromosomes.
The Nobel Prize in Chemistry was received by Israeli Ada Jonahth and the Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishna and Thomas Steitz for explaining the structure and function of ribosomes.
The last prize given, the Nobel Prize in Economics, was received by the American Elinor Ostrom and his compatriot Oliver Williamson for the analysis of an economic report.
The only specialized category, without an award-winning woman, was Physics.
This award was received today by scientists Charles Kao for research in the field of optical cables, and George Smith with Willard Boyle for the invention of the CCD chip, which forms the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or telescopes.
Each awardee collected the diploma, the Nobel medal and the certificate of the money received.
This sum in each category is up to 10 million Swedish kroner (approximately 25 million Czech kroner).
In the case of several prize winners in each category, the prize is distributed to each other.
The traditionally most awaited Nobel, Peace, received him this afternoon in Oslo, Norway, U.S. President Barack Obama.
In his speech he recognized the controversy of having been rewarded, as he is at the beginning of his career and is also at the head of a country that participates in two wars: in Iraq and Afghanistan.
To defend his policy, he added, however, that in certain situations wars are essential to achieve peace, even if their price is high.
Minister Janota considers the resignation. Klaus invited you to the Castle
President Václav Klaus will receive on Friday morning the finance minister Eduard Janota, who is considering his stay in the government, as he does not agree with the version of the state budget for next year, approved on Wednesday by the Chamber of Deputies.
The budget, and perhaps Janota's stay in the cabinet as well, is supposed to be the subject of his Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
According to him, the deficit is too large, which continues to deepen the crisis of public finances.
President Radim Ochvat's spokesman reported on the appointment.
On his stay in office, Janota wants to negotiate with Prime Minister Jan Fischer on Monday.
According to the Budget Act, prepared to be signed by Klaus, the Czech Republic should govern with a deficit of SEK 163 billion.
The Chamber of Deputies, however, approved on Wednesday the proposals of the left for transfers of funds and increased the money for civil servants' salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government does not agree with the proposals of the Social Democrats, as they covertly increase the budget deficit.
Between the left on the one hand and the government, Klaus and the right on the other, there was a serious conflict of internal politics. Due to this conflict, the future activities of Fischer's bureaucratic cabinet, the form of which was agreed in spring by the ODS, ČSSD and the Green Party, are beginning to be controversial.
Critics say that the budget, in the version approved by the Chamber of Deputies, de facto liquidates the package of saving measures, imposed in autumn by the Fischer government to curb public debt.
Klaus can but does not have to sign the law on the state budget; today he declared during a breakfast with businessmen that politicians had been neglecting "the serious problem", that is, "the unsustainable deficit" of public finances.
According to him today they no longer have a good solution.
Only a strong government, which can be supported by a broader consensus among political parties, could improve this situation, the president said.
ODS leader Mirek Topolánek mentioned that the budget is appalling and that the government should think about its future existence.
ODS Vice President Petr Nečas told ČTK that the concept of the bureaucratic cabinet with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Greens obviously no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer reacted and described similar words as "strong judgments".
The head of ČSSD, Jiří Paroubek, reacted to Topolánek saying that the budget deficit is appalling, prepared for this year by the former government of Topolánek. It will exceed 200,000 million crowns.
Wednesday ČSSD said the approval of the state budget for next year was successful.
The popular were also happy.
Mandela in Clint Eastwood's new film, played by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans claim that Hollywood's new film, Invictus: Invincible, tells a lot about the country, its struggle and its victories, although some critics say that the protagonist roles are played by American actors.
History speaks of sport, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is interpreted in his biography by the American Oscar-winning actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said Mandela, 91, asked him to play it in the Eastwood movie.
Another important role is played by Matt Damon.
I said, "When I interpret you, I'll have to have access to you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor, who received the award for his role in the Eastwood drama about the world of boxing Million Dollar Baby, played the role of the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, who ended up being a slave, of the fictional president of the United States, and even of God in Evan Almighty. But rarely did he represent someone who is still alive and, for many people, is as important as Mandela.
The former South African statesman spent 27 years in prison for his activities to end apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released in 1990 and for four years became president of the country.
In 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus - Invincible is a Latin word and the title of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film is a real story about Nelson Mandela, who joined forces with South African rugby team captain Francois Pienaar to help unite the country. Mandela, the new president, knows that after apartheid his nation remains racially and economically divided.
He believes that he is able to unite his people through sport, and that is why he decides to unite rugby players, who belong in the global measure to the outsiders.
The South African team managed to reach the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked for several years to get Mandela's story to the cinemas.
He had no other goal to play this role in such a way that it was as similar as possible to reality, Freeman said.
Of course, the biggest challenge was to talk like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were from the same area, he would have tried to meet Mandela, have dinner with him, be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing was that I wanted to shake Mandela's hand.
I found that when I shook his hand, I received his energy, it was transmitted and had the feeling of knowing how you feel, he said.
It's important to me to try to become a different person.
Matt Damon plays the role of François Pienaar, the captain of the national rugby team, in which white players predominated.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the rough rugby world.
A great surprise to him was, when he finally met for the first time with Pienaar at his home.
I remember calling the door, he opened and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was, "In the film I look much taller."
Despite the obvious differences between the characters of the actors and their real models, and under the management of director Eastwood, Invictus: Invincible received positive reviews and also talks about ambitions for the Oscar.
The film critic of Daily Variety magazine Todd McCarthy summarized his assessment with these words: "It was a very good story, a very well-made film."
In the film reviews on the rottentomatoes.com website, Invictus received 76 percent positive reviews.
The Secret of Splendor on Norway Solved: Russians Tested a Missile
A special luminous effect of unknown origin was observed on Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defence ended up recognizing yesterday that near the borders with Norway it tested an intercontinental ballistic missile.
The launch failed again. The "Bulava" missile, formerly intended to be the pride of the Russian army, is becoming the nightmare of the Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimír Putin.
Not even its repeated presence in missile tests has had the desired effect on the success of test flights.
Bulava, in most cases, did not fly or there was a failure in the air.
In Russian newspapers they write of "Bulavá" as "a missile that doesn't fly".
A missile that doesn't fly, but shines.
During this, the 13th test, there was no problem at first.
At the end of the flight there were again technical problems in the aircraft.
The engine probably went off in the third stage of the missile.
This time "Bulavá" was launched from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskoy, which was floating in the White Sea.
This type of missile makes it possible to launch from a vessel that is moving and is submerged at the same time.
That is why it is likely that the mysterious light on Norway, caused by an unidentified flying object, was actually the failed "bulava".
The Norwegians equally from the very first moment did not hesitate that it was a Russian missile.
The generals this time defend themselves by saying that one cannot speak simply of a failure.
The first two stages of the missile endured and the damage occurred in the third.
In the previous cases the engines were damaged immediately in the first stage.
Although none of the launches were completely flawless, according to the Ministry of Defence management only six of the thirteen were unsuccessful.
The success of almost fifty percent full of optimism to the generals and therefore continue to claim that "Bulavá" one day will fly without problems and that it will even manage to carry up to ten nuclear hypersonic blocks, whose total weight is maximum 1.15 tons.
Legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract with Moscow CSKA at 51
The legendary defender Viacheslav Fetisov will be back at the age of 51 at a professional hockey event.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup winner will help his team CSKA Moscow and possibly play on Friday in the KHL duel against St. Petersburg.
Fetisov finished his professional career at the age of forty in 1998 and currently presides over CSKA.
After Denis Kulyash was injured, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov practices constantly and is committed to helping the team.
We just have to solve some formal issues, quoted the AP agency Sergei Nemchinov, the coach of the Moscow club.
It is not yet clear whether the return of the famous player will refer to a single game.
I think Fetisov is one of those who manages to raise the spirits of the other players, Nemchinov mentioned.
According to AP if Fetisov returns to the ice tracks, he will become the longest professional player in Russian hockey.
The legendary forward Gordie Howe played in the NHL by Hartford at the age of fifty-one, during the entire season, and scored 15 goals and 26 assists.
The biggest group of the five famous players Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
Playing for the Soviet Union won two Olympic golds, seven World Championships, won the Canada Cup and the World Junior Championship.
In the second part of his career he also had success in the NHL: playing with Detroit he won the Stanley Cup twice.
Since 2001, he has been a member of the Hall of Glory in hockey.
Hyundai met the requirements of the unions. It will cancel all additional work
The management of the car factory in Nošovice agreed with the unions to cancel all additional work.
Precisely because of the frequent extra work, the unions declared the strike emergency on Monday.
The information was confirmed by Petr Vaněk, the spokesperson for the Hyundai car factory.
The management, however, wants for this year to agree with the unions one more Saturday shift.
We cannot resign to our manufacturing plan, because it is essential. That is why we proposed additional volunteer work on Saturday 19 December, that is, it will work in two shifts, Vaněk said.
According to the Sedmička.cz server, the company offered a bonus of 400 CZK to employees working on Saturday's shift.
The bonus will also be paid for last Saturday, November 28.
According to Vaňka, the company decided to change the way to motivate its employees with the extra work offered.
Employees can charge the bonus for overtime or they can take a day off on December 28, i.e. extend the holiday holidays in one day, Vaněk said.
In addition, all employees on Saturday shifts will receive money for travel and food.
Because the extra work was the most urgent and problematic point of the comments and complaints of the trade unionists and strikers, who stopped manufacturing last week, the management yesterday afternoon immediately decided to cancel all the extra work for December, Vaněk mentioned.
The employees of the car factory were forced to work two more hours in addition to eight-hour shifts and this situation lasted almost every day until last week.
After signing the agreement the unions will cancel the strike emergency.
Another negotiation between the factory management and the trade unionists should take place on Monday morning.
The head of the Petr Kuchař trade unions said on Wednesday, that if they commit to meeting the requirements and signing the document, they are willing to cancel the emergency by strike.
The situation at the car factory worsened last week, when approximately 400 employees spontaneously went on strike for frequent overtime work.
They also protested against poor payment conditions and alleged harassment.
The management felt that employees had to work overtime to meet the requirements and be able to supply the cars.
The trade unionists in their statement of Monday's strike emergency also demanded that none of the employees, who interrupted manufacturing last Wednesday, be penalized in any way.
As far as supplementary work is concerned, trade unions demand that the company minimise it.
In addition, this year's work requires a salary of 5,000 kroner.
The car factory in Nošovice Hyundai currently employs 2,000 people.
Serial manufacturing began last November.
Until last September it manufactured approximately 80,000 cars; its current productive potential is 200,000 cars a year.
A Czech discovery: an effective substance even in 'breasted' HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists tests new compounds able to moderate the spread of HIV in the body
The main advantage of this improved substance is that it is also effective against drug-resistant viruses.
In some cases this is more important than the fact that the compound is not as effective in a common variant of the virus, such as some accessible medicines already.
AIDS disease cannot be cured until now.
However, patients' lives can be significantly prolonged by a mixture of medicines that prevent the replication of HIV virus in the body.
However, its use has many side effects.
If the replication of the virus is not completely suppressed, so-called resistant viruses will be created; against them, drugs no longer work.
The work of the experts from three Institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, VŠCHT Prague and the University of Heidelberg demonstrates the possibility of mastering the resistance of the virus.
They demonstrated that substances called metalocarborans have an effect on albumin, which is responsible for the spread of the HIV virus.
Metalocarborans are composed of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus in a different way from all the medicines used today, so they can solve the problem of resistance.
In their work scientists find new, ‘improved' compounds, prepared knowing the molecular mechanism of their binding to the virus albumin.
Metalocarborans have a single three-dimensional structure: two polyhedral cages composed by boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms are joined by the metal atom, in this case by cobalt.
A Traitor and Resistant Virus
HIV protease is an albumin of the HIV virus, and is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the protease of HIV, there is no fractionation of the HIV virus and no mature and infectious corpuscles of the virus would be created.
If we stop HIV protease, we also stop the spread of the virus in the patient's body, scientists explain in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry at the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In an article published in the scientific journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of compounds, in which two pairs of cages (see table) are joined by a short organic series, which continues to be systematically modified.
A little weaker, but more effective
The test of the effect of this set of substances against HIV proteases was performed as a sample, and also against its resistant variants, obtained from HIV patients.
The effect of metalocarborans on the common variant of the enzyme is not as strong as on the clinically used medicines, however they do not lose their effect on the resistant variants, in which the drugs often do not work.
The mechanism of the single effect, its other qualities such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications makes, that the metalocarborans are interesting compounds for research with the aim of proposing effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlína, the head of the laboratory of structural biology at the Institute of Organic and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics at the Academy of Sciences.
ODS attacked Fischer, he defends himself
ODS chief Mirek Topolánek said that the budget approved for next year is "spooky" and Prime Minister Jan Fischer's government should, according to him, think of its future existence.
ODS statements were pointed out by the Prime Minister as strong sentences.
They say there's time left for analysis.
ODS Vice President Petr Nečas said that the concept of the bureaucratic cabinet with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party obviously no longer works.
According to Nečas, the Prime Minister has to decide whether in the Chamber of Deputies he wants to rely on the minority, which is trying to fight against the growing deficit, or whether he wants to remain in his position with the help of the parliamentary left.
The attitude of ODS and social democracy towards the problem of the public deficit is completely different, Nečas warned.
The Chamber of Deputies yesterday approved the budget for 2010, however with the amendments by the left, for more than 12 billion kroner.
The Chamber of Deputies increased the money for the salaries of state officials, for social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government criticized the SDG proposals, as they cover the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should govern with the deficit of 163 billion kroner.
ODS before the vote left the room and thus fulfilled the government's desire, that the modified budget is better than an interim budget.
Disillusionment and futility
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and the feeling of futility; Prime Minister Jan Fischer mentioned that the government will again assess the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota seriously threatened to resign if the amending proposals were approved, the situation could have been different.
According to Česká TV Janota requested a meeting with the Prime Minister.
He said, he's thinking about staying in the show.
The reason is their disappointment at the negotiations on the budget.
If Fischer agrees with another fight against the budget deficit, according to Nečas in the government they have nothing to do with the nominated by ČSSD, which imposed the changes in the budget.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear, if he resigns, whether the House adopts other laws that increase the deficit, for example those relating to sickness grants, income, or the amendment of the service law.
Topolánek: Ministers nominated by the SDG are not to blame
It's about Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
The ministers nominated by the SDG have done nothing wrong, Topolánek stressed in the US text news.
He recalled that in several ministries in lieutenant positions there are people who belong to TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed, that if Fischer decides to resign the principle of struggle with the height of the deficit of public finances, "it is absolutely logical and correct, to rely on the leftist majority, which is currently in the Chamber of Deputies".
However, it will not be able to count on the support and tolerance of SDG members.
I have not thought about that, when the time is right, I will deal with it, said to the journalists in the Chamber of Deputies the Minister of Defense Martin Barták, who was appointed to the government precisely by the members of the SDGs.
Prime Minister Fischer left for a European Council meeting in Brussels in the afternoon.
ODS gave in at Prime Minister's request
Nečas stressed that ODS on Wednesday in the Chamber of Deputies would probably vote against the modified budget if the Prime Minister did not explicitly ask ODS Members to allow the budget to be accepted.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not young children, he responded to the question, if ODS does not worry about the absence of the party leader in parliament and the Czech Republic during the budget negotiations.
I didn't realize my vote was missing.
Upon resigning from the mandate, he knew that in the following months it was mainly about the Bolshevism of the Chamber of Deputies and the destruction of everything positive, he reacted Topolánek himself.
According to the new schedule of trains of ČD will circulate fewer trains at almost the same rates
České dráhy (Czech Railways) from 13 December will cancel or restrict some fast and local trains less used and, on the contrary, will strengthen some links.
The total length of traffic will be reduced by two percent compared to today, after the new train schedule comes into effect.
Most rates including basic and customer price will not change.
More possibilities of links to the capital will win for example the inhabitants of the region of Ostravasko, dráhy for this line will add a pendulum road.
The direct train, on the contrary, will not return to Bratislava.
On the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line will run fewer fast trains, direct links to Prague - Letohrad will be restricted.
In the regions, the largest reduction in the planned transport by dráhy is in the Hradec Králové region, eight percent in total, on the contrary, transport will increase in Prague and the surrounding area.
Two night trains will also be cancelled in the Prague - Tabor - České Budějovice route and some fast trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line will be reduced only to a few days per week.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague, the inhabitants of Milovice have to change in Lysá nad Labem.
It is the 15. line of the Esko system, in the surroundings of the cities, its opening is possible thanks to the electrification of the line from Lysá nad Labem to Milovice.
Long-distance links to the capital will end at Prague station Hlavní nádraží.
ČD will introduce more SC Pendolino links between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jeseník will circulate every two hours.
From December 13 the travelers will not travel to Bratislava again in Pendolino.
This year's regional rail account: 200 million more than before
The fast trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport, to cover the so-called demonstrable losses Dráhy will receive next year four billion crowns in total, like this year. The local trains are ordered by the regions, next year they will pay eight billion crowns in total, and the State will help them almost three billion.
This year's regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
For fast trains and local dráhy have a new ten-year contract, so far the contract was always a year old.
Drahy are happy with the system, and perhaps that's why they didn't increase the prices of a large majority of the tickets.
Changes will occur only on one-day tickets - ČD Net and on cheap eLiška internet tickets.
For travellers without a customer card the ČD Net price will increase from 450 kroner to 600 kroner.
The price of eLiška will depend on distance, so far there was a single price of 160 kroner for travel between any two regional cities.
Philippine armed forces still detain more than 50 people, children were released
The armed have abducted 75 people in the southern Philippines today, including several primary school pupils and their teachers.
This was stated by the AFP agency, which previously reported only 65 abducted persons.
All 17 children arrested and one teacher were released after eight hours.
The kidnapping took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
They say that approximately 19 armed use the hostages as a living shield in the escape to the police.
Local negotiators are trying to agree to hand over the remaining hostages.
According to the AFP agency the armed belong to the New Popular Armada (NPA), an armed fraction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP agency, the police had previously persecuted the kidnappers because of the violence, the cause of which was the adjustment of the accounts between two clans of the local families.
In the southern Philippines in the province of Maguindanao it was because of the recent massacre, in which 57 people died, imposed martial law.
Among the victims of the November 23rd massacre, related to the governor's election, were 30 journalists.
On suspicion of involvement in the massacre, the governor of this province in the southern Philippines and his father Andal Ampatuan, the patriarch of an influential Ampatuan dynasty, were arrested.
Muslim separatists also operate on Mindanao Island.
However, they renewed peace dialogues with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
The story of RSA refers to everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the coming days, a new Hollywood film by Clint Eastwood Invictus (its official title in Czech isInvictus: Neporažený), which captures part of the biography of former South African President Nelson Mandela, is being released in American cinemas.
The role of the world-famous anti-apartheid fighter is played by Morgan Freeman, whom Mandela himself chose years ago for the leading role.
The second role, that of the legendary rugby champion Francoise Pienaar, was played by Matt Damon.
With the premiere are born from the reactions of critics and the public
Nelson Mandela
His full name is Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela. He was born on July 18, 1918 in Mvezo, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, and in 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize alongside Klerk.
He was President of the Republic of South Africa in 1994-1999.
Great hopes, as it comes to the public at the time, when in the Republic of South Africa they culminate preparations for the world championship in football. At the same time the media are shaken by alarming news about the increasing racial hatred and discrimination of the inhabitants by the dominant black majority.
According to the news agency AP, the reactions to this new film in RSA have been positive, despite numerous reservations against the distribution of the leading roles by Hollywood's "little interesting" stars.
Morgan Freeman says, however, that he is proud of the new film.
For many years I dreamed of the role and was well prepared to play it.
Many times I met Nelson Mandela in person, to - as is said - collect his energy, he mentioned in an interview after the festive premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it's good, if through the film we can remember Mandela's character and message.
It is a history of the Republic of South Africa, but it refers to everyone, he added.
In the suit of the national rugby team
The film is based on the book of British writer John Carlin with the title freely translated In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the game. Thanks to this game the nation was born. Portrait of South African human rights lawyer during his first presidential election period.
Morgan Freeman in the film is trying to unite two groups of inhabitants, racially and for long separate years. Like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he as protagonist also wears the suit of the national South African rugby team and enters the field of play. RSA won at that time the world cup.
By entering the gramilla in the suit, which in RSA is considered almost sacred, Mandela fourteen years ago won great ovations, especially of the white public and the recognition of the white inhabitants.
The football championship may be able to help people join and form a nation, rugby player Chester Williams, the only "black" on the national team in 1995, mentioned.
It will still be seen, if it improves the tense situation in the RSA.
White South Africans, however, are skeptical, as a rugby lover Christopher Dawson, who fled from his country to Britain, said in an interview just for LN.
The championship begins on June 11, 2010.
In Lounsko burns a transformer with a value of tens of millions of crowns
The fire caught in the morning a transformer of the company Čeps in a switch box near the village Výškov in Lunsko.
According to Lukáš Marvan, the spokesman for firefighters in the Ústí region, the fire is extinguished by six groups.
Previously the firefighters wanted to let the transformer be destroyed by fire, however later they changed their minds and the fire is extinguishing it with a mixture of water, foam and a special extinguishing material.
The fire was caused by a technical defect, the transformer's short circuit.
There were no injuries, according to Pavla Mandatová, the company's spokesperson, the failure does not endanger the safe functioning of the distribution system.
The estimated damage is several million crowns, enumerating it exactly will not be possible before the fire is extinguished.
According to Mandatová it will be necessary to replace the transformer destroyed by a new one.
During the ten years of Čeps' activity nothing similar happened, the breakdowns of this type are sporadic, he added.
According to Sona Holingerová Hendrychová, the spokesperson for ČEZ for the northern Czech Republic, electricity supplies were not cut, and the fire at the electricity substation did not affect the operation of homes, offices or businesses.
A.s. Čeps působí in the territory of the Czech Republic as exclusive maintainer of the distribution system, of the electrical conduction of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It keeps in good condition, renews and develops 39 switch boxes with 67 transformers, which carry the electric power from the transmission system to the distribution system, and also maintains the electric drive of 4339 kilometers long.
Jančura submits a slanderous complaint to three ČSSD hetmans
The owner of Student Agency Radim Jančura today will present a slanderous complaint to three Social-Democrat Hetmans.
These are Michal Hašek of the Jihomoravský Kraj region, Radko Martínek of Pardubický Kraj and the Olomoucký Kraj Hetman Martin Tesařík.
Jančura mentioned it in twenty minutes on Radiožurnál.
Demand has to do with the company's effort to maintain regional rail transport in some regions.
All regions, however, ended up signing long-term contracts with České dráhy.
All three hetmans are attacking us and talking about the fact that we're "taking the cake raisins," yet we only brought the offer for what they wanted.
They say that we are more expensive than České dráhy, which is not true. We know the prices of České dráhy, which were set last week.
So we have nothing left but to defend ourselves.
It is because of slander towards the Student Agency society, he said for Radiožurnál Jančura.
He mentioned at the same time that he had the proofs of all the regions, according to him they had not taken the necessary measures in harmony with European law.
That is why it is preparing an incentive for the European Commission.
Hašek considers this complaint for the continuation of Mr Jančura's media show, which serves as free advertising for his company and for himself.
Naturally I am prepared to defend my good reputation and that of my region and I appeal to the other Hetmans to do so too.
I suppose, that also on this occasion it will be clearly demonstrated, that Mr Jančura manipulates the public in the matter of regional rail transport, and uses false and false arguments, said Hašek.
Jančura announced last week that he would invest several million kroner in advertising, whose goal would be to warn of these measures in the regions.
Radiožurnál told him that he would interrupt the campaign after Christmas and wants to continue it after the New Year.
He said the campaign will be carried out against corruption as such.
Jančura started the campaign after the regions agreed with České dráhy to maintain regional rail links and for the commission of approximately 150 billion crowns did not call a tender.
According to Jančura, similar steps disagree with the law and the opinion of the European Court.
Jančura claims to have been threatened by a Member of ČSSD due to his criticism of rail transport in the regions.
The only threat was, if we don't leave it, we can lose the bus licenses.
He presented himself as deputy of ČSSD, I know, which gentleman it is, I will not say his name, said Jančura today for Radiožurnál.
The pneumococal vaccine will be free and voluntary
The pneumococcal vaccine from January will put an end to the usual customs.
As the first vaccine should be free for families and at the same time voluntary.
However, there are already opinions that the mandatory vaccine would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of the free pneumococcal vaccine are complete.
The Institute for Medicinal Products is already setting the maximum prices for vaccines, which will be covered by insurance companies.
Experts have already made this clear in the vaccination procedure.
The new vaccine
Free vaccines for children born in August
From January onwards, children born since 2 August last year may receive free pneumococcal vaccine.
The condition is that you have not received a dose of the vaccine before.
Those who started the vaccine last year or before, have to cover other doses of the vaccine as well.
The first dose of the vaccine must be received between the third and fifth month of age of the child.
Last year, a quarter of the families voluntarily let their children be vaccinated against pneumococcus.
However, parents paid for a dose of 1600 crowns and more.
Four doses are needed to vaccinate younger children.
Experts generally estimate that insurance companies will spend on vaccines from 300 to 450 thousand kroner annually.
Without clutch they will save on treatment, which is needed for unvaccinated children.
So far, the state has spent about 500,000 annually on all child vaccinations.
Covered vaccination was initiated by the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococcus is the cause of otitis media, but also of serious infections including meningitis and septicaemia.
Of the pneumococcal infections in our country every year, 28 children under the age of 10 die according to hospital investigations.
In addition to the Czech Republic, the pneumococcal vaccine cover in children was introduced in approximately 40 countries.
Is the vaccine mandatory?
However, opinions appear at the same time, that this vaccine could be mandatory in the future.
From January it must be covered by insurance and voluntary companies.
The mandatory vaccine would be better, for example Rudolf Kalovský, the head of the civic association Nahlas, said.
Its association has been spreading pneumococcal vaccines for a long time.
The experts at an international conference, in which our association participated, were not completely satisfied with the fact that we have the voluntary vaccine.
It's not entirely ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy to achieve at least this.
I think this is the way we have to go now, Kalovský mentioned.
The Ministry of Health, however, does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococcus.
At this moment we do not think at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň.
Voluntary vaccine has its disadvantages, doctors say
The president of the pediatrician society Odborná společnost praktických dětských lékařů Hana Cabrnochová acknowledges that the voluntary vaccine has its disadvantages.
If all children would receive the vaccine, you can reason about the reduction in the number of doses. "In the situation, when the vaccine costs so much, we relatively understand the political decision to have started the vaccination as a volunteer," says Cabrnochová.
Experts expect that from next year more than 80 percent of young parents will let their babies get pneumococcal vaccinations.
Pneumococal vaccine is a big change also because as the first vaccination in children is covered by health companies, not by the state.
Insurance companies should spend more money on prophylaxis, to save later on treatment, Cabrnochová explains.
Doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves.
However, pediatricians are concerned about the purchase of vaccines.
Previously, vaccines had to be bought by insurance companies and distributed to doctors, just like when the state gives them other vaccines.
Some MPs were afraid, however, that insurance companies could "take out the money from health insurance."
That's why doctors will have to buy the vaccines and wait until they're paid for by the insurance companies.
It is estimated that pediatricians will invest in vaccines 40,000 a month, which is a remarkable sum.
It won't be easy at all, Cabrnochová says.
The son of an American artist involved "in the theft of a museum"
The son of renowned American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta has been accused of trying to steal paintings valued at 20 million US dollars (12 million pounds) from his father's museum.
Pennsylvania police claim that Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught while carrying 90 frames in his vehicle and trailer.
They claim that Frazetta and another man used an excavator to break into the museum, in the Pocono Mountains region.
Frazetta father, 81, is famous for his portrayal of such characters as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
The Associated Press news agency reported that the artist was in Florida at the time of the incident.
AP reported that an unidentified police officer claimed that a family dispute might have motivated young Frazetta.
The agency reported that Frazatta son, 52, told the police that his father had ordered him to "enter the museum by any means to move all the paintings to a warehouse."
The agency said that Frazetta father refused to grant such permission.
Labour Party Defends Tax Increases in Budget
Ministers have defended tax increases and cutbacks in the pre-budget report, in the face of criticism from the opposition, businesses and trade unions.
The Conservatives said Alistair Darling "lost" an opportunity to show his seriousness about the deficit cut, delaying decisions until after the election.
The Minister of Finance also received harsh criticism for harming low- and middle-income workers.
Among its main proposals are a 0.5 % increase in social security expenditure and a 1 % ceiling in public sector wage agreements from 2011.
Cholera for Social Security
Trade unions have regretted that low-wage workers are punished with a recession generated by others, and warned about future "problems".
The increase in social security spending, which will grow by about £3 billion a year, has enraged the business community, which claims that this is a job tax, when the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase, limited to those earning more than £20,000 per year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
KEY POINTS OF THE PREVIOUS BUDGET REPORT
Social security with an additional 0.5 % increase from April 2011
Economy will contract more than expected 4.75 % this year
New 50% tax on bankers' bonds
The 1-point increase in corporation tax for small firms was ruled out
Tax exemptions for electric cars and wind turbines
State pension would increase by 2.5%
According to estimates by the Ministry of Finance, a person who earns £30,000 will lose £90 a year and a person who wins £40,000 will lose £190, while a person who earns £10,000 a year will earn £110.
Ministers said their goal of halving the deficit by 2013 involved "hard decisions", but insisted that 60% of the additional tax burden would fall on 5% of the higher wages.
The Minister of Finance, Stephen Timms, denied that tax increases and cut-backs were a "sand grain in the desert" compared to what was needed.
"These are big figures. It will allow us to halve the deficit, which is absolutely essential for the next four years," he told the BBC.
Mr. Timms said he had confidence that the economy would grow again towards the end of the year.
However, the Labour Party's forecasts of future economic growth, which will affect the amount to be borrowed and the speed with which the deficit will be reduced, have been questioned after the Finance Minister was forced to change the first figures.
In his statement, he stated that the economy would probably contract by 4.75 % this year, much worse than the fall of 3.5% forecast in April, while the demand for loans would be £3 billion above the previously estimated.
"Squandered opportunity"
The Conservatives, who will launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday, warning about the "debt crisis" of the Labour Party, said that the projected demand for £789 billion for the next six years was unsustainable.
Ministers had failed to present a credible plan on how they would return the money, adding, avoiding "cynically" the difficult options until after the elections to be held in June 2010.
"They have included nothing significant about what they will do," said the Minister in the shadow of the Ministry of Finance, Philip Hammond. "They had the opportunity to do so and they have wasted it."
"All major announcements will be made after the election, win whoever wins"
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
The Labour Party insists that schools, hospitals and the police be protected from future cuts, unlike conservative proposals, which would seek to further reduce the deficit in the shorter term.
But the Liberal Democrats claimed that the money raised by tax increases and spending cuts would be used to support next year's spending, not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the projects were like "stones of sand."
The BBC political editor, Nick Robinson, said that the time chosen for the announcements, such as the increase in inflation of some disability subsidies in April, mentioned above, would leave the Minister of Finance exposed to accusations of electoral maneuvers, as the money could simply be recovered the following year.
However, the Labour Party insists that more people are being provided with it and the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"Fake budget"
Although ministers did not publish post-2011 expenditure data, economists said it was clear that the adjustment of public spending would only be felt in the medium term.
The respected Institute of Fiscal Studies said that the figures of the Minister of Finance implied substantial cuts in many areas, potentially including in the future transport, higher education, science and defence.
"This is really postponing the pain for later," said its director, Robert Chote.
"All major ads will come after the election, win whoever wins," added Roger Bootle, economic consultant for Deloitte's accountants.
"This has been the false report before the budget. Markets realize this."
FBI investigates "American arrests in Pakistan"
The FBI is investigating the arrest in Pakistan of five American men suspected of extremist connections.
The US Embassy in Pakistan told the BBC that the men were arrested in a raid on a house in Sarghoda, in the eastern province of Punjab.
The FBI said it's investigating whether they're the same men who disappeared from their homes in Virginia State, USA, last month.
The U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs said he was also looking for information about men.
It is reported that three of them are of Pakistani descent, one of Egyptian heritage and the other of Yemeni origin.
"If they are American citizens, of course we will be very interested in the charges for which they have been arrested and in what circumstances they are being held," said spokesman Ian Kelly.
The FBI spokesman, Katherine Schweit, said the agency was aware of the arrests and that it was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identities and the nature of their business there, if in fact these are the students who were missing," the spokesman said.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washington said that the men were arrested in a house belonging to one of their uncles.
He said that the house was already in the hands of the local police and that no charges had yet been brought against the detainees.
Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton refused to comment on the arrests, the news agency Reuters reported; but she said that the US had to "work more closely with both Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to eradicate the terrorist infrastructure that continues to recruit and train people."
The families of the five students reported his disappearance in North Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty International condemns Iranian "abuses"
Human rights in Iran over the past 20 years have always been equally deficient, according to a report by the Amnesty International campaign group.
The report details "models of abuse" of the regime, before and after the presidential elections held in June.
One man quoted in the report said he had been beaten and burned with cigarettes, another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran has rejected previous criticisms of its human rights record.
Officials have said that such criticisms have a political basis.
Thousands of people arrested and dozens killed in Iran after President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's election provoked the biggest street protests since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens of people have been convicted, and prosecutors claim that at least five people have been sentenced to death.
The BBC correspondent in Tehran, Jon Leyne, who is now in London, says that during the protests, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Jamenei, acknowledged some allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention centre.
But since then, the authorities have shown very little tolerance for criticism, according to our correspondent.
"False Confession"
Amnesty International quoted the story of Ebrahim Mehtari, a 26-year-old computer student, who claimed that he was accused of "working with Facebook networks" and protesting against the election results.
"They often hit me in the face" according to his words.
"They burned me with cigarettes under my eyes, neck, head... they threatened to execute me and humiliated me."
Amnesty said that after five days he signed a false confession and was released and left on the street, still bleeding and semiconscious.
In August, the defeated presidential candidate, Mehdi Karroubi, said that some protesters detained after the election had been tortured to death in prison, and others had been raped.
Iranian officials denied allegations of rape, but admitted that there had been abuse.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee, who claimed that he was held in a container together with 75 other persons for more than eight weeks in a detention centre in Kahrizak.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and the judiciary had established committees to investigate the discomfort of the post-election and the government's response, but said that the mandate and powers of the agencies were confusing and the investigations of the parliamentary committee had not been made public.
The group said that at least 90 people had been arrested in the last three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
A ski slope was made in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn a Bristol site of interest into a competition track.
The track at the Park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who competed for cash prizes.
At the top of the slope in Brandon Hill Park there was a short jump ramp, opposite a 100-meter long track.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said that there was a beautiful view from the top of the track, but that it was pretty scary.
It looks under a beautiful view of the lights of the city sparkling.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the county, true talent," he added.
The awards were given to the best tricks or maneuvers performed on the track.
After Thursday afternoon's event, the snow will melt.
Still them and us.
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters have called for a ban on the construction of minarets and there is a widespread warning about the supposed Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, has written a detailed and studied report on the possible integration of Muslims (who are actually integrating) into one of the most openly secular societies on the continent.
Some readers will come to this new book as admirers of the author's latest work "Why the French do not like veils" ("Why the French Don't Like Headcarves") (2006), an elegant and detailed study of a problem that divided and worried the country for a decade and a half, and whose effects are still perceived today.
Mr Bowen's last book has a broader and more ambitious perspective.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media are saying about Islam in France, but what is really happening.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide the 5-6 million Muslims in France with what Mr. Bowen calls "Islamic spaces".
He is a good listener who reproduces debates between teachers and students about the questions they are most interested in.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or a town hall (or both)?
Should young Muslims be taught about the evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it legitimate for a Muslim to use an interest-based banking system to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly mundane issues, he says, things of daily life, that worry the media more than political dramas.
The author identifies a new generation of magnets, teachers and intellectuals, none of whom are renowned, with the possible exception of Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim scholar and scholar born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They cannot fully spread this argument.
Conservatives doubt only the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists Mr. Bowen interviews tend to disagree with his Salafi counterparts, supporters of the purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia, who currently have a small but influential presence among the Muslims of Europe.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But adaptation requires mutual concessions.
He questions the extent to which French political strategists (and the intellectual elite who so fiercely defend secularism) are truly committed to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims are probably treated more unjustly than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who have also had to make their historic commitments to secular republicanism.
More than a growing pragmatism, he perceives "an adjustment of values."
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one tends to say "Yes, but not yet."
The world's most desolating panorama
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other habitat on the planet.
The ice that defines it is melting at an alarming speed, taking with it life that cannot survive anywhere else.
The interests of oil, gas, transport and fishing have been focused on recently opened waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now authors, as a result.
In "On Thin Ice" Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, paints a natural story of the northern icon, the polar bear.
Knowing the complicated history and policy of whale hunting, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers, who gave evidence of value in confronting the white bear.
Admiral Nelson's encounter as a brave 14-year-old cadet, fighting only with the end of his musket, is surely a myth, but others are true.
The young, caught swimming following the bodies of their newly exterminated mothers, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
A circus presentation in the early 20th century, exhibited 75 polar bears at the same time.
Even today, zoo enclosures are usually one millionth of the area of a wild adult's area. The climate is almost never adequate: a polar bear resident in Singapore got green by the algae growing within the hairless areas of his fur.

Ellis resorts to stories from other writers and historians, and often returns to the threat that hunters pose to the survival of the species.
Although prohibited in Norway, the US and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where helicopter hunters and snowmobile eskimo Indians use high-powered assault rifles to take down their prey.
Ironically, it is in the waters north of those two hunting nations where the ice will last longer.
In his new book, "After the Ice", Alum Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and chilling account of Arctic science and an overwhelming look at how the future of that place can be transformed.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of changes.
It's not for lack of commitment.
Fridtjof Nansen's pioneering journeys in the late 19th and early 20th centuries showed signs for the first time about the displacement of ice masses.
Then the cold war submarines drew a map of the moving ice ropes circulating beneath the ice masses.
Satellite explorations and extensive series of probes mounted on the icebergs are a useful supplement, but hard-wearing individuals camped in the cold still perform many tasks.
Mr. Anderson looks inside the extraordinary, tiny world of the tributary system inside the Arctic ice, formed by jets of saline water that is compressed while frozen.
But from the bear on the surface to the microscopic wonders of the interior, they are all doomed once the summer ice withdraws, what is believed to happen sometime between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months... these could be us.
Marines among the 6,000 who place crowns in Arlington's graves
Pfc. De'Angello Robinson, 19, traveled seven hours by bus to place a single crown in the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who traveled from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, N.C., to the Arlington National Cemetery to decorate tombs, it was a day to pay tribute to men and women who once stood in their boots.
In a few months, from where we are being boarded, these could be us, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If it's us, I'd want someone to do the same for me, so I'm just trying to show respect.
He was one of over 6,000 volunteers who met on Saturday morning to place crowns in the graves of veterans in various sections of the Arlington Cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, the owner of the Worcester Crown Company in Harrington, Maine, started the event when he and others decided to decorate several hundred graves at the Arlington Cemetery.
In what is already an 18-year-old tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen make the trip every year stopping in different cities along the way, to host events dedicated to military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America, which has extended the event to other states.
This year the volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns in the tombs of the Arlington Cemetery, areas on the Pentagon, tombs in the Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, the Battery Park in New York City and on the United Airlines Flight 93 memorial site in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 to buy and transport crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said he made the trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, a late military career.
As long as her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said this was his way of giving a retribution to those who made sacrifices.
This is a modest way in which civilians can support our troops, he said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Wrapped in layers of warm clothing, the volunteers walked through the vast meadows and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers went to the oldest graves of World War I, World War II, and the Vietnam War, because they do not receive as many visits as the new graves, the organizers said.
The atmosphere was cheerful as the children played and the couples held hands, while they carried the fresh pine to the tombstones.
Each circular crown was of a deep green, with a small red loop tied at the top.
Near there, Section 60, where most of the war veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, remained virtually silent.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 crowns to decorate the section, but the gloomy atmosphere of the current wars invaded the area.
People wept openly, others prayed, and families and friends leaned on each other in the glacial air.
Some read aloud names carved into the stones, while others leaned to see small white and black plates placed inside the wet mud, for those whose tombstones have not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who would wipe the tears out of her eyes in front of her son's grave.
He drove eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the grave of Marine Gunnery Sgt. David Shane Spicer, who died in combat in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free. . my son paid for it, he said.
"A long time after my death I want someone to remember."
Cuban officials arrested a U.S. government contractor
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. government contractor who was distributing mobile phones and laptops in the country, State Department officials said on Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc, based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for clients such as the United States Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officers along with the U.S. Interests Section in Havana are seeking access to the detainee, who was arrested on 5 December.
Specific charges have not been made public, although according to Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor may be detained for almost anything considered "dangerous".
All activities called counter-revolutionary, including mild protests and critical writings, entail the risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has an incipient blogger community, led by popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are followed and harassed by government agents.
Sánchez has requested on several occasions permission to leave the country to accept prizes, but the permission has been refused.
The arrest of an American contractor may probably cause tensions between the Castro brothers' communist government in Cuba and the Obama administration, which has been seeking a "slow-paced" approach to improve relations with the island.
The New York Times was the first to announce the arrest news on Friday night.
The new US policy emphasizes that if the Cuban government takes concrete measures, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more space for opposition, there will be reciprocity on the part of the United States.
Mobiles and laptops are legal in Cuba, even if they are new and coveted products in a country where the average salary of a government worker is $15 per month.
The Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones only this year; they are mainly used for text messages, as a 15-minute telephone conversation would cost the daily wage.
Internet use is extremely limited on the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and for foreign visitors to the hotel, and in some government establishment, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect often have to give their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The arrest of an American in Cuba is unusual.
Gloria Berbena, press officer at the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, said that most of the handful of U.S. citizens in prison in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking.
Berbena said she couldn't provide any more information about the arrest.
Arrest and detention are clearly wrong.
An activity that in any other open society would be legal, like distributing mobiles for free, in Cuba is a crime, said José Miguel Vivanco, director of the Americas program of the organization Human Rights Watch, who recently published a hard report on freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, same Cuba", a reference to the site of Raúl Castro as leader of the country, to replace his sick older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said the defendants are often arrested, prosecuted and imprisoned in one day.
He stated that any solution would probably be political, and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just when the two countries begin to have more dialogue.
Pakistani officials plot to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities neutralized the alleged brain of a plot to send five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill American troops, saying they expect the case to help unravel an extensive network of terrorist recruiters, who are running the Internet in search of radicalized youth.
The investigators said they were chasing a mysterious insurgent figure, known as Saifullah, who invited men to Pakistan after discovering that one of them made comments approving terrorist attacks on the YouTube Internet video site.
Saifullah directed the men once they were in Pakistan, trying to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan's tribal belt, which is a familiar place for the Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence officer who had been informed about the case, said Saturday that Saifullah could not convince al Qaeda commanders that the men were not part of a CIA plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
They were therefore isolated for several days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the imposing northwest mountains, which have become a terrorist paradise.
They were considered part of a covert operation.
For this reason they were rejected, the official said, who spoke from anonymity due to the delicacy of the case.
The official said that the men did not mutate and were even trying to get proper approval to access the al Qaeda camps, when Pakistani police authorities arrested them.
The case of the five men, who remain in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI, underlines the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and, perhaps more importantly, determine who they are trusted.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, U.S. intelligence has prioritized trying to infiltrate people inside the Qaeda.
The recruiters of the organization act as guards, not letting go of those who do not show a serious commitment to the holy war, and those who might be spies.
Analysts said that al Qaeda analyses aspiring American recruits with special attention.
But for the organization they represent an enormous attraction, due to their potential to have access to American goals and due to their propaganda value.
But Evan Kohlmann, senior analyst for the US-based NEFA Foundation, said that terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in recent years about those who admit, because US intelligence agencies have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you are trying to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way than to follow the recruitment model than so many have already followed? Kohlmann said.
It has become a much more web-based model.
Tens of thousands protest in Copenhagen, demand climate "action"
On Saturday tens of thousands of protesters marched here on the streets demanding negotiators working at the city's Bella Center Convention Center, bolder actions for the climate.
The protesters said that 100,000 people participated in the event, but the police estimated that the amount was closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists placed small explosives near a group of government buildings in the city centre.
On a day when little happened in the UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists walked around the city holding banners in English saying "There is no planet B" and one in Spanish saying, "The Earth says "that's enough."
Several celebrities joined the protest, including the Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that Peru's journeys, her mother's home country, made me aware of the distressing issues that the country must deal with because of the impacts of the climate changes that are already happening. "
This is part of the reason why I have decided to join the great demonstration, to spread the word and appeal to the world's leaders, to present a just, ambitious and binding agreement, he said.
This is not an easy task, but it has to be done, there is no way to avoid it any longer.
Police prevented protesters from getting too close to the Bella Center, and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly because of the use of masks or by carrying pocket knives.
Under Danish law, such activities are prohibited during demonstrations.
According to one witness, who asked not to be identified because he was involved in the climate talks, activists wearing sports masks and black suits placed several explosives near the Copenhagen main canal, which is close to several ministries.
They were by the buildings, he said, adding that they started as flares, but were followed by "a couple of large explosions."
Within the convention center, people gathered around the TV screens to watch the march throughout the afternoon.
But the protest did not seem to penetrate the consciousness of key officials like Su Wei, China's chief climate negotiator.
When asked if he thought that the demonstration was having a constructive impact on international discussions, he replied in English, "I really wasn't aware of the situation."
Then he kept saying in Mandarin, "As the meeting place is large, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He noted that it depended on each individual's perspective to define whether the march was harmful or beneficial.
He said that this shows the attention of the general public and different sectors to the issue of climate change.
On the other hand, "it can also be said to affect the negotiations, or the freedom of other people.
Evidence reveals persistent racial differences
Last week's Federal Qualifications Book on Performance in Mathematics was very good news for the public schools of the Capital District.
Although the District is still far from the country's best-performing systems, the rating book showed that fourth and eighth graders have been beating at a faster pace over the past two years, compared to the cities of Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what is recorded in the recent figures of the National Assessment of Educational Progress is the persistent performance gap between African-American students and white students, both locally and nationally.
The average scores of fourth-degree white students in D.C. over the past two years have grown from 262 to 270 (on a 500 scale), but their African-American peers have increased by only three points, from 209 to 212.
In fact, the performance gap grew between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of African Americans in the eighth grade remained essentially fixed, lowering a statistically insignificant point from 245 to 244.
The average white scores were not included in the test results, because the sample size was not large enough.
Over a six-year extension, the picture is no longer encouraging.
The difference between white and black fourth grade students in 2003, when the first ENPE was released in the District, was 60 points on the scale (262 to 202).
Although the scores achieved by children in both groups increased during this period, the difference has narrowed to just 58.
Some education lawyers in the district expressed concern last week, as the advances celebrated by Rector Michelle A. El Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democratic), were largely driven by white students, who are already very good students.
This would suggest that we have improved the whole by addressing those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and conflicting, said Jeff Smith, executive director of D.C. Voice, a non-profit organization advocating for educational equity in the District.
I'm not leaping for joy over a difference of two or three points, said D.C. Council member Kwame R. Brown (Dem.-For Accumulation), who has a daughter in the fourth grade of the Eaton Elemental.
Brown, an assiduous critic of Rhee's style of administration, said the message of the test scores is that the city's high schools have a desperate need for attention.
Clearly you always want to see the positive signs, and I respect it.
But what's worrying is that we're not devoting the time or the energy we need for our middle schools.
Rhee said the District needs to continue to find better ways to address the needs of low-performing students.
This fall, for example, some teachers are being trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at students in the upper grades of primary and middle school, who did not master the basics of early reading in their school classes and are considerably behind their peers.
The mathematics of every day, a curriculum of mathematics from kindergarten to sixth grade, which emphasizes games and experiences of real life, which was introduced in the District under former Superintendent Clifford Janey, who is credited with some of the progress reported by ENPE last week.
I just think we need to keep working to offer the best interventions to those students who are below the grade level, Rhee said.
Others say that the ENPE results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to increase the overall performance of the system and yet provide additional money and resources for low-performance schools, which will be needed to narrow the gap.
Here's some sort of scathing dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California in Berkeley, who studies urban test scores.
The solution of conventional policy is to allocate its resources and administrative reforms to schools located in the poorest sections of the D.C.
Then the goal can generate political repercussions that run counter to that important timeline.
But the problem, of course, is that, like other urban overseers, she tries to cling to the white and black middle class.
Our focus is on ensuring that we build a system of excellent schools.
We need to strengthen our neighbourhood schools so that all families, regardless of where they live, have confidence that their children will have access to excellent public education.
Janey, now superintendent of Newark schools, said in an interview this week that an essential element to end the performance gap is to extend the year of traditional public school, currently 180 days in the District, to compete with autonomous schools.
It is necessary to reach almost 200 days to have the force of change, said Janey, who reached an agreement with his teachers' union last year in a year of 185 days, which he considers to be a "indicator" to seek a greater increase in the next agreement.
Making higher education a part of the future
The tourist bus arrived at the University of Gettysburg with a strong resolution.
Graciela Rodríguez, 12, came down and blinked for a moment before the white columns, brick facades and emerald meadows.
Graciela's parents had barely graduated from a high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
Still, when she and the other eighth graders in the group explored Gettysburg, where tuition costs $38,690 a year, her attitude was less than that of impressed guests than that of enthusiastic potential students.
"This is where I will be!" said Graciela, who would like to study medicine, when the guide announced that they had entered the science building.
Boy, really?," he said thoughtfully, when the guide spoke of the low proportion of school teachers-students.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that the children had visited on their three-day trip, and had already completely absorbed their deliberate message: The question is not whether you are going to go to college.
The question is which one.
Although there is growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States of Hispanic immigrants who drop out of high school or become pregnant in adolescence, there are also hundreds of thousands who access university education that they need to access the middle class.
In fact, one in five of these "second generation" Hispanics graduate from college, a remarkable achievement given that many of their immigrant parents, especially Mexicans and Central Americans, entered the United States without completing high school.
Their success stories are important, researchers say, because they indicate the way forward for a generation that will play a very important role in the country's workforce.
Those who analyze those with higher performance say that they often have a natural affinity for school and an innate tendency to succeed.
Many also have parents who set high targets for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with U.S. schools.
But tutoring programs can also play an exceptional role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her get to college, particularly if efforts are sustained over time.
Observing low-income children, whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, it follows that any intervention at any time will not solve it, said Patricia Gandara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, who has examined Latino students.
We need to think about providing a support network for these children, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that financed the tour of Graciela's universities is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million a year to local school systems to implement university readiness programs, which begin when low-income students are in middle school and continue to finish high school.
Since 1999, the program has helped more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent attending university, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
Iraqi Oil Ministry reaches agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to attract important oil companies to rebuild its fragile infrastructure, during two auctions that ended on Saturday.
The 10 agreements reached by the Iraqi Oil Ministry with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are ready to play a major role in restoring Iraq's oil industry, maimed by decades of war and sanctions.
The American companies moved away having bid on only two of the 10 auctioned deposits.
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only one who submitted an offer lost.
Two U.S. companies reached agreements for substituted deposits in June.
The poor representation of U.S. oil giants in the opening of Iraq's oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of American companies, there are Asians and Europeans at the head, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an online news center.
It'll be a long time before anything else is on offer in Iraq.
The security concerns, accentuated by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability as the US military retreated, probably prevented US oil companies from taking a stronger risk in Iraq, which has the third largest crude oil reserve in the world, analysts said.
U.S. companies were in some cases at a disadvantage, because rivals, particularly Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower labour costs and are more likely to take risks because they do not respond to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc were the only American companies to reach agreements with the ministry.
Major US firms, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have bonded with the Iraqi Oil Ministry and provided technical advice in recent years, have moved away empty-handed.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main protagonists in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The National Oil Corporation, owned by the Chinese state, offered in more contracts than any other company and achieved large investments in contracts for two major deposits.
We know that China is on its way to becoming a major economic and technological power, said the spokesman for the Assam Jihad Oil Ministry.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be in line with its competitors and meet its commitments to Iraq.
The companies selected to submit proposals made offers that were then confronted with the subsidy per barrel that the ministry was willing to pay to increase production above the current levels in each field.
Al Qaeda's main planner has apparently been killed in Pakistan
An alleged U.S. missile attack on the Pakistan border with Afghanistan is believed to have killed a senior al Qaeda operations planner this week, U.S. counter-terrorism officials said on Friday.
If confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack on a high-ranking terrorist leader this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men who was thought to have died on Tuesday when a couple of missiles hit his car near the city of Miran Shah, in North Waziristan province, according to US sources and Pakistani officials in the region.
Local authorities said the missiles were launched by an unidentified CIA-operated aircraft within the illegal tribal zone of Pakistan.
They were driving a white car, heading towards the Afghan border, when the car received the impact, said an official of Pakistan's civilian intelligence agency, speaking on the phone from Miran Shah.
The official said the suspected local militants rushed to the site and quickly confiscated what was left of the "totally destroyed bodies."
Local authorities were unable to verify the identities of the victims, but two U.S. counter-terrorism officials cited unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali was described as a high-ranking al-Qaeda military planner, who led the terrorist group's operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He devoted himself to conspiracy all over the world, said a high official, who spoke from anonymity, citing the delicate nature of American air strikes inside Pakistani territory.
Considering its central role, this probably included conspiracy attacks against the United States and Europe.
He had a strategic guide to the senior command of al Qaeda and translated it into operational patterns for potential terrorist attacks.
The second American official said that Somali had risen rapidly in the ranks of al Qaeda and was well connected with other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be a known name for some Americans, but that does not diminish in any way the threat that posed to us and our allies, the second official said.
If his death is confirmed, Somali would be the second leader of al Qaeda or Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal area, and three other high-ranking agents.
The pace of CIA-led unmanned aircraft attacks has declined since the summer, from an average of about six operations a month to two, according to a count from The Long War Journal, a website run by a non-profit organization.
The decrease is perhaps due to an improved tactic by terrorist groups, which have taken steps to limit their vulnerability while mercilessly killing suspected informants, said the site.
The UN's highest envoy in Kabul about to give up
The highest United Nations envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would resign from his post in March, ending with a tumultuous mandate that was damaged by allegations of widespread corruption in the UN-backed Afghan presidential election.
Eide's exit happens when the Obama administration has decided to send some 30,000 additional U.S. troops to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said he supports the increase, but he is concerned that the U.S. timetable for the military withdrawal that begins in 18 months is prompting other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to speed up the preparation of Afghan security forces and send the right signal to Afghans so that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment has to be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressured the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civil servants, who are cooperating with Afghanistan's political transition.
The increase in the military sector has to be reflected in the civilian sector, he said.
Eide said he was not resigning, but simply fulfilling a promise he made to his family in March 2008, to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to notify the Secretary
UN General Ban Ki-moon, so he had time to find a replacement.
What I said is that you better start looking for a successor, Eide said.
When I got here, there was a two-month gap between my predecessor's exit and my arrival.
Ban has begun to look for a replacement, according to UN officials.
Officials say they have been considering Staffan di Mistura, a Swedish-Italian citizen who recently led the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously led UN peace missions.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was put to the test before his former delegate, Peter W. Galbraith, who accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai in the country's presidential vote and of covering up evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied the incriminations, but said Galbraith's accusations, who was fired, "certainly damaged the mission, because there was already a lot of scepticism about international interference" in the election.
Eide said he proposed the appointment of a senior civilian representative to coordinate United States-led forces' assistance efforts in Afghanistan.
It also boosted UN leadership to allow its successor to hire more personnel from the United States and other Western countries, who lend themselves to the Afghan mission, stating that this would increase their confidence that their money is being used properly.
Eide expressed frustration at the limitations on his powers in Afghanistan, arguing that cumbersome UN recruitment regulations undermine his ability to capture talent.
Such is how the UN rules allowed me to recruit only one person since May, he said.
That's catastrophic and it can't go on.
Gates: Iran to Face Additional Sanctions · Global Voices
Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates said on Friday that the world powers will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran, for its failure to engage in talks about its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, addressing a group of approximately 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq, during a week-long trip to war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, was left with the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There are no good choices in Iran, he said, in response to a soldier's question about the likelihood of such an event.
One of the things that weighs on me is that, if we've learned something from Iraq over the past six years, it's the inherent unpredictability of war.
The Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions targeting Iran's military and political elite, but Gates noted that some sanctions could also affect the Iranian population in general.
He argued that it would be necessary "a package of incentives and disincentives", "to persuade the Iranian government that they would be really less secure with nuclear weapons", because "their people will suffer enormously" the sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders to warn that Iran will face "credible" consequences if its nuclear programme does not fully respect the indications of the UN Security Council and its nuclear control agency, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists that it wants to develop nuclear knowledge only for peaceful purposes.
In talks in Geneva on 1 October, he indicated that he would renegotiate on the restriction of his nuclear programme and would agree to leave a substantial part of his enriched uranium reserve, in exchange for the fuel desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pressed for such an agreement, as a way to build trust between the two parties and gain time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran seems to have strayed from the tentative agreements, in part, say the experts, because the Iranian command is divided in relation to the possibility of engagement with the United States.
Frankly, I believe that Iran's hardening with the international community on some proposals that were actually accepted at the beginning of October has united the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, in a way that they have not been in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, said Gates.
President Obama has set 31 December as the deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals, before reconsidering other options, including continuing with what Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "destroying sanctions."
In a statement made in New York, Iran's mission to the United Nations denounced what it called Thursday "unfounded and baseless accusations" by some members of the Security Council about Iran's nuclear activities, and said it has the will to continue discussions with the United States and five other world powers, "in order to achieve an appropriate, long-term solution."
Gates, who was to return to Washington on Friday morning, met Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki, before flying to the oil-rich Iraqi Kurdish region, to meet with troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
Tensions remain high between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly with regard to borders, property rights and co-participation.
Gates urged both sides to decrease the potential for conflict, to avoid any delay in US projects, to reduce the number of US troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also sought to alleviate Kurdish anxiety about the pending reduction. US officials quoted Gates' words to Massoud Barzani, the president of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We will preserve their security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq.
We will not abandon them."
In an aging China, a change of direction
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that lectured them about the fact that "Mother Earth is too tired to support more children" and "one more baby means one more grave."
They learned the lesson so well that when Shanghai government officials, alarmed by the low birth rate and the aging population of their city, suddenly changed course this summer and began to encourage young couples to have more than one child, their reaction was instantaneous and firm: No way.
We have already given all our time and energy only for a child.
We have nothing left for a second, 31-year-old Wang said, a human resources administrator with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of a single child's policy in China, creating two generations of notoriously lame children, single malcreated children, affectionately nicknamed "little emperors," a demographic crisis is emerging in the country.
The average birth rate has fallen to 1.8 children per couple, compared to six when the policy became effective, according to the Division.
UN demographics, while the number of residents aged 60 and over is expected to exploit from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent by 2050. This is well above the global average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is worse in rich coastal cities with highly cultivated populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for almost 22 percent of Shanghai's registered residents, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai Family Planning and Municipal Population Commission, said that fertile couples must have babies to "help reduce the proportion of the ageing population and alleviate a future shortage of labour."
Shanghai is about to be "as old (not as rich, however) as developed countries like Japan and Sweden," he said.
Gradual relief
Drafted in the constitution of the country in 1978, the policy of a single son of China is possibly the most controversial mandate introduced to date by the Communist Party.
Couples who violate politics face huge fines, up to three times their annual salary in some areas, and labour discrimination.
Chinese officials have endorsed the policy for their contribution to avoiding critical pressure on their natural resources, while human rights defenders have denounced abuses in the imposition of the policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women with a second child to undergo abortions.
In addition, many couples have performed abortions according to the sex of the fetus, leading to an unnaturally high male-female ratio.
In recent years, population officials have gradually softened their position on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they allowed more exceptions to the rule, including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and wife are single children, and in 2007 they attenuated many of their hardline slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Demographic Research at the University of Beijing, said that central government officials have recently been debating even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the spouses is a single child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Almost at night in the morning, posters ordering families to have only one child were replaced by copies of regulations detailing who would be suitable for having a second child and how to apply for a permit.
The city government sent family planning officials and volunteers to visit couples in their homes and slide brochures under the doors.
It has also promised to provide emotional and financial guidance to those who have chosen to have more than one child.
Family planning officials say the response has been very little overwhelming.
Disappointing response
Although officials in a rural town on the outskirts of Shanghai maintain that they have seen a moderate increase in requests for couples who want a second child after the launch of the campaign, the more urban districts do not indicate any change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, is still receiving only four to five applications per month.
The disappointed Shanghai officials say that, despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected to reach only around 165,000, slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the Caolu Municipality's family planning committee in Shanghai, said financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people don't want children anymore.
They want to give their first child the best, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and are legally qualified to do so.
But like many Chinese, they only have insufficient health and life insurance provided by the government.
Without a social protection network, they argue, that option would be irresponsible.
People in the West incorrectly see the one-child policy as a matter of rights, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the first child of the couple.
Yeah, they're robbing us of the possibility of having more than one child.
But the problem is not just a political issue.
It's the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for their doubts.
Wang, the human resources manager, said he wants an only child because she too was: "We were the center of our families and we were used to everyone taking care of us.
We are not used to caring for others and we really don't want to care for others. "
Chen Zijian, 42 years old, owner of a translation agency, explained it more forcefully.
For parents with two middle-class careers, who reduce the birth rate, he said, it's about having enough success to be selfish.
People between the ages of 20 and 30 grew up watching their parents' struggle during the first days of China's experiment with capitalism and do not want that kind of life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child takes a lot of time from parents, he said.
A mother has to give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are questions of space, "they have to remodel their apartment," and the strategic "must have a curriculum prepared for the best day care centers when the child is 9 months old."
Most of his friends are willing to face this once, Chen said, but not two.
Ours is the first generation with the highest standard of living, he said.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
A UN group outlines a plan to reduce emissions
The UN-sponsored climate conference, characterized so far by challenging positions and mutual recriminations, caught renewed attention on Friday with the release of a document that foresees ambitious greenhouse gas reductions over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations carrying most of the burden on their shoulders in the short term.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles and highlighted the way forward.
But it was seen as an important step forward in a negotiation that is running out of time, with more than 100 world leaders arriving in Copenhagen next week.
Prepared by an ad hoc UN working group, the text does not talk about how much money rich countries would give to the poor to face global warming in the short and long term.
And this offers a variety of options for key questions, including how developed economies and major emerging economies would cut their coal production, and what would be the limit of the overall temperature increase that political strategists would be willing to tolerate.
This gives a lot of flexibility to the process, said John Coequyt, senior representative in Washington for the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted the six-page paper, summarized a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the UN's top climate official, Yvo de Bóer, described as "the great panorama."
It shows the profiles for a possible agreement, in which industrialized nations would collectively cut their emissions by 2020 by 25 to 45 per cent, compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 per cent during the same period.
Together, countries would cut emissions by between 50 and 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union also stimulated the talks on Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion annually over the next three years to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change, from floods and droughts to deforestation.
However, Friday presented the same kind of verbal fireworks that dominated the talks last week.
The US Special Climate Envoy, Todd Stern, rejected claims requesting mandatory greenhouse gas emission reductions for industrialized countries, compared to volunteers from major emerging economies, if not funded by the developed world.
The maneuver indicated that the Obama administration is adopting a tougher line with China, with respect to what Bush administration officials did just two years ago.
The United States will not make an agreement without major developing countries moving forward and taking action, Stern said, who also regretted that the text did not do enough to ensure that cuts could be verified by external observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after the Chinese Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs He Yafei, said that the top climate negotiator in the United States lacked "common sense," or was "very irresponsible" for saying earlier this week that the United States would not help China economically to cope with global warming.
With the future economic trajectory of the world's major powers at stake, fault lines have erupted both within the developing world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is both to save individual economies and to save the planet, with China and the United States facing their respective obligations, while the poorest nations insist that the twenty-four most influential countries in the world are ignoring the scientific imperative to take the most courageous action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said it is not surprising that the major powers are discussing who should cost the costs to limit greenhouse gases, even though vulnerable countries have become more aggressive in seeking to hold the major emitters responsible for their actions.
This is clearly a game where a new economic hegemony is developing, Ulate said, who also works as a regional climate change adviser for International Conservation in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change indicated that they would continue to press for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most of the main participants say that the talks will produce a political agreement at most.
The 43-member Alliance of Small Island States prepared a 24-page preliminary treaty proposal early in the morning of Friday.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who leads international climate negotiations on behalf of the European Commission, said that the push of small island nations has "put political pressure on the entire political process," in part because they are now unified and demand the action of emerging economies, such as China and India.
The talks assumed a new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that they must resolve most of the exceptional issues before the heads of government can close a deal.
High-level officials, such as Indian Minister of Environment Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Deputy Minister, descended from the planes and ran into the corridors of the Bella Center, closed-door meetings and press conferences, in order to be able to delimit the claims that will be arbitrated during the next week.
The absolute disorder of the meeting (where 13,000 people come in and out of the convention center every day, the activists who play the guitar present night shows mocking the countries they say are selling, and preliminary proposals are passed hand-in-hand instead of via email), poses a challenge.
The intensity only builds: almost all the key ministers are here right now, and on Wednesday 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the major leagues, said Carlos Manuel Rodríguez, vice president for the global policy of International Conservation.
Heavy weights are coming.
Britain's first 225 km/h train redefines Monday's feeling
At 5.13 a.m. on Monday morning, a whistle will pierce the darkness to signal a train departure that marks a revolution for Britain's travel.
The country's first high-speed long-distance train will reach 225 km/h, when it passes like lightning from Ashford, Kent, to St Panrcas station in London, covering 93 kilometers in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Secretary of Transport, will then be joined by Lady Kelly Holmes, aboard the first Javelin intercity service outside London.
He hopes that the new service will finally connect Britain to an international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the major conurbations of the Midlands, North and Scotland to London.
Neglected remote areas would become prosperous suburbs, business travel times would be shortened and the shift of aircraft and cars to the railway would reduce national coal emissions, as well as ease congestion on roads.
In theory, the three main political parties believe in this vision.
But the tens of billions of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable battle of planning and fears about environmental damage, can still slow Britain's high-speed lines.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to provide the government with a feasibility study, will deliver its report to Lord Adonis on December 30, according to the Times.
This will provide you with a detailed itinerary of the next planned stage for the high-speed network.
The new line linking London to the Midlands of the West will be drawn within a five-metre radius in urban areas and areas where the environmental impact may be controversial.
In rural areas, the plan will be drawn within a radius of 25 metres of a definitive route.
It is also expected that HS2 will establish three options for a wider high-speed network heading north.
Lord Adonis will answer in spring.
The preferred option being proposed is a Y-shaped configuration, in which a single high-speed line would reach the Midlands of the West.
The line would be divided into or near Birmingham, with a branch heading west from the Penins to Manchester and Scotland, and another to the northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would enter Scotland.
"It seems that this will be the most beneficial option," said a member of the railway.
Once completed, travel times between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours and 40 minutes.
The first stage, which would not be inaugurated before 2025, would allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to just over an hour today.
The proposals would allow trains to travel at 402 km/h, making the British network the fastest in Europe.
The initial track is being designed to withstand trains of 400 meters in length, capable of transporting 1,100 people.
At least 18 trains could operate every hour on a London-Birmingham line.
This means that you would need a London terminal capable of receiving 20,000 passengers per hour.
Considering the space constraints of the capital, it is expected that an existing station will be expanded to fit the high-speed network.
Experts from the railway industry argue that only St Pancras International or Euston stations offer that potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether he believes the scheme should proceed, but broad public consultation and planning procedures mean that no final decision will be taken until after a general election.
Even if it starts the work, the network would have to be built into sections.
Trains would initially be forced to leave fast lines along existing lanes north of Birmingham, keeping travel times between London and Scotland above three hours.
This is seen as the crucial point necessary to ensure a change of aircraft to trains, a point of reference for the railway revolution.
Taxpayers face the mortgage for an orange of £75,000 from a Conservative
Alan Duncan, the spokesman for the Conservative Party, charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orange tree that he built in the house of his electoral district.
The party's prison spokesman, who was degraded by David Cameron for complaining that deputies were living "of rations", increased his mortgage by £75,000 to build an extension framed in oak in his second home in Rutland.
They allowed the taxpayer to charge the additional interest, adding hundreds of pounds a month.
The authorities of the House of Commons approved the applications at the time and have not been consulted by Sir Thomas Legg, who is conducting a review of the expenses of the members. Last night Mr Duncan said that the applications "cannot be clearer or simpler".
Mr. Duncan, one of the richest Members of Parliament, owns a two-storey house in a village in his electoral district of Rutland and Melton.
The nearby houses have been sold for almost a million pounds.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the fee office agreed that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year he added a greenhouse to the house, described in the plans as an "orange".
Neighbors described it as "a greenhouse for entertainment."
Mr. Duncan was not asked to make any reference to the increase in the loan during a recent investigation by the Committee on Standards and Privileges of the House of Commons into its previous mortgage agreements.
Last month the committee acquitted him of violating the rules, after an investigation of his expenses.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal guarantee for a mortgage of £271,406 from his London property to the house of his electoral district, which he had purchased in 1991, the previous year to become a deputy.
The documents released this week show that Mr. Duncan was requesting approximately £1,400 per month in mortgage interest, until March last year.
In April, your applications increased to over £1,800 per month.
The interest rate on Mr Duncan's Royal Bank of Scotland mortgage did not change at the time, suggesting that the entire increase would finance the loan of £75,000.
The BRE standard variable mortgage rate dropped from 7.94% in December 2007, to 4% in March this year, which is now the case.
The most recent document issued by the authorities of the House of Commons shows that Mr Duncan continued to apply for £1,250 per month in May.
Mr Duncan lost his job as President of the House's opposition in September, after an undercover reporter filmed him saying that the deputies had to survive "from rations" after the expense scandal.
"Basically this is nationalized, you have to live on rations and be treated like m*rda."
He said: "I spend my money in my garden and ask for a small fraction based on what is appropriate.
And I could ask for a lot more, but I don't. "
The deputy, a millionaire for his former profession as an oil trader, was first questioned about his expenses in May, when it turned out that he had requested thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the salary office that this "could be considered excessive."
An activist dug a hole in the shape of the sterling pound symbol on Mr. Duncan's lawn as a protest, after revealing that he applied for £4,000 for three years.
Last night, when asked about the increase in the mortgage, Mr. Duncan said, "It was for primordial improvements, approved both by the salary office and later by Legg."
He added: "It's not about eluding and delinquent or breaking the rules or whatever.
This is absolutely within the limits, according to the rules, authorized and everything.
It could in no way be clearer or simpler."
Come those who have faith, to see the calendar of the advent of the palapa of the beach of Brighton
Brighton's palapas have found a new impetus for the winter months in an interactive Advent calendar.
In addition, an alternative religious group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their palapas for each December day, using carols as their theme.
The event began on December 1, with guests who could see the last palapa from 17.30 to 18.30 every day, with stuffed cakes and free punch.
The carols chosen so far include Vi Tres Barcos, Oh Ven, Oh Ven, Emanuel and The First Christmas, where the palapa presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a Hove TV marketing assistant, is an unpaid clergyman of the diocese of Chichester and the leader of Beyond.
He said: "We want religion to be more relevant to people, in a post-Christian society."
"Why do we as a Church expect people to come to an old strange building? I think the Church should come to people and celebrate in exciting ways.
"The idea of the palapa Advent calendar began as a conversation with some friends during a dinner.
Brighton is an incredibly creative and vibrant place and we are trying to prove and represent that through spirituality."
Massive climate mobilization in Copenhagen and around the world
Tens of thousands of protesters protested this Saturday in demand of an ambitious and binding agreement to fight global warming, around the world and in Copenhagen, where the police arrested several hundred people.
Some 30,000 people, according to the police; hundreds of thousands, according to the organizers, paraded through the frozen Danish capital in demand of an agreement that the United Nations Conference on Climate Change should reach by Friday. It would enter into force on 1 January 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish President of the Climate Conference, the growing mobilization for climate throughout the world, represented by these demonstrations, contributed to the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen being very high.
The incidents erupted shortly after the start of the demonstration in the Danish capital, when a group of 300 people, all dressed in black, broke windows with stoneware and hammers, reported an AFP journalist.
The riot police intervened quickly and firmly.
The police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people in total, according to her, they are especially members of the "Black Blocks", ultra-violent groups that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, east of France, last April.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA) coalition, one of the organizers of the demonstration, denounced the conditions in which hundreds of militants were arrested "without distinctions", stressing that a hundred of them "were immobilized in the street on Saturday night handcuffed and seated despite the intense cold".
The rather peaceful demonstration came out of Parliament and took place at the Bella Center, the site of the negotiations.
Protesters stopped approximately 500 metres from the building without attempting to enter.
A stage was set to welcome guest speakers. Former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, led a candlelight vigil.
Most of the protesters arrived by bus and train from the major European cities, but many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present, as were some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most of them with heavenly showers responded by forming a first concentration in the morning in Copenhagen to the call of Friends of the Earth to form "blue tides" for "justice and climate".
Today we take the streets to ask for compensation for the ecological debt in favor of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, Filipino activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We cannot go on saying: there is time, said Beninese singer Angélique Kidjo.
In Africa, there are rivers that dry up, watercourses that can be walked as never before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, created in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the anti-globalization movement approached environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, an anti-globalisation figure, explained that he came to Copenhagen to "unify climate justice and social justice": "today the fight against global warming does not oppose the fight for another world".
The Asia-Pacific region, which brings together many islands that are very vulnerable to warming, gave the initial kick to the demonstrations.
According to the organizers, some 50,000 people went out on the street in Australia.
In Manila, more than a hundred people, mostly students, paraded in red dresses and wearing handkerchiefs with slogans in favor of solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, as well as in Canada, concentrations of hundreds of protesters were formed demanding strong action against climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the network "350" brought together hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
In Geneva, dozens of people were concentrated.
Separatist Abkhazia elected president, although Georgia denounces "fraud"
This Saturday Abkhazia, Georgia's pro-Russian separatist region recognized by Moscow over a year ago, elected President; however, Tbilisi denounces "fraud".
Some 131,000 people were summoned to participate in the first election after the Russian-Georgian war in August 2008 by the control of South Ossetia, another Georgian separatist region recognized by Russia.
Election tables closed at 5 p.m. GMT.
According to the officials of the Election Commission of Abkhazia, the participation was 58 per cent a few hours before the closure.
The first provisional results would be announced on Saturday night until Sunday.
The five candidates in the race, including outgoing president Sergei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which disapproved of voting.
These elections are a farce.
For his part, the Georgian president, Mikheil Saakachvili, "regrets that Abkhazia has fallen under the total Russian occupation," declared his spokesman, Manana Manjgaladzé.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After his separation from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, which ended with several thousand deaths, Abkhazia attempts to demonstrate through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, our new era as an independent state, declared to AFP Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian, who claimed to have voted for Bagapch.
She was among the voters who addressed the election table at a school in the capital, Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with palm trees at the entrance.
The theme of Russian domination is the central theme of the presidential election in this region with sumptuous landscapes, on the shores of the Black Sea.
Large boards show Bagapch alongside Russian President and Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, in different places in this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, west of the country, the district chief, Beslan Archba, warmly welcomed Russian officials who came to control the development of scrutiny.
At a brief ceremony, he said: We, the people of Abkhazia, thank Moscow for its support, and most particularly for the decision to recognize Abkhazia's independence.
"I hope that your country will be quickly recognized by the United Nations," replied Alexeï Ostrovski, a member of the Russian parliament, raising his vodka glass.
For its part, the opposition represented in the election by former Vice-President Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticizes the agreements signed with Moscow last year, such as the one that gave Russia control of the Abkhaz railways for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, claims that he does not support the current power or the opposition.
A 50% majority plus one vote is needed to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round will be organised two weeks later.
Climate: demonstrations in the world, incidents in Copenhagen
On Saturday tens of thousands of people went out to the streets of the world to demand an ambitious and binding agreement at the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference, where the police, on alert, arrested more than 700 people around an imposing demonstration.
Some 30,000 people, according to the police; hundreds of thousands, according to the organizers, paraded in the afternoon in the cold of the Danish capital, which hosts until 18 December delegates from 193 countries, in search of an agreement that will have to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
The demonstration, which was quite peaceful, came out of Parliament and took place at the Bella Center, where negotiations are taking place.
Protesters stopped approximately 500 metres from the center, without attempting to enter.
A stage was set to welcome guest speakers. Former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, led a candlelight vigil.
A few moments after the start of the demonstration, a group of hundreds of people, all dressed in black, broke windows with bricks and hammers, reported an AFP journalist.
The riot police quickly surrounded them and intervened firmly, throwing several of them on the ground.
The police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people stating that they were mainly members of the "Black Blocks", ultraviolet groups that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, last April.
At the last hour of the afternoon, a police officer was wounded in the jaw with a dock, and four cars were burned near a house occupied during the incidents that led to the arrest of some 20 people, according to the police.
We didn't take our eyes off extremist groups, police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen warned, while law enforcement helicopters overflew the area.
Most of the protesters, who arrived by coach and train from the major cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam, even Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present, as were some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most of them with heavenly showers responded by forming a first concentration in the morning in Copenhagen to the call of Friends of the Earth to form "blue tides" for "justice and climate".
Today we take the streets to ask for compensation for the ecological debt in favor of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, Filipino activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.

Oxfam, along with the former UN Commissioner for Refugees, Mary Robinson, who was to lead the crowd, mobilized several celebrities, including the Danish model Helena Christensen.
The Asia-Pacific region, which brings together many islands that are very vulnerable to warming, gave the initial kick to the demonstrations.
According to the organizers, about 5,000 people went to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, hundreds of people, mostly students, manifested red dresses and wearing handkerchiefs with slogans in favor of solar energy in front of the City Hall of the Philippine capital.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, concentrations of hundreds of protesters demanding action against climate change were formed.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the network "350" brought together hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
In Geneva, dozens of people were concentrated.
The subject of history and geography emerges reinforced from the reform of secondary education, according to Chatel
The Minister of National Education, Luc Chatel, stated in an interview that will be transmitted in the Sunday Information (JDD, according to his French acronym) that history and geography would emerge "strengthened" from the reform of general secondary education, despite being eliminated from compulsory education in the second year of scientific baccalaureate.
From now on, all students in the first baccalaureate will have four hours a week and the same program for a shared common culture, says Chatel.
For the Minister, "it is enough with hypocrisy" because, according to him, "the C branch is no longer a scientific branch", but "in general, it summons the best students".
The branches General and Literary Teaching cannot be sub-branches of the C, he goes on to emphasize even: "I did not hear that historians or intellectuals were outraged at having eliminated history and geography in second high school in technological schools".
An IFOP poll published on Saturday in L'Humanité revealed that approximately seven ten (69%) French people disapproved of the government's plan to eliminate compulsory history-geography education in second in high school C. Numerous intellectuals and teachers, the left and some elected right-wing representatives also criticized this fact.
On the other hand, the Minister added that "no talk" about eliminating philosophy from the second high school program C.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher training, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) called for a day of mobilization on Tuesday to protest against the project, which they say sacrifices the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), at the beginning of the year they will give an admission test that will aim at their discipline, and at the end of the year, an admission test on their ability to teach, the Minister explained.
They will also practice in real conditions during the year of M2, then they will be a first year in front of the classroom as teachers in practice.
If you make all the practical proposals before the competition, you will already have a great experience in front of the classroom, that is, more than 300 hours, he added.
Finally, the Minister points out that he will propose "the individual right to training, which does not exist in national education".
It also confirmed the project to eliminate the school map "before 2012".
At the Higher Normal School, experts will have 15 minutes to explain convincingly the evolution of the climate
Fifteen minutes to talk about the challenges of the Copenhagen summit, a challenge that Jean Jouzel, vice president of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Climate Change (IPCC), invited to the Ulm Street High School of Normal, accepted on Saturday morning.
Jean Jouzel, also Nobel Peace Prize winner, inaugurated the conference wheel "Ernest", a day composed of a series of fifteen-minute expert presentations, filmed and open to the public, reported a journalist from AFP.
We wanted to do something that would appeal to people and convey to them a desire to know more, explained at the conference Edouard Hannezzo, 22, one of the organizers of this day called as the students baptized the fish from the school pond.
We chose about twenty participants from among the experts of his discipline and selected them from his charismatic side, he said.
About global warming, "we can talk hours, but we can also talk about key goals in a few minutes," he told AFP Jean Jouzel, who exhibited without notes, but with the help of graphics in front of about fifty people.
It is part of our scientific role, he stressed, waiting for the public to understand that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an extremely serious scientific dossier".
The videos filmed during these lectures will be online on the school's website as of December 15.
The next "Ernest" day, followed by others at a bimonthly pace, is scheduled for February.
Delay in payments: Disgusting of prison guards, plans to take action
The prison guards' unions called on Friday for a "general mobilization" to demand payment before the end-of-year holidays, bonuses and overtime, which was postponed until January for budgetary reasons.
The Prison Workers' Force (2nd Guard Union) asked the off-duty personnel to join the demonstration on Tuesday morning in front of the prisons and "block them" to denounce the theft of their assets.
The CGT prison (3rd trade union of the profession) calls them to "meeting in general assemblies in the different prisons to achieve a mass mobilization", as it is called "shaming and unacceptable" the non-payment in December of the "extra hours, nocturnal premiums, Sundays and holidays" worked in October.
And the first union of guards, the Federal Union Autonomous Penitentiary (UFAP/Unsa), "calls for general mobilization (...) in order to increase discontent and anger".
The Directorate of the Prison Administration and the Ministry of Justice explain that overtime increased significantly in 2009 and not all were accounted for, but ensure that the balance will be paid in January.
At the last hour of the day, the Chancellery reported that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the guard unions assuring them that the payment would be made next month.
I have no doubt about the efforts made by staff to operate and modernize our prison system, the Minister of Justice writes in this letter.
I requested the Directorate of the Prison Administration to immediately implement a set of measures aimed at ensuring that this situation generated by a poor assessment of the number of overtime hours would not occur again in the future.
The December pay will then be low, except for the management staff who benefit from the famous bonuses for functions and objectives, and who "always blames the budgetary demands", deplored the Ufap/Unsa.
It is a real scandal, said outraged the FO interregional union of Marseilles, announcing its decision to boycott until new order "all meetings and convocations".
The staff will not come to work on Sundays and corresponding holidays if those of the month of October are not paid in December, the same will happen with the overtime, also threatens FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
As the tasks and missions increase without taking more action, it is more than unfortunate to dare to attack the staff's salary, estimates the CGT in Bordeaux.
According to the unions, the same is not true in all regions, as some are more fortunate than others.
But anyway, the result is not the expected one, Ufap Secretary General Jean-François Forget said.
For Christmas, Obama says he makes "better gifts" than the ones he receives
U.S. President Barack Obama, who will celebrate his first family Christmas at the White House, confessed to the famous television host, Oprah Winfrey, who came to a simple conclusion as to gifts: "I make better gifts than the ones I receive."
During a special interview that ABC will broadcast on Sunday night, the President and his wife Michelle explain how they plan to celebrate the end of the year parties in their new and prestigious residence.
Even Bo, the family's little four-legged partner, will be in the game.
Santa also loves Bo, said Michelle Obama, clarifying that the dog will "of course" receive a gift, according to the excerpts of the program transmitted in advance.
And Michelle Obama disagreed with her husband's assertions about the quality of the gifts he receives: "No way, last year I made you nice gifts," he said provoking the president.
True, he was forced to admit it before responding with humor pointing to the First Lady's pearl necklace: "Who gave you that?"
During the one-hour interview, in a relaxed atmosphere with the famous cheerleader who supported with devotion the presidential campaign of Barack Obama, the president and his wife also remembered his favorite gifts from childhood.
Barack Obama recalled a two-speed bike, as well as a basketball that his Kenyan father, who he rarely saw, gave him for Christmas.
I remember that time when my father came to see us at Christmas and gave me a basketball, the President said.
Only many years later, I learned that he had given me that ball.
For her part, the First Lady remembered her doll house.
I had no idea how to organize a house, so I put all the furniture online against the wall, instead of accommodating it around the house, however, I loved that doll house, said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday again operated, RTL claims he's in induced coma
Johnny Hallyday was again intervened in Los Angeles due to significant "injuries" resulting from an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his relatives, while RTL claims that the singer was subjected to an induced coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker intervened again on Wednesday night to Thursday at the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles where some doctors checked "injuries from the operation" of hernia disc carried out in Paris on November 26, pointing out his press service in that same city, indicating that such injuries "needed a repair operation".
However, the singer's press service tried to convey calm by stating that the situation was "under control", and reported that a new medical party would communicate within the next 48 hours.
According to RTL, sponsor of the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday agreed, however, to be subjected to an induced coma to avoid "pain and complications".
In less than 48 hours when the patient wakes up, we will be more sure about his condition, adds RTL.
The press service, questioned by the AFP, did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also states that "according to some sources" no cannula would have been introduced to it after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated on at the international clinic of Monceau Park due to a hernia disc.
The surgery, scheduled for a few days, was practiced by the neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor in the artistic environment.
On Thursday night, Delajoux refused to comment on the information transmitted by RTL.
On Monday, singer Johnny Hollyday entered Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles for an infection resulting from Delajoux's intervention.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, Johnny Hallyday's close friend, explained on Thursday at RTL that his friend was going through "a bad time", but he assured that he did not "no problem" because the rocker is "a fighter".
He called me right before he went to L.A., and I told him it was silly to make twelve hours of air travel after such an operation, it's not possible, Eddy Mitchell said.
On Wednesday night, the producer of the musician, Jean-Claude Camus, sought to reassure by stating that Johnny Hallyday "reacted satisfactorily to antibiotics" and that the infection was "controlled".
Camus said he had talked to Laeticia, the musician's wife, and that he had not noticed any particular concerns.
But the singer's health problems increased since July when he was admitted for nine days as a result of a fall on his yacht.
Two months later, as a general surprise, Johnny Hallyday revealed that he had been operated on by a "colon cancer" after a mild infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed, as expected, his long "Gira 66", presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health problem has been overreacted. Fans and journalists have noticed the musician's difficulties in moving on stage.
In mid-November, his relatives even had to deny a new admission.
Euro-2009/short pool: first Bousquet title in your favorite distance
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, a triple medalist at the 2009 World Long Pool, won an international title on Thursday in a distance for which he feels particular affection, 50 m free, during Euro-2009 in a short swimming pool in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition where polyurethane swimmers were allowed for the last time, only three world records were exceeded when many more were actually expected.
One was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto in 200 m 4 styles; and the other two, by the Russian in relief 4 x 50 m 4 styles (male).
A penalty for Bousquet, who coveted the world record in 50 m free, brand that owns in long swimming pool (20.94).
In one of the two distance queens of swimming, in 50 m free, the 28-year-old Frenchman was imposed with 20''53 during a final where ten swimmers competed instead of eight as usual, a first on an international level.
Bousquet advanced to Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but failed to lower the global mark (20.30), as he had planned.
We can always aspire to something better and, in that case, I said that if the world record was within my reach, I would try to reach it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers were wearing polyurethane swimmers that will be banned from January 1.
These swimmers, the origin of 238 world records since February 2008, finish their epic in Istanbul, where they competed for the first time in 1999 for the same test.
This time the use of swimmers did not help the German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in long swimming pool this summer in Rome, consecutive world records.
The young swimmer failed to lower his mark by 400 m free (3:32.77), however, he imposed himself with the second best time of his career (3:34.55), before Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn't give myself up in this race.
I knew that this time I couldn't beat a world record, but I managed to defend my title and fulfilled my mission.
Lobintsev will be a tough rival in the future, Biedermann explained.
USA: a sarcophagus panel belonging to Zola was sold at USD 1.5 million
A Roman sarcophagus panel belonging to French writer Emile Zola was sold on Thursday for $1.5 million, well above the estimated price, announced Sotheby's art dealer.
This panel of 2 meters long by 63 cm high, dates from the 3rd century after Christ, and its price was estimated to be between $150,000 and $250,000.
The marble "that represents four dionysian scenes, in a sophisticated architectural setting, surrounded by satyrs and drunken women, is an unusual piece, since in the world there are only four or five", he explained on Tuesday to the AFP Florent Heintz, vice president of art auctions of ancient Rome and Egypt in Sotheby's.
It was sold between a hundred lots.
The sale continues, but so far, this lot was the most impugned by the buyers, no doubt, pointed out to the AFP a spokesman for Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy.
Just a few days ago, it was discovered that marble was an acquisition of Emile Zola.
For almost 300 years, the panel was part of the famous collection of the Borges family in Rome, then appeared successively in the house of the French actress Cécile Sorel, as an element of his bathtub in his particular Parisian mansion, and in the house of Paul Raynaud, minister of the Third French Republic and president of the Council for a short time, before Marshal Pétain took power.
For some 50 years, his whereabouts were uncertain.
Reviewing the Louvre Museum database, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of a "Emile Zola succession" opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresco of the "Rougon-Macquart".
Honduras aborted Zelaya's departure to Mexico
On Thursday, Mexico felt that the conditions were not in place to transfer to its territory the overthrown president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, who was denied safe conduct by the coup government.
For the moment, after a telephone conversation at night with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that there is no possibility of the transfer, said Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa.
The Mexican government plane that arrived in El Salvador on Wednesday to take Zelaya, returned to its place of origin, according to a source from the General Directorate of Migration.
In order to give him a safe passage, the coup government wanted to force Zelaya to "give up" and seek political asylum abroad.
But the ousted president refused because he wanted to come to Mexico as the guest head of state.
The coup government "has suffered a new defeat by asking me to resign from my post (...), they wanted me to resign," Zelaya said on Thursday on Globo radio, in which he usually makes statements since the beginning of the political crisis that has been in Central America for five months.
Here I can stay ten years, I have my guitar, added playing some chords the deposed president, refugee at the Brazilian embassy of Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
The embassy of Mexico submitted a request for safe conduct to us, but unfortunately we could not accept it because it did not contain an application for asylum, said on Wednesday the Minister of the Interior of the coup government, Oscar Raúl Matute, to the Honduran radio station HRN.
"I will not seek asylum in any country," Manuel Zelaya replied in an interview with the Telesur network, whose headquarters are in Caracas.
If I leave Honduras, I will do so as president of the Honduran people, he stressed.
The rumors about Zelaya's departure mobilized on Wednesday the supporters of the deposed president, who gathered around the Brazilian embassy, heavily besieged by the military.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the coup government's position.
That reflects the marginal nature of this government in the face of international standards, he said.
Zelaya, who had approached the socialist president of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, was overthrown on June 28, the day he organized a referendum to prepare for his re-election, rejected by the Supreme Court, the army and Congress.
From his exile in Costa Rica, he returned surprisingly on 21 September and took refuge in the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves, he will be arrested and will have to answer to the Justice for the crime of "high treason", according to the coup government.
The de facto president, Roberto Micheletti, managed to organize a presidential election on 29 November to replace Zelaya.
In the controversial poll, he was elected Porfirio Lobo. This election was recognized by the United States, but questioned by Latin American countries, such as Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted massively against Zelaya's return to power until his term of office ended on 27 January.
Wall Street goes up, the U.S. trade balance feeds optimism
The New York Stock Exchange closed this Thursday, the US trade balance figures are a faithful witness to the economic revival of both the United States and its partners: the Dow Jones won 0.67%; and the Nasdaq, 0.33%.
According to the final figures at closing, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 68, 78 points to 10,405,83 points, and the Nasdaq, of technological component, 7.13 points to 2,190,06 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index rose by 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1,102.35 points.
We received good news from different sectors of the economy, said Lindsey Piegza from FTN Financial.
But this is anecdotal, he clarified, considering that the market was concentrated "in the half full glass".
For Peter Cardillo, of Avalon Partners, investors focused mainly on the US trade balance figures, "which reflect an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter."
The United States trade deficit fell in October by 7.6 per cent compared to September, to $32.9 billion.
The analysts expected, on the contrary, a deepening of the deficit.
Both imports and exports increased.
The great novelty is the growth of volumes of trade, in particular, exports of goods, which reflect the growth of the major economies they trade with the United States, said Christopher Cornell, of the research company Economy.com.
In return, last week, unemployment registrations in the United States unexpectedly increased, and 474,000 applications were submitted.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job seekers "has been the lowest for a year," said Scott Marcouiller, of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The performance of the 10-year Treasury bond amounted to 3.482% against 3.423 percent on Tuesday night, and that of the 30-year bond to 4.492% against 4.408% on the day before.
Cuba: More than a hundred supporters of power boochea to the "Ladies of White"
This Thursday hundreds of supporters of the Cuban power booed the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for the World Day of Human Rights and prevented another demonstration to which a dozen dissidents were summoned.
Some forty "Ladies of White", wives or relatives of political prisoners, were assaulted on the street by supporters of Raúl Castro's government as they walked towards the center of the capital demanding the release of these detainees, said an AFP journalist.
The Yankees die!, "Mercenaries!", "The street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Long live Fidel and Raul!" the militants of power crowned dissidents with their fists high.
The latter were escorted by plainclothes officers who came to "protect them".
On the eve, a similar demonstration broke out against the "Ladies of White" in Havana, without injuries or arrests.
But in the Havana neighborhood of Vedado, a dozen dissidents who were also ready to protest on Thursday for international human rights day, was arrested by police officers dressed in civilian clothes, reported an AFP journalist.
The officers forcibly climbed the vehicles to the dissidents who were ravaged by supporters of the government, according to that journalist.
In general, the arrest of dissidents in similar circumstances only last a few hours.
The "Ladies of White", awarded the 2005 Sakharov Prize awarded by the European Parliament, had organized an unauthorized march to "claim the release of all political prisoners", about 200 according to dissent, declared one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband, Héctor Maceda, is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
Maceda is part of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents imprisoned in March 2003, of whom 53 remain behind bars.
Cuban authorities call opponents "mercenaries" or "agents" on the wages of their declared enemy, the United States.
Made very rare in the media, Cuban television reported on Thursday's demonstration of the government's militants against the "counter-revolutionaries".
Cuba, ruled by a single party, the Communist Party, is constantly accused by European or American NGOs of trampling on rights and freedoms, especially those of expression.
An alienated man kills an octagenarian with a knife and leaves 5 wounded in Clichy-la-Garenne
An unbalanced man with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and wounded another five people in the center of the city of Clichy-la-Garenne (High Seine) on Thursday at the hour of the most influx of the afternoon
According to the first elements of the investigation, the 28-year-old assailant allegedly struck with two knives and for undetermined reasons, an elderly man, at or in front of the pharmacy at No. 85 of the Boulevard Jean-Jaurès, reported police sources and witnesses.
As a result of the serious injuries, the man born in 1929 died in the hospital, according to a head of the Alliance police union.
Later at or in front of the pharmacy, he attacked a pregnant woman who was with her partner.
The husband, about thirty years old, intervened and was wounded.
The first two victims, seriously injured, were transferred to the hospital where the elder died.
The life of the other injured person, with the vital organs apparently affected, is in danger.
Then the pregnant woman suffered a fainting and was hospitalized "in shock," a police source reported.
The armed man, who seemed to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, would have escaped through the boulevard Jean Jaurès.
Apparently by chance, he would have wounded two more pedestrians: one thirty - year - old man, and another forty - severely.
At night, the crime scene was still unclear.
He was armed with two butcher knives that had crossed on his back, explained in the place a head of the union Alliance in the Upper Sena, Arnaud Pressé.
Several passersby, including young ones, tried to control the alienate, according to the testimonies obtained by the AFP.
I saw a guy about thirty years old in a green jacket.
Three young men tried to intercept him.
They didn't make it because the guy was strong, said Alberto, waiter at a nearby bar.
A crowd threw themselves at him, among them a police officer who broke his wrist, he added.
At the Jean-Jaurès boulevard, at the height of No. 61, two municipal officers, including the chief, tried to arrest the armed man and were punched, according to police testimony.
The events occurred in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are numerous shops.
Some people came to tell me there was an injured man on the street.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old man on the floor. When I put him in a safe position, I noticed a very important wound in the abdomen, told AFP Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later, a second person about 35 years of age arrived, with knife wounds.
National police officers arrested the man without identity documents.
The Nanterre Prosecutor ' s Office submitted the investigation to the jurisdiction of the Department of the Judicial Police of Upper Sena (SDPJ 92).
The madman was hospitalized Thursday night.
During his provisional detention, he did not say a word.
A police source does not exclude the possibility of placing him in a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, six police officers were needed to dominate him at the Clichy police station to which he was transferred.
It was "in a state of overexcitedness" as "all of this kind of upset whose forces increase considerably under the effect of action."
U.S.: Polanski's lawyer again calls for the case to be dismissed
The lawyer of Franco-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski again claimed this Thursday in Los Angeles (California, West of the United States), that the case against his client, who is under house arrest in Switzerland, be dismissed for a case of sexual abuse that occurred more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, lawyer for the director of "El Pianista", denounced serious procedural errors at the time of the events in 1977 before three judges of the California Second District Appeals Chamber.
Hummel stated: I claim that the charges are dismissed at this very moment, as the judge's conduct in charge of the case at that time, Laurence Rittend, "has turned out to be chilling."
According to him, Judge Rittenband (died since then) would have talked to a prosecutor who would have told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison, before issuing a sentence, which constitutes a serious procedural failure.
This conversation was made public in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski, wanted and wanted), from the very mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But finally Wells declared at the end of September "to have lied" to the author of the documentary.
Hummel called for a trial that would allow him to present evidence of his argument in the event that the court rejected the dismissal of the case.
The prosecution, for its part, reiterated the argument put forward at first instance, that no dismissal of the charges could be seriously assessed as long as Roman Polanski did not appear before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker fled the United States in 1978 before his sentence was handed down for "illegal sexual relations" with a person under 13 years of age.
Since then, the United States has never stepped foot again.
Los Angeles District Vice-Fiscal Phyllis Asayama stated that Roman Polanski "must be here to appear at the hearing."
With this cause, we want to convey the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, that there is the possibility of fleeing?, Asayama asked.
For her, the filmmaker "calls a favor to the court, even though he despises her authority."
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to pronounce his sentence, also highlighted "that there were other alternatives to the decision to flee."
Hummel wasn't the only one asking to dismiss the case against Roman Polanski.
The lawyer for Samantha Geimer, the victim, also claimed, once again, to close the case.
She claims that her client no longer supports being harassed every time the Polanski case resurfaces, adding: "No one in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years, that's enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland on an American arrest warrant.
After more than two months after the bars, he was sentenced to house arrest at his Gstaad cabin, pending possible extradition.
Wall Street loses course and slows down by the rise of the dollar
The New York Stock Exchange closed this Friday aimlessly, in a market that is debated between better indicators than expected in the United States and the rise of the dollar: the Dow Jones won 0.63%, but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final figures at the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 65.67 points to 10.471.50 points, while the technology-component Nasdaq lost 0.55 points to 2,190.31 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 advanced 0.37% (4.06 points), reaching 1,106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, said Mace Blicksilver, from Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains with narrow margins, the volume of exchanges is increasingly reduced and I think it will remain so until the end of the year.
The trend was sustained by the publication of better economic indicators than expected, which "helped to improve market opinion on the soundness of economic recovery," summarized Charles Schwab's analysts.
In the United States, retail sales increased by 1.3 per cent in November for the second consecutive month and by more than expected.
In addition, U.S. consumers' confidence recovered visibly in December, 73.4 versus 67.4 the previous month, according to the preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan index.
However, the indices were held back by a new advance in the dollar that reached the highest level of the last two months against the euro, which "leads down to sectors sensitive to the economic situation," explained Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
In this way, technological values lost ground.
The bond market has fallen.
The yield of the 10-year Treasury bond amounted to 3.540% against 3.482% on Wednesday night, and that of the 30-year bond to 4.497% against 4.492% on the day before.
The election of Miss World again in South Africa
After a month's tour of South Africa, the 112 women candidates for the Miss World title are in the final line to fulfill their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world against a billion spectators.
During this great celebration of beauty organized for the second consecutive year in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already achieved their participation in the semifinal.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Pearl Beltran of Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gibraltar and Yanbing Ma of Canada were elected Miss Sportsman or even Miss Top Model during their stay in Africa.
It was a real riot.
It was extraordinary to visit beautiful cities such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town.
"I saw so many things and lived countless experiences!" said Miss Sierra Leone.
This ninth-time event in South Africa will be broadcast live Saturday from Midrand, North Johannesburg, from 5 p.m. to 3 p.m. GMT.
I can't imagine a better country to deliver my crown.
This experience was fascinating.
I'm very glad I've worked twice, points out Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the southern summer.
For the young Russian woman, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges with the candidates and the possibility of rediscovering "African landscapes that take away the breath".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, press conferences and safari, Miss World candidates focus on the contest.
The Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to be able to follow the steps of Priyanka Chopra, winner in 2000 and present in this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both converted into Bollywood stars.
Every woman's dream is to be crowned as the most beautiful in the world, but it's not just about appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our countries, and I want to return to my country with the crown, says Miss India with a big smile.
According to the organizers, music and dance will mark this 59th edition.
The candidates will parade in traditional dresses and, of course, in swimwear.
Chinese hostess Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean, and Miss World committee leader Steve Douglas will lead the event.
South Africa proved to be able to receive the world with warmth and pride difficult to match, says Julia Morley, president of the Miss World contest.
Like last year, the candidates made a safari, visited Soweto's famous township, but this time by bike, and tasted the local cuisine.
As an exceptional fact, they met South African President Jacob Zuma, who shook their hands.
Something unusual for a head of state, says Miss Sierra Leone.
His best memory will undoubtedly be the draw in Cape Town (Southwest) for the World Cup in June 2010, a way for the country to further promote the event.
I've been dealing with people I never thought I'd get to know.
Probably back for the 2010 World Cup, says enthusiastic Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
Johnny Hallyday news "is very positive," according to his son David
The news about Johnny Hallyday "is very positive," said his son David on Friday when he arrived at the Los Angeles airport to accompany his hospitalized father for several days.
The news is very positive.
Dad is strong and everything is going very well, he told the press David Hallyday when he got off the plane that brought him from Paris shortly after 1:00 p.m. local (21:00 GMT).
The singer's son, distended, assured that he would move "as soon as possible" to the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday entered on Monday for an infection resulting from the hernia disc operation last November 26 in Paris.
The musician is "in a coma induced from that night in Los Angeles for reasons of comfort, to avoid suffering and thus be able to administer his treatment," the press service said.
Johnny Hallyday had already been subjected to a coma induced by doctors at the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, where he entered Monday for an infection, following a hernia disc operation on November 26 in Paris.
The singer was operated once again on Wednesday night through Thursday due to serious injuries caused by the previous intervention.
His wife Laeticia went on Friday morning to the French high school in Los Angeles, attended by her daughter Jade, to witness a school act, confirmed an AFP photographer.
The Chief of Orthopedic Surgery and Trauma of the Hospital de la Pitié-Salpêtrière, Yves Catone, announced that he would travel to Los Angeles on Monday to be with the singer.
The producer violently accused Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated on the singer on November 26 at the Monceau Park International Private Clinic in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
The Los Angeles surgeons said they were outraged, Camus said.
There is talk of a possible lawsuit, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus argued that Johnny Hallyday had "travelled too fast to Los Angeles with the permission of the Parisian surgeon."
I spoke directly to the doctor and was surprised when he assured me that there was no problem in making the trip, as I was operated twice on hernia disc, he added.
Shortly before on the RTL station, he indicated that the singer appeared to have gone "without a cannula, without anything", after his Parisian operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic environment.
She operated on actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before her death, at a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where Delajoux worked at that time.
In 2007, she also intervened with actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to reabsorb a hematoma formed by a brain hemorrhage.
He is a doctor with a bad reputation, condemned by the courts on several occasions for misappropriation, as well as for tax fraud and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, lawyer of the Order of Physicians, accused him of being "a man without scruples" sued "with regularity" before the Council of the Order, and is "far from being recommended".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke on Friday through his lawyer, David Koubbi.
He indicated that the intervention "was carried out without any inconvenience" and that the results of the postoperative studies were "normal".
The operation "could not cause hemorrhage and therefore did not need drainage," he added.
Anyway, the singer's tour, whose health problems have multiplied since the summer, entered a parenthesis.
Undoubtedly, to resume the tour on January 8 (in Amiens, NDLR) as planned, seems very risky to me, Camus said.
The association UDF raises the tone and warns the New Center about the use of its acronym
The association UDF (Union pour la démocratie française), controlled by the MoDem (Democratic Movement) of François Bayrou, reacted this Friday to the attempt of the president of the New Centre, Hervé Morin, to launch an OPA (Procurement Public Offer) on the acronym of the former Giscardist party, intimidating it to withdraw from all support, even if it is sued.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to regain the acronym UDF, as he believes that François Bayrou was not in a position to defend his political heritage after reaching out to the left.
On the other hand, the Minister of Defence, whose party is associated with the UMP, had planned to confirm the strategy on Saturday before the NC National Council.
In support of his management, he received the help of the deputy Hervé de Charette (former UMP, current NC) who claimed ownership of the UDF brand, since he was the first to register it with the National Institute of Industrial Property in 2004.
But on Friday night, the office of the UDF association, controlled by François Bayrou's friends who do not want to be deprived of it, broke the silence to issue a request to the Minister and the deputy intimidating them to renounce the acronym and to transfer to them the property rights of the brand, on pain of a lawsuit.
In recent days, you have made many statements implying that you were going to propose to your political movement to recover the acronym UDF, writes the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez del MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Athuis of the Centralist Alliance.
They also believe it is right to continue using the name of the movement, the +New centre+, and the slogan +'UDF d'jourd'hui+ in its militant material and on the presentation page of its site, the signatories of the letter say.
As you already know, they have no right to use the acronym, explains the UDF office which requires the NC to withdraw "immediately the mention of the name of the UDF of all support, as well as of (its) website".
He also asks Hervé de Charette "to transfer the property of (the) brand to the legitimate right-holders."
If not, justice will be called upon to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warn.
In the letter, they point out that the UDF "is a real political movement since 1978" and recall that Morin and his friends "chosen" to leave in 2007 "to create a new party, as others had done in 2002 to create the UMP".
Therefore, according to them, the New Centre has no right to use the acronym UDF.
They also recall that the last congress of the UDF voted in 2007 to join MoDem for three years and the creation of an office responsible for defending "the material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continues, "when he registered the brand", he was no longer "member of the UDF for three years", but of the UMP.
It takes scandalously and fraudulently advantage of the absence of registration of the acronym UDF to carry it out on its own.
This indiscretion is becoming a crime, they denounce, before mocking the NC's strategy: "We believe that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make your own name than to try to get out of anonymity by fraudulently taking a name to which you are not entitled."
Case Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier to be tried for weakness abuse
This Friday the Nanterre Court decided to bring the artist François-Marie Banier to trial to determine whether, as the daughter of the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt claims, she took advantage of the state of weakness of the octogenarian to strip her of part of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his photos of stars from the show, will be tried on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime whose conviction consists of a maximum of three years' imprisonment and 375,000 euros' fine.
This means that in this case there will be a process worthy of a saga about one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter are disputed the reins of the empire of cosmetics L'Oréal.
But Correctional Court No. 15 also ordered Liliane Bettencourt, 87, to undergo a medical examination by three medical professionals.
L'Oréal's heir and principal shareholder always refused to undergo such examinations, even more so under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre Prosecutor's Office during the investigation.
Doctors designated this Friday will be required to submit a report by March 10, 2010, stating whether Liliane Bettencourt suffered from weakness and during which periods.
I think he'll take it.
I'm going to talk to her, counsel for Mrs. Bettencourt, Georges Kiejman, testified upon leaving the hearing.
For his part, Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' lawyer, Olivier Metzner, was pleased with the court's decision.
It is excellent news (...) The expert will show that he (Banier) manipulated this elderly lady, whom we must protect, he said.
For two years, Liliane Bettencourt's only daughter initiated criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and multi-faceted artist, accusing him of taking advantage for years of his mother's weakness to obtain a billion euros in donations, through checks, life insurance contracts or works of art.
For his part, Liliane Bettencourt always denied having been manipulated by the photographer, whom he considers a long-time friend.
On Friday, while the court examined the origin of the action brought by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers' allegations were, on some occasions, a great family confession.
In this way, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer took into account three letters that her client sent (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary in which she said she distrusted Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' husband.
In the 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to counsel: "I could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier between once and twice a day for fifteen years.
Since her wedding, I have never been able to speak to Françoise again."
For its part, the Nanterre Prosecutor ' s Office considered once again that the complainant was not in a position to appear, especially since a guardianship judge in recent days refused to give rise to her request to initiate a judicial guardianship procedure for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to appear before justice, is not under guardianship and has no guardian.
No other person will be able to appear in his place," said the representative of the Public Prosecutor's Office, Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney.
Finally, the court decided that the trial on the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers would take place.
Management revolution or end of business intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our struggle for the development of business intelligence will have been in vain...
More than ten years ago, the attitude of the management of large companies towards their employees recalls the position of companies with regard to consumers before the marketing revolution: it is a question of employees adhering to "values" determined from above as before, it was a question of imposing on consumers products designed by factory technicians.
By putting the customer at the center of the company, the marketing revolution gave place to the strategies of conquest of the markets... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products that are unrelated to the preference factors of the customers is repeated regularly.
A demobilization of employees can end in a deadly demoralization.
Suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just the tip of the iceberg of a much more general phenomenon that particularly affects executives.
This demobilization seriously compromises the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, especially R & D and, even more, business intelligence.
Indeed, the BI (Business Intelligence) "requires that all parties involved (...) have proactive behaviour and a forward-looking vision; it needs a commitment on the part of employees that is completely opposed to the recommendations of an authority.
For this reason, we called for a managerial revolution, which would be to put employees at the centre of the company's concerns as well as the customer.
Internal opinion polls have a relative utility
Will internal opinion polls, such as Orange's questionnaire among its employees, incite the managerial revolution in practice?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
In principle, because I was able to verify that, in the face of a new situation, and after many laps, all the companies end up doing essentially... what they always did! B989
-Secondly, because authoritarianism, one of the pathologies of power, grows proportionally to the importance of its own failures.
- Finally, because most managers have a simplistic vision of human behavior.
As they come from major engineering schools, they interpret psychology in a mechanical way.
They adopt, out of intellectual comfort, the ancient conductist theory that the American "neurosciences" recently reactivated, and that the Institutes of Studies and the media spread widely behind their backs.
In this way, by suggesting that it is possible to manage the "commands" (sic) of executive engagement, a recent research by Ipsos published in Le Figaro.fr reaffirms managers in a position of mechanical management, unsuitable for today's world.
Identifying and measuring mobilization factors
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern companies, involves adopting a finalist vision of human behavior.
It consists of integrating into any reasoning or practice of business management, a fundamental fact: for employees, commitment to the company is possible only if it clearly appears as a means to make reality part of their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Today, only the studies from the Motivational Analysis adopt this conception of the motivations of the employees.
The studies showed that they judge their company based on a predetermined doxa that allows them, through the image they have of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to achieve their own life projects.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of mobilization factors, company managers can control, anticipate and anticipate their "social performance" and relocate human resource management "in place".
In this way, they create a favourable ground for the organized development of a strong and effective business intelligence.
Oslo speech: Obama receives praise from the right for the "just war"
This Friday, the American right, pleased that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize has defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States, welcomed Obama's speech on Thursday.
The Conservatives, who had discredited the award for Obama on October 9, this time applauded the presidential speech, as did Sarah Palin, a former vice presidential candidate during the 2008 elections.
I loved what she said, said Mrs Palin, the main figure of the right wing of the Republican party to the USA Today newspaper, and added that she herself had addressed the issue of war "sometimes necessary" in her recently published memoirs.
In my opinion, war is, of course, the last thing Americans want to be forced to do, but it is necessary.
The terrorists must be stopped, he observed.
Obama, who inherited the two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, dedicated himself, this Thursday in Oslo, to justifying the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 more soldiers to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, considered that the president had done "a very good job" in Oslo.
I think the speech was really very good, the former president of the House of Representatives was pleased, who appreciated in particular the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential words.
For moments, the speech seemed very historic to me, Gingrich said, during an interview on the radio program "The Takeaway".
The former elected representative, whom some consider a possible candidate for the 2012 presidential election, was pleased to hear "a left-wing president" when he reminded the members of the Nobel Committee "that they would not be free and could not deliver a peace prize if the use of force did not exist."
According to Michael Gerson, author of George W. Bush's speeches and current columnist at the Washington Post, Obama delivered "a very American speech."
In addition to presenting himself as a "citizen of the world," as he "always does," he "spoked like an American president" by reminding Europeans "that they live in a security bubble that they did not create and that they do not do much to preserve it," Gerson said.
Among the few not very convinced right, a Bush era hawk, the former UN ambassador, John Bolton, described the speech as "monotonous, pretentious and uninspired" on the National Review Online website.
To the left of the president, Democratic representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed when he saw Barack Obama justifying the use of force.
When we cover the war with the notion of justice, it is easy to justify the massacre of innocent people, he warned.
However, the center-left press praised the president.
Los Angeles Time, while still believing that Obama received the Nobel prematurely, called his speech "superproduction" above all for a speaker known for his talent.
Oslo's speech "should serve as a road map to guide international decisions in the fight against conflict, poverty and oppression," the Californian newspaper said enthusiastically.
Obama "pronounced the speech that was needed," estimated the New York Times, judging it "both gloomy and upbuilding."
Road transport: three marathon negotiations to ensure Christmas supply
After three sessions of marathon negotiations, the trade unions in the road sector and the TLF (Transport and Logistics of France), the only employers' organization that remained until the end, arrived on Friday afternoon at an agreement that puts an end to the strike slogan and the threat to the Christmas supply.
During the signing session on Friday night, the Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, was "joyed" by the agreement, after several negotiation sessions that began on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, the negotiators said good-bye at dawn on Friday in the hope of quickly signing the text according to the last hour of the morning.
Even though three employers' organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) withdrew by giving a doorway.
But a meeting of more than six hours that began at 11 a.m. was necessary for everyone to agree and the text was signed at 6 p.m.
The conflict "had been very harmful to businesses" and "we feared that it would disturb the end of the year parties," Bussereau said.
The text provides for an increase of 4 per cent for the lowest wages (in local and regional road transport) and 2.9 per cent for the highest (international transport).
The hourly rate rises from 8.72 euros to 9.06 euros for low wages.
It's not much, but we started with a lot of disadvantage, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
If so, we will give the order to our militants that there will be no more cuts or blockades in the supply centres.
But there can always be some disgruntled rebel, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, acknowledged that this was "a good agreement", although it was "difficult to grant increases to high wages taking into account international competition".
According to him, the increases will be in the order of 170 euros per month for low wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is an agreement with common sense and that respects the employees, declared Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) recognized it as "a historical agreement".
For Richard Jaubert (CGT) it is "an acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for an increase in travel costs of 3% and the holding of general meetings on road transport in the first half of 2010, which will make it possible, above all, to address the issue of extraordinary pay and modernization of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled that "a decrease of 100 million euros in employer charges" was the subject of an amendment by the government in the 2009 rectification finance bill, which the National Assembly voted on Thursday night.
The government will ask the Senate to vote "under the same terms."
The signing of TLF allows the agreement to apply, first, to companies affiliated to this organization and, secondly, to the entire profession, should the Minister of Labour make an extension.
"It will be done as soon as possible," Bussereau said.
Opposition from employers' organizations could only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced this as a "ingenuous business", as the EUR 100 million "had already been promised to the sector to compensate for part of the CO2 tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate in an emergency situation, not as a conclusion to an analysis discussed by the parties, but not to contradict those who want to eat turkey at the next Christmas Eve dinner, the Unostra lamented.
For the OTHER, the agreement puts at risk "the stability of many SMEs in the sector over the next 12 months".
RER A: weekend conflicts, unions disagree with RATP proposals
The conflicts in RER A, France's largest urban public transport line, will continue over the weekend, because at the Friday meeting, the 2nd day of strike between unions and the RATP leadership, there was no agreement and the unions were dissatisfied with their premium request.
For this important Christmas shopping weekend, on Saturday and Sunday only trains will run between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m., due to one train each on the central stretch (between La Défense and Nation) and one train every four on the other lines.
Interconnection with the SNFC will be suspended in Nanterre Préfecture, which will force passengers to change trains.
The Galeries Lafayette, which wait for 200,000 customers every day, were pleased that "RATP strives to provide service to large stores".
The RER A crosses from West to East the city of Paris.
The RATP section runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
This Friday, approximately one in two trains flew in peak hours, and almost no trains in valley hours, as planned.
On Thursday there was no disorder on the platforms thanks to the organization of the inhabitants of the island of France.
In this way, at dawn, the Saint-Germain-en-Laye station (Yvelines) was much less crowded than usual, especially due to the absence of students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), 29-year-old engineer Jack Nbakina explained that he had risen "an hour and a half earlier to arrive on time."
Saint-Lazare station was not saturated, said SNCF, which had provided for police and law enforcement oversight.
The RER A operated by SNCF from or destined for Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed from Saint-Lazare station to join the meters.
New general assemblies of workers on strike will take place on Saturday and Sunday. The results, "unsatisfactory" according to the unions, of a meeting held with the management on Friday afternoon will be analysed.
The Director of RERs proposes to negotiate a specific protocol in all aspects for RER A: working time, professional development, etc.
This is not what drivers who claim a premium due to them want, according to Thierry Garon (South).
RATP even put its premium proposals in parentheses, commented outraged the CGT, noting that the management "was not able to solve a problem that SNCF and the road sector had already solved".
A new meeting is scheduled on Monday to carry out "a more extensive analysis of the conditions of exercise of the profession", the RATP said.
This also led the unions to say that the company "did not care about weekend users".
In the morning, some 150 drivers invaded a committee at the headquarters in Paris.
Then the management, which until then refused to dialogue during the strike, suggested the meeting "to calm the waters".
The conflict could extend to RER B on Tuesday, after the Unsa and the Independents have submitted a notice.
The unions demand a premium of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independents) and complain about the deterioration of working conditions in this line that has a million passengers daily.
RER drivers, all in the second degree of their professional career, charge from 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross and from 600 to 650 euros of premiums, for schedules with alternate shifts, Sundays and holidays.
Turkish justice dissolves prokurdo party, a decision with serious consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court ruled on Friday in favour of the dissolution of the country's main pro-Kurdish party, a decision that immediately provoked demonstrations of anger in the Kurdish community, in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision could greatly complicate the government's task, which has just given the Kurdish community a hand in trying to put an end to 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society Party (DTP) was dissolved because it had become the "focus of activities that undermined the independence of the State and its indivisible unity," the President of the Court, Hasim Kiliç, told the press after four days of discussions.
The decision of the 11 judges was unanimous, although only a seven-vote majority was needed to obtain the dissolution, Kiliç said, adding that 37 of the party's leaders, including its president Ahmet Türk and MP Aysel Tugluk, are separated from political life for five years.
The judge also announced the cessation of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Türk and Tugluk, and the confiscation of the party's property by the Treasury.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (550).
Its leaders warned before the verdict that Members would leave Parliament before they were parliamentarians without a party label.
The decision follows a procedure launched by Supreme Court Prosecutor Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya in 2007, accusing the DTP of obeying the "principles" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many other countries.
Many observers believe that DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
However, the party claims that it does not have "organic links" with the PKK, but refuses to qualify it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The verdict of the Court intervenes at the moment when the government lends a hand to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen their rights, so that the Kurds stop supporting the PKK and thus put an end to the conflict.
DTP leaders stated that a dissolution could lead to an upsurge in tensions in Southeast Anatolia, where a large number of demonstrations against the conditions of detention of PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan degenerated into clashes with the police over the past few weeks.
Since the announcement of justice, thousands of protesters have gathered in front of the DTP premises in Diyarbakir, the great city of the Southeast mostly inhabited by Kurds.
The Order Forces threw tear grenades and used water cannons, while protesters threw Molotov bombs or rocks with slings.
In Istanbul, about 100 people were also concentrated.
After the verdict, Türk stated that the decision of the justice system was "to deepen discouragement."
Turkey cannot resolve this issue (Kurdah, NDLR) by dissolving a party, it told the press.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also regrets the decision.
At first we oppose the closure of parties.
This does not solve anything, said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
This decision completely boycotts the democratic opening launched by the government, political analyst Ahmet Insel commented.
We can expect, of course, a reaction from the PKK, he added.
This Thursday, the PKK was attacked in which seven soldiers died three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the bloodiest attacks in recent months.
Snows can start suddenly
A truly cool winter is what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
At all it is something with which you want to make life impossible for citizens, comments the director of road maintenance in winter of the EDF
But with this your employees can learn to test and master the entire vehicle technology.
Meteorologists may announce it for the first time at the weekend.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to deal with snow and ice.
In this case, the EDF acts in accordance with a detailed plan.
As soon as it snows profusely in Frankfurt and temperatures fall below zero degrees, 20 of the so-called A sections come out with large salt vehicles, Brauburger explains.
For example, major arteries and avenues such as Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße are included.
But also the accesses for the fire department, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and sections with slopes, such as the Atzelbergstraße.
The service of the EDF starts around three in the morning
Approximately 1,040 kilometres should be covered, as necessary, in a maximum of three hours with wet salt, which adheres better.
That is why the EDF starts around three o'clock in the morning, "with this the roads are free until the traffic starts at peak hours."
The hard part is when it starts snowing around 7:30.
"Then we have a problem," says the director of road maintenance in winter, "because then no one is ready to clear space for salt vehicles."
Immediately afterwards, when it is no longer snowing, it is up to the secondary and private roads, to which the Rat-Beil-Straße also belongs.
The last priority is on the side and secondary streets.
That's where the troubles are generated, Brauburger knows well.
Around five o'clock in the morning the FES infantry is launched, mainly the dangerous points and cruises are cleared.
In general, the EDF could not be responsible for all bicycle lanes.
In Frankfurt there is a special service, which from 22 to 4:30 does not lose sight mainly of the bridges, says Brauberburger.
As these become slippery quickly, the salted vehicle starts as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees.
In case of an emergency, the police can also call them.
The cradle of the dinosaur
The Tawa found looked the same as many other carnivorous dinosaurs: an animal two meters long and 1.50 meters high that ran on the two strong hind legs, had an elongated head with sharp and curved teeth, short arms with sickle-shaped claws and a long tail.
If the species had lived a couple of million years later, it would not have been something special.
But the Tawa found was one of the first dinosaurs with these body characteristics, reports Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in Thursday's Science magazine.
The species lived about 215 million years ago in what is now New Mexico, which at that time was in a dry area of the Pangea supercontinent in the equator.
Tawa opened a new window towards the early evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
It shows us a lot about the genealogical relationships, the propagation and characteristics of the first dinosaurs.
Nesbitt and other paleontologists began an excavation in 2006 at Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
Sometimes, we have found in one day a dozen dinosaur bones, this is something unprecedented for Triassic sediments, reports Randall Irmis, a member of the Utah Natural History Museum team.
Researchers quickly identified some bones as belonging to a new species.
In the course of the excavation they gathered in total the remains of five specimens.
A finding confirms theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt it is an exceptional finding: "The dinosaur fossils of the Triassic are extremely rare, usually only individual fragments are found."
Other dinosaur experts do not fully share such enthusiasm.
This finding is not particularly spectacular, but confirms some theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs, says for example Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to current opinion, dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
But many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, so the classification of these early dinosaurs is quite controversial.
Thus, the experts discuss, for example, when the sages were divided into their three most important genealogical lines: the carnivorous theropods among which are the Tyrannosaurus Rex, the Velociraptor and also the birds, the quadruped sauropods known as "long neck" and their relatives, and the herbivorous Ornithischia (sauri with bird pelvis), to which, for example, the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus belong.
According to the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa is a primitive theropod.
This shows an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties, says Nesbitt.
For example, in Tawa's skull, researchers found signs of air bags, such as those also owned by the descendants of the theropods, the birds.
Thanks to air bags, the breathing of birds is more efficient than that of mammals.
In the case of Tawa he also found the bones of the spine were evidently partially full of air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive airbag theropod, says Randall Irmis.
Because the related line of the posterior giant sauropods also possessed air bags and light bones, it was likely that the common predecessors of both groups already produced this useful innovation.
At least three waves of migration to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs so far known were living in South America, researchers deduce that the sages first appeared there.
Therefore, the three genealogical lines were separated at the beginning and extended from South America throughout all corners of the Earth, which at that time still formed a single earth mass, the Pangea supercontinent.
However, the facts say that the team found together with Tawa found the remains of two other teropods not closely related.
The three cannot descend from a unique related predecessor, the researchers argue.
We believe that at least three waves of migration to North America took place, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of Science.
Of course, there are also opponents.
An even older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to a brotherly group of dinosaurs, lived in present-day Poland, says the paleontologist of Bonn Martin Sander.
His opinion could give a distorted image, because simply in South America many fossils of dinosaurs continue to be preserved, while on other continents there is hardly anything to discover.
The question of how dinosaurs evolved from a relatively rare collateral line of reptiles to the dominant terrestrial vertebrates of Mesozoic remains an enigma.
Meanwhile, in the Triassic dinosaurs still shared their vital space with many other reptiles, for example with the ancestors of current crocodiles and pterosaurs and with many other sages.
Towards the end of the Triassic the dinosaurs expanded all over the world and many new species developed, while the kinship was extinguished at the limit of the Triassic towards the Jurassic.
The successful stories were not eternal
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There may have been a massive extinction that the dinosaurs survived by chance, but the other reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted, so they were able to beat the opponents in the area.
Successful stories are not always eternal.
150 million years later, an impact of meteorite brake the rise of a group of species, which had also evolved in the Triassic and since then had a miserable existence: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and international signatories.
Teachers from the University of Toronto, Cambridge, Vienna or Berkeley, California, attend.
Teachers from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen attend.
The police eviction of the busy casino at the Goethe University of Frankfurt had an impact all over the world.
278 teachers and professors from Goethe University, but also from higher education institutions across Germany, Europe, and North and South America, sympathize with students in protest at the Westend Campus.
In a statement in German and English, they "reject" the police eviction promoted by the board of directors.
Werner Müller-Estler, president of the university, evicted last week the building occupied by students and teachers on educational strike, because the walls and works of art were covered with propaganda.
As a result, five students suffered injuries.
The material damage, the signatories judge, does not justify "the violent dissolution of the courses organized by the same students and professors by a police command."
The eviction represented an "unacceptable attack" on freedom of research and learning.
The exclusive approach to vandalism served "the delegitimization and criminalization of protest" and diverted attention from content.
The Governing Council has refused to enter into the necessary negotiations.
Teachers demand the immediate withdrawal of the judicial claim.
Most occupants have not caused material damage, it is said.
Protest legitimized
The young people of the Verdi trade union and the German Federation of Trade Unions also sympathize with the students.
The protest is the legitimate expression of a growing concern for the future itself, commented Verdi's national youth secretary, Alexander Klein.
Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), Minister of Science of Hessen, nevertheless defended the performance of the rector of the university and the police.
We're grateful to the rector of the university.
Destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, he commented on an issue of Aktuelle Stunde on Thursday in the Parliament of Wiesbaden Province.
We are sympathetic to the protest, but we are not sympathetic to vandalism," said Peter Beuth, provincial parliament delegate for the CDU.
The opinion of the opposition factions, the SPD, the Greens and the left, is different.
The CDU used the painted walls as a pretext to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (left).
Instead of studying students' arguments and demands in depth, they are evicted.
The Left has submitted a motion requesting the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on police intervention.
New Silicon Valley
For many years, it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was in the Soviet Union a heavily guarded site for secret weapons investigation.
Today, the community of 216,000 inhabitants, located 37 kilometres from central Moscow, is considered to be the "Russian Silicon Valley".
Here are important research and production centers for micro and nanoelectronics.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograd have contacted the scientific headquarters of Riedberg in Frankfurt, university institutes and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
Several mutual visits were made and now, on Wednesday, Selenograd and Riedberg sign in Frankfurt a "Protocol of Close Collaboration".
Deputy Moscow Mayor Juri Rosljak and Selengrad Mayor Anatoly Smirnov led the Russian delegation; by Frankfurt signed the head of planning services Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and directors of small and medium-sized enterprises at the Natural Sciences Research Centre will travel to a seminar in Selenograd.
Scientific exchange
This is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it also deals with trade relations.
FIZ companies will have the opportunity to set foot in the growing Russian market.
In return, Russian scientific companies want to have access to contracts in Germany.
Selenograd is home to important Russian companies and research institutes.
These include, for example, the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, the large Sitronics and Rossijskaja Elektronika consortia.
The community was founded in 1958 as the so-called "City of Socialist Planning" for weapons research.
Selenograd (literally translated "Green City") received its name from the forested mountain landscape, where research facilities were established.
Stuttgart brakes
The Stuttgart 21 Dimension is not at all high enough.
For the supporters of the project it is simply and simply "the new heart of Europe".
The law so. S21 is much more than the reduction of a railway station, rather than a monstrous construction project, which will precipitate the capital of the Banden-Württemberga region a decade of chaos from irremediable construction sites.
Stuttgart 21 emerged from the spirit of the 1980s.
Terminals with rails, which end up in the middle of the city, were then considered 19th-century engineering fossils, which acted as brakes of modern rail traffic, since a huge amount of time was formerly needed to engage the locomotives back and forth.
Roll, stop dry continue the journey; but so must be done.
And that's why the terminals had to disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a passing station, which is located approximately half way from the trans-European lines of operation between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava; hence the slogan of "Heart of Europe".
The S21 will really be started, even though the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious designers have known that in the Hessian and Bavarian capitals it is almost impossible to implement the reduction.
The railway terminals of course do not have any more problems with entry and exit, since there are reversible locomotives with tractor unit and driver's car at both ends.
However: Stuttgart 21 including the new section built ICE towards Ulm will already be started.
Federal and communal politicians have arranged this.
The railway continues, also because the risks of the Republic's large individual infrastructure projects are borne by the taxpayer and not by the State.
From the urban point of view, the project is still justified to some extent.
New urban space is created, provided with many green areas, probably from computer-generated graphics by the designer.
For the rail transport system the S21 is harmful.
The passing station and the road support are designed for the transport of people, which was attributed to the enormous typical growth of the 1980s.
At that time there was no competition for low-cost flights.
But modern transport policy must first be concerned with strengthening freight transport, as rail transport is considerably more environmentally friendly than road haulage.
However, the new sections under construction are good for freight trains due to the intense gradients.
Even more serious is that the S21 also indirectly affects many other railway projects.
More than EUR 6 billion must be buried in the Zuavos.
That's the official figure.
Experts consider it more realistic between ten and fifteen billion.
It is certain that in the next decade the money will be missing at other crosses and narrow passages on the net.
A total of 60 major projects are on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the extension of more than 180 kilometers of long rails across the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987 the route has been built slowly.
It would be urgent here to step on the accelerator properly.
However, the S21 acts as a brake.
The section of the Rhine Valley will be the bottleneck for the international transport of goods: through the heart of Europe.
The government examines the judgment on the airport.
The federal government leaves pending in the Wiesbaden Autonomous Parliament, if it is going to file an appeal to the judgment on the ban on night flights of the Hesse Administrative Court.
The CDU/FDP coalition seems to have tasked experts with the legal investigation of the 400-page VGH ruling, according to Minister of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP).
The administrative court in Kassel had stated in writing on this date that in the case of the construction of the north-west runway planned at Frankfurt airport, the federated state would have to re-regulate the ban on night flights.
The admission of 17 flights between 23 and 5 hours, as foreseen by the federal government, would not be compatible with the mandatory legal protection of the population from noise due to air traffic.
The coalition has to decide until 4 January, whether it is going to file the appeal against this sentence.
The opposition criticized this postponement and pressured government representatives to waive the appeal to the National Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD group, Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel, urged the CDU and the FDP to respect their promises to ban night air traffic, which they had made before the elections, otherwise this could be taken as a lack of speech.
It is quite difficult, if you let one fulfill his word, said the head of the Green Tarek Al-Wazir, referring to the slogan of the FDP "We fulfill our word".
Minister Posch rejected the recrimination of Schäfer-Gümbel, which the federative government would be trying by misrepresentation of the law and tricks still obtaining their night flights.
Extensive legal research would take a long time.
The coalition would not like to act on the basis of a "quick first impression".
"We need a legally binding decision," said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As the opposition stands for it, it would never have been his group's assertions about the nocturnal air traffic ban.
U.S. banks repay the aid provided.
The big American banks shaken by the crisis are stripped of their state bonds.
The "Bank of America" returned all the aid provided to it by the Tarp bank rescue fund of a total of 45 billion (approximately 30 billion euros).
And also the Citi group plans to return state aid, according to a report from the CNBC of the United States.
With this the institutes intend to free themselves from the restrictions that had gone hand in hand with the acceptance of the money, such as the limitation in the payment of bonuses to directors, as well as the payment of high fees.
The Bank of America had obtained approximately 19 billion cash through convertible bonds.
The rest of the sum was taken from the box itself, which had quite a few means, among others for the sale of items.
The bank director Kenneth Lewis thanked the US taxpayers especially on Wednesday night: the financial injection helped to overcome very difficult times.
The bank had miscalculated the effort of absorption of the investment bank in the climax of the financial crisis.
The Citi group also aims to raise money in the capital market in order to be able to free itself from its obligations vis-à-vis the state.
The CNBC reported from a source of known circles, that the American bank could already announce by this Thursday the increase of its capital by 20 billion dollars.
A representative of the Citi group did not wish to comment.
By June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had returned their aid.
Rapid election
In the end, everything was faster than thought.
Just two weeks after the administrative council of the ZDF (German television channel) pressured editor Nikolaus Brender to leave his post, the channel can present a successor.
Last night the guild wanted to vote about the candidate.
The favourite was Peter Frey, director of the ZDF's main studio in Berlin.
There was no confirmation of this on the part of the station, officially in order not to anticipate the procedure.
But it certainly also influenced not to further harm the director of the ZDF Markus Schächter, if this proposal would not be approved on the administrative board either.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the union.
The result of the vote was not yet in place at the close of this edition.
Two weeks ago Schächter failed on the board of directors with his proposal to renew for another five years the contract of Nikolaus Brender.
Only seven members supported Brender, seven voted against him. Brender's dismissal was a bitter failure for Schächter, but a failure that could be expected.
Because the majority of the Union on the Administrative Council had already indicated weeks before the election that they would not support Brender in his post.
The opposition against the editor-in-chief had been organized by Hesse's president, Mr. Roland Koch.
He declined another mandate from the prestigious editor with the argument, that under the direction of Brender the ZDF news would have lost ratings.
Until just before the election there were protests due to this, in which he flagged the political influence on the ZDF.
In the end, 35 public law specialists had even been involved in the debate, which classified Koch's course as unconstitutional.
But it didn't do any good.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and Romanesque philology.
He then worked on the station "Südwestfunk" and on the newspaper "Frankfurter Rundschau".
In 1983 it was changed to the ZDF, in principle to the news "heute-journal".
Next stations: 1988 to 1990 personal rapporteur of the editor; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 director and conductor of the morning program "Morgenmagazines"; until 2001 director of the foreign policy of the ZDF; since then director of the study of the ZDF in the capital.
The political party of the Greens announced a constitutional demand after the dismissal of Brender, who was still elected this Wednesday as a journalist of the year by the media magazine "Medium Magazin".
Koch's opposite on the administrative board, the president of the government of Rhineland-Palatinate, explained last week that the federated states should change the ZDF state agreement in such a way that the director's staff proposals cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
A withdrawal of politicians in favour of the ZDF control unions was ruled out by Beck.
Brender's likely successor, Mr. Peter Frey, was recommended to the board of directors with an intelligent move: he strongly criticized the guild for Brender's dismissal.
Thanks to this test of journalistic independence both Schächter was able to appoint him for the post of editor without losing his face, as the administrative council was able to vote, without falling under the suspicion of giving the position to a secuous supporter.
In the calculations of the Frey parties it is awarded anyway to the left-wing liberals.
University careers clear
Partial success for students: after a year of education-related strikes, the Ministers of Education and Culture of the federated states finally gave in. At a meeting of the Ministers of Education and Culture with university rectors, both sides agreed to try to improve the conditions of study in the cases of bachelor's and master's degrees.
Students in the future should be able to overcome their careers.
For example, they agreed to reduce the burden of exams: basically each module of the race must end with a single exam.
In addition, it is intended to examine the workload of students, and it is intended to ensure a "real and justifiable measure".
Politics and universities also want to simplify the recognition of exam results between universities within and outside Germany.
The federated states are committed to making the structural rules together for Bachelor and Master races in a more flexible way.
Rules of the federated states that diverge from this, should no longer exist.
Less examinations
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, the Ministers of Education and Culture and the rectors of the universities have been constantly talking about the improvement of being able to carry out and successfully complete a career (studyability).
Now for the first time there was talk of a specific content.
The so-called accreditation board agreed to drastically reduce the number of exams: "Each module ends with a single exam", is said in a 30-page document, which aims to partially regulate the approval of university careers.
The "significant reduction in the burden of examinations" is intended to avoid development in the wrong direction, which would significantly affect studentability, as explained by the director of the accreditation board, Mr.Reinhold Grimm.
In addition, in the future "studyability" must be the decisive criterion in configuration.
Modules and contents should be examined in detail as to unnecessary restrictions on students in the choice of..
the courses.
Students would have "the right to obtain more spaces, which enable and encourage their own initiative".
These rules would apply to new races, but also to the examination of existing races.
These should be "re-credited" again every five years. But this would mean, it would take until 2015 to examine all races.
Those responsible for this would be throughout the country 10 accreditation agencies, which are under the supervision of the accreditation board, which is set up by the federated states.
The ministers of education and culture urged the federated states in October to influence the agencies in such a way that the number of subjects and examinations are not too strict or demanding.
In some federated states universities and technical schools have already agreed with ministries to take such measures.
So far only Rhineland-Platinate has ensured to provide additional means for the further development of the Bologna process.
With this money, universities must implement tutoring and student counseling programs, as well as strengthen exam and foreign offices.
The Federal State and universities intend to have EUR 10 million for these purposes.
In early 2010, the government wanted to bring to parliament a novel of university law.
According to her, only one exam should be sufficient for the completion of a career model.
The career configuration should be made more flexible, in addition to ensuring recognition of evaluations at other universities and facilitating accessibility to the Master.
Until the end of next year, it is intended to examine all the careers about their "studyability".
This Thursday the government and the opposition again discussed the conditions for studying in the federated state.
Apart from the praises there were also criticisms about the decisions.
At the federal board of directors of the Juso (young socialist) university groups, it was required that the configuration of educational policy should no longer be carried out "behind closed doors" of ministers and university rectors.
No later than after the education strikes, students as main involved should now be able to comment as well.
The president of the university board of directors (HRK), Margret Wintermantel, gave her support to the students: "We need the experience of the students," she said on Thursday in a meeting with the Ministers of Education, with which the HRK discussed a joint reform document.
For the education and science union (GEW) the Bonn agreements were not enough: the union requires a legal right for each student with the Bachelor's degree to have access to a subsequent Master's degree.
In addition, the federated states have to ensure that for the current generation of Bachelor's students there will be sufficient study places for Master with the best possible study conditions in the future. This was reported by a member of the GEW, Mr. Andreas Keller.
The federated states have to hire a lot more teachers.
But about greater access to the master's degree, the Ministers of Education made no comments.
More than a footnote about Herta Müller
"Entering and leaving Germany is virtually out of control" says the first line of a poem by lyric Werner Söllner in disequilibrating idiomatic fragments, in which he themes the experiences of arrival in Germany lived by a dissident, who gained his freedom, but lost the environment of his language.
Werner Söllner, who was born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, initially worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest, and later as a reader in a children's book publishing house, before moving to Frankfurt in 1982.
Söllner received several literature awards, in 1993 he gave memorable lessons or poetry talks in Frankfurt at Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been director of the literature forum in Hesse at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He said he talked a lot last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich about "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the disfigured mirror of his Securitate files"
Visibly insecure and ashamed, Söllner read a statement in which he admitted participation as IM in the Romanian secret service Securiitate in front of fellow German-Roman writers, among others Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
Together with some of those present in 1989, Söllner had received the German Language Award.
Attempts to recruit had begun slowly in early 1971.
"I am therefore someone who did not defend himself sufficiently in the face of attempts to provoke fear of the Securitate," Söllner concluded.
The lyric Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time as the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature to Herta Müller and his unmatched literary controversy with the mechanisms of dictatorial domination, the literary scene is shaken and, in particular, the community of German authors from Romania is shaken by a case that shows the abysses and evil of a political system, which is based on control and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we know, not only the author, but also the victim.
In his file of Securiitate IM Walter had played a role, literary scientist Michael Markel said after Söllner's confession, and stressed the positive influence for him of IM Walter.
He had excused or defended him in every difficult spot for him, Markel said.
"I feel the moral need to make this statement," he said.
Söllner's statement in this form and in front of this audience was unexpected, the confession of a former dissident and his work with the Romanian secret service, however, is not so surprising.
Germany would have been a comfortable refuge for spies of the Securiitate-Spitzel gewesen, wrote Herta Müller already in the month of July in the weekly "Zeit", after having read his own 914-page file.
Those involved will surely have speculated and will have known in some cases, what names were hidden behind the pseudonyms of Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
Unlike the review of the Stasi files with a controlled procedure in Germany, the treatment with the control files by Securité is still quite diffuse.
Systematic clarification has been boycotted and hampered in recent years.
A national council for the clarification of the files of the Securiitate (CNSAS), corresponding to the authority Birthler, was formed in 1999, and the handing over of the files since then is rather a trace.
Since 2005, there has been a law regulating the administration of records.
An interview, following the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature to Herta Müller, proves that the influence of former members of the Securité in Romania is still quite great. In this interview a former head of the Securiitate of Temesvar spoke contemptively of the decorated.
"She has psychosis," in the end she was only questioned once.
The infamy of power seemed to be able to be shown without turns in the form of freedom of opinion.
Of course, inevitable questions arise with the Söllner case, as many times when there is silent guilt.
Why just now? Who was harmed? The calm reaction of the listeners to Söllner's confession lets hope that the continuation of this story will be governed more by the eagerness of knowledge and not so much by the attribution of guilt and shame.
For the genesis of Herta Müller's work, which yesterday accepted the Nobel Prize in Literature, it is more than just a footnote.
The Champions League as a garrison to fill the stomach
When the new coach of Stuttgart's VfB football team, Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag from his team's supplier, boarded a Class C Mercedes taxi a quarter of an hour after midnight, he gave the impression that an elegantly dressed outside service member was leaving a very pleasant Christmas celebration, in which the sports goods manufacturer had distributed samples.
The bald man had hired a driver because he still didn't know the city.
Otherwise, he could also have driven the car himself: after all, there was no alcohol at stake, and neither was the 55 - year - old man drunk of joy.
It had been a pleasant evening, but tomorrow would start work again.
Or I'd start for the first time.
In the words of the Swiss, who had been hired just three days before: "It is true that we reached the eighth in the final", namely, in the Champions League, thanks to triumph 3:1 against Unirea Urziceni of Romania, "but we cannot let ourselves be blinded by success: we will have to fight brutally against the descent."
The "much more important task" was waiting for them the following Sunday, he said.
Then, it will be necessary to repeat in Magncia the success of the "real classes" in the daily life of the league.
And eliminate the weaknesses, which have been clearly demonstrated again, after the fast three goals of Marica (5), Träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Luck
The eighth finals of the Champions League (starting on 16/17 and 23/24 February/turning off 9/10 and 16/17 March) will be drawn on 18 December in Nyon.
So joy was kept limited by the fulminant entrance of Babbel's successor.
Not only in the supposed savior, who had soon inspired them to the disconcerted Stuttgart profession trust in themselves, willingness to surrender and taste for the game.
I went with the players and told them that they had to focus on their strengths, I urged them to be more launched, explained the soul repairer Gross his recipe for success that sounds so simple, but that with the therapist Babbel had no effect anymore.
He displayed a certain magic, accepted Babbel's supporter, Jens Lehmann, "when a new impulse arises in football, sometimes things happen that would not have been thought possible."
And Sami Khedira, who after a few weeks' break due to an injury immediately advanced to become the best local player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the "phenomenon" perceived with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the way the new boss works: "He is a man who intervenes thoroughly, and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation."
And this is what was obviously missing when Babbel was there.
The VfB Stuttgart has not yet passed the test, sports manager Horst Heldt warns
But the VfB Stuttgart needs above all constancy.
Like Gross, players and the administrator also refrained from overestimating the triumph against a defense weakened by a lack of relief and totally overtaken by Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen with 0:4 had arrived the sad awakening, gave Khedira thought.
And manager Horst Heldt warned that while one goal of the season had been achieved, the other was still far away.
We haven't gotten over the problem yet.
That Heldt did not want to celebrate on his 40th birthday, even after the first victory at his home for three months, was due to the events of the weekend, which were updated again in the form of a television interview, broadcast just before the start of the game, which had been granted by goalkeeper Jens Lehmann.
There are decisions that others make, and not Jens, faced Heldt's harsh criticism of Lehmann.
He had criticized weakness in the leadership of the board, which had decided to change coach due to pressure from teenage fanatics.
Also that his day off after the games had been eliminated, Lehmann described him as a sign of lack of sovereignty and hostility.
Lehmann's statements were "marked by pure selfishness," Heldt said, and announced consequences for the zaguero.
They probably won't be friends forever, the two quarantines.
But at least they agreed with everyone else that, without previous efforts with the replacement coach's team, it would not have been possible for the show to be of great force of play and battle.
Babbel and his assistants had "an important part in success," Heldt and Lehmann said in unison; and the plastic bagman also agreed.
World Heavyweight Championship Fight
Burning mourning in Bern: The challenger Kevin Johnsonn has been provoking the world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title in the WBC version.
The judges' trial was unanimous.
Hamburg: Vitali Klitschko is still a heavyweight world champion.
The 38-year-old champion in the version of the WBC Association won the American Kevin Johnson on Friday night in Bern by unanimous decision by points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko it was his third successful defense of the title since his return in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was twice the world champion of the WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, the knockout that everyone had expected could not be carried out.
Klitschko expanded his balance to 39 wins in 41 professional fights, twice he had to give up due to his injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to accept the first defeat in his fight number 24.
In front of some 17000 spectators in the Berne Arena, Klitschko, with a height of 2.02 meters, wanted to dictate the fight above all with his left hand.
But Johnson, 11 centimeters lower, who had proclaimed the end of the Klitschko era before the duel, was shunning the world champion's blows over and over again, so Klitschko could not decisively bring his dangerous right hand to his goal.
Generally speaking, passive Johnson did too little for a challenger, and only tried to pass the rounds.
While he was provoking Klitschko with words and gestures, his blows only rarely reached the world champion.
However, he is now the second boxer, after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who endured twelve full rounds with Klitschko.
Before the fight, the challenger had already produced a certain scandal in the Swiss capital.
He had insulted Klitschko as a "horrible zombie," who "can't do anything."
When he made the weighing, the champion let himself be provoked on Friday to remove Johnson's sunglasses from his nose "so he could see his eyes."
Fourth triumph after Klitschko's return
Also in his fourth fight after his return on 11 October 2008, Klitschko remained invincible.
After a break of almost four years, he defeated Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin at the time, and had recovered his WBC belt, which he had previously had to deliver without a fight.
That year he defeated Juan Carlos Gómez of Cuba in his defenses of the title, and in September Chris Arreola of the United States.
In this fight I only received one blow, and I'm in very good physical condition, I had explained Klitschko's quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains to gather all four important titles in his family.
His brother Vladimir is the world champion of the WBO and IBF associations.
However, the belt belongs to the British David Haye, after he dethroned Nikolai Valujev, 2.13 meters tall, in November.
In the previous summer, Haye had canceled a fight against Vitali Klitschko planned for September.
Supposedly, the company that promotes it is already planning the fight against Klitschko at Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz case
Frontal attack by the opposition: the leader of the Green Group, Jürgen Trittin, called the Minister of Defence, Gutenberg, a liar because of false information about the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and the leftists demand an explanation from the Chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin – After the most recent revelations about Kunduz's air attack, the opposition has accused the Minister of Defence, Karl-Theodor zu Gutenberg (CSU), of knowingly deceiving.
On Saturday's "Tagesschau" news broadcast, broadcast by ARD TV channel, the head of the Green Group, Jürgen Trittin, said the minister "had not knowingly told the truth" about the deadly bombing of two convoys.
In such a case, it is usually said: he said lies.
The order to kill would have been given without taking into account the rules of the International Protection Force for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of NATO's report, which Mr Gutenberg has read, Trittin said.
On Friday, it had been announced that this attack was not only about destroying the hijacked trucks, but also about intentionally killing two Taliban leaders.
In the United States air strike, requested by the German commander of Kunduz, Colonel Klein, according to the NATO investigation report, up to 142 people were killed or injured.
The Greens, the SPD and the Left urged Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to speak immediately before the federal parliament and to clarify what Gutenberg really knew about the incident.
Ms. Merkel needs to clarify whether a strategy of intentional murder is part of the policy of Afghanistan of the federal government, and whether the chancellery, army and information service have approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and his Green Renate Künast colleague demanded.
The government spokesman, Ulrich Wilhelm, resolutely rejected the criticism.
The chancellery did not exert any influence on the concrete actions of the German army in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, doubts had also been expressed about the Ministry ' s presentation on the grounds of the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL, both had informed Gutenberg correctly and completely about the background of the attack on convoys.
Officially, they had been said to have denied the existence of NATO reports and had concealed sensitive details from the Minister.
However, from the environment of the two high-ranking officials it was clear that they had even pointed out to the Ministry of Defence the existence of several reports, including a two-page document by Colonel Klein, who was in command, and a report by a field patrol.
Meanwhile, Wichert would have asked in a letter to clarify the matter, reports the newspaper "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung".
So far it has not received an answer, it was said.
The ministry did not express itself on Saturday regarding the criticisms made to it, and noted that this would be clarified in the Federal Parliament's commission of inquiry, which will be set up next Wednesday.
Oniric worlds
In a waking state, some people see images and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only in the case of the mentally ill and in the drug addicts, the limits between imagination and reality fade.
As long as it happens during sleep, everything is in order.
When we are lying in our dark rooms with our eyes closed, we can give ourselves unhindered to the wildest imaginations and creations of fantasy.
However, anyone who experiences sleep-like states during the vigil, or sees and hears things that others do not see or hear, is considered most of the time in the modern Western world to be crazy or drug addict, or at least to be a maniac.
But such images and voices not only arise in the mentally ill or in the drug addicts.
The fault is our imagination: the same neuronal processes that allow us to design houses, paint paintings or write novels, sometimes cause the boundaries between sleep, madness and reality to be blurred.
Onirically modified states of alert consciousness can appear in the most diverse forms, at best we call them visions, and at worst, madness.
Although triggers and effects can be distinguished, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the psychedelic experiences of the prophet of the New Age Carlos Castañeda, the states of Chamanic possession, and psychosis and hallucinations can be referred to similar processes.
Hallucinations or deliriums arise when the balance of the neuronal substances of communication in the brain – especially dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and acetylcholine – has been untied and the interaction between various parts of the brain is disturbed.
During schizophrenic psychosis very often complex hallucinations and crazy thoughts appear.
Gravity no longer has power over him.
The relationship between madness and sleep has occupied philosophers and doctors since ancient times.
Aristotle conceived hallucinations as a form of sleep in a waking state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, observed in 1861 a "great resemblance of the state of madness with the dream states", for Sigmund Freud, the dream was even "a psychosis, with all the misconceptions, crazy formations, and mirrorisms of it".
It's the fall of 2001, when Henning T. becomes a comic book figure.
His body is two-dimensional and scandalously colorful.
Gravity no longer has power over it, it's floating near the ceiling of the room.
He feels a kick.
Behind him, figures of demons with wings, with red mussels like blood, deformed, snorting their teeth.
They're chasing him, kicking him with heavy, flaming boots, throwing him against the walls, he feels the pains all over the body.
Strict and malignant voices resonate from the walls and the radio.
He can't stand them anymore, the voices that insult him and offend him.
Henning T. starts two wires from the stereo, ties them to form a hanging knot, and fixes them to a hook on the ceiling.
He goes up into a horn and puts the knot around his neck.
Jump.
The rope is loose.
"Go to the clinic and make them heal you!" the voices shout in a choir that blows his eardrums.
Now, Henning T. is 40 years old and has experienced six acute psychosis, the last one two years ago, the first one almost 20 years ago.
The cause that produced it was the LSD.
His diagnosis is schizo-affective-paranoid psychosis, and he is manic-depressive, he takes drugs, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, for three years he has been married.
In psychosis I have experienced the most terrible anguish and the deepest despair, he says.
Hallucinations are a cruel reality
Approximately one percent of the population falls ill at least once in the life of schizophrenia; psychiatric clinics treat it as the second most common disease after depression.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis, most of the times those affected can no longer distinguish between the outside and the inside world, and they fall into a state of overexcitedness that can lead to hallucinations, delusions of greatness, disorders in the relationship, or persecutory mania.
Especially widespread is hearing voices: voices that give orders, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also common.
The affected person is no longer able to distinguish what is important from what is not, the brain can no longer filter out the disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like sleep, psychosis also opens the gates to a torrent of ideas and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is focused on the subject, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, chief physician of the general psychiatric clinic at Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrenic is at the center of events, everything has a meaning directed at it.
At the same time he enters a passive role, as in a dream, he feels overwhelmed by events and cannot organize them actively.
That is why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
In general it is not possible to adjust reality to them, hallucinations are a cruel reality, awakening, impossible.
Having experienced a hallucination once in a lifetime
Unlike in a dream, says Fuchs, "the spatial and sensory structure of reality that is perceived in psychosis remains in principle as it is."
The paranoid thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the distancing of experience takes place in reality.
For the researchers still an unknown why our brain makes cabrioles.
According to Fuchs, states of emergency can lead anyone to lose contact with reality on an interim basis.
But not all people develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic disposition for schizophrenia, but studies in twins have shown that in addition to genes there are also other determining factors.
Researchers assume that those affected suffer minimal brain damage.
We suspect that the neuronal maturity of the brain is affected at an early stage of development, such as through a mother's viral disease during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But it is still an unknown how this alteration of the neuronal system occurs, which also does not manifest itself at all for many years.
The influence of the environment also plays an important role – stress or a traumatic experience can be the triggers of a psychosis when there is already a previous disposition.
Similarly, hallucinogenic drugs can cause psychosis, as they interfere with the brain's transmitting system.
When the brain heats up
The logic of all this is that psychotic people suffer from their hallucinations and take very expensive medicines to get rid of them, while others pay for drugs that allow them to experience some, says Professor Erich Kasten, of Lübeck.
Perceiving a hallucination as pleasant or not often depends on the point of view.
Kasten has been collecting reports on hallucinations and visions for ten years and has analyzed the results in the book Die irreale Welt in unserem Kopf (The Unreal World in Our Head), published last year.
The hallucinations are among the typical accompanying symptoms of psychosis, but also, surprisingly, of many other diseases.
Among them are, along with mental disorders such as personality limit disorder or depressions, often also diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's and head trauma .
in a surprising way and under certain conditions, the brain of healthy people also suffers hallucinations.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, are composed of memories that are usually repressed.
They arise when the areas of the brain in which sensory perceptions are processed are overactive or poorly cohibited; when our brain gets warm, but also when there is a lack of stimuli.
Drugs can cause this state in the same way as brain damage or psychosis.
But also the restriction of stimuli, stress, the evil of love or other states of emergency brain.
In jüngeren Studien gab bis zu einem Drittel der Befragten an, mindestens einmal im Leben eine Halluzination erlebt zu haben.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. was 16, living in a small town in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and attending a secondary school.
A regular girl.
If it wasn't for those images and the voices.
Sometimes, during recess, it happens that a clumsy boy with long, dark hair directs the word to him.
When she answers, the other students look at her surprised; no one, apart from her, hears or sees the boy.
They think the shy girl is a bit of a dreamer, but Sarah K. knows she's not dreaming.
She's awake and she sees and hears that boy, the same way she sees and hears the girl sitting on the bench next door.
You can even feel your presence, at least a few moments.
It's a nice feeling, he likes the kid.
Sometimes she wonders if she's crazy.
He also knows that the boy and the rest of the visions are not real and disappear.
At night, the apparitions are alarming.
Visions are often a burden.
When he is in class he can sometimes not follow the lesson because the teacher – in his eyes and ears – is presenting a new companion, while for the rest he explains the mathematical equations visibly and audibly.
At night, the apparitions are alarming.
While waiting in the dark room for the sleep to arrive, which often comes late and is scarce, he does not know whether he is awake or dreaming, whether the images he sees, the bites or the girl with bloody cuts in her arms and legs, appear in front of his eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, he yells at the figures.
Her parents and friends haven't told anything, they'd think she's crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. She's 20 today.
She approved selectivity last year and lives with her boyfriend.
It's been a year since the hallucinations disappeared.
Ever since she's been in contact via the Internet with psychologist Kasten, she knows she's not crazy.
Insanity is also a work of art out of despair.
According to Kasten, when a person is socially isolated or suffers from a restriction of stimuli, it is very likely that after a while he will start hallucinating.
I think the brain is unoccupied and takes care of itself to look for entertainment.
Sarah K., an only child, was afraid of the other children and often played alone.
His hallucinations began when, at the age of 13, he learned that the man he calls Dad since he has been using reason is not his biological father.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same areas of the brain that also process real impressions and noises, those affected like Sarah K. They find it difficult to distinguish between visions and reality. "Every experience," says Kasten, "has a place in the brain, reality is projected there.
Hallucinations are also images that the brain produces, so they seem so real."
Kasten also classifies night fantasies as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those of acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, psychically healthy people are able to recognize their visions as unreal.
Kasten therefore recommends that patients appreciate their hallucinations as a special skill.
Limit situation between sleep and hallucination
in this world too consciously focused, imaginary experiences usually become pathological, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and chief physician of the psychiatry and psychotherapy clinic of the Florence-Nightingale-Krankenhauses hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a harsh and painful disease that also involves something positive and creative – madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has investigated so-called oneirism, a special form of consciousness, which is perceived as a dream.
The dream hallucinations are almost very complex and detailed dreams that the person who experiences them considers to be real and that can subsequently not differentiate from being awake.
Oniric conscious states arise in extreme situations associated with trauma or disease, such as in patients with polyradiculoneuropathy, who experience motor paralysis being fully conscious. die bei vollem Bewusstsein eine motorische Lähmung erleben.
According to Schmidt-Degenhardt, when a person is threatened by a loss of self or the world due to a total and permanent motor disability, it replaces a very dangerous real situation with a self-imaginary world that is disconnected from reality.
A form of boundary situation between sleep and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome a situation in reality, there is a change of world, although the real situation remains present in the imagination.
An intensive way of giving meaning and interpretation to an untenable situation in itself that our own capacity for creation allows us not to sink into the nothingness of the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
Also the art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen of Zurich describes his dream experiences in his book Herzenwechsel as an action to save the soul.
He was 49 years old, when his conscience embarked on several days' journeys after an operation of heart valves with included heart transplantation, while his body was condemned to immobility at the intensive care station.
Claussen immersed himself in a world created by him and visited strange places of other times: he was prostrated in bed, an older man aboard a sanatorium on a train, a robot was watching for his health.
It was seen in the high Middle Ages, surrounded by nobles who produced narcotics from blood.
A Greek on a motorcycle kidnapped him in his home country, surfed his hospital bed in the Alps with snow and found a Korean mobster.
It gives everything in these imaginary facts, everything is real, even later in memories.
For Claussen, these inner journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
Dreaming is a different state, thus describing your experience.
On the contrary, the memories of mental journeys are, many years later, much clearer, even in irrelevant details.
Clearer and more intensive even than real experiences.
The intensity of this experience dilutes the horizon of the rest of our daily experiences, adds psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, oneirism, psychosis, hallucinations and drug use show how fragile the inner reproduction of outer reality is, even when we are awake.
Every change in the state of consciousness, summarizes psychologist Kasten, "can lead to a distortion of what we call reality."
An experience that, on the other hand, can be completely enriching.

The children will take care of the editorial at 27 years old
The new editor Kallen has come to an interim solution: Hubert Burda wants to leave his company in the future in the hands of his two children, he told SPIEGEL.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
Hamburg – Editor Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the future.
The two children become heirs at the age of 27 and have the firm will to enter the company, confirmed Burda, 69, to SPIEGEL.
Details have been arranged as a precautionary measure.
The next question is whether they will participate actively in the company.
Also, if they are able to do so.
One cannot put 7,500 workers in front of their children if they are not sufficiently trained to do so.
That would take out the kids and also the company.
Burda announced on Thursday that he will retire from the chair of the board of directors in January and that Paul-Bernhard Kallen has been appointed his successor.
This member of the Kallen family, of 52, has been a member of Burda's management since 1999.
At first he was responsible for technology.
Later, he took over the treasury and with it came the responsibility for the company's assets. After the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer also took over direct marketing, foreign, printing and finance.
For the first time, no family member occupies the peak of the editorial.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old. His son Felix, currently 42 years old, died a few years ago.
Kallen's designation also serves to, "save the differences of 10, 15 years," according to Burda.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
With a look at the Schickedanz and Schaeffle cases, Burda said that family businesses are also not safe from decadence: "This has always affected families who let themselves be infected by the desire to seek capital, who have misjudged and thought that they could rise as well as the biggest player.
That's never been my strategy.
"I've never had delusions of greatness," Burda says.
I don't see myself as a political preceptor of this country, as Springer was, and I don't want to play with Time in the world league either; those businesses have grown too big.
Full Beauty
Everything you can desire, in the matter of beauty and well-being, within reach of your hand.
This is what seems to have been proposed El Corte Inglés, which has just inaugurated in the shopping center of Callao (Madrid) a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2 dedicated to the care and care of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, has prestigious signatures such as Hedonai - who is in charge of laser waxing-; Spaxion, with relaxation rooms and cosmetic treatments; Luis & Tachi hairdressers; Marina d'Or, who owns a gym, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a feeding section, where the teapot stands out, with more than 130 different classes of this infusion.
Enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner as you contemplate the unbeatable views of the capital, or rent for two hours the relaxation area to mount your own 'beauty party' with eight of your friends and relax with a jacuzzi session, massages and a glass of champagne are some of the possibilities that Spaxión offers.
In total there are 250 m2 distributed in 12 rooms to perform the latest and most novel facial, body and hydrotherapy treatments.
For example, cavitation to combat cellulite or vibratory platforms.
The gym also has these machines, as well as virtual 'trainers' who guide the customer's steps, offering them a fully personalized treatment.
Everything starts by inserting your personal key into a touchscreen, located in front of the machine.
Then, several videos show us how to perform our exercise table correctly.
Its director assures that 15 minutes (including heating and stretching) are enough to exercise all the muscles of the body.
And, if after exercising our body, we want to go through the hairdresser, the firm Luis & Tachi has a room where rituals of hair recovery, luminosity or nutrition are offered in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the premises of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year, from 10:00 in the morning to 22:00 in the evening.
Varying Scots
Christmas is approaching and it is never again to review the looks of the stars to adapt them to our party costume.
The form of the neckline, very important to enhance the silhouette, is one of the variables that we should take into account.
There are a few suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose an exaggerated and very complicated neckline. It is not very advisable.
Endesa and Barcelona, with the electric car
The electric company Endesa, together with the City Council of Barcelona, have created the 'LIVE Office'.
It is a project to develop and promote the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The 'LIVE Office' (Logistics for the Implementation of the Electric Vehicle) will define and coordinate the road map for the implementation of the electric car in the city and will reach agreements on mobility, managing, coordinating, submitting grants, etc.
On the other hand it will develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, collect the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
In short, it is intended to promote what will be the transport of the future.
3 'electrical towns'
But Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the implementation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville join the project.
They are the three cities chosen by the Government, within the MOVELE Plan, to promote the implementation of the electric vehicle.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat of Catalonia.
The aim is to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These would include activities related to energy and in particular energy efficiency.
It is not the only initiative in which Endesa participates in the promotion of the electric vehicle.
The company participates in standardization groups at European level and has assets a number of complementary projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees 'a horizon of tranquility' for the motor sector
The president of the government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, glimpses "a horizon of tranquility" for the Spanish automotive industry, which, he recalled, is the country's main export sector.
In the presentation of the Economic Report of the President of the Government for 2009, Zapatero reviewed the measures that the Executive has put in place throughout the year to support the automotive sector.
"Without the Automotive Competitiveness Plan, today we would have a panorama of abandonment, closure of some of our main production plants," said the President of the Government.
"Thanks to this plan and the willingness of the brands to follow in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can have a quiet horizon for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector," he added.
In this regard, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Integral Automotive Plan (IPA), allocated 800 million to projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which mobilized an investment of more than 3 billion euros.
The Chief Executive explained that this investment was committed to both the development of new models and the modernization of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also emphasized government demand support measures, in reference to Plan 2000E, implemented in collaboration with autonomous communities and car brands.
According to the president, this plan has made it possible to reduce by 6% the average emissions of new vehicles marketed on the Spanish market and has led to a "strong increase" in registrations, which grew "40 percent" in November.
20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
The first edition of the International Classic Vehicle Show will be held in Madrid, a meeting space for professionals and fans of the engine mount.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 in the Crystal Pavilion of the Casa de Campo de Madrid.
It is an exhibition area of 20,000 square meters in which there will be more than 200 national and international exhibitors.
Not only will you find classic motorcycles and cars, but ClassicAuto Madrid will find all kinds of items related to the world of the engine.
Thus, among the pavilion exhibitors, accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, accessories, publications, miniatures, etc. can be found.
Hundreds of articles related to the world of the classic motor that will make the delights of collectors and curious.
Among the participating companies will be, among others, Classics of Mos and Good Old Times, sale of cars; Juan Lumberas, restoration; Coupe-Francisco Pueche sale and restoration of cars; or Car Classics, specialist Mercedes Benz.
Exterior skill tests
In addition, the commercial activity of this Hall will be completed with parallel activities: holding of concentrations, sports exhibitions, skill tests, presentations and competitions.
Skill tests will also be carried out with classic cars and motorcycles on an enabled circuit outside the fairground.
Mazda3 i-Stop: sustainable sport
Mazda wants to show that sportsmanship is not constrained by respect for the environment.
For this reason, the Mazda3 has just incorporated the engine stop and start system -baptized as i-Stop-, a device that at least for the moment is only available with the 2.0 petrol engine with 150 horses.
This second generation of the Mazda3 stands out for the good note achieved in its entirety.
The finishes, the end of the vehicle, the habitability, the behavior, the mechanics, the i-Stop system...
All these aspects are outstanding in the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driving station, we found that the front seats have excellent ergonomics and restraint.
Also, the touch of the steering wheel is exquisite.
Continuing with the set formed by the frame frame of instruments and the console we see how Mazda has continued the Japanese tendency to create a futuristic interior design, with lots of buttons and controls and striking colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, of the Honda Civic.
Therefore, we can say that both Mazda3 and Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products, and more specifically the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to beat.
Continuing with the cabin, this Japanese compact features more than enough habitability for four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
To all this is added a large trunk with regular shapes.
The engine stop and start automatic system, at least for the moment, is only available with the two-litre and 150-horse petrol engine and with the manual change of six gears.
This engine is an authentic delight. It stands out for its fineness, for its reduced noise, for its performance and for achieving contained consumptions.
And it is that although the most demanded Mazda3 will be the diesel versions, those that do not perform a high number of kilometers a year should not rule out this i-Stop with gasoline engine, both for its high running comfort, and for its contained consumption.
Regarding the level of equipment, the version chosen for the test is the one called Sportive, that is the one that incorporates a greater number of serial elements.
Of the standard equipment stands out especially the rail shift assistant (RVM) that eliminates the dead angle, the traction and stability controls, the speed control, the photosensitive interior mirror, the on-board computer on a large screen, the parking sensors, independent air conditioner, rain and light sensors, bluetooth and bluetooth audio and 17-inch alloy wheels.
In addition, in case there was little equipment, this version had the Premium Pack, which adds for 1,500 euros: bixenon adaptive headlights and BOSE sound system with disk charger, among other elements.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compacts in the category.
It stands out especially for the quality of the materials used, their behavior and the high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not make many kilometers a year will be able to opt for this i-Stop version, associated only with the 2.0 petrol engine of 150 horsepower.
The only drawback of this model is its high price, which is between the 21,770 euros of the Luxury finish and the 23,270 euros of the proven version - Sports-.
In exchange for this high figure, the Mazda3 will offer us great doses of satisfaction every day.
Luxury 'Première'
L.A. covers the red carpet of sensuality from the hand of Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars dazzled more than ever wrapped in models as elegant as 'sexy' in the premiere of 'Nine'. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our 'Pe', as sophisticated as usual, chose a dark 'lady'.
FonPeek's Promise
Peek is extremely limited, a device that only serves to look at the mail, without even being able to see certain types of attachments or navigate the network.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the U.S. when Time magazine named him one of the products of the year.
Seeing it on the street is more difficult, the truth, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek has a very low price and a very low monthly fee, less than half of what is paid, for example, for the iPhone data plan.
In view of the success the company has taken out two new devices: one exclusively designed for Twitter, the other with a free data service for life in exchange for paying six times more for the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It's just as limited as your U.S. counterpart, but it comes with a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price of around 12 euros per month includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with smartphones already know what it's like to give up data when crossing the border or desperately look for a café with WiFi (or a Fon connection) in order to check the mail.
The idea of a fixed-price roaming is incredibly attractive and long ago it would have to be in operation.
Yes, some operators have special arrangements and travel plans, but in my experience it takes a PhD in physics to understand them and good glasses to read the small letter.
The European Commission's repeated earrings to achieve affordable roaming rates across Europe have barely had a perceptible effect.
Outside the country of origin there is fear of using the data, and rightly so.
That a device like FonPeek (does not cease to be curious that it bears the name of Fon when it lacks Wifi) obtains this type of rates means that operators start to think differently and study different proposals with which to amortize their data network.
Kindle is another good example, including download traffic of books and other queries on the Internet.
No contracts and no gaitas.
It's a connected device and you pay for it when you buy it, not month by month.
And that's what I hope to see one day with FonPeek, a lifelong access shopping option like Peek already has in the U.S.
Not because I'm going to buy it.
I look at my mail on the phone, thank you.
I hope so because I think it is a fairer model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with this same system.
Michelle's Fetish Color
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite tone of the first American lady.
If he has already come to the inauguration of Barack Obama as president of the United States in a dress and coat of this color, he has chosen the same one to accompany him in, no doubt, the second most important moment of his life: the collection in Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama has worn a very similar model on both occasions: in addition to being a similar color - greenish yellow with bright reflections -, the two times the outfit consisted of three pieces - clothed, jacket and coat of the same fabric - and adorned with a great embroidery or necklace.
So much so, that at first glance it seemed that the first lady of the United States followed the stele of the Princess of Asturias and had chosen to repeat vestaurius.
But the fabric in which the two suits are made makes them very different.
If for the taking of possession it was a fat lace, in Oslo it is a velvet with stamping.
The complements have also varied: half-heeled green shoes the previous time, and a similar model, but in gold, now.
And equally different is the hairstyle: one collected on this occasion, melena looses the previous one.
Seventy-five per cent of working mothers have had labour problems because of their motherhood.
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women of the younger generations who want to be mothers.
This is revealed by the study 'Fecundity and career path of women in Spain', developed by the CSIC in collaboration with the Women's Institute.
The survey of 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 leaves no doubt about this: 75 per cent of working mothers have seen limited opportunities in the workplace due to motherhood.
The study points out that there are many differences at the beginning of the couple's cohabitation and the number of children, depending on whether or not they work and the type of work they perform.
Those who do not have an activity outside the home, work part-time, or have an unsteady job, start living together as a couple before, advance the first motherhood, and have more children.
On the contrary, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, delay living together and motherhood, and have less offspring.
"Women between the ages of 35 and 49 with fixed work have the first child, on average, 3.7 years after starting living together, a figure that increases to 4.1 women with fixed jobs have needed more time from their vital trajectory to achieve them, which has led them to postpone the union and the arrival of the children.
In addition, the type of work performed exerts a great deal of influence on motherhood, although less on the timing of the pairing," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that differentiates the age of women by marrying and having the first stem.
According to the survey, the higher the educational level, the higher the age at which they marry and have the first child.
The difference is also maintained among women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35-49 age group, those with elementary and higher education had been mothers for the first time at 25.1 and 32.1 on average respectively.
"There is also another division between women according to their level of education.
While those with elementary education get married and have their first child before getting a stable job, those with middle or higher levels reverse this sequence and give priority to obtaining a stable job as a precondition for marriage and the arrival of a child," Delgado explains.
Diane Kruger's worth it, too.
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its envious list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will become an image of different brand products, chanting the universal motto of 'Because I'm worth it'.
The protagonist of 'Joyeux Noël', one of the most elegant actresses on the international scene, joins other famous L'Oréal Paris signs, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter such a select club were actresses Evangeline Lilly ('Lost') and Freida Pinto ('Slumdog Millonaire').
In the male section, the cosmetic brand also has luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ('Grey's Anatomy) and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's companion in 'Lost').
British Fashion Awards
The British have a lot to say in the fashion world.
Its highest representatives - designers and models, yesterday and today - met at the annual award ceremony, held in London, at the Royal Court os Justice.
There was no one left on the date.
Former model Jerry Hall and her daughter, Georgia May Jagger, elected Best Model of the Year.
Manuel Vicent's Poker
Manuel Vicent presents in 'Póquer de aces' (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) about thirty X-rays of writers who have gone through their literary life (and, in cases, also the other).
It does not do so in predictable and fearsome genres (biographical appearance, life and work), but looking for something similar to the ignition core of the creative character.
The trip has its excitement and Vincent does not save any scares or lighting.
In addition to exquisite pleasure, the book is a moving invitation to reading and reading.
Here I leave you some snapshots.
About Albert Camus: "In his pages I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical impulse, the same as I felt without giving it a name: pleasure against unholy fate, guiltless morality and innocence without any god."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, an allegorical Christian, wrote what was in his blood, not his intellect, between impotence and ignorance, with a dazzling, meaningless poetic humor, like the blade of the knife that was about to kill him."
About Graham Greene: "Our man was abducted by this woman with a passion that lasted thirteen years, in whose flesh he combined the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that consisted in reaching heaven through the path of perdition."
About James Joyce: "The 'Ulises' was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the tops of eight thousand meters of universal literature, which must be climbed by the north wall, from which the best climbers are sluggish over and over again."
About William Faulkner: "He was a weird guy.
Of himself, he sometimes said that he was heir to a county landowner and others that he was the son of a black woman and a crocodile.
Both dreams were of greatness."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer picked up the mad cry from a bridge by that Munich character to bring his echo to the bottom of the night of the twentieth century in his literary form and did so on a journey running away from himself and invoking posterity with a violent speech to the worms."
About Dorothy Parker: "One day she got on her knees and prayed, 'Dear God, I beg you to stop writing like a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "On his grave were recorded these verses of Spenser: 'The dream after the effort,/ after the storm the port,/ the rest after the war,/ after life full pleases death."
About Virginia Wolf: "In the luggage she also brought her depressions.
The husband accepted in all normality that she told him that Edward VII was spying on her among the azaleas or that the birds sang in Greek.
There has never been a case of a man so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent went ahead of his madness."
About Pio Baroja: "What did Martin-Santos do but try to inoculate Joyce in Baroja?
What did Benet try but go to Baroja for Faulkner's weapons?
What did Cela do but abduct that man's fame so that he could serve him on his own pedestal?"
Cowardly assault
Last week, my 70-year-old mother walked around our neighborhood in the municipality of Fuenlabrada when a group of 15-18-year-olds passed by her and our dog, a mixed-race specimen, rescued from the kennel and weighing no more than six kilos and, without a word, tipped her two kicks that left the evil dog.
Our indignation is overwhelming because we did not find the fun in a free assault on a small, defenceless animal, which, by the way, was tied up.
To this must be added the suffocation that provoked a lady who walked calmly and who, when incredulated these individuals, came to fear for their physical integrity, since an energumene that attacks an animal, is able to do the same with a woman, a child, an elderly person or, ultimately, with anyone who is weaker than himself.
The event took place at five o'clock in the afternoon on any Tuesday in a traditionally quiet neighborhood.
The dog was crying all day.
By the way, we filed a complaint at a nearby police station that we doubt it would serve much and not generate susceptibility, just to clarify that the coward killers were Spanish.
Indignantness has led us to denounce this fact.
We do not understand that it is happening among young people to consider it fun to abuse a helpless animal that gives us affection, companionship and friendship for free.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and people are.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the helmet
The Michelin tyre manufacturer, with the collaboration of the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to encourage the use of the helmet, mainly among the younger drivers, reported today both entities.
This initiative seeks to raise awareness of the importance of using the helmet, as it is the only protective element capable of preventing head injuries or even death in the event of an accident while riding a motorcycle.
Michelin indicated that this campaign is part of her commitment to road safety, which "goes beyond designing and manufacturing products every day safer" and stated that she also contributes to this goal through other educational and informational actions.
This new campaign to promote the use of helmets on motorcycles, under the motto 'To be or not to be', will have a first phase in which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle workshops, with the aim of achieving maximum diffusion.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, since being a tyre manufacturer for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main purposes is to develop increasingly safe products.
Up the sale of light commercials
Almost two years later, the light commercial vehicle market began to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 units registered in Spain in November represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of declines, according to figures from the employers of Anfac manufacturers and Ganvam sellers.
The good, not ostentatious, should be quarantined since the reference to which the comparison is made - November 2008 - was particularly bad, with a decrease of 60% compared to the previous year.
The result is that, despite the rebound of the last month, the enrolments accumulated in these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January 95,853 units have been sold together all the vehicles that make up the tailor drawer of the light commercials: derivatives of passenger cars, pick ups, vans, light vans and light trucks/chesis.
Nubarrons that most affect their demand have also not disappeared, since although they are also purchased by individuals, most purchases are made by small and medium-sized enterprises, which pay in almost 100 per cent of cases through external financing.
Thus, other factors such as the increase in unemployment levels or the persistence of the poor economic situation must be added to the restrictions imposed by the closed bank lending tap.
In the light of this scenario and unlike tourism, aid for the purchase of 2000E has recently been used.
In addition to private individuals, self-employed persons and SMEs are eligible to acquire a light commercial capacity of up to 3.5 tonnes with a level of CO2 emissions not exceeding 160 grams per kilometre, but the number of operations has been testimony.
Yesterday, from Ganvam they remembered the need to devote special attention by the Administration to these vehicles and also to the industrialists (trucks and buses).
The sellers' association predicts a similar 2010 to the end of the year, for which it calculates a 19% drop in sales (from tourism and 4x4).
Aid for emergency braking is already compulsory
As with ABS brake antilock and will pass with ESP stability control, emergency braking support systems will have to be a mandatory element in European cars.
In fact, they are already in all passenger cars and light commercial vehicles of new registration, while for the rest a period of absence is fixed until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to increase pedestrian protection but, by its way of work, can also help to avoid many collisions by scope.
The emergency brake assistant does what it does is to increase the pressure on the brakes in case of an emergency, which the system detects by the footset given by the driver.
But this one doesn't always keep that pressure to the end.
According to a study carried out by the manufacturer of Bosch car components, a third of the drivers involved in an accident had failed to step on the brake before the collision and half of them did not take full advantage of the force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, on the other hand, requires the maximum of the braking system, reducing the distance used by the car to stop.
According to an EU study itself, if all cars were equipped with these types of elements, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be avoided a year.
The reduction will be even greater - it is estimated that one in four accidents with damage to people would be avoided - when so-called intelligent emergency braking systems are popularized.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that (through radar or camera) detects obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, it helps to increase the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
In case it does not react, and even if the collision is inevitable, the device exerts maximum effort on the brakes to minimize damage.
General Motors delays Opel's plan until January
While the workers of the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have already been notified by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April - probably the 8th - according to Javier Ortega, the American manufacturer warns that it will take more time to complete the recovery plan for Opel.
What Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, claims is that each of the points in the plan was previously agreed by the affected party.
And this can cause the final document that will be submitted to the workers first and then to the governments of the countries in which there are factories, to be delayed until the beginning of 2010.
On the other hand, GM ensures that a decision on the sale of Saab should be made in the coming days.
It is no wonder that the Swedish Government has increased pressure on the US manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM supports contact with some new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but the option of the Dutch sports car manufacturer Skyper, which is backed by the Russian group Convergence, is gaining strength.
In case there was no agreement with either of them, GM could sell some assets from Saab to China Baic.
The decision to close Saab by the end of the year is maintained if it is not sold.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To develop its last, expensive jewel, Porsche engineers took the Boxster S as their base and managed to lose nothing less than 80 kilos, which has left the scale at only 1,275 kilos.
This led them to dispense, in the first place, with the automatic roof that has been supplied by a canvas with manual drive, saving 21 kilos; using aluminum doors like those of the GT3, 'fall' 15 others; removing the air conditioner, 13; reducing the fuel tank from 64 to 54 litres, gained 7 kilos more; mounting sports bacquets another 12 and with light 19-inch tires, five.
Finally, giving up the CDR-30 audio system provided another six kilograms and changing the door handles for some fabric, the remaining kilo.
Although it is also offered with the dual clutch PDK change, the test was carried out on a unit with the six-speed manual box, mainly by California's secondary roads, in mountain sections with really twisted tracks
Their behavior can only be described as untouchable.
Weight reduction does not imply that the car does not step on the asphalt with aplom.
Rather, quite the contrary: for a long time we had not tested a model so small and light that, at the same time, it transmitted so much safety in the bend passage, even at high speeds.
He is a small athlete, able to warm his muscles in a short march for as long as necessary, until we order him to sprint, to brake, to recover and to repress his engine...
What we ask of you. Thanks to your address, as communicative as it is precise, what we indicate with our hands on the wheel is what the car will do.
And he'll do it with surgical precision.
Engine sound at will
The sound of your V6 boxer, with 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster S) is very successful and can be enhanced with the 'sport' option and through a system that modifies the engine's roar, already premiered previously in the Panamera.
The ability to accelerate is brutal, either from standing or in recovery.
The suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt of the roads we crossed with Boxster Spyder was quite punished, but the car digested well the bumps.
The electronic aids hardly made an act of presence throughout the journey; and that in one of the curves we find ice at dawn and gravel, well in the morning.
In short, an ultra light car, one of the most fun driving that you can on the market and which is more than just a modification of the Boxster S.
The car will be for sale in February 2010, with a price of 70,831 euros.
'Bag Girl'
Intimate of Karl lagerfeld, image of the Coco Cocoon line and 'starlette' occasionally of the parades of the 'maison', the singer prodigates her face of malata with as much contumacy as her Chanel bags.
More than 'Bad Girl' or 'It Girl', it's a 'Bag Girl'.
Baskonia Wins in Israel · Global Voices
The Caja Laboral achieved a brilliant 82-91 victory in his visit to the complicated Maccabi Electra court, despite the numerous casualties with which Dusko Ivanovic's team counted, and in this way he placed himself in the lead of his group, following the great performance of Mirza Teletovic, who with eight triples scored was the best of his team (29 evaluation).
The Victorian team was able to fill the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with large doses of involvement and collective work, although it had to suffer to the end to achieve victory.
In addition, the great hit from the perimeter, with 16 triples scored, had much to do with the final triumph.
The match started face-to-face for the blueberries, which were placed from the beginning forward on the scoreboard.
That the first four baskets of the Victorians were from the perimeter was already presaging that they had jumped to the Israeli court with hot wrists.
English and Teletovic were the main architects from 18-20 to the end of the first half.
The second quarter was more of the same, but the team chose Barak's inner game and Eliyahu's work, which was received with hiccups and applause on the return to his home, to further extend his advantage to rest (34-43).
Teletovic was already beginning to stand out as the best of his team with 13 points, although the 'less than six' of Splitter's assessment already made it clear that this was not going to be the best night of the Brazilian.
But the party, even though it was tied to rest, was not decided much less and the Maccabees wanted to remind the Victorians that in their court no one wins, and with 'the hand of Elijah' tightening they managed to get into the party.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the turn of the yellows (50-49).
More Disadvantages
Those of Ivanovic, wounded but not much less dead, needed to spin a couple of games with good luck to get air, and in those came the machine gun of Mirza Teletovic, who with three almost consecutive triples and the help of English and Ribas returned the marker to a reassuring income (54-67), who managed to make up the premises at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The Alaves went out to leave their skin in the last part and English and St. Emeterius (60-75) already warned that they would not let anyone take away from them what they had deserved during the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team did not resign and tried to keep their team alive from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated by faults, Ivanovic's did not rush, defended well, and although the Israelis approached in the final minute (80-85), the party already owned and the victory escaped from Tel Aviv for the first time in the season.
Injuries prevent the battle of Unicaja
The Unicaja lost in Greece strenuously to the Olympiacs and gave him the lead of the Euroleague B group, in a game marked by the bass of the cashiers, especially in the interior game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malagasy team was not frightened by the atmosphere of the pavilion of Peace and Friendship and not by the entity of the rival, perhaps of the most powerful in Europe and with a great budget.
The game shown in the first quarter allowed the Andalusians to dream. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two from the Omar Cook base and one from Guillem Rubio, dazzled the locals 12-18, minute 9.
The Olympiacs were surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja , although the arsenal of the locals in the inner game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, turned to the score 22-20, minute 13, when an action, fighting cone, between the two American bases Beverley and Williams, involved the disqualification of both players.
The Greek ensemble began to function by showing its superiority within both areas, where the injury of English pivot Joel Freeland and Carlos Jiménez's three personal faults were tearing the cashiers apart.
Among the indoor players and the Lithuanian winger Linas Kleizas, with their triples, increased the advantage 44-32, minute 19.
An Impossible Rising
The third period was very offensive with the Olympiacs, which, despite the 19 losses, proved superior and even came to equal the difference of the meeting held in Malaga 66-48, minute 27, which caused the group's leadership to stagger.
The Unicaja tried to overcome the absences and the last descent of the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, injured during the encounter.
Despite all the inconveniences the Unicaja for the direction and the triples of Cook, and Lewis' contribution, left some hope 66-57, minute 31.
But it was practically impossible because the Olympiacs when they pressed and given their superiority in centimeters within the area was unstoppable.
Croatian pyvot Nikola Vujcic, managed to go back to basketball average 81-62, minute 37, and the Unicaja went out, delivering the lead to Olympiacs.
How much should you charge for your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they deserve according to their profile, thanks to a new application by Trovit, the searcher with the highest number of classified real estate, employment and engine ads in Spain.
The tool How much should you charge? calculates the salaries of the users from the more than 140,000 job offers available to Trovit in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where they must introduce their profession, years of experience, age and city where they want to work.
In the week that the application is running, the searcher has found that in general the Spanish worker "feels poorly paid", explained in a statement the product manager of Trovit, Albert Ribera.
According to Trovit's search engine data in the UK and France, Spanish are the worst paid.
One British computer programmer charges 45,226 euros gross per year and one French, 31,059, compared to the 24,000 that one Spanish receives.
Similarly, a driver charges €34,247 per year in England, €25,751 in France and €16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst paid work in Spain is that of waiter, with 11,592 euros net per year; followed by dependent, with 14,725 euros; and that of operator, with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs on the network in the last three months are drivers, part-time jobs and social workers.
Brazil sets the date for Zelaya's departure
The Brazilian Government has put an end to Manuel Zelaya's stay at his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The deposed President shall leave the diplomatic legation no later than 27 January 2010, when he or she officially completes his or her term of office.
Francisco Catunda, head of business of the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows that he must leave before that date of the embassy, where he remains a refugee since September 21.
"He is aware that he has to leave on January 27, at the end of his term, he has to look for another destination."
The station also quoted the former president, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by telephone.
After the elections of 29 November (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, this same week he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation was finally frustrated by the rejection of Zelaya's status as a political assylate that was intended to impose on him by the "de facto" government that Roberto Micheletti presides.
Thank you very much.
After the days of wine and roses since last spring in which asset inflation has been the dominant focus in the markets, again uncertainty reappears in the markets, which should not be surprising since it is their natural state, in an environment in which agents make decisions about the future by an uncertain nature.
The medicine used by central banks to stabilize markets was to monetize debt with direct purchase of assets and indirectly give liquidity-free bar to near-zero rates for financial institutions to buy off assets.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct asset purchases have practically been completed and, without questioning their heterodox liquidity policy, they are starting to sanden gears as the ECB did with its auction next week.
Investors therefore doubt the ability of the global economy to maintain economic recovery without such heterodox measures and we are witnessing a reversal of risk premium reduction.
The volatility of the Stock Exchanges and the differentials of corporate bonds have re-emerged, although they remain far removed from the paranormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
The states were forced to socialize private risk and the public debt was again affected.
Again there is a flight to quality and the US, Japan and Germany have been the refuge chosen by investors, causing an expansion of the differentials of the eurozone countries with regard to Germany.
Spain had hardly been affected by this episode of instability but in that came Standard & Poor's and threatened with a new downward revision of the qualification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, some uncertainty does not go wrong to silence the defenders of moral risk who were once again trying to raise awareness of those responsible for world economic policy for having curbed the destructive effects of credit restriction on job destruction, when what should be done is to decree a new day of Thanksgiving.
However, Dubai paints a tribal struggle between the Emirs to regain power in the Emirates and Greece we have seen before.
A government that hides public deficit, elections and a new government that pulls from the blanket.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense for Ecofin to save Hungary from non-compliance with its external payments at the beginning of the year and to allow a euro member country to breach its commitments.
What makes sense is that Ecofin has forced the Greek Government to be transparent and make its citizens responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we hope, we are faced with an episode of normalisation of transitional risk premiums, after some excesses in leveraged positions, it would be within expected.
In the Spanish case, as long as our public debt differentials expand as European corporate bonds do, we must not worry.
If European differentials decrease and our differences continue to expand, then it would be a Spanish idiosyncratic risk.
Standard & Poor's is an anecdote. When our advanced indicators are forcing most study services to anticipate their recovery scenarios and to review their scenario upwards for 2011, including the OECD and the European Commission, to return to the burden with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy does not augur much life expectancy to their warning.
Again, it looks like it will be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although for the moment "prudence, friend driver".
Related sectors
The president of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to speak yesterday before the subcommission of the Congress of Deputies in which the energy strategy of Spain is debated these days in the next two decades.
After his speech, followed by that of the president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press some brushstrokes of what he had raised in the subcommission behind closed doors.
For the president of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest 50 billion euros until 2020 and another 60 billion between that date and 2030, provided the nuclear power plants are kept open today.
Otherwise, the necessary investments will not be 60 billion, but up to 95 billion.
That's right, Iberdrola believes that in the next decade investments should not be aimed at increasing capacity in generation, but at distribution networks and international interconnections.
From 2020 onwards, the issue is changing and the power will have to be increased.
Its focus is on both gas and coal plants with carbon dioxide capture mechanisms and, above all, renewable energies.
In this case, it considers that 18,000 MW is needed, that is, with other "supporting energies".
Galán, who believes that the draft Sustainable Economy Act just passed by the Government is in line with what his company has been demanding, did not want to blood with the royal decree to encourage the consumption of national coal, which contradicts policies to combat climate change.
In his view, there is "a clear long-term bet" in this regard, despite the "puntual" measures, as the President of Iberdrola called them.
In any case, Galán believes that investment decisions, although long-term, should be started as they take time to mature and a stable remunerative framework is needed to address them.
Ferrovial wins Aer Lingus handing at ten airports
The Ferrovial subsidiary for ground airport services, Swissport, will play the role of preferred partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus for cargo services at ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are some of the most outstanding.
The agreement, of which the economic terms have not transcended, has a duration of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed yesterday a collaboration protocol to create the Intelligent Infrastructure Innovation Centre
The alliance envisages an investment of 20 million until 2012, of which 50% corresponds to Ferrovial.
One of the center's tasks will be to investigate energy efficiency at highways and airports.
Drives dispute its first highway in Australia with Hochtief and Bouygues
He works for his first concessional highway in Australia, a market where he already works as an energy company and water manager.
The work at stake is that of a tunnel valued at 1.7 billion Australian dollars (about 1,047 million euros).
The French Bouygues and the German Hochtief are her rivals.
A 5-kilometre tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the East Coast, has become the closest option for Acciona to settle in the country as a builder and dealer of motorways.
The City Council wants to have it ready by the end of 2014
After opting for public-private collaboration (PPP) to carry out the project, in a business plan sponsored by Erns & Young, the Administration already has a final list of women candidates to do the work and exploit the toll.
Pending the submission of their bids next May, the planned investment amounts to A$ 1.7 billion (EUR 1.047 million) and in the last phase three consortia with a notable presence of European construction companies compete.
The group named Transcity is led by Aciona, the only Spanish in Liza, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian construction companies, while the second, based in Italy, is one of the largest European specialists in underground works.
Against Acciona's team plays the Northern Direct consortium, with the presence of the British Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French construction group Bouygues.
The third and last consortium that has passed the screening is the so-called LBRJV, where the Australian Leighton (a subsidiary of the German builder Hochtief, in turn participated by ACS), the local Baulderstone (ownership of the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the gala firm specialized in civil works Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises great works and privatizations, but it carries a clear difficulty of entry if it is not through the acquisition of a local construction firm.
A strategy that has followed the aforementioned Hochtief or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, and that continues to be an outstanding subject for the Spanish giants in the sector.
Only ACS has achieved a position in that market through its 30% stake in Hochtief, the owner of Leighton.
Millionaire assets
It is committed to a geographical area of the utmost importance for the sector, in which it already has a prominent presence through its activity as an energy supplier and in the business of desalination.
Among other assets, it has its largest wind farm, Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and leads the group of companies responsible for lifting and managing the Adelaide desalinator, with a budget of 700 million.
Its intention now is to consolidate these two areas and take advantage of synergies to enter the fields of construction and infrastructure operation.
The underground toll road, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and called Northern Link (North link), is called to join the Western Toowong Highway with the bypass road in Kelvin Grove (see map) along 5 kilometres of tunnel. This is the biggest action to reduce congestion in Brisbane traffic.
The timetable set by the Administration sets the award for the summer of 2010 and the start of the works in December of next year.
Although this payment step would open to traffic in the last months of 2014, it is not expected that the work will be completed until 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will include two lanes per direction, electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Government of Queensland will contribute US$ 500 million (EUR 308 million) to its financing.
Brisbane already offers business to Hochtief
Australia continues to bear significant fruit for Hochtief, who yesterday communicated a contract with the Government valued at 154 million.
The ACS participant will enable, through its local Leighton subsidiary, the infrastructure of the national broadband network with fiber optic cable.
This performance will offer fast internet access to 400,000 people and will give work to the German for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has overtaken the 27-storey King George Tower construction project in the Australian city of Brisbane. The works were still to begin and Hochtief has closed the sale by 129 million.
Already in the UK, specifically in Manchester, he will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and operation of two schools for 25 years.
The initial investment will be €75 million.
FCC awards a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC, through its Alpine subsidiary, has been awarded the construction of a 2.1 km long tunnel for a motorway in Slovenia of EUR 64.5 million.
The firm obtains this contract days after the works of extension of the tunnel of Bosruck (Austria) for 130 million.
In this way, Alpine reinforces its experience in the construction of tunnels.
Work is scheduled to start in early 2010 and will run for 32 months.
Mrs. Rushmore awards Renfe's publicity
Renfe has awarded advertising and marketing services over the next two years to Mrs Rushmore for an amount of approximately EUR 3 million per year, the railway operator reported.
The contract covers the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Ms. Rushmore has been elected from among the 16 agencies that presented themselves to the competition convened by Renfe of which four were finalists, including TBWA who was responsible for creativity in the last three years.
From now on, Mrs Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
France Télécom received 63 million for curbing competition
The French competition regulator has imposed a fine of EUR 63 million on France Télécom for anticompetitive conduct in the Caribbean regions belonging to the country.
According to this institution, the operator limited competition in fixed and mobile telephony by signing exclusive agreements, price plans and consumer loyalty programmes outside the scope of regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state company accumulates more than 560 million euros in fines since 1994 for blocking its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday, in fact, has been increased because the competition authority considers that France Télécom has committed similar infringements in the past and is therefore a repeat offence.
Application shop
In addition, the mobile subsidiary of the French company has followed the wake of other operators and has opened a web-based app shop, with the aim of increasing revenues that do not come from voice transmission.
In principle, Orange's app shop will be active in France and the UK.
We will have to wait until 2010 for it to reach other countries, such as Spain.
Playing the Champions has reported 476.4 million to Madrid and Barça since its origin
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs since it was born in 1992.
So much, that Real Madrid and Barcelona have entered 476.4 million since then, which makes them the third and fifth club that has earned the most money in the competition.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only provides glory. It is also one of the main sources of income for the big clubs.
So much so, that the competition has distributed 5,362.5 million euros to the 105 teams (12 of them Spanish) that have participated in the event since the creation of the tournament in the 1992/1993 season, according to UEFA data.
Real Madrid and the F. C. Barcelona have come out well standing from this distribution.
The white club has been the third on the continent to have the most money pocketed for participating, and the only one, along with AC Milan, who has won the trophy three times.
Catalan, the current champion and the last winner of the end European Cup in 1992, is the fifth in the standings.
The list is led by Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams that, in addition, charged more money for participating in the last Champions League.
And that, despite losing both to Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country that has made the most money through the Champions, despite having achieved more titles than any other (five, for the four of Italy, the three of England and the two of Germany).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complicated money-sharing procedure applied by UEFA.
For this exercise, the organization that presides Michel Platini plans to enter 1,090 million for the Champions League.
Of this money the UEFA will dedicate 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the previous round of classification (including the Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received 3.8 million just because they were there, in addition to another 550,000 euros for each party they played.
There are also bonuses to win (800,000 euros) and to tie (400,000 for each team).The eighthfinalists will receive three million each; the eight fourthfinalists, 3.3 million.
The last four will pack 4 million each.
The champion will win $9 million, compared to the finalist's 5.2 million.
Thus, in terms of fixed payments, a club will enter at least 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
The Barça, on the other hand, won 2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
But there are also variable payments, for which 337.8 million are allocated.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
Spanish is one of the main places, and has four designated places.
The previous year's champion is left with 40 per cent of the money allocated, 30 per cent for the second, 20 per cent for the third and 10 per cent for the fourth.
The other part will be paid according to the number of matches played in this year's edition.
New Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% of Sos
The New Rumasa group gave up yesterday the details of the stock purchase offer with which it seeks to acquire a top of between 25% and 29.9% of Sos' capital.
A percentage that does not oblige you to launch a public offer of acquisition (opa) for all the securities.
In particular, New Rumasa offers EUR 1.5025 per share that would be disbursed in 10 years and that would be remunerated with an interest for such a 1% annual postponement
Yesterday Sos' shares closed to 1.85 euros; therefore, New Rumasa's offer values the company 18% below the market.
According to New Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects Sos' real valuation.
The offer is subject to the appointment of eight of the 15 advisors.
The stockholders' interest in selling securities is limited to 15 days.
CNMV claimed that it had not been informed of the offer, despite the fact that the company of Ruiz Mateos claimed that it had contacted the regulator.
If made, the disbursement would reach 611.7 million when the capitalization of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructure his direction.
In an attempt to remain on the sidelines of possible offers of purchase and judicial changes by its former directors, the brothers Jesus and Jaime Salazar, announced the election of Maria Luisa Jordá as director of internal audit.
A decision that makes her the first woman to hold a high position in the food business.
This is a new post that will depend directly on the group president.
And it is not without controversy, as the company remains immersed in the legal battle for the alleged diversion of more than 230 million from Sos to Salazar societies.
In fact, it cannot be ruled out that over the next few months Sos unveils new diversions of funds
Regarding the credit to the Salazars, yesterday the former councillors Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of CCM and Unicaja) declared at the National Audience and stated that they approved the deviation of 212 million without knowing their fate.
CNMV authorizes the exclusion opa of Paternina presented by Inversora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) yesterday authorized the exclusion opa presented by Investora Mer on Federico Paternina on 9 October.
The supervisory body has explained that it authorises this operation on the understanding that its terms are in line with the current rules and consider the contents of the explanatory brochure submitted after the amendments made on 2 December to be "sufficient".
The CNMV has specified that the offer is directed to the acquisition of 550.008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of 7.65 euros per share, which represents 8.95% of its share capital, which is composed of 6,142,786 shares admitted to negotiation in the Stock Exchanges of Madrid and Bilbao.
It has also explained that 5,592,778 million shares have been immobilised, which cannot be transmitted in any way until the end of the offer, which it has specified that the price has been fixed by Federico Paternina, in accordance with the rules in force.
New Car Expert Tools
In these days of storms and accidents, not only do car workshops win.
Every day thousands of cars that have suffered a disaster are towed to a workshop, where an expert must assess the damage suffered and what the cost of repair will be.
No damage is equal, and the calculation of parts costs and labor time can be a long and complicated work.
The cost of a repair of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including parts and workmanship, can be calculated annually for two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the most recent computer tools it would be a question of minute
For this reason, almost 100% of experts use this type of system.
The providers of services and solutions for the valuation of claims and maintenance are dedicated to collecting the information supplied to them by the manufacturers, and then processing it and offering it to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, of the American group Solera, is the leading firm; 80% of the ratings are made with its products.
The other firms that compete in the field of valuation and information-processing tools on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
The work with the data supplied by the manufacturers is far from easy.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, commercial director of Audatex, in Spain they work with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides them with information in different formats.
In addition, the amount of data to be dealt with continues to increase, to the extent that more versions, variants and motorisations have been launched in the past five years than in the previous fifteen years.
As soon as a new car comes to market, these companies get to work.
It is a very difficult task, because each of the thousands of pieces of the vehicle must be catalogued and their price introduced.
In addition, of each model, a graphic image is made "intelligent" where different parts of tourism can be "pinked".
If it's a windmill model, the job can be ready in a week if the process goes very fast.
If it is a minority car, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information about 99.2% of the cars sold in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models are information about Porsche, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini, for example.
As for the mobile park that circulates, they exceed 99%.
To carry out documentation work and database development, Audatex has eight centers worldwide (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), each of which specializes in specific brands.
The national headquarters is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than 100 technicians (usually mechanics experts) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests €90 million annually in the development of these databases.
Every month 2.5 million data are included, and customers receive updates every two days.
The production of this huge flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and offer various products.
The most frequent use focuses on repair and maintenance, but according to which countries there are also tools to manage scrapping parts or to calculate the venal or residual value of a car.
The only company with a guide that reports on the value of those used in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex doesn't offer it in our country, but it does in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get an idea of the type of support that can be given to professionals in the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, being the star product AudaPlus, the standard disaster valuation solution, intended for experts.
Includes cars, motorcycles and light or heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it includes the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or paint bars.
This tool is paid according to use, for each valuation.
The highest cost is 5.75 euros, for customers who use it little, a maximum of ten times a month.
Then each insurance company, which carries out thousands of tests, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the full identification of a vehicle and the equipment with which it left the assembly line only with its frame number.
AudaGlass concentrates on the moons of the vehicles, and AudaSubastas is an open service to the professional sector on the internet that allows to bid for the vehicles declared total sinister.
Its statistical service is very useful for identifying trends, performing geodemographic analyses or knowing deviations by omodel brands.
It is possible to study, for example, how many models of a given brand have passed through the workshop due to breakdowns or how many have suffered serious injuries in a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of such tools.
It commercializes, among others, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and also provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official times of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa group founded in 1971 as a service provider and solutions for the valuation of damage, damage or maintenance of the car
The Gt Evaluation Guide is your historical reference product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its turnover has grown at a rate of 20% per annum over the past three years, and in 2008 it was worth 10.8 million euros.
At the beginning of last year they began their process of internationalization, with the installation of an office in Paris.
Audatex, for his part, was born in Germany in 1966 and was established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources, 62% of its business is generated in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38%, in North and South America. They work with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, 3,000 of them in Spain.
The global turnover of the Solera group (Audedex, Sidexa, Informax ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach $557 million, 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country the company will enter 19,1 million euros, 7.2% more than the previous year.
In 2005, the Solera group was worth $1 billion in stock, and now its shares are valued at a total value of $2.4 billion.
Since 2007, it has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is included in the Standard & Poor's benchmark.
Internet auction of crashed cars
Last October the Solera group bought Autoonline, an internet platform for the sale of cars such as motorcycles or damaged special vehicles.
The operation involved a disbursement of €59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could be extended to the remaining 15% next year.
The objective of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of access to a huge international market.
This sales and valuation service is aimed exclusively at professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, experts, renting companies, workshops, scrappings and professional sellers who must register before starting operations.
This platform was created in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, 500,000 of them in Germany.
Among its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
