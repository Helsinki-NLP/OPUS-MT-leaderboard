Inflation in Europe has slipped on food
Accelerated inflation, measured in the euro area, is mainly due to the rapid rise in food prices.
In November, the price increase in the 13 euro area countries was higher than forecast, after an inflation rate of 2.6 per cent in October, an annual inflation of 3.1 per cent was recorded, reported the European Community Statistics Office located in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts indicated only 3 per cent, Bloomberg reported.
Unlike the United States, British and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) did not lower the policy interest rate by saying that the decline in interest rates, with the rise in commodity prices and the fall in the unemployment rate, would lead to the generation of an inflationary spiral.
The ECB would like to keep the inflation rate below but close to two percent.
According to one analyst, it is Catch 22 for the ECB: "we must deter" inflation in order to stop having to intervene on this subject later.
In Germany, the inflation rate of 3.3 per cent is a record in the last 12 years and in Spain it has risen from 3.6 per cent to 4.1 per cent.
Inflation in the euro area has taken off because of the rapid rise in food and energy prices.
Future market shares for cereals have increased by 88 per cent and the price of soybeans has also reached its highest value since 1973.
The price of food oil and dairy products also increased considerably in 2007.
This year, world oil prices rose by 52 percent and last month, a barrel of black gold cost almost $100.
According to the ECB, in 2008, inflation will rise from 2.1 per cent this year to 2.5 per cent, but in 2009 it will fall to 1.9 per cent.
According to analysts, the 12-month inflation rate remains around 3%, however, over the next 3-4 months, the average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to lower the master rate twice in 2008.
Gallup indicates government crisis
After a long stagnation, the number of supporters of Fidesz (Alliance of Young Democrats) increased significantly in early December. Thus, since 2002, it currently has the largest number of supporters, while Gallup (Institute of Polling) has never seen such a low level of socialist support, i.e. 13 percent.
For the faithful voters, the difference would represent, due to the greater determination of the opposition voters, more than two-thirds (71 percent) support against the fifth (20 percent) support for the MSZP (Hungarian Socialist Party).
According to the survey, the MDF (Forum of Hungarian Democrats) and the SZDSZ (Alliance of Free Democrats) are below the parliamentary threshold: their support is two percent for the entire population.
Of the faithful voters some to go to vote, the number of supporters of both parties has increased by 1 percent.
The economic climate has continued to deteriorate from the previous lowest point, the proportion of those who felt that the country's economic situation was particularly serious has never been so high, it stands at 41 per cent and according to 46 per cent complementary the situation is quite serious.
After the more optimistic prospects of spring and last summer, families are once again more pessimistic about their financial situation.
For next year, the majority of the population foresees a worsening and only one tenth foresees an improvement in the situation.
Last December, 71 per cent of those surveyed, i.e. a majority never seen in previous Gallup polls, felt that the Prime Minister was doing his job rather badly than well.
13 percent of respondents have confidence or a lot of confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány while 38 percent support Viktor Orbán.
54 per cent do not trust the Prime Minister at all and 27 per cent trust the President of Fidesz.
One of the indicators of change in the political situation is the proportion of society thinking that discontent with the Prime Minister can be dealt with without change of government.
While after last October's riots, 35 per cent of respondents wanted the government and the Prime Minister to remain in office, this rate is currently only 20 per cent. The relative majority (33 per cent) believe that holding new elections would be the solution to this situation.
On the question of the intention to vote, 60 per cent of the respondents replied that they would certainly vote and the additional 20 per cent said that they would probably vote.
To make the comparison, for a "legislative election to organize next Sunday", only 55 per cent of the respondents would certainly participate and 15 per cent additional would probably participate. According to current intentions, the result of the referendum would be no doubt.
74 per cent of people would say no to tuition fees in higher education, 79 per cent would say no to consultation fees and 84 per cent would say no to hospital expenses.
When we look only at the same proportions among those who expressed their intention to vote in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 percent of the voters would reject the introduction of registration fees, consultation fees and hospital stays.
Auchan is the most expensive, Tesco has increased its prices by almost twenty percent
The hypermarkets located in the commercial triangle of Budaörs have maintained the average price increase of 16 percent last year, as opposed to the fact that this year the VAT rate has not increased.
Article by Napi Gazdaság (Daily Economy)
This year, in the commercial triangle of Budaörs, the usual daily Christmas Basket has also increased by an average of 16 percent, a value increase of well over a thousand forints appeared in all hypermarkets.
Prices, "which had already flown" to major food stores last December, did not increase sharply compared to the previous high base.
Nevertheless, consumers are obviously shocked to see that items purchased well below nine thousand forked last year now cost more than ten thousand forked.
The daily basket in the hypermarkets surveyed exceeded by 91 forints, at least, the psychological threshold of ten thousand forints.
And the highest value of the basket was 10,573 forints.
(In 2003, this value was 6,800 forints.)
The prices of Unicum and live fish remained almost at last year's level, but prices of turkey nets, nuts and poppy have risen sharply.
In the stores, the price of flour and bread followed the data of the KSH (Central Institute of Statistics) but at Auchan, bread was found from one kilo to 139 forints only.
Competition did not decrease the price of the product below 200 forints.
It was amazing to see, also in this hypermarket, that the price of the two-litre bottle of Coca-Cola was below 200 forints, it therefore cost only 257 forints the bottle recorded including.
However, this year, in terms of daily basket, Auchan was the most expensive and Cora the cheapest.
According to our calculations, Cora increased the price of his daily basket by 15 percent while Tesco and Auchan increased them by about 18 percent and 18 percent respectively.
By comparing last year's most expensive basket and this year's cheapest basket, we see a difference of 12 percent while the difference between last year's cheapest and the most expensive of this year's basket is 21 percent.
Prices rose by an average of 1,480 forints.
Last year, prices rose by an average of 1,206 forints, while knowing that the impact of the increase in the VAT rate had already been noted in last year's Christmas prices.
This process has perplexed trade, as hypermarkets could not clearly determine which margin to apply to products as long as they were unable to predict the impact of price change on consumption.
(If a trader miscalculates the rotation of a product, he risks losing a large profit on the margin adapted to the intensity of the trade.)
Due to the change in the VAT rate, the increase in prices of the daily basket has evolved so excessively that the most expensive basket was higher than the value of the 2006 basket, while the difference between the cheapest baskets was only 844.
This year, the difference was not so excessive as the value of the most expensive basket was 1,630 forints higher than last year and prices at least increased by 1,284 forints as well.
By approaching the two Christmas seasons, we have seen a catastrophic increase in prices, in less than 20 months the prices of daily consumption items have increased by more than 30 percent in hypermarkets.
(This does not necessarily confirm KSH data: for some basic necessities, the institute of statistics has seen a price increase of more than 30 per cent in 12 months.
This is the case, for example, with flour and egg.)
According to the daily basket of the latter, this seems almost absurd since the price level of this product, already very expensive last year, has increased by just over 10 percent compared to the base.
According to the evidence, flour suppliers are in a stronger position than egg suppliers because they have succeeded in accepting the sharp rise in prices also by multinationals.
In the commercial gold triangle, hypermarkets do not complain, they constantly record good years.
According to our experiences, the majority of customers no longer look at prices in the three hypermarkets visited.
They buy everything in quantity, they take long-storage foods by pallets.
On Wednesday morning important queues were formed at the crates of the three hypermarkets as the number of customers increased sharply.
However, according to our information, the turnover is lower in the province, many multinational companies complain to the survey companies that they do not even reach the expected turnover, not only for food but also for sustainable consumption items.
Many hospitals save money on disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand infections, mainly caused by the misuse of antibiotics, have been registered in hospitals.
The hygienic conditions of hospitals, the insufficient number of beds, and the overwork of medical personnel do not help to block infections, says the Chief Medical Officer of the National Epidemiology Centre.
Many hospitals also save money on disinfectants
Not long ago an MRSA infection was diagnosed in the trauma department of János Hospital.
Antibiotic-resistant bacteria were detected in a man hospitalized following a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year a similar infection occurred in the same place.
The injured in a serious car accident came out of the hospital but soon after he had to return there due to an MRSA infection and since then doctors have not been able to perform a major surgery because of the bacteria in his body.
Until December 10 of this year, 1,094 hospital infections generated by a multi-resistant pathogen were reported to the National Nosocomial Surveillance System, said Karolina Böröcz, chief physician of the National Epidemiology Centre.
To know that it is the number of infections caused by a multiresistant pathogen that has actually been registered in hospitals and for the rest we have no information.
Approximately two thirds of infections (683 infections) were caused by MRSA, i.e. methicillin-oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
One third of people carry the Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria in their noses without developing a disease.
Infections caused by SA (such as angina, tonsillitis, skin infections, traumatic infections) respond well to antibiotics, they are easily curable.
However, if antibiotics are used excessively or inappropriately, the bacteria, which reacts well to antibiotics, will develop a well resistant antibiotic bacterium that will proliferate rapidly in poor hospital conditions.
In the event of temporary or prolonged malfunction of the immune system, this bacterium may cause serious hospital infections, such as traumatic infection or septicaemia, in elderly, small-weight or weakened patients.
According to the director of the János Hospital, there is nothing special about MRSA infections, these infections are part of the daily lives of hospitals.
Above all, we should not confuse the infection with the epidemic, we do not find MRSA only the one or we do not look for them, said Tibor Nyulasi.
The SAs are resistant to antibiotics.
"These patients are isolated, the health care staff wear rubber gloves and protective masks and we have antibiotics adapted to treat them," said Tibor Nyulasi.
A priori, hospitalized patients are examined if they carry MRSA, but infection cannot always be avoided.
Sampling of the sample is not fashionable
The vast majority of infections caused by MRSA could be prevented, but the current conditions and circumstances are not favourable in Hungarian hospitals to prevent the development and proliferation of multi-resistant pathogens, says Karolina Böröcz.
As this infection occurs mainly in hospitals and in elderly homes, hospitals should control hospitalized patients and immediately isolate patients with MRSA.
However, microbiological sampling is not fashionable in Hungarian hospitals.
It should be noted that the National Social Security Fund does not fund these examinations.
Most cases occur only if MRSA infection is detectable on the patient, said the Chief Medical Officer of the epidemiologic center.
The European Union has strict recommendations for the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also Hungarian guidelines for the cure of certain infections and syndromes.
Efforts must be made to ensure that antibiotic therapy is targeted, i.e. microbiological tests should be conducted to prevent drug resistance, but hospitals do not always take this into account.
Microbiological sampling is even more rare in outpatient and basic care, said Karolina Böröcz.
Many hospitals save money on disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSAs proliferate from one patient to another most often through medical personnel.
It is therefore essential to wash your hands, put on gloves and protective masks. However, significant deficiencies are also detected in hospitals in this area.
MRSAs proliferate by infection transmitted by inhaling droplets and by contact. However, due to conditions in Hungarian hospitals, the infected patient cannot always be isolated.
In addition, the rooms are often full, the beds are often too close to each other, while in terms of epidemics, the sick should be removed from each other by at least 1.5 metres.
Unfortunately, we also find that hospitals, in difficult financial situations, are saving on disinfectants, they lack nurses, there are many patients, so the risk of contamination is even greater, said Karolina Böröcz.
According to Karolina Böröcz, in hospitals or preventive measures are respected, the number of infections is lower demonstrably or then the proliferation of the pathogen can be blocked.
Government project against MRSA
The treatment of MRSA infection represents exorbitant expenses for social security funds, which is why we fight this infection everywhere.
In England, for example, the government has established a program to prevent or reduce the incidence of MRSAs.
According to published data, this program is effective and MRSA infections show a decreasing trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) identifies as its priorities the prevention of the incidence of multi-resistant pathogens (such as MRSAs) and the prevention of hospital infections caused by these pathogens.
The Commissioner, who was the author of a fatal accident, was not in a state of drunkenness.
The official finding concerning the fatal accident caused by the Commissioner of the 22nd District has been drawn up.
It may be excluded that the commissioner of the 22nd arrondissement, who has since resigned from his post, who crushed a pedestrian by causing his death last Tuesday, would have led in a state of drunkenness or dizziness, communicated Friday Attila Morvai, spokesman of the Public Prosecutor's Office of the capital after the relative finding has been established.
The finding confirmed the first result of the investigation which had already found that the former Commissioner had not consumed alcohol before driving.
Last Tuesday, the former chief of the police station of the 22nd district crushed a 55-year-old man who stood in front of him when he turned, with his personal car, into Kossuth Lajos Street of the 22nd district. The man wanted to cross the road by not passing through the pedestrian passage.
(In fact, the fact that he was crossing the road outside the pedestrian crossing does not constitute an extenuating circumstance, according to the Code of the road a car that starts a turn must let the pedestrians pass.)
The pedestrian died after being transported to the hospital.
As a result of this accident, the Commissioner resigned from his post and requested his retirement because, according to police communication, this accident has upset him greatly.
The investigation of this case is conducted by the Budapest Prosecutor's Office.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former Commissioner cooperated from the outset with the investigating magistrates.
EUR 400 million for infrastructure
János Veres, Hungarian Minister of Finance, and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three agreements in Budapest on Friday with a total value of EUR 400 million for a credit line to support education, transport and environmental infrastructure and energy.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) adopted a budget of EUR 300 million for the Hungarian budget financing of transport and environment projects to be carried out from the Cohesion Fund, a credit contract worth EUR 100 million has already been signed by the parties. This time, the contract signed concerns the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The EUR 150 million credit agreement also covers the budgetary financing of education-related projects.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for Hungary, and the remaining EUR 150 million can be used later following the extension of the credit agreement.
The parties have signed a contract of €50 million for innovation, the state budget will use this envelope in the first place as part of the research and development project to be carried out at the University of Debrecen.
During the negotiations, the Metro Line 4 project was also discussed.
The parties agreed that they would discuss the possible amendment of the initial contract once Hungary finalized the details of the financing of the metro with the EU.
According to János Veres, this could be done in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has provided a total of EUR 8.4 billion for the financing of 113 projects in Hungary.
The EIB shall grant its loans at the interest rate linked to EURIBOR, with a grace period of 8 years and without a commitment fee.
Bulgaria, a paradise for the EU's real estate market
The evolution of the Bulgarian real estate market is spectacular, the attention of the whole of Europe is focused on this Balkan country which has not been mentioned in the past.
What, or who bought in this EU market which is always the cheapest but which will soon become expensive?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
At present, in real estate, Bulgaria is unquestionably the most popular target in Eastern Europe with its ski apartments and houses by the cheap sea.
In the mountains, the most popular regions are Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa and, by the sea, Albéna, the "Golden Sands", the "Sunside", the former Sozopol and Nessebar but they are more and more looking for a building in the Kavarna and Balcik region as well.
According to the analysts of Re/Max Bulgaria, sooner or later, the central region of the country, namely Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna, will also arouse the interest of investors and they are also more and more to buy in the very cheap area of Ruse.
Sofia, the capital, also offers attractive opportunities, business and office surfaces promise the highest depreciation rate.
Bulgaria is on the best path to becoming one of the most attractive golf paradises in Europe and thus be a priority destination, after the summer and winter seasons, also in the other two seasons of the year.
More vigilant investors are already buying in large numbers, for example in Bansko's corner.
According to analysts, people buying a building in Bulgaria are looking at the same time to change their life, their way of life.
Most buyers are English but others come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot investors are also present. Along the Black Sea and in the most famous ski resorts, we traditionally meet many Russian buyers.
Foreign buyers are divided into three groups, said Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
People who plan to settle in buy renovated buildings, at a price ranging from 50 to 100 thousand euros, or old broken houses, at a price ranging from 5 to 15 thousand euros, which are then renovated.
The criteria are easy access and communication possibilities, proximity to a large city, shops and in general that of the local doctor.
The second group includes buyers of secondary residences (since last December Bulgaria is listed among the top 10 holiday destinations in Germany).
The third group is made up of commercial investors who buy in the hope of achieving medium or long-term gains.
The price of the capital's buildings continues to rise as demand increases.
In the European Union, real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria. However, in the last 5 years, they have risen by 21 per cent each year.
The increase in real estate prices essentially exceeds the increase in wages.
Fodor and the six percent Hungarian
According to Gábor Fodor, Minister of the Environment and Waters, the meetings of professionals are concluded on Tuesday, however, Wednesday, after the official opening, the negotiations of ministers on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue.
Experts and politicians coming from 192 countries around the world will discuss the Bali Roadmap, which is supposed to define the efforts to be made after the Kyoto Protocol emission reduction period until 2012.
At the present time, strong discussions are taking place on this issue between developing and developed countries.
The United States also noted that, for the time being, it did not wish to discuss exact figures, but was prepared to sign an agreement on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 25 per cent to 40 per cent from 1990 levels until 2020.
Another important topic of the conference is whether developed countries commit themselves, excluding emission reductions, to providing financial and technological assistance to countries in need.
An agreement was also signed on aid to be provided to developing countries.
The aid fund defined by the Kyoto Protocol will be managed by a board of 16 members, probably within the framework of the United Nations Global Environment Facility (GEF), said Piac és Profit (Market and Profit).
Six percent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Gábor Fodor, Minister of Environment and Waters, confirms the EU's ambition to maintain its role as an admiral ship in global efforts to protect the climate and encourage the signing of the new international agreement before 2009.
The Minister explained that the EU was committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent by 2020 compared to the 1990 level, regardless of the success of the signing of the "Post-2012 Agreement", and was ready to reduce them by up to 30 per cent if other major regions of the world and/or developing countries were also ready to make commitments tailored to their responsibility and capacity.
Gábor Fodor recalled that in 1997, the countries signatories to the Kyoto Protocol had a total reduction of 5.2 per cent and all 15 EU members at that time made a commitment of 8 per cent less.
Hungary has committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 6 per cent compared to the level in the period 1985 to 1987, our country will fulfil its commitment, recalls the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
The challenge is great in Bali because the long-term international agreement on climate policy must be put in place within two years, otherwise the entry into force of the agreement would certainly be postponed after 2012. In this case, the reduction commitments below the Kyoto Protocol values would not be followed immediately by a new international emission reduction system that was highlighted in the new IPCC report, the international scientific body, which won the UN Nobel Peace Prize for addressing climate change.
The reduction of emissions would be delayed and the increase in the Earth's average temperature by more than 2 degrees Celsius could no longer be avoided, which scientists believe would have extremely serious and irrevocable consequences.
British Army recruits on YouTube
The British Army units report on the video-sharing site recordings made during their operations in Iraq and Afghanistan with the aim of becoming popular.
First, the British Air Force (RAF) was passionate about YouTube: special units operating in Afghanistan are uploading video footage of operations against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC announced.
These recordings, taken using miniature cameras mounted on the helmet, are checked at the Air Force Operations headquarters in Kandahar and then transferred to Londrès, where the compatriots load them on the Internet.
The political message is inescapable
Air Force soldiers have already passed 139 sequences on the net through this route and their "chain" has been watched by over 75 thousand people.
The British Ministry of Defence registered there as "defenceheadquarters" in the spring of 2007 and broadcasts videos on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan while the Commonwealth Ministry (Commonwealth Office) and the International Peacekeeping Forces in Iraq (MNFI) also have their own channels on YouTube.
Mission to Afghanistan
According to the initial objective of the air force, the videos were passed on the net to recruit. According to the Ministry of Defence, they were also used to make the general public aware of the real objectives of the army's presence abroad.
The propaganda published through this channel costs virtually nothing compared to the usual recruitment ads on television, which were communicated to BBC Gordon Mackenzie, a defence consultant, but it also inevitably carries a political message as it justifies in a special form the appropriateness of the military operations decided by the government.
The Americans made a game
The army is annoyed because, apart from the carefully composed and censored videos, amateur videos have passed on the sharing site that also present, for example, the death of soldiers: in the "official" propaganda films, somewhat hypocritical, the officers do not avoid talking about losses but they never present the bloody side of the fight.
In fact, many videos had already been posted on the Internet showing the areas of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan that were being carried out on a real mission, but the British army has only recently packed up for the loading of these videos.
The Americans do the recruitment a little differently using the America's Army shooting game that can be downloaded for free. In this game the player can put himself directly in place of the soldiers as part of a more or less real simulation.
Christmas raffle and doughnuts in ministries
Mónika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, does not seem to be sentimental: instead of celebrating Christmas, she will hold an end-of-year meeting with her collaborators who will be able to say goodbye to 2007 with doughnuts and coffee.
Another ministry will organize a party with live music, another will enchant officials with a raffle and offer a drink to create a Christmas atmosphere.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet, so the power is fun.
The public authorities are also preparing Christmas.
This year, the biggest Christmas party will be organized by the Ministry of Defence but it is not the employees of the Ministry who will be invited to it.
At Christmas, orphans, children of fallen soldiers will receive gifts, for missionary Christmas, family members of soldiers currently serving in foreign missions are invited and a press reception will also be held.
The Department is planning a budget of 25 million forints to create the atmosphere at the end of the year.
In comparison with other ministries, the National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) will celebrate.
The GKM party will be held in the House of the Future with a total budget of 4,320,000 forints and, of the six hundred employees in general, three hundred and fifty are expected.
At this party, the Christmas atmosphere will be rigorous, there will be actors and also a raffle.
The Christmas of the NFÜ cost 4,700,000 forints and was organized Wednesday in the building of the National Council of Justice (ILO) with concerts and dinner.
The rental of the room cost one million forints, the rest was spent on the more than four hundred guests.
According to our information, a service of the NFÜ is invited to another Christmas party that is organized with European money by the National Centre for Economic Development, society manager of tenders.
The building of the Théâtre de la Gaîté was rented for this purpose.
This information was not confirmed by MAG Zrt because we were unable to reach the person responsible.
The costume is not mandatory
The ILO building not only hosted the NFÜ but also the Ministry of Justice and Police, which, instead of a Christmas party, held a ball on the occasion of Saint Luke on 7 December.
The ILO did not charge them for the use of its rooms.
This ball had five hundred people.
The party began with the Minister's welcome words and the dinner was followed by a dance evening on live music.
Answer to the question of [origo]: the party was not mandatory at all at this ball.
The Ministries of Health, Labour and Local Authorities are preparing a sober holiday.
The Ministry of Health will organize a show and a party for its employees in its walls for 400,000 forints.
On the other hand, Mónika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, does not officially invite her employees to a Christmas party but to a working meeting at the end of the year.
One hundred and eighty people are expected to be invited to have coffee and donuts, the press service said, and the party will cost only 350,000 forints.
Gordon Bajnai, Minister of Local Government, will simply invite his collaborators to have a drink in the classroom of the Ministry of Local Government and Territorial Planning.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will organize a Christmas party in its large hall, at which 436 employees are expected.
It plans to spend 2,500 forints per guest including a buffet and a drink.
Since the arrival of János Veres, PM employees celebrate Christmas every year in the same way.
No festive atmosphere is foreseen, the official character is reinforced not only by the Minister's presentation but also by the time of the party taking place in the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture will organize a reception on January 20 to celebrate the New Year, the Christmas party will not take place.
The reception will be held at Vajdahunyad Castle, located in the City Wood, and according to the Ministry's communication, 1,000 forints per person are calculated for the 100 guests.
According to the press department, this is going to be a very simple cocktail to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
These cocktails, organized every year, are started by a few words of welcome from the minister followed by a modest meal.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture are not celebrating Christmas at all, the respective press services have communicated to [origo].
The press service of the Ministry of the Environment did not know the price of the official Christmas party.
However, more than four hundred people were invited to the party organized at the Musée de l'art décoratif.
The forces of the mega strike gather
The unions of the League and the National Association of Workers' Councils will set up, on Friday, their strike commission, which will be responsible for coordinating the undetermined strike on Monday.
On Saturday, a general protest meeting will be held and on Monday, on the day of the final vote on the Health Funds Act, the strike will begin.
This action will certainly cause important plugs in the traffic as the railway traffic will be stopped almost completely and the employees of BKV (public transport company) will also strike until 1pm.
The League Unions will make known, Friday afternoon, the details of their Monday strike, organized with the National Association of Workers' Councils.
The strike commission of LIGA - MOSZ will also be formed, it will serve as coordinator of Monday's actions.
On Saturday, a general protest assembly will be held and, from Monday, organizations joining the strike will stop work for an indefinite period if they fail to reach an agreement with the government.
This means that the date of the end of the strike, starting from the day of the vote in Parliament on the Health Funds Act, is not defined.
If the National Assembly does not adopt the Health Funds Act, the unions will immediately withdraw the call for strike.
On the other hand, if the law is passed, strike commissions will meet and decide what action to take.
According to the National Assembly's Monday agenda, it is likely that the vote on the Health Funds Act will take place only late in the evening or even at night.
Due to the strike planned for Monday, important traffic caps are planned: the railways will stop work for an indefinite period and during the morning part of the public transport to Budapest and more than half of the Volán companies are likely to be stopped.
At the same time, at different points in the country, half the track will be blocked as well.
Many trade unions and civil organizations have joined the call for strike, and the list of them is constantly updated on the League's website.
Some organizations reported that they were on strike for an indefinite period, while others reported a temporary stoppage of work.
Until Thursday afternoon the MÁV (Hungarian Railways) and the Free Trade Union of Roadmen (VDSZSZ) failed to reach an agreement on minimum services, but, as Christmas is approaching, more and more people are taking the train.
According to current communications, public transport in Budapest will strike from the start of service until 1 p.m., Budapest airport between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m., the Industrial Electricity and Thermal Energy Unions of the League will strike for four hours, the Teachers' Union and the Teachers' Democratic Union have called for strike for 2 hours and 2 hours to 8 hours respectively.
The National Association of Physicians will strike throughout the country alternately, the Health and Social Workers' Union (EDDSZ) attached to the SZEF will make a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands, made by the League, requires that the government withdraw its proposal for health reform and submit a new concept to the social debate.
The second claim requires that the new method of calculating the pension to be introduced from next year be introduced in several steps.
The third claim seeks a guarantee, in terms of retirement before the legal age, that the functions that deserve to be transferred into the system before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is the rejection by the Free Road Union (VDSZSZ), attached to the League Unions, of the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport concerning the secondary railway lines and the expectation of another proposal.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard increased country risk
According to the Risk Analysis Division of Political Capital, the Hungarian Guard's activity, established last August, with the support of Jobbik Magyarországért Mozambique (Movement for Better Hungary), increases, in several respects, the political risk of Hungary and the region.
In its "risk warning", society points out that, in relation to the Hungarian Guard's activity, the greatest political risk is already that "in the short term aggressive ethnic confrontations can occur as a result of the worsening ethnic tension already existing between the Gypsy and non-gypsy population of Hungary".
The research institute added that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy likely to provoke this situation is the main reason for this.
As they say, this is explained by one of the main shortcomings of Hungarian political actors: "public actors have passed the public debate on the Roma affair to representatives of radical and extreme political groupings that have based a political strategy on the dispute between the Gypsies and Hungarians".
The problem is compounded, normal dialogue becomes impossible, extremists are reinforced and aggressive conflicts are more likely to arrive, they say.
However, according to the research institute, with the increased attention of the Hungarian and international media, the Hungarian Guard's activity "has significantly deteriorated the image of Hungary abroad, in particular with regard to confidence in the country's stability and democratic maturity".
They recall that, following greater publicity for the reorganization of Hungarian radical and extreme right-wing groups since autumn 2006, many associations have been formed in Hungary since the summer of 2007 calling themselves the "national self-defence association".
"The common feature of these gatherings is that they define themselves as a civil organization when they publicly declare the preparation of their adherents for defence missions (catastrophes, national defence, defence of order), armed if necessary, moreover, by invoking the incapacity of the police, of the army, in other words of the state," they added.
They pointed out that everything was going on according to the method which, based on the resentment of the political society and the parties, seeks to disguise different political ambitions in a civil aspect.
The emphasis on civility and association is therefore only used to avoid legal traps in the registration of such associations in court, but they are also a political strategy.
The analysis indicates that the Hungarian Guard's activity is a factor that also increases the risk in relation to neighbourhood relations.
"In recent months, many neighbouring countries have cited the Hungarian Guard as a potential source of risk and ultranationalist political actors in some neighbouring countries want to justify their anti-Hungarian policy by referring to the establishment of the Hungarian Guard.
This influences the political stability of the region," they added.
According to the research institute, the establishment of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in Central Eastern Europe, political risks have increased throughout the region.
As they say, the operation of the Hungarian Guard resembles, for example, the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard whose constitution was declared by the Bulgarian National Union (BNU) in August 2007.
The many Roma riots that broke out in a neighbourhood of Sofia (Kraszna Poljana) were at the origin of the Bulgarian guard's constitution.
Taking advantage of these events, UNB decided to establish a guard by saying that the organization's objective is "national self-defence".
According to them, in the last 17 years, the gypsies have "terrorized" Bulgaria but the state has remained inactive and neutral, recalls the Political Capital.
They added that the initiative had sparked lively debate in Bulgarian public opinion.
As they say, the statement by some Bulgarian Roma organisations regarding the establishment of their own guard as a resistance indicates the increased risk of ethnic clashes.
The operation of the Hungarian Guard showing similarities with that of the Bulgarian National Guard does not exclude that the Hungarian Roma react to the threat in the same way by organizing their own self-defense, can be read in the risk warning of Political Capital.
At the request of the telegraphic agency, Attila Juhász, Research Director of Political Capital, said: Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, their risk analysis is published annually, and if events occur that could have an impact on risk change, they inform public opinion, as in the present case, by issuing a risk warning.
The party is not marked in red everywhere
In Hungary, the law defines exactly the holiday days and, around the holidays, it has become common to reorganize the working days whose number will decrease next year.
Holidays are not uniform in the EU and the United States either.
Hungarian legislation distinguishes between national and state holidays and rest days.
Rest days are often linked to religious festivals or important historical events.
In Hungary, we celebrate the new year, the last day of the year that ends and the first day of the new year are also days of rest, the latter especially so that the revelators can rest peacefully.
In addition, in a year, we have at least eleven celebrations marked in red.
March 15th is a national holiday, commemorating the revolution of 1848, as October 23rd is also the commemorative day of the revolution of 1956.
On August 20th, we celebrate the constitution of our state, May 1st is the Labor Day, and on November 1st and 2nd, we remember the members of our family and our dead friends.
In addition, we have two days at Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
The days of our state, national or even religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, according to the calendar, it has become common to reorganize the working days in cases where there is only one working day left before or after the party marked in red.
It is true that we pay the price for extended weekends by working or going to school on the Saturday before the extended weekend.
For many years, the Minister of Labour has made special regulations on the replacement days of the days preceding or following the holidays.
The Act covers all employers and employees, civil servants and persons working in the public service.
It does not apply, however, to service companies, institutions that rotate without interruption and in service, by virtue of their vocation, and also for days of rest.
This year, the working days will be changed only around the end of the year holidays: from December 24, life stops almost throughout the country because according to experience the majority of people do more overtime or take holidays that they have saved for these purposes in order to spend the days between Christmas and New Year's day at home.
Next year many holidays fall in the middle or the end of the week, so there will be fewer changes in workdays compared to this year.
The calendar will be reorganized the first time around the Labour Day to allow employees to stay at home four days in a row.
Saturday, April 25 will be a day of work to have a day of rest on Friday, May 2.
Another change is planned for October 23rd: Saturday, October 18th will be a working day replacing Friday, 24.
On the other hand, next year, the end of the year is announced under the sign of the holidays because from December 24, everyone will take a non-stop break even if the New Year's Day falls on a Wednesday.
Six futile things that can piss off colleagues
E-mails that we forget to send, voice messages that we never receive, innocent lies that annoy us almost more: these are things that "beautiful" the daily life of a workplace.
The question is whether we get used to these problems or rise to the challenge and consciously avoid ambiguous situations, causing trouble to others.
Examples.
"Excuse me, I forgot to tell you that you were called from the marketing department," said a colleague.
That you missed a date?
At best he is sorry and tries to arrange things by calling the marketing service to tell them that he forgot to pass the message (this is the least common solution).
In most cases, the thing is arranged with excuses.
Before you have painful explanations, it is useful to think about how you can cause unpleasant moments for your colleagues and make efforts to avoid them.
Are you borrowing something that doesn't belong to you?
There's nothing more annoying than wanting to take a file, an office tool or the phone and you can't find them anywhere.
Remember the day before you put the stapler on the desk, but she disappeared the next morning?
Do you happen to find your pen that you thought was lost in your colleague's office?
Don't take anything from your colleagues without asking otherwise they're right to be angry at you for stealing their property.
Don't bring envelopes, post-it into your pocket because it may be annoying that there are no more envelopes and that you need them right away.
Are you chatting about your colleagues' privacy?
There are no good ways to stop propagating chumps.
Who did what, with whom?
Or why?
Don't tell everyone about your colleagues' privacy!
If a colleague shares his intimate secrets with you, do not abuse his confidence!
Bury in you the shared information and do not discuss it with your colleagues in his absence even if your colleagues are also aware.
You claim to be ill for no good reason?
When you call the office and you declare yourself ill on the pretext of a headache tearing up because you feel bad or you think you need rest that day, think about the fact that your work, your urgent affairs, your futures missions must be carried out by someone else in your place.
Don't bother your colleagues!
If you know in advance that the next day you won't go to work or that something can happen that would force you to stay at home, don't forget to warn your boss and your colleagues to avoid their surprise at your absence the next day.
Ironing, knitting, telephone
You're getting into your work, but your colleagues' sneezing suddenly rips you out of it?
Have you become, unintentionally, witness to a telephone conversation that you would have done better not to listen?
Do not disturb your colleagues with trembling, singing, talking aloud (which you lead over their head), footbeats, big words or discontents expressed aloud.
They can disturb even if your colleagues are not immersed in a project (writing, design, organization).
Are you accusing the others of a mistake?
If your work is not done for the deadline, you forget to send a mail or an important message, blame no one for this forgetfulness!
Don't put it on account of the possible chaos in the office or your noisy colleagues!
Recognize it if you have made a mistake and if it has presented disadvantages for others, fix the mistake!
Ask how you could fix your fault, fix the negligence!
Do you feel too much at home at the office?
Putting a jogging and slippers is comfortable at home but they are not suitable at the office!
Don't jog comfortable even if your function allows it!
Don't be neglected, respect your colleagues and yourself by dressing properly, and if your function requires it by wearing nice and elegant clothes, to go to work!
If you want to meet expectations, you're not interesting anymore.
We move slowly into the usual morning cap.
Suddenly, a particular melody is heard on the radio: the voice of a violin with electronic effects.
I'm putting up the sound.
The music changes rhythm and the bass arrives to accompany the tones of any hour, then a female choir joins it as a real jewel.
Mr2 broadcasts the song Wings of Love by Zagar.
Hungarian musical life has not spoiled us for a long time with good quality electronic pop.
Now it seems that the plug becomes different if you listen to Zagar's new album.
The appearance of Yonderboi, the few interesting new productions born from the Hungarian digital underground begin gradually to change the overall image and, despite the new fashion of garage rock tearing the guitar, the Hungarian electrotropp proves that there is new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer arrived from Pécs and he was playing himself in the Yonderboi group before he started his own way, perhaps because "there is no room for two feet in the same shoe".
His project (Zagar) and his music, an ally of jazz, electronic dancing music and pop, began to become known when he was entrusted with the composition of the soundtracks filmed (e.g.
The Ferenc Török season).
The training at the beginning in small clubs began to be known by a larger audience when the magazine wan2 cited their first album of 2002 among the fifty most important records of the Hungarian market and proclaimed Zagar, with Yonderboi, the almost only creators of the Hungarian trend that would also be competitive to the west.
Zagar and his ensemble became unquestionably "trendy" but no one asked them if they wanted to wear this label.
The band reacted properly, released a new and better record.
The album entitled Cannot Walk Fly Instead, released recently, can open new channels for them, although the title wishes to represent a continuity with the years spent in Pécs.
It was a line of the former group of Pécs de Balázs Zságer.
We are there with the reference to flight but next to air music now appears, according to the spirit and trend of the time, the strongest guitar, impact of rock and roll.
György Ligeti, a singer currently working in England with the group The Puzzle, showed his talent in these songs during the first of the album at the Millennial Park.
On the album, we find a real tube for the radio, Mr2 Petõfi, recently broadcasting popular music from morning to evening, began to introduce the melodies of Wings of Love recorded with six Hungarian singers ("Underground Divas").
Everything's all right, then.
hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer questions.
hvg.hu: This new tube prompts me to ask a question: has your music remained well a music aimed at a certain layer?
Zságer Balázs: The term music aimed at a certain layer doesn't tell me much.
For me there are two castes in light music; not mainstream or underground, not alternative or pop but commercial music and sincere music.
The so-called alternative, underground music can also be mediocre and made only to sell them and thus become commercial.
But a good pop song can be sincere too.
The reception attitude also works in this spirit regardless of language or borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference between Hungarian and foreign audiences, is either one more open to your music?
Zs.B.: Abroad, especially in the west, light music has older traditions.
There, people go to concerts and not only young people of about ten or twenty years of age but also the older ones.
They follow with much more attention the changes in light music because they think it is also part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the public in your work?
Are you interested in who, or how many people listen to your music?
Zs.B.: I'm obviously glad to see that more and more people come to our concerts.
However we have never made music for the market.
For us music is not made to achieve a goal but for a specific reason.
The role of the public is more important at concerts or mutual influence already works but it is perceived only in the elusive changes of the moment.
But I noticed that if you wanted to meet the public's expectations, you wouldn't be interesting anymore.
hvg.hu: Are you going to follow Yonderboi's example?
He works alone and has made a career in the west.
Zs.B.: We don't really follow his path even though sometimes some try to find traces in our music.
We are rather team players who trust each other's musical presence and let it unfold.
In the beginning, it was of course inevitable that our music would be compared to Yonderboi's because we are many to leave his band and take another path.
hvg.hu: On Mr2 Petõfi's rankings, Wings of Love is ranked first.
Many have heard the name of Zagar for the first time through this song.
With this more popular style did you consciously open up to a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We did not plan to make a tube to sell the disc.
This song means more things.
We wanted it for the final of the album to try to soften the orgy of sounds and the more difficult themes addressed throughout the album.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why was the guideline?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a gospel choir.
We had the idea to compose this choir of good soloists from the Hungarian music scene.
Thus was composed the six-member choir, namely Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh, which was later baptized Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you want this song like that or did the girls change it a bit?
Zs.B.: This song already existed for a long time in an instrumental version and then when we composed the album, we thought that something was still missing from this song.
The chord suite attracted the voice of the song.
I sang the melody the same night that the girls learned later.
I had it almost immediately and everything was terribly spontaneous.
I remember it galvanized me back then, but we certainly needed the Divas.
With my voice she wouldn't have had the same strength.
hvg.hu: On the record and at the concert it also seemed to me that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo (except for a short solo by Judy Jay), they have no role alone, they all sing together and they don't sing louder than music, so music doesn't just accompany their singing.
They were behind the stage too.
Is it meant to be?
Zs.B.: The fact that they were in the background is due only to technical problems.
On the other hand, what was voluntary was that we did not want to distribute solo roles.
The song also says that we have to forget a little bit our ego, forget who comes from where, who goes or, we just have to let those wings, the wings of love, take us away.
I wanted others to also feel this euphoric state that we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: Which of the songs made you work the most?
Zs.B.: Actually, none of the music creation process, we had more difficult songs during the mix.
For example, with Dorian Gray's Dilemma, or I play a concert piano, or with Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, or the groove didn't want to work for a long time, and then, little by little, everything set in place as in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What's your favorite about the new album?
Zs.B.: It changes all the time with the concerts and the fact that I have already "dropped" this record.
Right now, it's Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
Trader perfids to risk billions because of its inferiority complex
A cover-up fraudster.
This is the former employee of the French giant Société Générale, owner of the Czech bank Komerční banka.
The bank has lost nearly EUR 5 billion because of it.
But it seems rather that Kerviel is only a great player who wanted to equal his colleagues, and who, moreover, cannot be considered as incapable at all.
Unlike all major banking houses, he recognized in time the crisis of the American mortgage market.
"He's fragile," said his superiors, who denounced him to the police.
However, if we stick to Kerviel's testimony reported by the French media, including Le Monde, this man's transactions produced at the end of last year a profit amounting to 1.6 billion euros.
The crisis overtakes the United States
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he says in the statement.
Last summer, he managed to take advantage of the US crisis to earn half a billion euros.
In fact, he felt the opportunity from the beginning of the year.
Information began to emerge in February that so-called "sub-prime" mortgages, granted to low-income clients or those who had experienced difficulties in reimbursing them in the past, would have problems.
But this crisis should not affect the whole economy.
Kerviel didn't believe it, and he gambled.
Thus, at the end of the year, its profits amounted to 1.6 billion euros.
"As soon as I had won my first half-billion, I didn't know how to announce it," Kerviel says, adding that he didn't, of course, keep anything for himself."
Throughout the interrogation, he admits to having misreported for not being screened.
He managed to fool his superiors, although the Eurex stock exchange began to take an interest in his transactions.
Who doesn't risk anything has nothing to do with it.
Was he afraid to be discovered?
Rather not.
"I thought the mere fact of getting 1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them."
Where did he come from to risk so much?
He only reached his post gradually.
He had started working at Société Générale in 2000 just after completing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about $51,000.
Two years later, he was already a trader's assistant and, in 2005, he became an independent trader with an annual salary of $90,000.
Yet he knew that he would never win as much as the others.
"From my first interview in 2005, I knew that I was much less regarded than the others.
In the light of my university curriculum and my professional and personal career," Kerviel told investigators.
Soon after he took office, he achieved his first great success.
Thanks to the Allianz shares, he won half a billion euros by betting on the decline of this title during the attacks in Londrès.
And the mechanism was triggered - it wanted more.
As long as you win, we'll leave you alone.
"There was like a snowball effect," he told the police.
But the superiors were aware of everything, or rather, they doubted it.
"As long as I won, they pretended to close my eyes."
But that's when the start of the year comes.
He's losing a billion euros in one day.
In mid-January, after the weekend, he decides to hide the money.
On Monday, when he arrives at work, he is no longer employed by the bank.
A few days later, the bank announced that it had lost EUR 5 billion because of it.
And how did we find out?
He became a suspect because of his leave.
"Last year, I only took four days off.
A trader who does not take a vacation is a trader who does not want to leave his book to another," concludes Kerviel.
The Czech Republic has the opportunity to obtain 365 billion
Yesterday, the ministers of the Czech Government signed a total of nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, which could, in the coming years, contribute 14 billion euros (approximately 365 billion Czech kroner) to the Czech Republic.
This is about half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
Nearly CKr 125 billion from seven operational programmes will be allocated to the Czech regions.
The Czech companies will be able to obtain approximately SEK 100 billion under the Enterprise and Innovation programme.
The transport sector will benefit most, up to 150 billion.
The Transport programme is the most important operational programme and represents up to 22 per cent of the financial resources that the Czech Republic can obtain under these projects.
This money will be the source of an increase in the budget of the National Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will manage a sum of 90.8 billion kroner next year.
The Enterprise and Innovation programme, intended for SMEs and entrepreneurs, should be used to obtain financial resources to encourage innovation within the enterprise.
Companies should obtain financial resources for the introduction of new technologies, research in industry, but also for the introduction of new and more efficient management methods.
Until now, the Czech Republic has been among the new members of the EU's least successful recipients of funds.
The Tribunal confirmed the sentence of 20 years in prison for the former President of Nicaragua
The Nicaraguan Court of Appeal confirmed on Thursday the 20-year prison sentence for former President Arnold Alemán, who was sentenced in 2003 for a $100 million fraud (nearly $1.8 billion).
However, he was later released and lived under house arrest in his hacienda near the capital of Nicaragua.
Whether or not the former head of this Central American state, in office between 1997 and 2002, will be incarcerated again is not clear at the moment, according to the AP agency.
According to the President of the Ileana Pérez Court of Appeal, everything will now depend on prison officers, either they will let Aleman finish his sentence at home, or they will go back to prison.
Four years ago, the Tribunal proved that Alemán regularly moved the government's money to foreign companies' accounts in Panama.
They were fictitious societies, and the accounts were in fact owned by his family members and his closest supporters.
Some of this money went into the funds that Alemán had created to finance his election campaign in 2001.
We've adopted the budget.
That's the way it is.
The State budget was adopted.
How is this budget exceptional?
This is the first budget designed by this government and accepted by the government majority without the support of the opposition.
The one for the current year passed a year ago thanks to the support of the Czech Socialist Party - ČSSD, since it was prepared by Minister Sobotka and ČSSD could not afford its refusal.
Contrary to the turbulent debate before the vote on the statement of confidence in the government, this time nothing dramatic.
The Chamber of Deputies passed this law without any problem, which, although the most influential, is usually neglected.
There's some sort of paradox.
Whether we want it or not, each chapter and article is the beginning and end of any government.
The budget is a constituent part of politics, though hidden behind the power competition between government and opposition.
The latter is more attractive in the media and that's why more attention is given to it in the media.
The arguments of politicians are much more interesting to the opinion than the abrupt figures.
The national budgets of the past socialist governments suffered from three ills which the current budget is not capable of settling at the same time:
The first is the large share given to the costs of mandates imposed by law, constituted not only by pensions, but also by social charges, adopted last year by the silent "coalition" bringing together the ČSSD and KSČM parties.
The second is a deficit economy, resulting from the first evil.
The third obstacle is the deficit in public finances, i.e. the deficit in cities and municipalities.
However, it is not the deficit in the state budget that represents the greatest hazard.
It is public and relatively under control.
The real time bomb is the deficit of cities and municipalities.
Many mayors often issued, in stunning terms, bonds, disproportionate debt to their municipalities, in order to obtain, apart from the money from taxes, tax duties and bank loans, new sources of investment.
In past years, they were able to repay these debts through the mass sale of the shares of the distribution systems, particularly those of the energy, obtained from the State in the context of privatizations.
Today, they no longer have this source.
If only official and verifiable facts are taken into account, it can be seen that:
Our economy has been going through a period of several years, like the rest of the world, a phase of growth and ČSSD does not fail to sell itself.
It was a unique opportunity for the successive governments of this party to regularize public finances.
Instead, they were in debt to the state more and more.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania and Egypt, have managed their affairs in a much more reasonable way than our republic.
It is a monstrous shame that falls mainly on previous governments.
We are among the countries that, on a global scale, are least threatened by poverty.
We therefore have no need for massive social programmes which have, precisely in recent years, unfortunately become unnecessarily swollen.
Although some of the absurd populist spending approved last year prior to the elections has been eliminated, if a gap in the retirement age limit and a reform of the pension system will not take place in the near future, then any policy will cease to exist in that country and whoever will be in power, it will only administer.
By barely exaggerating, it can be said that politicians in power will become bureaucrats who mechanically distribute the majority of the money imposed between pensions and social benefits.
That is why the current budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the mechanism that causes regular costs to be pushed back by mandate costs.
The projected deficit of 70 billion in 2008 would be absolutely useless if previous governments had not dissipated all the money they could.
If we really don't want the government's policies to become mere bureaucrats, we must be patient and give this fragile government coalition, aware that the state can only spend the equivalent of what it can levy in taxes and tax duties, the necessary calm for the preparation of new reform laws.
Only the latter will gradually achieve a balanced state budget.

Banks Want to Solve the Crisis
The US Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the English, Swiss and Canadian central banks have decided to fight the financial market crisis together.
More than a hundred billion dollars will be placed on the money markets through auctions.
It will be a question for banks to sell, through an auction system, the interest rates at which they are prepared to borrow money.
For example, the US Fed will send $40 billion to the auction and, in addition, it will provide $24 billion to the European and Swiss Central Banks.
This is the first time since the attacks of 11 September that the Central Banks of individual States have decided to take such concerted action to prevent or even reduce the effects of the financial crisis.
"This approach tends to solve the major problems of the economy, namely the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend," writes Bernard Baumohl's report to clients of the Economic Outlook Group consulting company.
"The concerted action of the Central Banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the United States from 65 percent to about 50 percent," adds Baumohl in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion to unreimbursed loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts are still waiting for more losses in billions.
"If the central banks have chosen this approach, it is that they must really understand what can still follow," says the chief economist of the ABN Amro Kieran Davies.
"It seems that the situation is really bad," he adds.
The central banks fear that, if banks themselves have difficult access to loans, they will lend more to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and plunge the U.S. economy into a recession that could affect global economic growth.
The central banks made this choice after the interbank rate of Londrès, called LIBOR, which was used to borrow from the interbank market, was not successfully lowered.
This meant that banks were still afraid of mutual borrowing, despite the fact that the US, Canadian and English central banks had repeatedly lowered their interest rates in the fall.
"This will have the same effect as a further decline in interest rates," says Reuters Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting.
Some analysts do not believe that the Central Banks' approach will not help avert the crisis, as it does not address the main problem of falling real estate in the US.
President Klaus: Ecologists' debates are incredible
Global climate change is expected to be a major threat to developing countries.
President Václav Klaus once again spoke out on the issue of global warming.
Criticism this time over the United Nations International Conference on Climate Change ending in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book The Blue Planet, not Green, he stated that the debates of the ecologists were incredible.
According to Klaus, it is not only the structure of the conference, consisting of a curious mix of representatives of Governments and non-governmental organizations, that is unacceptable, but also the basic difference between the rhetoric accompanying it and reality.
"The debate is not structured at all, it's just a rocket of words, ersatz solutions to current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech President stressed, when presenting his book, that his subject is of great importance to him and that is why he is so committed to this cause.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book also appeared in German translation, since, he said, "I often encounter only the caricature of my opinions".
From now on, interested persons can read their positions without being distorted.
Klaus recalled that although he is not a climatologist, he nevertheless believes that he has enough provisions to write such a book.
He is indeed an academic capable of following and appreciating scientific treaties, he has the practice of statistics and he is also an economist.
The main conclusions of the book are, according to him, the following: the climate is constantly changing, the changes in the climate are therefore normal, there is no opinion shared by all researchers on global warming, the effects of current changes are neither too important nor too serious, they are therefore not dangerous and, finally, the efforts made to influence climate change are useless, ineffective and unacceptablely costly.
Especially since he had experience of a totalitarian regime, he considered it unacceptable to impose unverified opinions on others, which he felt was a dangerous attack on freedom.
In response to the questions of the persons present, he explained on several occasions that he was not against "reasonable protection of the environment, but against a comprehensive environmentalism that does not take into account the relationship between the costs and the profits they bring".
In Vienna, Klaus had already spoken about this topic two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600 thousand people failed to renew their driver's license in time
Six hundred thousand drivers have allowed the deadline to expire and have failed to renew their old driver's license, which expires at the end of the year.
We are the last day when people can still apply for renewal, so that the authorities are able to issue them a new permit before the end of the year.
However, the Department is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of unlicensed drivers will take the road.
According to the authorities, they have not renewed their driver's license especially those who no longer wish to drive.
While the municipalities report a drop in the number of licence renewal applications, the authorities in the capital are invading applications and the number of licence renewal applications has increased this week.
The City Hall satisfies about 2000 customers per day.
There's a tail about half an hour or so.
In Prague, nearly 140.OO drivers have not yet renewed their driver's licenses.
The issuance of a new permit takes 20 days.
However, it is possible to request the issue within a short period of five days.
In this case, the driver pays a supplement of five hundred crowns.
Drivers who fail to complete the compulsory renewal of the driving licence by the end of the year and will take the road without a valid licence will be liable to a fine by January.
The culprit will be forced to pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
However, the police officer may also deal with the offence by resorting to a friendly approach.
In the case of an administrative offence, the fine rises to 2500 crowns.
According to old information, even a person who was not going to circulate was liable to a fine.
By doing so she could be forced to pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry had called on the authorities to moderate and impose fines of no more than 1000 crowns.
According to the spokesman for the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka, no one risks fines in tens of thousands.
The driver's licence is, in his view, a document that people can decide whether or not they wish to have.
It is not as with the identity card that, it, must be valid without exceptions.
People who don't want to drive should give up their driver's license.
Just bring it or send it to the corresponding municipality.
Driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to be valid at the end of the year.
However, drivers are also forced to progressively renew other types of driving licences.
Persons with documents from 1994 to 2000 are still three years old to complete the renewal.
The validity of driving licences issued in the years 2001 to 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are about 2.6 million other documents.
The Tribunal has reduced the sentences of detectives agreed with Berdych
Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, former police officers accused of connivance with David Berdych's gang, will be imprisoned for 13 and 10 years respectively.
The Prague High Court has thus definitively condemned them by reducing their sentences by 1 and 2 years respectively.
Originally, the detectives of the Department for Combating Organized Crime were at risk of 14 and 12 years' imprisonment.
It is no longer possible to appeal against the judgment delivered today, only an appeal to the High Court is possible.
Although Berdych is also accused in this case, he is awaiting only the verdict of first instance at this time.
However, he has already received sentences in other trials for more than 16 years in prison.
He can't get any more.
In January, the departmental court found 19 persons guilty of participation in hold-ups, and the High Court now dealt with the appeals of 16 of them.
Since the beginning of the investigation, most of the defendants had questioned the prosecution on the grounds that it was a handled case.
According to the Central Bohemian Court of Justice, police members, after an agreement with Berdych, transmitted information from police sources to criminals, covered the various hold-ups and helped gang members avoid criminal responsibility.
The gang returned 30 per cent of the lark to Opava and Kořařík.
The prosecution refers to the criminal activity of the gang in the years 1999 to 2001.
Essentially, armed robbery of which the victims in most cases have suffered serious damage to their health, but also abuse of power by a public official and prohibition of weapons.
During house searches, the police discovered illegally detained pistols, shells with a steel core, a laser direct-fire viewfinder or a machine gun.
According to the charges, the gang was enriched with tens of millions of crowns.
Apart from nearly 20 men from this trial, the courts have already found guilty of other robbery by hand raised Berdych and a whole series of others.
Other men in the Berdych neighbourhood are still explaining themselves in court in another trial, some cases have not yet reached court.
The main hearing has, for the time being, avoided Tomáš Půta and Maroš Šulej who are currently in detention in Ireland, where they await the final decision on their extradition to the Czech Republic.
The price of child substitution: 12 million
The lawyer for the families affected Igor Veleba wants to get compensation of 12 million crowns plus the costs from the hospital of Třebíč.
Three million for each of the mothers, two million for the fathers and one million for each of the children.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
That is why the lawyer at Ondřej Dostál Hospital is absolutely not in agreement with Veleba's proposal.
"We refuse such a claim, it is very high," Dostal said at the exit of the hearing.
"To be able to make an opinion on the counter-proposal, we need the expert report that the opposing party commissioned the drafting.
We'll see if this one has any explanatory value.
But we continue to think that the total sum should not exceed hundreds of thousands," Dostal said.
According to him, the amount should be set between 100,000 and 200,000 Kč for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, the Jablonov family demanded a million crowns for each month where they could not raise their biological daughter.
Veleba used the expert report, prepared for him by the university hospital in Prague-Motol, as a document in support of the compensation negotiations.
According to psychology and psychiatry experts, parents suffered psychological damage and were subject to stress at different scales and depths.
The stress situation has been better supported by men, although they have been confronted with the remorse of not having been able to prevent the substitution of newborns.
Women remain less serene in the face of the experience of trauma in today's world and in the face of what is happening precisely at the moment, he summarized the content of the Veleba report.
Veronika and Nikola were replaced by nurses at the hospital in Třebíč on 9 December.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola at the Čermák in Přibyslavice and Veronika at Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová at Jablonov.
At the end of October, the Governor of the Vysočina Miloš Vystrčil region handed over to each of the families 100,000 crowns for the reimbursement of expenses caused by the error of the hospital of Třebíč managed by the region.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are legally bound by civil liability insurance.
In case of failure, they must draw from the reserve fund, exceptionally, they can ask the manager for help.
To date, the courts have recognized relatively little compensation, and the amounts calculated from the tables were in the order of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions.
Polívka lost Valašské Království (the Kingdom of Valašsko)
Bolek Polívka lost the dispute over the mark Valašské království (Kingdom of Valašsko).
According to the judge of the Ostrava Regional Court, he had used the title of King of Valašsko for the first time, but the project was set up by the team around Tomáš Harabiš, former actor's collaborator.
Polívka was not present at today's hearing.
However, according to his lawyer, the case is probably not over and his client will appeal.
"The dispute concerns the fact that Mr. Harabiš and his team are biased against Bolek Polívka's popularity," Polívka's lawyer said after the trial.
According to him, the words Kingdom of Valašsko evoke to everyone precisely this actor and comic.
Harabiš is of the same opinion.
"There's a job behind us that's almost ten years old.
Searching for money and developing events," he said.
According to him, money is the cause of the dispute.
"After years, they realized that the project was successful and that they could benefit from it.
They are the ones who want to parasiticize our work," he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, Polívka used the title valašský král (King of Valašsko) for the first time in his television programme.
Actor Radoslav Brzobohatý crowned him king in 1993.
At the time, however, this had no bearing on the plan to establish a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came up with the idea of issuing passports for the Valašské Království.
From a humorous action originally came a business and a lucrative commercial activity, followed by the creation by Harabiš of the company Valašské království.
In 1997 Polívka agreed that his name and signature should be mentioned in the passport and even offered the holders balances on the price of the visit of his farm and his theatre performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
Today, the judge also mentioned that Harabiš only used the naked idea, published by Polívka in the manéž broadcast, for commercial purposes.
"The popularity of Boleslav Polívka certainly helped the Valašské království project," the judge said.
She added, however, that the core of the project was Harabiš and his team, who were intensely dedicated to the project.
The collaboration between the now enemy parties continued until 2000 when Harabiš organized an official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín.
But from there, conflicts began to accumulate between Polívka and Harabiš, which culminated in the deposition "of King Boleslav 1st elected forever".
The ruling role in the kingdom was then, under the inspiration of Harabiš, assumed by singer Jarmila Šulaková as Queen Mother.
Then, in 2002, Polívka filed a complaint against Harabiš and his company, which the court today rejected.
What could make the matter clear is the tournament envisaged for the throne and half of the princess.
A new king should come out.
He still didn't want to betray the details and the date.
"We don't want to go to work fast.
It would be something like the parade of kings in Slovácko.
The king would be elected for some time.
Even Mr Polívka can of course register," added Harabiš.
Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi test: disappearance of prejudices
Actually, I've never been a big Peugeot 206 fan.
Its rolling qualities were not extraordinary, the quality of gear change, of driving and also of manufacturing could in many ways be described as below average.
At present, however, there is its successor Peugeot 207 on the market, which is much better.
All the more so as the combi named SW goes a step further, all I have to do is think about it.
When I tested the classic Peugeot 207 hatchback, I complained, for example, about head space on the back seats.
While that ends the complaints because the combi bodywork means that even the great devils will be comfortable in this regard.
Let's see how fast it's done.
I'm going to bring up the inside very quickly so I don't get too repeated.
This is an almost successful design, my only comment on the central tunnel that seems to me to be poor.
There, I would have liked a slightly more inventive design, since the car looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and the time when you could complain about seats or too short backs is over.
Lateral guidance has also improved significantly compared to model 206.
As for the space, the increase in the dimensions of the bodywork is sensitive there too.
The combi also sees the lack of space above the mentioned head disappear.
A safe in the safe
The most important thing about this vehicle, therefore, is its luggage compartment.
I have to evaluate this as very well accessible (also thanks to the rear swivel ice) and with a rather easy stowage.
Blind spaces are equipped with stop elastics that are an ideal compromise.
It is not cumbersome and can be extended while being able to hold quite heavy objects.
But let's stop at the volume.
According to the tables, it makes 428 l in the basic configuration, which is a rather average figure in relation to competition.
Apart from Škoda Fabia Combi, the best-selling vehicle in this category in Czech Republic.
Comparing the 207 SW with the new generation of Mlada Boleslav's product, it can be seen that the Peugeot remains very significantly behind, the difference being 52 litres.
When it comes to going on leave abroad or loading a stroller, this figure is almost critical.
But, if I were to highlight the advantages, I would mention the underside of the body remaining after the backs of the seats are completely straight, or a very low foot.
120 horses spread over four cylinders
The car we tested was equipped with a four-cylinder Otto engine with a volume of 1.6 l and a power of 88 kW.
And actually, that's what a 1.6 should look like that makes a family hatchback work.
It is quiet, consumes little and, above all, it grows well.
If I compare it with the equivalent produced by Škoda which often gives the impression of having an exhaust bottle clogged by a mop, then I can only be enthusiastic.
We're going through the rates.
The price of the vehicle is not affordable by all.
However, one must be aware that we have tested a fairly well equipped car, with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of a vehicle with an Otto 1.4 liters engine of 329 900 Kč is still fair.
The vehicle we tested costs from 410 900 Kč, which is already enough.
Premium equipment, also tested, increases the price by 80,000 Kč.
In addition to head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic wipers, automatic control of rear windows...
In fact, the vehicle costs 531 900 Kč at the end of the day.
That's a lot, but try to add to the Fabia price additional equipment and you will get a very similar figure.
All that remains is to choose the brand.
The integration of Slovak pupils into British schools is not working well
The number of children from Eastern European countries in British schools is increasing, which causes the rest of them to be concerned about the evolution of local education.
The integration of Eastern Europeans is currently facing a series of obstacles.
British schools even see cases where conflicts between immigrants and descendants of the original inhabitants turn into violence.
The case of North Kent, where persistent and immigrant conflicts of Slovak origin are beginning to intensify, illustrates the problem of the integration of children from Eastern Europe.
The arguments, the chicane and the fights between the students have been translated into relations between the parents.
The situation went so far that the police arrested a Slovak woman in Chatham who was hitting a 10-year-old student with an iron bar.
The culprit defends himself by claiming that the boy insulted him by racist words.
The police also had to intervene following the attack on a Slovak immigrant by two teenage girls.
The girls allegedly made racist remarks to this man and threw stones at him.
"When we came home, a young man climbed on the bus stop and started spitting on us.
When I told him to stop, he answered with apples and pears and then discovered his buttocks," described another unpleasant adventure a mother of Slovak students.
Complaints are made by both parties.
One of the residents went so far as to qualify conflicts with immigrants as a struggle for survival.
The cases mentioned above show that the atmosphere in British schools between the inhabitants of origin and the immigrants is beginning to be tense.
70 thousand Slovaks came to find work are registered in Great Britain.
And about 30 thousand Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it's really an island of freedom.
Everything you expect from your holidays can happen if you make a good choice.
Golden and white beaches like snow, high waves or then a calm sea like a pond.
Palms and all inclusive with servers offering you on the beach a pizza, ice cream or intoxicating cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean Sea, you will not find this list only in its entirety, but enriched.
However, there is only one island on which you will find much more and it is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island in the Great Antilles.
By the time of the Spanish, Cuba had been the bastion of their invasion of America.
Christophe Columbus called it the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana has become the repository and the place of transshipment of the treasures that the Spanish had stolen and that they were transporting to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was built in the early 1920s.
It was Lucky Luciano, one of the leaders of the American mafia, who had it built, since everything that was a crime in the USA (especially under prohibition) was admitted and supported in Cuba: drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his clients, there were, among others,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, tall buildings pushed and cars, belonging to the cult symbols of the 50's of the last century, were circulating on the wide boulevards.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojímar he had his yacht.
The stars of the show business and politicians of the entire America left their signatures on the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio.
What about today?
You can leave your autograph on the walls of Havana's Bodeguita.
In the bar of the Hotel Nacional, a luxury hotel, you will be mixed the cocktail of your choice.
And these cult cars still circulate in Havana, since the jigoulis and fiats once imported have already long, in a climate so salty and humid, rotten.
Although Havana, especially the oldest part, is significantly decrepit, nowhere else in the vicinity are there as many splendid colonial monuments as there are right there.
Other places become more beautiful, for example Trinidad.
Since tourism brings the money if necessary, its development has the green light.
Over the past fifteen years, new hotels have pushed not only to Havana, but above all to Varader, on the coast of Holguín province, and also on small islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a fantasy that is unique in the world and that will be appreciated especially by lovers of small trains.
The cane had returned from the plantations extended in the sugar factories on a narrow track by small steam and motor trains.
Their rolling stock has not been renewed for decades, and this is how small locomotives can be seen in operation, whose contemporary ones are not only in museums elsewhere.
Where to direct his steps?
The majority of visitors do not miss the most well-known places.
So there is no need to write long about Varadero or Havana.
Otherwise remember that in the Hemingway property, already mentioned, there is a museum and that the one who loves this writer should not miss the visit.
The Viňales valley to the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
Exuberant vegetation grows there on limestone soil.
Mogotes, calcareous balloons and rocks go up in candle from the bottom of the valley, and, with fertile soil in their guts, even its rotten rocks are covered with a very dense vegetable carpet.
The valley is the place where Cuban tobacco is probably grown of the best quality.
You will be able to meet the final shape of this product if you visit one of the cigar factories in Havana.
Someone may also find it interesting that this is where Major Zeman's Chilean episode was shot.
Trinidad
Old town founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
It was the slave trade and the sugar market that brought him glory and wealth.
Wealth has been embodied in the beauty and vitrine-city character of this small city.
Koloniální španělská architektura,výrazně ovlivněná pozdějšími francuzskými osadníky, if čtyři staletí teměř nezměnila.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray mountain massif, is a place so far away that still in the 50's of the last century, there was no road that would connect this region with the rest of the country.
This isolation allowed him to stay out of the way.
We didn't build anything, and that's why we didn't demolish anything either, everyone just had a roof over their head.
If you have more time in Trinidad than an afternoon, then it is worth seeing interesting places in the surrounding area, such as Playa Ancón Beach or the Sucreries Valley.
Then, in the evening, it is customary to go to the Casa de la Música, which is animated after sunset and where the music only gets dark in the early morning.
Barracks
Some refer to this village located in the far east of Cuba as the most beautiful of the island.
This view is certainly already influenced by the path that leads to it.
The two roads that lead there from Guantánamo must cross high and rugged mountains and cross a landscape almost without any signs of human activity.
UNESCO has listed Cuba's eastern echelon, thanks to its intact landscape, on the World Heritage List.
We make the best chocolate in the church, there is the cross of Christophe Columbus (in reality, it was born about a hundred years after the journey of Columbus) and from the hill where the old castle-fort and the current hotel El Castillo is held, we see several table mountains, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, cigars, the mountain massif Sierra Maestra, the Bay of Troves and Isla de Pinos, the Tropicana cabaret, the sanctuary of the patron saint of Cuba Caridad del Cobre, the Santeria, the African religions practiced by the descendants of the former slaves, about all this we could fill a number of pages.
Only, as we say, it's better to see it once.
In Afghanistan, the allies are passive, states the Americans
The lack of troops and necessary equipment, according to the United States, has an impact on the conduct of the mission in Afghanistan.
According to Defence Minister Robert Gates, NATO should outline a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not as it should be, representatives of countries with troops in the southern part of the country agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland.
In addition to the growing protest by the Taliban movement, the eight States involved are also discussing future plans and the coordination of allies.
While the United States, through Defence Minister Robert Gates, has called NATO troops into greater activity this week, Britain sees the strengthening of Afghan government authority and the intensification of development aid as a priority.
"The evolution in Afghanistan is perceptible, but military power can only be part of the solution.
The other being to allow the inhabitants themselves to start a new development of the economy and security," British Defense Minister Des Browne told the BBC channel.
Ninety per cent
The activity of Afghan insurgents is, according to U.S. Army data, the most intense in the past five years.
The number of violent actions has increased by 27 per cent over the past year, to 60 per cent in Helmand Province, south of the country.
NATO countries have about 40 thousand troops in Afghanistan, nearly a quarter of which in the southern part.
However, according to the United States, the allies have reached their absolute limit in the organization and equipment of the troops.
Specifically, they are requesting additional helicopters, soldiers and experts for the training of Afghan troops.
"We will have to think seriously about the concrete objectives for the coming period, as well as how to achieve them," said Gates.
NATO Secretary General Jaap of Hoop today made similar remarks.
"I'm not happy with what we have on earth and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we would need, and that's not enough," De Hoop told Reuters at the end of the three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Which is passive
In recent months there have also been conflicts between the countries involved on the issue if all the allies are doing their utmost in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany has been criticized for its passivity.
"The Germans have a relatively large representation in Afghanistan.
But they are engaged in areas where violence is minimal, so the combat demands of which they are subject are not as strict as those in the South and East parts of the country where we operate," said Gates.
The British Sun tabloid called German soldiers lazy this week.
"Afghanistans discovered: Germans play, while ours fight," Sun wrote in a document supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German newspaper Bild went to counterattack by publishing a photo of a British troupe during a rugby game in southern Afghanistan.
State debt will rise to one billion in 2009
The burden of a government debt in excess of CKr 84,000 is borne by each Czech.
At the end of September, total debt rose to CKr 842.7 billion.
The government had planned to borrow R$159.2 billion this year.
As a result of a better-than-expected government budget savings, the Department has reduced the planned amount to SEK 152.8 billion.
The debt of the State of the Czech Republic increased towards the end of September to CKr 842.7 billion.
During the nine months of this year it has therefore increased by 40.2 billion crowns.
As of June, however, it has fallen by 13.4 billion kroner.
Today, the Ministry of Finance has confirmed its data on the debt of the State dating back to early October.
Each Czech has a debt of more than CKr 84,000.
Over the past year, the state has owed more than 111 billion kroner.
"For the moment, it seems that, thanks to a smaller deficit planned for next year, one could cross the border of a billion crowns only in 2009.
Next year, the debt is expected to be between 900 billion and a billion kroner," said Patria Finance analyst David Marek for the iHNed.cz server.
The forecast for Next Finance analyst Vladimír Pikor is similar: "We could exceed the billion in 2009.
The precise date will depend on the next budget that is not yet known.
If it appeared that the situation on the political scene was changing, that policies were ready to save more, the date could be postponed to 2010.
But I don't expect this change," he said.
Debts grow
The debt of the State is constituted by the debts of the central government and is generated mainly by the accumulation of deficits in the state budget.
The government debt is financed by treasury bonds, rent bonds, direct borrowings or, for example, by borrowings from the European Investment Bank.
The domestic debt of the state has increased this year from 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion kroner.
The foreign debt of the State has increased this year from SEK 1.7 billion to SEK 123.3 billion.
The debt of the so-called negotiable state reached at the end of September 803.3 billion kroner and from June it decreased by 13.7 billion kroner.
The average debt liability of the State was 6.5 years.
"Total debt increased annually from the first to the third half of the year by 13 per cent, which, given the current good health of the economy, is far too high.
It is interesting that the increase is generated mainly by the rent securities where it reaches 20 percent.
It's bad that the debt is growing, but on the other hand it indicates that there will be something to negotiate when the pension reform comes," commented the Pikora data.
Better than we expected.
As a result of the government's 2007 debt financing and management strategy, the government planned to borrow $159.2 billion this year.
At the beginning of September, thanks to a better-than-expected change in the state budget, the Ministry reduced the planned amount to SEK 152.8 billion.
The sum consists mainly of the deficit of the state budget, which is clearly going to reach 76 billion kroner this year, instead of the 91.3 billion kroner originally planned.
Secondly, these are the maximum sources foreseen for the Czech Consolidation Agency, i.e. 13.3 billion kroons, the reserve of 10 billion for the payment of pensions, the financing of state rent securities for 43 billion kroons and the repayments of loans from the European Investment Bank amounting to 1.8 billion kroons.
She was appearing before a court in Khartoum today for naming a teddy bear
The British teacher tried in Sudan for insulting Islam was sentenced on Thursday evening by a court in Khartoum to 15 days in prison and to deportation, her lawyer said.
The British were accused of letting students between the ages of 6 and 7 give the name of Muhammad to a teddy bear while any representation of the prophet of Islam is illegal.
She was punishable by whipping.
This 54-year-old British teacher in the unit high school in Khartoum, Sudan, was arrested on Sunday at her home and charged with assaulting Islam and sedition, under article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, following several complaints from parents of students to the Ministry of Education of the Sudan.
The story actually dates back to September, when this teacher asks her students, 6/7 years old, to choose a name for the teddy bear of the class.
"Eight names come out of the children's mouths, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed," says school director Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a vote in the class, 20 out of 23 children chose Mohamed as their preferred first name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
The children then made a book for the class with the bear photo followed by the legend "My name is Mohamed".
The bear itself did not bear any label with this name, but the problem is simply that of the representation of the prophet considered an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons' Muslim colleagues, a teacher at the same school in Sudan, said that he knew her well and that she would never have done anything that could be insulting to a religious faith, "I just regret that she asked the children to vote for a name," he said, "it is only an "innocent mistake".
Opinion shared by many of the teacher's students who describe her as "very attentive to her students" and "who never speak of religion in class".
Let's remember that the first name Mohamed is also the second most given name in Britain, it is written in English in 14 different ways.
This name is often chosen by Muslim families as a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this name?
Can one give it to a toy, for example?
Of course, this is a question of interpretation.
They did not reach an agreement on the future status of the province on Wednesday at the last negotiating session in Vienna.
In the end, failure.
Kosovo Serbs and Albanians completed a sixth and final discussion session on Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, without having been able to overcome their differences on the future status of the separatist province.
"It is regrettable that the parties were not able to reach an agreement on the status," said European Ombudsman Wolfgang Ischinger at a press conference in Vienna.
Stressing that peace in the region was "at stake", his American counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to respect their commitments to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
"We do not foresee violence in the immediate but we are entering a very difficult period," he added, noting that "obvious tensions exist".
End of mediation on 10 December
The Troika mediators, which brings together the European Union, the United States and Russia, will visit Serbia and Kosovo once more on Monday.
The future of the province with 90% Albanian-speaking populations could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and the Russian Ombudsman Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko submit their report to the UN Security Council by 10 December.
The discussions in Baden, near Vienna, were the sixth and final negotiating session since the Troika was entrusted with a new mediation by the United Nations last August.
Americans and Europeans consider that their mediation will end on December 10.
The Russians, who have already blocked the Security Council from granting independence to Kosovo, insist on continuing negotiations beyond that deadline.
"Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," said Botsane-Khartchenko.
Declaration of unilateral independence?
After eight years of UN administration in Kosovo, Westerners believe that independence under EU supervision is the only viable solution.
Pristina stands ready to proclaim it unilaterally if the Security Council does not decide in its favour.
Belgrade insists on greater autonomy.
"Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached," said the President of the Kosovo Autonomous Authority, Fatmir Sejdiu, in the Baden hotel where these "last chance negotiations" were taking place since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future Prime Minister of the province, expressed regret.
But he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade "belonged to a past that led to murders and deportations".
‘Domino effect'
Serbian President Boris Tadic, for his part, considered that a compromise was still possible, warning the Albanian majority in Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of the independence of the province.
Belgrade says in particular to fear a "domino effect" in a region still weakened by the wars of independence of the 1990s.
"For Serbia," he said, "it does not mean that a compromise is impossible."
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that any decision should be taken exclusively by the Security Council, where its Russian ally had a veto right.
"The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word"
"Only a solution in the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia," Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
"These negotiations lasted two years.
They must end as they have begun: in the Security Council."
To the journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu had replied that "the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on the status", adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanians would be "in consultation" with the Westerners.
Bush tears up an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
President George Bush announced, at the opening of the international peace conference held by him on Tuesday in Annapolis, Maryland, that the Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He stated that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to immediately enter into negotiations with a view to finding a definitive solution to the 60-year-old dispute between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them conclude a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, Palestinians must dismantle "terrorist infrastructure" and Israel must stop its colonization activities, Bush said, reminding both sides of their obligations to the "road map" for peace they accepted in 2003.
The Head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would aim "to conclude a peace treaty resolving all outstanding issues, without exception, including central issues".
This name covers the three thorny problems at the heart of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees driven out of their homes in what is now the State of Israel during the 1948 conflict.
Speaking after the American president, Abbas insisted that the forthcoming negotiations be "global and thorough" and cover all aspects of a settlement, citing "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among others".
In turn, Olmert pledged to make the forthcoming talks "direct and continuous" and to make "an effort to close them in the course of 2008".
At the end of 2008, Bush set the deadline for implementing its "vision of two Palestinian and Israeli states" that coexist.
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had obtained a commitment to this direction from Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is at the origin of a plan, endorsed by all Arab countries, which offers Israel peace in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks "a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it tackles the roots of the conflict and its central aspects", says Prince Saud in his interview with Saudi-owned Arabic-speaking daily.
For the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As every time in this type of fact various, official versions and rumors oppose.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the investigation of the Inspectorate General of the National Police (IGPN), a police car was circulating on Sunday, shortly after 5 p.m., Louise-Michel Street, Villiers-le-Bel.
"She wasn't in surgery but on patrol, and she was moving at 40-50 km/h, without a gyro," says a police source.
A green motorcycle of the Kawazaki brand, "unapproved, therefore not allowed to travel on the public road" (read below) and driven by two young people without helmets, was circulating "very fast".
"She hit the police car on her left, after a priority refusal to the right," says a police officer.
The blood alcohol control of the occupants of the vehicle was found to be negative.
The state of the car (before high, windshield starry, bumper ripped off) shows the violence of the shock.
Very soon, yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère de Givry, announced that she had entrusted an investigation for "involuntary homicide and non-assistance to persons in danger" to the IGPN, cososis with the departmental Directorate of Public Safety of Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, at a press conference, the prosecutor said that the IGPN investigation, at this stage, excluded the responsibility of the police.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident, heard on Sunday evening, confirmed "the version of the police officers, that this mini-motor arrived relatively quickly on their left."
Yesterday, a kind of groove, probably caused by the friction of the footrests on the ground, showed that the two vehicles remained jammed as long as the police car was able to brake.
The vehicles have been seized and will be subject to technical expertise.
The bodies of the two victims were autopsyed yesterday.
What happened right after that?
Yesterday, a rumor quickly circulated in Villiers-le-Bel, according to which police officers would have left the premises very quickly, thus not helping the two young people.
The IGPN, while remaining cautious, would also rule out "any serious misconduct" on this point.
"This is a more difficult aspect of the investigation, which requires more investigation, on which one must be very careful," said one police source.
Liberation met with an eyewitness of these few moments that followed the accident.
One of his windows giving precisely on the stage.
"We went down immediately, with my cousin who is a nurse in the hospital, to try to revive them," says this witness.
There was nothing to do."
He then saw "a completely hagard policeman, who was drinking.
Two others were trying to revive one of the young people, the fourth one was talking on the phone."
Faced with the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and apparently with the certainty that people were present about the unexpected situation of young people, the police were taken by car by colleagues who arrived on the scene.
According to this witness, aid arrived "about twenty minutes after the police left".
They also had heart massages, in vain.
"I will not let you say that the police did not provide assistance to young people.
These young people have been rescued.
The firemen arrived right away.
Everything was done to try to save them," the prosecutor said.
Voltage is rising in Pakistan
On Monday, the Pakistani police repressed the first demonstrations since General Musharraf established a state of emergency two days earlier.
In the city of Lahore, east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers protesting against the measures taken in the context of the state of emergency were injured by tear gas grenades used by law enforcement officials, according to witnesses.
The latter responded by throwing stones, wounding police officers.
At least 350 lawyers were arrested.
Similar scenarios in Karachi and Rawalpindi, or police officers have commissioned and injured lawyers.
Several were reportedly arrested.
In Islamabad, lawyers of the Supreme Court Bar called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, following a wave of some 500 arrests during the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
The streets giving access to the Supreme Court were blocked Monday morning to prevent assembly.
Other demonstrations reportedly took place in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (north-west).
The lawyers' movement gathered on Monday the support of the religious parties grouped in the powerful alliance Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal whose president '' urged the population to send flowers to the judges who have spoken against the state of emergency and debris to those who have sworn before Musharraf''.
''Musharraf's promise no longer holds''
The Pakistani Supreme Court is directly covered by the emergency measure proclaimed on Saturday evening.
It was to rule in the coming days on the legality of the presidential re-election, on 6 October, by indirect suffrage, of President Musharraf.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was removed and replaced.
"All that we are witnessing is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the rulings of the Supreme Court," the magistrate told The News.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to leave the head of the army and become a ''no longer holds'' civilian president after the state of emergency was established, Deputy Minister of Information Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
He was expected to abandon his military uniform by November 15, the date of the end of his first presidential term.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
In addition, the Pakistani government has denied persistent rumours in the country that President Musharraf has been placed under house arrest by his deputy chief of armies.
More than a third of pregnancies remain unplanned
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) and unplanned or unexpected births.
Even today, more than one in three (36%) pregnancies are not expected, reveals a study conducted by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined), forty years after the Neuwirth law was passed, which liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) and unplanned or unexpected births.
The various methods of contraception such as the pill or the sterile still show a failure rate of 5% to 6%, estimates the Ined.
However, the liberalisation of contraception has allowed for better "fertility control", according to the Institute, which notes that the rate of use of the pill among women between 20 and 44 years of age has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Finally, eight out of ten births would be well planned today.
True calculated in the next month for one in five couples and, if possible, in the spring, season considered as the most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
It will have taken more than seven hours of space work for astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crewmates from the International Space Station (ISS) to perform the spectacular repair of a torn solar panel, indispensable for the continuation of the scientific activities of the station.
A risky release that has accumulated records due to its duration, its remoteness from habitable modules, the speed with which it was imagined, tools "bricked" by astronauts to perform the repair.
The problem arose on Tuesday when the astronauts had unloaded the Harmony module from the Discovery shuttle, a large cylindrical piece tasked with soon hosting the European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see box).
This module is a sort of docking dock for laboratory modules.
But we have to be able to supply them with electricity.
The crew's second task was therefore to move a solar panel generation module weighing 17.5 tons, already present on the ISS, in order to place it in its final position.
After moving it, the crew began the redeployment of the solar panels of the module that have a span of 76 meters.
And that's where one of the panels, which unfold like accordions, was damaged by a wire that stuck.
Deployment was stopped so as not to further damage the panel.
The astronauts, who originally had to carry out a control exit of the Discovery shuttle, then went to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was defective, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazynski who was chosen to go caracolar at the end of the 30 meters of length of the remote controlled arm of the shuttle added to the station to perform the repair.
It is one of the best "spacewalker" (spacewalker) in Nasa.
Large, resistant, very apt, it has a very developed torso and long arms.
At the age of 46, this training doctor was therefore tasked with "operating" the "injured" solar panel.
After precisely inspecting the damage, he severed the faulty cable and installed some kind of "steels" on the damaged area.
He was assisted by a second "spacewalker" who remained near the sas and, from the inside, by other astronauts including Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, a mini-hockey cane wrapped in insulation to prevent electrocution on solar panels producing several hundred volts, was designed and "bricolated" by astronauts aboard the station.
After the operation was completed, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before taking stock of his tools and returning to the inside of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts took advantage of half a day of relaxation before today, seven astronauts returned to the Discovery shuttle for a return to Earth scheduled for Wednesday.
The EADS title sanctioned on the stock exchange
The EADS action is currently in sharp decline on the Paris stock exchange, after the aeronautics and defence group has announced that it will have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to deal with the delays of the A400M.
EADS currently loses 4% to 21.96 euros on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was forced to review its operational performance forecast for 2007 due to delays caused by the slow development of the A400M engine, which conditions the aircraft's inaugural flight.
The cost to compensate for the delay in the delivery of its military transport aircraft, announced in October, amounts to 'between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros of which more than 1 billion for Airbus', announced the mother house of the European manufacturer EADS.
As a result of these charges, EADS will be forced to announce new operating result targets (EBIT) for 2007 when presenting its quarterly results next Thursday, he adds without further detail.
The group also indicated that the estimate of the new charges was consistent with the six-month delay.
As a reminder, EADS' operational performance fell by 86% in 2006, mainly due to delays in another program, that of the very large carrier A380.
Initially, the group planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The choice of the status quo
There will be no suspense on Sunday at the polls: the Russians will opt massively for the party of President Putin, Russia united.
Confirming their aspiration to stability, even authoritarianism, after a very locked campaign.
Three days after the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin today sends a television message to voters on public channels, already recorded but whose content is kept secret.
He does so as the leader of the united Russia list, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory is expected to be overwhelming.
Yesterday, the president did not allow anything to transpire by receiving foreign ambassadors, merely delivering a new charge against the West accused of interference - its theme of choice during the campaign.
"We know the price of a true democracy and we want honest, transparent and open elections, elections that are unattainable," he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, we are far from counting.
She denounces a campaign fraught with pressure.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says that "there have never been such dirty elections, even in the time of Yeltsin."
After the repression of last weekend's demonstrations, the former chess world champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstration, remains banned from visiting according to his lawyer.
"The Russians kept the mentality of the homo sovieticus"
Behind these unsuspended legislation are two much more open questions:
- Who will succeed Putin in the presidency?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election, on 2 March 2008; the candidates have until 23 December to make themselves known.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot run for a third consecutive term.
But no successor emerges.
- What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Head of the parliamentary majority and of the all-powerful united Russia party that would choose the government and the president?
In any case, both legislative and presidential, the outgoing power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians have maintained the mentality of the homo Sovieticus, they do not feel mastery of their destiny," says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent Levada centre.
Historian Nikolai Kopossov, of the State University of St. Petersburg, goes back a long way: civil society has fallen behind in this Christianized country five centuries after Europe; the famous Community spirit has delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Putine has reborn with the model of a paternalistic state, perfectly accepted by the population all the more so since this new paternalism has not been followed by terror, but by a certain economic ease," says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians "willfully renounce personal responsibility" which they had briefly demonstrated after the break-up of the USSR.
"What's the use of thinking?"
The phenomenon affects all social strata, including the business world.
And the administrative elite intends to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (out of 85 heads of Russian regions) lead the local lists of united Russia.
The new freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
Opinion prefers stability.
For which the Russians will not vote for the extremists either.
Conclusion by 54-year-old Professor Tamara Cherednitchenko: "What is the use of thinking?
Those in power are not too bad, why change them?"
A Heavy Memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which trace the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are in free access.
The 47 million archival documents, stored on 27 km of linear in Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were available to date only for a "humanitarian" purpose, i.e. individually and nominally, at the request of a former victim or his successors.
The eleven states in charge of their management - including Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to researchers and historians.
As the process of ratification of this agreement by all States has been completed, the opening has been effective since yesterday.
Sensitive information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow research to be carried out "in particular on the displacement of prisoners, the population of camps and the state of health of forced workers", explains Reto Meistern, the director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several States, including Germany, were opposed to the opening to the public of these nominative documents, due to the sensitivity of certain information.
Like the alleged homosexuality or mental disability of some victims of deportation.
The registers of concentration camps or arrest warrants established by the Gestapo had been compiled after war for a practical purpose: to find civilians deported or subject to compulsory labour and, possibly, to provide proof of their internment, in order to pave the way for their compensation.
Even today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees handle tens of thousands of individual applications.
Yet, for part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
"There is nothing fundamentally new to expect from these documents," said Professor Wolfgang Benz, Director of the Anti-Semitism Research Centre at Technische Universität in Berlin in 2006.
The EU and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
At present, bilateral Indo-European trade is already close to €60 billion per year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, said European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath.
EU Foreign Ministers gave the European Commission their green light last April to start negotiations to sign free trade agreements (FTAs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Indo-European bilateral trade is already close to €60 billion a year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the EU's 9th largest trading partner, according to figures from the European Commission.
"A free trade pact works enormously between the two economies" and "India would improve its access to a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans," explained Peter Mandelson.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the top ten products exported by India, said the European Commissioner. Asian and European giants trade annually for "47 billion euros in goods" and for "ten billion euros in services", said Danièle Smadja, head of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi, regretting that bilateral trade has "not yet reached its potential". The EU and India meet Friday for their eighth diplomatic summit in New Delhi in the presence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and European Commission President José Manuel Durao Barroso.

Bank of England acknowledges concerns by offering £10 billion over five weeks
The Bank of England said Thursday in order to ease the current return of concerns about credit conditions, and announced an offer of 10 billion pounds at the base rate of 5.75% over five weeks, an offer of an unusual duration.
"In order to alleviate concerns that the financial market conditions will be particularly tight at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in how they will organize their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant proportion of its expected reserve contribution during the maintenance period beginning on 6 December in the form of a five-week open market operation," she says in a statement.
The bank states that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be placed on the market on 6 December at 12:15 GMT, at the basic rate and until 10 January.
This is the first time it seems that BoE has placed liquidity on the market for five weeks in an open market operation.
These are normally done within a week.
BoE adds in its press release that it "will stand ready to take further steps to maintain the rates" of day-to-day interbank loans in line with its base rate.
The day-to-day interbank rate was 5.829% Wednesday.
The three-month rate was 6.6%, a higher rate since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the financial crisis in the summer, the Bank of England's funds were placed on the market with a significant penalty rate that had discouraged banks from using them.
According to some rumours, corroborated by the evolution of the book price relative to the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the sums placed on the market by the European Central Bank, at more advantageous rates and with greater discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to consider PS proposals on purchasing power
The UMP and New Centre groups refused on Thursday to discuss the articles of the Socialist bill on purchasing power, which amounts to a rejection of the text.
Incorporated in a socialist "niche" (meeting at the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text declined about ten measures adopted on Tuesday by the national PS office, including the 50% increase in the employment premium, the restoration of the floating TIPP, a transport cheque or the rental management.
UMP and NC having voted against the examination of the articles (180 votes against 115), the session was adjourned following the general discussion which gave rise to exchanges, sometimes lively, between the majority and opposition to a few hours of Nicolas Sarkozy's television intervention on purchasing power.
The leader of MPs PS Jean-Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent all of his proposals in the form of amendments to the draft amending financial law considered by the Assembly next week.
A new festival is born
Following numerous rumours about the creation by C3 Presents of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in partnership with the Republic Festival of British producer Melvin Benn.
"For our company, it is an honour to work with someone who has inspired the current festival movement in America," Charlie Jones of C3 told Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Chicago Lollapalooza Festival and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping.
The festival is expected to be held from August 8 to 10 on a 500-acre private farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Formerly known as Mean Fiddler, the director of the Festival Republic, Melvin Benn, is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took the helm of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts some 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio and, in 2006, the Republic Festival created the Henham Park Latitude Festival in Suffolk.
Since 2002, as a co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Qualifying Glastonbury as the "most inspiring event" he has ever attended, Charlie Jones de C3 says that his company and Melvin Benn's are working in parallel to give the region a European-style festival-event.
"We had chosen Philadelphia as a market and worked diligently with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia," says Charlie Jones.
"We were in talks with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we got stuck in politics because of the current administration, continues Charlie Jones.
"Happily, we were able to chat with Melvin Benn and we are about to create a great festival on an exceptional site that will ultimately serve the people of Philadelphia."
C3 Presents revived the Lollapalooza Festival in 2005 at the Grant Park in Chicago, after standing out in the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded gross revenues of $9.8M and $11.3M in 2007.
Both festivals are held in urban areas.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a country festival, while ours take place in urban green spaces," says Charlie Jones.
The aim is to merge, in one way or another, the two formulas to give both an impression of a country festival to the European and urban to the American."
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The Vineland community, including the mayor, enthusiastically supports the event," says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the terms of the agreement, but says "they are interesting enough to allow investment in such an event and to host a festival that, hopefully, will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says that the reception capacity of this festival is "very large", like that of 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He said that invitations had been issued to the groups, but that nothing could yet be confirmed at the time of the press.
"Vineland will be rock-flavored, but music will be varied, in the hope of attracting all kinds of spectators," says Charlie Jones.
His C3 partners, who received the Top Independent Promoter Award from the latest Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal Confronts Terminator
It's not easy to attract Hollywood film sets to Montreal when no one else than Terminator opposes it...
This seduction mission is part of the function of delegate.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because the Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces the "runaway productions".
Is it difficult to play in the hands of the Governor?
"Be careful, it is the industry that decides where it is going.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are favourable, she will go there.
Our role is to offer the ones they will judge the best," he says.
The Festival Race
For now, however, Denis Turcotte's priority is to promote cinema here.
The Oscar race has begun.
It will be of all festivals on the West Side, whether Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, a question of presenting the Quebec films, highlighting them and ensuring that the directors do interviews.
The Dark Ages had a beautiful showcase at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is on display in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four feature films and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be an end-of-year rally on the stock market? Experts divided by the sub-prime crisis.
Less than five weeks after the end of the year, investors are already rubbing their hands hoping for the arrival of the traditional end-of-year rally.
However, this year's experts are not as sure as this is going to happen.
Banif believes that "statistically, December on the stock market generally has a positive attitude.
However, forecasts should not be made solely on the basis of statistics, since, given the current context, uncertainties are on the market, at least in the short term. "
Although they are not in favour of the stock exchange gaining momentum during the last weeks of the year, these experts point out that "the stock market is fed by the existence of liquidity, willing to invest due to the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially fixed income, affected by the leak effect towards quality values both in the long periods and in the short ones".
For this, they believe that the stock exchange will behave rather side-by-side, not free of volatility "especially because the impact of the likely decline in Fed rates is unknown, given the high level of gross and the danger of stimulating inflationary tensions"
Javier Barrio, responsible for sales of BPI in Spain, agrees that this is not the right time to say that there will be a rally.
"It's not the best thing," says the expert.
Ibex, the Spanish stock market index, has lost almost 4% since November 8 when the index closed to 15,945.7 points.
However, not all experts have such a negative view.
Juan Solana, Intermoney analyst, believes that Ibex 35 could close the year to 16,000 points thanks to the reorganization of portfolios and the traditional contributions to pension plans that occur every year during these dates.
However, the expert notes that things will be a little different this year since he believes that the rally will take place from the second week of December, after the bridge of the feast of the Constitution (December 6).
The analyst does not consider that volatility will affect the market trend.
For its part, Federico Olucha, analyst of Inversis Banco, estimates that we are close to the technical levels and "that is why we could observe a rebound of the index that could be provoked according to the information that comes from the European Union regarding the consequences of the crisis on the credit market".
The analyst hopes that these will be positive.
Analysts agree to choose the values that will be responsible for leading Ibex to new maximum odds.
Solana, of Intermoney, says that "this year the great values are back for him".
The expert would include in the portfolio the two large banks and some manufacturers "because when the date approaches, the electricity sector will be very expensive".
While, Federico Olucha, of Inversis Banco assures that the increases will be due to the bank and the industrial sector.
The builders will also be able to benefit from this rally, in case they start there.
"ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we hope that other construction companies such as Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path," explains the expert.
Cyclical consumption will play a leading role in the last part of the year due to the increase in sales in the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technology companies will do just as well, although in this case there is not much representation on the Spanish market.
Five times for seven years
For the past seven years, only for two occasions the month of December was a low month.
The genuine year-end rally took place in 2003, during which stock markets emerged from the crisis caused by the breakthrough of the technology bubble.
This year, when Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, December recorded an increase of 6.68%.
It will be necessary to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of winnings (for the time being the Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and if it succeeds in computer on its end-of-year rally.
The Banque Populaire will open 200 offices open from 12 noon Monday to Saturday
The People's Bank has decided to renovate a large part of its offices.
A total of 200 banks are located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the Populaire Max brand, represent a big change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish organizations, since it is the first group that has decided to start betting on the uninterrupted opening of its agencies until 8.30 pm, and to open on Saturday from 10am to 8.30 pm.
Another group that also repeated several times that it would like to amplify the schedules of its branches, BBVA, even though it has not yet decided to take the first step.
It is about to conclude an agreement with the unions to close 75% of its agencies on Saturday instead of opening an afternoon, but not to the public.
The results of the People's Bank's experience will be decisive for other organizations to join or not this initiative that coincides with business schedules.
It is precisely this objective that the People's Bank seeks.
Attract autonomous customers who travel in these areas to make their purchases in SMEs and street shops chosen to open.
The bank wants to open these 200 agencies throughout Spain in about 18 months, since this is not about opening new agencies but about renovating existing ones.
For this purpose, the organization will modernize the branches it already has in the commercial areas, adapting them to the profile of the customers of the different streets.
In this way, the amplification of the hours is accompanied by a different design from the inside of the branch and a new, more up-to-date design with brighter colors.
The commercial bank manager, Ángel Rivera, ensures that this renovation does not involve major investments, but the hiring of staff, as the number of employees will increase from six to eight or nine per agency.
The agencies, which will also have spaces for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
The Banque Populaire has already tested its initiative in three agencies in Madrid.
And the experience was positive, as Angel Rivero explains.
The branches of the streets Murillo Brave, O'Donnell and Gran Vía de Madrid are the streets that have been chosen, and with success, according to Rivero.
The People's Bank currently has 2,500 branches.
And 60 others that operate under the brand of Mundocredit, specialized in the case of immigrants, also with very wide schedules, which even open on Sundays and holidays.
In these PopularMax agencies they will not copy the BBVA model, where several of its agencies have a wide range of non-financial products for sale.
'We do not want to compete with our customers', Rivero notes.
For the time being, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobile phones, with staff outside the bank.
Telecinco doubles the stock exchange value of its rival Antena 3 for the first time
We made it.
With this sentence Paolo Vasile, a delegate of Telecinco, expressed yesterday his satisfaction at the closing of the stock market, when he found that the chain he runs doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
One aspect tarnished his joy: 'What hurts me is not the fact that we have increased more but that we have decreased less', he said.
However, he stressed that in a small market, 'we have fallen less'.
Telecinco finished the day yesterday with a 2.54% increase.
This gain stabilizes its loss to 15.66 per cent over the past year.
The stock exchange value of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and announced by Vocento ( 13% more) thus reaches 4,488.88 million euros, according to Bloomberg data.
Its rival Antena 3, which yielded 1.52% yesterday and which has accumulated a decrease of 40.5% since January, costs half, 2,193.46 million.
In the case of Sogecable, the value of the other listed communication companies is 3,571 million; in the case of Prisa (the publisher of Cinco Días) 2,518,53 million; and in the case of Vocento 1,779 million.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antenna 3 is because we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact represents what we are able to do, in the same market, at what price and how we make it in terms of hearing. '
Telecinco announced last week that it plans to become this year's first television channel to exceed the 1,000 million gross advertising revenues, as Giuseppe Tringali, the delegate adviser of Telecinco and Publiespana, the subsidiary that manages the advertising of the group, said.
In order for this announced data to be real, the television channel is expected to record an increase of 3.6% in its billing for advertising for the current fiscal year compared to 965.4 million in 2006.
For its part, Antenne 3's net billing increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the fiscal year (to $734.4 million), while television's net revenues increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts point to for the best relative evolution of Telecinco on the Stock Exchange is the important pay out that it has maintained so far: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100% of the profit among its shareholders.
Vasile assures that, although it is early to make a decision, this ratio may vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol and in association with Mediaset.
' We have the official compromise to give at least 50 per cent, although we have always said much more.
This year I hope that we will be able to make our shareholders happy, to those to whom we have already given securities with the 33% of Endemol '.
According to analysts, the market is currently showing signs of fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its profit estimates on Telecinco in 2008 to 4% and in 2009 to 7%.
This is due, they explain, to the decrease in expected income growth from 10.5 per cent to 8.4 per cent in 2008 and from 5.5 per cent to 5.1 per cent in 2009.
The same company reduced the forecast of Antenne's earnings to 3.5% in 2008 and 7.5% in 2009.

Congress approves the transposition of the Mifid, which entered into force on 1 November
In parallel with its parliamentary formality, which ended today with the Congress' vote on amendments to the bill in the Senate, the Government submitted to a public hearing the rules that will develop the new law, with the aim of its entry into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the various groups agreed to highlight the efforts made by Members of Parliament and Senators to negotiate and agree on the best regulation to ensure investor protection and to regulate in detail the activities of the organizations so that the markets function effectively.
Mifid, which amends the Securities Market Act, involves modernising financial markets, as it strengthens investor protection, improves the powers of the leaders of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promotes cooperation between the different leaders of the European Union.
The new regulations will provide financial consulting services for both specialized social reasons and for natural or legal persons and create a new type of financial services (ESIS), financial consulting companies (FIA), which merge securities companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies.
In addition, it increases the number of systems for the execution of transactions on financial instruments, so that it is possible to add to regulated secondary markets multilateral trading and internationalization systems, which compete with current stock exchange managers.
The Act also requires investment services companies to disclose information on key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and forms of risk management on the market and requires them to keep a record of all the transactions they carry out, in order to facilitate control by the CNMV.
By way of the Congressional Economics Commission, several amendments have been added, one of which highlights that securitised debts will be considered a "complex" financial instrument given its high risk to the investor, which has demonstrated itself with what happened with the debt of high-risk US mortgages (subprime).
In addition, they took advantage of the transposition of the management took advantage to legally delimit the functions that graduates in the Economy can be 30 years after it was approved in 1977, the Royal Decree which delimits the professional functions reserved for economists.
For its part, the Senate has incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as that of the mediator, who will work on behalf of a company, who will not require the authorization of the CNMV and who will be able to provide its services of marketing products and attracting new customers to different investment firms at the same time.
The harmonised consumer price index increased by five tenths in November, up to 4.1%
This indicator, which is then used by Eurostat to incorporate it into the calculation of the inflation rate in the European Union, provides a balance sheet on price developments in Spain during the month of November.
Its publication responds to the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) by offering data comparable in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The advanced indicator is calculated using the same process as that used for the Harmonized Consumer Price Index, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate the information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the advanced indicator is only indicative, because it should not necessarily coincide with the final data to be revealed on December 14.
"The CPI will continue on relatively high levels"
The second Vice-President and Economy Minister, Pedro Solbes, said that the 4.1% increase in CPI in November is a "temporary figure", but at the same time he predicted that the price index will continue on "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case Solbes has specified in the corridors of the Congress that "although the figure is not good" the inflation differential of Spain regarding monetary union continues to be "more or less" the same as in recent years.
He also explained that in November "there was less surprise" than in the previous month, when the Government was not facing such a high increase.
"We were hoping for a figure of around 4%," the Minister of Economy acknowledged in relation to the data announced today.
Virgin plans to recover with Northern Rock €42 billion over three years
Northern Rock deposits have fallen to more than 50% to £12,000 million (EUR 16,800 million) since it came into crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency loan with the Bank of England.
At that time he collected some record deposits over £25 billion, a figure that was gradually dropped in two and a half months due to the mistrust of his clients and despite the 100% guarantee of this money that the Government has offered and that it will maintain until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, who would rename the organization with its financial trademark Virgin Money, needs to seize around a quarter of the revenues of the British banks that will be deposited in the next three years to obtain the remaining 18,000 million pounds until reaching the goal of 30,000 million.
The Richard Branson magnate group, known for its advertising campaigns in the UK, intends to spend £50 million (about €70 million) per year on advertising and marketing to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock named this week the offer of the Virgin Association, in which three other companies participate, including his favorite to save him from bankruptcy.
Totana mayor arrested for alleged urban corruption plot
The Civil Guard arrested today early in the morning the current mayor of the Murcian commune of Totana (the Popular Party) because of his alleged relationship with the urban corruption plot discovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the municipal council and the chief of police of the municipality were also arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced the me of May last Juan Morales, current MP of the right, and until then city councillor of the city hall, and who according to the sources of the investigation consulted by the Chain SER, could be the 'leader' of this plot.
The officers continue to search the municipal premises and those of the Urbanism Council and the possibility of new stops in the next few hours is not ruled out.
In addition, Juan Morales' lawyer, the prime suspect in the urban corruption plot, discovered earlier this week, was charged.
As indicated yesterday by the SER Chain to the lawyer of the 'popular party' deputy Juan Morales, he was arrested when he left Morales's home with important documentation in his possession relating to the plot.
Moreover, according to sources of the investigation, the purpose of the investigation is the alleged collection of Morales commissions in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban agreement with a construction company in Galicia to re-qualify 200 hectares of land.
For the time being, there are eight people in detention.
Bono agrees to be the leader of the candidacy of the Spanish Socialist Party for Toledo and to preside over the Congress if they win the elections
Former Defence Minister José Bono accepted the offer of the President of the Government and the Secretary General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to be the head of the list of the Spanish Socialist Party for Toledo for the next general elections and to be President of the Congress in case the Socialists win the general elections.
Thus the secretary of organization of the Spanish socialist party, José Blanco, and Bono himself announced it during a press conference after the meeting that took place this afternoon at the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The Chief Executive justified the offer made to the former Minister because "it is important to rely on the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best".
Moreover, he stressed that "yes it seems" that the political man of La Manche will be the candidate of the socialist group that will preside over the Congress if the socialists win the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as President of the Congress, who on November 15th made public his decision not to run for the next general election and to abandon his political career to devote himself to the fight against climate change in the academic context.
The former Minister acknowledged that the President of the Government has not stopped insisting that he return to the political vanguard since he abandoned him two years ago.
In addition, he noted that, although the citizens already know who will be the economic vice president if the Spanish Socialist Party wins the elections, his party wanted to announce the one who will preside over the Congress, in an "act of transparency".
If he reaches the post, Bono hopes to turn the House into "a house of respect and not insult or cry" and make it "more and more like citizens".
"Sometimes it seems unfortunate that the only place in Madrid where one cannot speak quietly and calmly is the Congress, the President of the Government in the Senate on some occasions has been interrupted 26 times."
In the same way, he had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Marín and "his know-how" and he did not want to act as if he was already in his position so as not to fall, as he pointed out, into what his opponents might regard as "a domination".
Climate propaganda
Since the movement against climate change places the skeptics of its predictions as well as those that give priority to other political and social battles, it must demonstrate iron coherence.
This is all the more the case for a leader of the movement who is president of the government like Zapatero and who believes that this struggle is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and who even intends to sign a "new contract for the planet".
This approach obliges him to explain why his Government's action, or inaction, has contributed decisively to Spain's leadership of the European Union in the non-implementation of the Kyoto protocols.
Who is responsible for the non-execution, in which sectors it has occurred and why his Government, that of the contract with the planet, has not avoided it.
In addition, it must clearly explain to the Spanish what measures it will take to curb climate change.
What businesses will be affected, what habits of citizens will have to be changed, what individual and collective energy savings will we be forced to do, what economic consequences it will cause.
That is, who will sacrifice himself and who will pay to save the planet.
But there hasn't been, and there won't be any explanations.
Precisely because it's about sacrificing and paying.
The measures against climate change, the actual measures, are unpopular.
Cost-effective, uncomfortable and threatening for business and individual accounts.
Up to one hundredth of the essence suggested by the Spanish Socialist Party seemed to him so dangerous in Zapatero that he hastened to deny it.
That is to say, it is about saving the planet with nothing, only with propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With sentences that have impact, commissions, committees, protocols, new posts.
With these contracts with the planet, this gentleman so useful for electoral campaigns that he does not speak, does not denounce and does not demand, embellishs meetings and inspires tenderness.
Provided that this is limited only to being a purely virtual contracting party and that it does not claim that we move on a bicycle or cool ourselves with the fan.
Mayor and local police chief of Totana arrested for alleged urban corruption
The Spanish gendarmerie arrested the mayor of the town of Totana, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local police, the secretary of the town hall and a suspicious hotel entrepreneur for possible urban crimes, today informed the sources of the investigation.
The city councillor was arrested at his home and taken to the town hall, where at the moment many agents met, who also presented themselves to the Municipal councillor of Urbanism and to the municipal management company of the Industrial Land and Housing.
These three stops are in addition to the six stops made last Monday in the provinces of Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation related to the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural land to urbanize them so that the Galician company Nuaria can build 4,000 dwellings, after the payment of illegal commissions during the last legislature.
In addition, two other persons have not been arrested but are charged in the judicial investigation, which the Totana Tribunal No. 1 investigates.
The first six detainees have now moved to a judicial disposition.
According to the sources, the previous municipal councillor of Totana and currently autonomous parliamentarian of the PP party, Juan Morales, is targeted by the investigation.
In addition, the ex-wife, owner of a real estate agency currently registered in Totana, was charged, as was the current fiancée of the former municipal councillor, who resides in Murcia.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and the entrepreneur of Vigo (Galice) Manuel N.A., were arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as Pablo José M.G., director of Souelo de Inmonuar, agency of the Nuaria Group, and through which bribes would have been made.
The investigation is carried out by the Urban Crimes Group of the Central Operational Unit (UCO) of the gendarmerie, whose officers, in addition to the arrests, carried out eleven inspections, the majority of which were carried out in companies linked to detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
Thus, only one person was arrested in Totana, in short, the owner of a well-known poultry product company in the region, which could have played the role of intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for the development of the largest residential complex in the commune of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 housing units, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company acquired 2.2 million square meters of land in Totana, which has been re-qualified and its project would involve doubling the population of the municipality, which currently has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group consists of companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which deal with real estate promotion; Conycase, which manages the parking spaces of Vigo in the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and the square of Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, which deals with direct marketing; Preconiza, which focuses on the promotion, sale and installation of construction elements.

Our Finnish correspondent gives us yesterday's comment published in Finland's most important newspaper (certain news headlines PISA above the educational level in the world), the Sanomat Helsingin, which refers to what they published on November 18, the same day it appeared there, curiously, the criticism of Blackburn's book:
"The contents of the Philosophy course questioned public opinion as a consequence of the tragedy of Jokela's school.
The culprit of the dead, a baccalaureate student, quoted in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Education Advisor in charge of Philosophy, Pekka Elo, demanded that teachers adopt a critical attitude towards Plato on what is written in the pages of the daily Helsingin Sanomat and said that studying Nietzsche is not indispensable in the compulsory basic course of Philosophy in high schools.

A colleague passes information on the introduction in the Criminal Code of offences on downloads on the Internet:
A. Downloading a song would be a crime punishable by six months to one year.
On the other hand, theft in a CD store for less than EUR 400 is considered only a fault (Article 623.1).
B. The theft in a store for up to EUR 1,000 is already considered an offence, but the penalty is lower than that imposed for the download (article 234 of the Penal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty is less than that imposed for the download (article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in the traffic of compact discs.
To participate in a tumultuous fight involves a penalty of three months to one year (article 154 of the Penal Code) and the trafficking of CDs would involve a penalty of six months to two years
(art. 270 of the Penal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a film, according to section 184.2 of the Penal Code.

My treating doctor told me about one of his articles on strange research entitled: 'Money produces brain activations, especially if others receive less. '
In other words, the feelings generated by the monthly pay of workers depend on what colleagues earn.
The study was carried out using magnetic tomographic resonances at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the last issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the neurocognition imaging group of the Life&Brain Institute, Germany: "The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his partner failed".
The researchers observed that when the two people became the same pay, the activation was moderate, but if one of them received double, the activation was greater.
I don't know if this conclusion requires so much science.
The Prosecutor of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly pursuing Balkan war criminals for eight years since the Public Prosecutor's Office of the Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, which is located in The Hague.
His term ends at the end of the year and Carla leaves with a bitter taste, because the main perpetrators of Srebrenica's murder - in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims have died-, former General Ratko Mladic and former Serbian leader Radovan Karadzic, are still at large.
Their names are on this list whose documentary by the Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach takes its title, 'Carla's list' (2006, not projected exclusively in Spain), with the rhythm of a police thriller, who follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade in New York who pursues the criminals in flight and puts pressure on the governments involved to narrow the circle.
What kind of insurance is it for me?
Car insurance, which covers the driver in the event of an accident, involves a significant expenditure which will depend on various factors, such as age, sex, driving licence seniority, civil status, type of vehicle to be insured or the use made of it, among others.
Having a car is the main thing.
And it is that, choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the vehicle model.
And it is that, choosing the right car insurance, is even more difficult than choosing the model of the vehicle.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insurer.
This compromise takes the form of an insurance contract, which establishes that the company receives the value of the premium granted and in exchange it becomes responsible for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of a loss.
The premium is the price of the insurance, which is established taking into account various factors, such as age, sex, seniority of the driving licence, marital status, type of vehicle to be insured or the use made of it, among others.
Insurance companies set their prices on the basis of statistics, so that the higher the probability of an accident, the higher the rating to be paid.
It is for this reason that people over the age of 25 and women have to pay lower premiums, as statistics show that these people have a lower disaster rate due to their caution.
Similarly, using censuses, the companies concluded that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will affect the frequency, and therefore the probability of an accident.
By increasing the frequency the probabilities increase.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when setting the premium price.
For this reason, the driver must study the situation in order to choose the car insurance that best suits his profile.
We will present here the most significant variables when choosing one or the other type of insurance, so that it, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insurer, offers it a reasonable price.
Young people under the age of 25 face various disadvantages when entering into a contract with insurance at an affordable price, as can be the low experience in driving and driving licence seniority.
Although the ideal to be well insured is insurance at all risk, other more economical options exist.
The most likely drivers can opt for any risk insurance free of charge, so that they get insurance coverage at any risk but at a more affordable price.
This form of agreement implies that the customer pays part of the amount of the claim.
"The part of the amount of the claim that the customer pays will be determined according to the value of the premium, which will be higher the amount will be lower," specifies Luis Noguera, the head in Spain of First Europa, online insurance mediator.
Another option is extended third-party insurance, so that the customer provides protection to deal with damage caused to third parties, but by those caused on his own car.
In addition, it would be covered against theft, fire and vehicle loss.
A piece of advice.
If you are under the age of 25 try to be careful and avoid claims to the extent possible, since this will affect the bonus, which can reduce the price of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction in the company's basic rate.
On the contrary, a penalty is an increase in the basic tariff.
"The bonuses and penalties will depend on the company and its profit.
If the company has had a good year it will be able to afford to increase the bonuses, " explains Noguera.
Over the age of 25 this becomes easier for drivers when they enter into a contract with insurance, since the rate of claims is reduced thanks to the accumulated experience.
For this reason, it is preferable to choose any risk insurance with frankness.
"Normally, young people cannot take advantage of the experience they have previously gained after an accident", says the director of the European company in Spain and adds that the majority of accidents occur during the second year of driving, after passing the 'fear of the novice'.
However, if the client is married but does not yet have children it is preferable for him to negotiate insurance at any risk, as long as his economic situation allows him.
Marriages with children are considered by insurers to be those with the lowest casualty rate, because increases will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be an insurance at all risk with franchise (which could be 300 euros), or an extended third-party insurance from the third year of life of the vehicle when the insured has a high level of bonus.
"They have more casual driving and they have greater purchasing power to afford the luxury to assume a larger amount of franchises," Judge Luis Noguera.
For retirees, insurance at all risk is preferable with franchise (with this being 150 euros), or extended third-party insurance when the insurer has a high level of bonus.
It must be said that motor insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver in the face of possible accidents, but also because it represents a major expense, that is why it is essential to study properly the insurance that suits us most according to our personal situation.
The Celtic will try to win a point in Milan to reach the eighth finals
The Milan AC and the Celtic Glasgow are measured next Tuesday in San Siro looking for the point that they lack to achieve their respective goals in the closing of the Champions League, since it serves the Italians to be first and the Scots to rank.
The Italians total ten points and they have already qualified during the fifth day thanks to a zero match in Portugal, while the Celtic Glasgow has nine points, but it still needs another point to make sure that the Shakhtar Donetsk, who has six, and who receives Benfica who has four, does not pass before him.
These two games of Group D will be played one week before the sixth day ends, since Milan AC has to play the semi-finals of the World Cup of Clubs in Japan on the 13th of this month in search of a place for the final of December 16.
Thus, this group will remain closed before the zero match at the Giuseppe Meazza stadium seems to be the most expected result, although both teams will try to get out victorious, since the Italians will not want to speculate at home and the Celtic Glasgow knows that by winning it would remain first and ensure a better cross in the eighths of the final.
A defeat of Gordon Strachan's team could be enough to rank if the Shakhtar Donetsk doesn't win, but she won't be able to computerize it just because with nine points the game returns to the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but who won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the Milanese will try to poison the evening to the Scots, who hope to finish for the eighth finals for the second time at the Champions League, after having been beaten during the last edition by a goal of Kaka during the extensions (1-0).
Pending the victory of the 'rossoneri' the triumph would return only to the Shakhtar, in case the Celtic loses, to rank for the eighth finals in order to continue the UEFA Champions League.
And it is that the Benfica, although it is last and without possibility to continue the European competition, could reach third place with a victory.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls tour in Vancouver
The Spice Girls began their first tour in Vancouver, Canada, ahead of about 20,000 spectators since the band disbanded in 2000.
' Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), ' Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) said shortly before starting their concert at the GM Place stadium in Vancouver that the group's meeting was "brilling".
Around 20,000 people have exhausted the tickets to attend the concert that was the subject of a video telling the story of the band that was furious at the end of 1990.
The meeting and the world tour coincide with the launch of a new album that resumes their main hits as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo', which EMI publishes in Spain.
The five members of the Spice Girls went on stage showing the bracelets that the husband of 'Posh Spice' had offered them, the British footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was in the audience who filled the GM Place, even though Victoria had forbidden him a few days earlier.
Before the show began, Victoria Beckham pointed out that the British footballer "did not see our costumes so I'm nervous because I don't know what he's going to think about the show".
'Sporty Spice' who was part of the group in 1998 "because of the differences between us" and which caused the group's dissolution two years later, also expressed his nervousness during an interview with the press, two hours before the start of the show.
"I was scared.
I was nervous, but I saw that people's feelings have changed, the feeling for the Spice Girls has changed.
And I thought why not, I'm glad I made a decision," Chisholm said about the group meeting that she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also noticed that over time, "things have settled and we appreciate each other very much."
But a lot has changed since the Spice Girl last showed up in 1998.
To begin with, on CTV, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines aircraft.
When they arrived at the airport, a baby sitter army was waiting for them.
They count to her five seven sons.
After the Vancouver concert, the band will perform in California (USA), San José (4 December) and Los Angeles (5 and 7 December).
In Madrid they will perform on 23 December.
The new gas case between Russia and Ukraine is setting the alarm.
A dispute over the price of fermented gas between Ukraine and Russia, thus increasing the risks of impact on oil exports to Europe.
Most Russian gas exports to the European Union (EU) are transported by pipelines, and each pipeline is scrupulously monitored.
Kiev announced that if Russia increases the cost of fuel, it will increase transit taxes to Russia.
Last year, an altercation between the two caused a decrease in supplies to the countries of the EU.
The last dispute between Kiev and Moscow occurs after the Ukrainian government and Gazprom, Russia's monopoly-owned gas company, have tried in vain to find agreement on the cost of Russian gas supplied to Ukraine for 2008.
Gazprom stated that it would increase its prices to Ukraine as it agreed to pay for 2008, up to 50% more for the supply of gas from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts said that this would involve a 40% increase in the costs of imports from Gazprom for Ukraine.
"It is essential for us to use all our arguments during the conversations, recalling that we are a country through which most of the gas transits," Ukrainian Minister of Economy Anatoly Kinkh announced to the Reuters news agency.
"The fluctuations in gas costs would probably be linked to our discussions on transit taxes (to Western Europe) via Ukraine"
The last major altercation between Moscow and Kiev caused the interruption of Gazprom's supplies to Ukraine in January 2006.
This has led to a fall in exports to Western Europe, thereby increasing prices.
Russian gas accounts for one quarter of the EU's supplies.
Russia has the largest gas stocks, although most of them are still underdeveloped.
Consequently, Gazprom completes its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other nations of the former Soviet Union in Central Asia.
The Ministry of Health 'must control its foreign employees'.
The Scottish Ministry of Health needs to improve controls on its extra-community employees to verify that they have criminal precedents, said the Monitoring Committee.
The Warden General's warning, Robert Black, came after a foreign doctor working in Scotland was involved in the attack at Glasgow Airport in June.
Mr. Black also expressed concern that the Scottish Ministry of Health does not have any specific data on the number of overseas people he employs.
His report nevertheless highlighted other decisive controls, properly carried out on a sample of employees of five health authorities.
The Auditor General carried out checks on the extra community staff following the attack on Glasgow airport.
Bilal Addullah, 28, a doctor of Iraqi origin at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after having gone down with his jeep, in the doors of the main terminal.
He was one of the three doctors who were filmed at the Old Bailey in October because they were suspected of being involved in various car explosion attempts in the UK.
The Ministry of Health will have to carry out pre-employment checks on overseas staff to be certain of the validity of their qualifications, experience, and work permits for the United Kingdom.
Although the Scottish Ministry of Health uses the Scottish Disclosure to carry out the controls of previous criminal cases, the agency has no right to obtain such information outside of Britain.
Among the many warnings, the Auditor General's report now states that committees are required to deal with the Office of Criminal Control, thereby enabling employers to undertake controls over various countries.
"Although we have discovered that some personnel information has been verified, this is not done every time," the report announces.
Mr Black said that the Scottish Ministry of Health carries out most of the pre-employment checks that he would do himself, but he also added: "Our report highlights aspects where the system can be improved to ensure that adequate information on certain overseas staff is available to health services.
Mr. Peter Terry, President of BMA Scotland said that it is "extremely unlikely" that pre-employment controls could identify employees likely to commit future terrorist acts.
He said "the report suggests that the pre-employment controls currently carried out work well in the Scottish health system and that it is not certain that these warnings can bring any added value."
The Scottish health authorities stated that they employed 1,161 people from overseas, mostly doctors and nurses.
But the reviewer general stressed that these figures certainly need to be revised upwards, partly because of the problems of identifying staff with indeterminate contracts, who may or may not choose to remain in our country.
The investigation has shown that the current controls procedures of the health authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian are quite adequate.
These checks are carried out on a passport, work permit and qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently revising its policy and system of pre-employment controls for personnel outside the ocean of the health service.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: "I was excited to do this work as a result of the terrorist attack at Glasgow Airport."
She added that the Scottish Government, together with the health committees, would carefully consider the warnings contained in the report to be published next month, and would commit to ensuring better implementation of the recently updated pre-employment controls, valid for all employees, including persons overseas.

Saudi Arabia blocks 208 terrifying plots
Yesterday Saudi Arabia revealed that it had arrested 208 activists involved in organizing cells handling an imminent attack on an oil site, as well as attacks on clergymen and the armed forces.
State television from the world's largest oil exporter, said one of the missile smuggling cells.
Al Qaeda supporters have been campaigning against the allied monarchy in the United States since 2003, following Iraq's invasion.
A cell of eight activists, led by a foreign resident, was planning an attack on an oil site in the Eastern Province, the TV newspaper said.
Saudi Arabia quickly formed a group of 35,000 military personnel to protect the sites, following a failed attack by Al Qaeda in 2006 against the largest oil site in Abqaiq.
The newspaper citing a statement from the Minister of the Interior stated that 18 of the arrested persons belong to a cell headed by a "missile launch expert" who infiltrated the country.
It is said that the militants planned the counter-band of eight missiles in the kingdom.
22 persons among the detainees appear to have plotted the murder of clergymen and armed forces.
The government has asked the clergy to do more against Saudis led in Iraq, to join Al Qaeda militants fighting the Allied Forces and the Shiite Muslim government allied with the United States, considered heretical according to the hard line of Saudi Sunny.
Al Qaeda activists believe that in Saudi Arabia, many clergymen have collaborated with the authorities to support the policy of the royal family that dominates the government.
The activists, encouraged by the calls against the pro-Western Saudi government, by Osama Bin Laden, leader of Saudi-born Al Qaeda, targeted foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy supply sites.
Major efforts have been made by the armed forces over the past five... months," said the Minister of the Interior's spokesman on state television.
Among the detainees are 16 members of the Medina organized into a "media cell" aimed at promoting "takfiri thought", the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals that supports the use of violence against infidel and apostate Muslims.
Of the detainees, 32 are accused of subsidizing activists.
Venus' climate could reveal the future of the Earth.
Scientists said yesterday that Venus was certainly a pleasant planet to live.
Data from the European spacecraft in orbit have shown that the planet is certainly twice as small as the Earth, contrary to what was previously thought.
Venus is the closest planet to Earth.
These two worlds are almost the same size, with similar orbits, although Venus is closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago Venus could have had conditions similar to those of the Earth, and could even have been habitable.
But the greenhouse effect due to carbon dioxide, the atmospheric erosion due to solar radiation combined with slower rotation led Venus to a whole other kind of evolution.
Today the planet is deprived of water, is ravaged by hurricanes and lightning storms and has a temperature surface warm enough to melt lead.
The discoveries of Venus Express, the probe of the European Space Agency, which studied the planet for a year, offer a sad vision of the potential future of the Earth due to the catastrophic changes in the climate.
The professor of physics at the University of Oxford, Fred Taylor, one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: "We are beginning to understand why the climate of Venus is so different from that of the Earth, although the planets themselves are practically similar.
"Our new data allows us to establish a scenario according to which billions of years ago Venus would have been originally the same as Earth, perhaps even with a habitable surface."
Enriched uranium seized by the police.
One kilo of radioactive material, apparently uranium, was seized by the Czechoslovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
One police officer stated that three people had been arrested and that the equipment was currently being analysed.
He did not confirm that it was uranium, but revealed that the goods would have a value of $1 million (£480,000).
Still open to everything
Mitt Romney said he was not up to the challenge as a presidential candidate to answer questions from a snowman.
Despite this, Republican presidential candidates finally agreed to participate in the You Tube debate, during which many ordinary voters who have registered their questions, submit them to the candidates.
Wednesday evening, November 28, none of the questions asked was as ridiculous as the one from another You Tube debate, when a snowman asked the Democrats their position on global warming.
But this time, the questions and the answers reflected very much the conditions of the Republican party, a candidate for the next elections.
We do not know on which criteria, CNN producers, who sponsored the debate, have chosen the You Tube clips to show to the aspiring candidates.
But the first half hour of the debate, the longest one-themed approach, focused on immigration.
The subject is one of the strong subjects for Republicans.
CNN asked some voters to call when they heard funny things: The board noted increases in approval when candidates spoke rudely.
The toughest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, leader of the national front, and Mr. Romney, who is at the forefront of the major early elections in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani tried to highlight the fact that he was accommodating about illegal immigration during his term as mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of employing illegal immigrants at his home.
The two fighters became particularly fierce when asked if they would be willing to promote "amnesia" (offering the illegals a regular status and the possibility of becoming a citizen).
Minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a Californian congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, managed to deepen this topic.
None of them have the opportunity to be elected, but both remain in the race, perhaps because they have begun to fight immigration before and in a more incisive way than the others.
In general, candidates, at least with regard to immigration, have the same opinions: more rigid borders, and zero tolerance for illegal immigrants.
This subject, combined with the concerns raised in particular by the case of toxic toys manufactured in China, or other fears towards the outside world, encourages Republicans to forget, or minimize divisions between libertarians and Catholic conservatives.
But the debate became particularly embarrassing when other topics were raised.
Mr. Giuliani asked why he had previously supported the arms control campaign.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether putting water in the nose should be considered torture.
One speaker asked if the candidates believed in the Bible in its entirety.
This led Giuliani to dare to declare that the Bible is his favorite book, even though he is not sure of believing in the history of Jonah and the whale.
Another speaker asked if Jesus would have been in favor of the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee was not expected to be in a position in Iowa during a recent election, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism, to declare that the death penalty is painful though necessary.
When one insisted on whether Jesus would have been in favor, he laughed and said that Jesus was too chic to run for election.
The human race remains unusually open to everything.
Mr Huckabee's recovery in Iowa coincides with the recent prodigious research of subsidies led by libertarian Ron Paul, and the whistles during Wednesday's debate.
These two emerge from nothing, because the two party protégés fail to agree on who is the most well-known and traditionalist candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate united the party early and convincingly with a message of success about American greatness bringing the leaders closer together.
This time, the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
The Pains of the Workers
Gordon Brown discovered a new hole to sink into; even if he resigned, the situation would not change.
Given the tendency of British scandals, this is not particularly juicy.
No decorations sold, no Parisian hotel bills from politicians, no extra marital finger sucked.
But a revelation attests that a rich businessman would have hidden his contributions to the current Labour Party for four years under false names, equivalent to over £650,000 ($1.3m), that the party would not have declared: A new battle that Gordon Brown would have done well.
Two months ago, the Prime Minister stepped back in his election project, foolishly insulting British intelligence, proclaiming that opinion polls did not influence his decision, and that he hoped, on the contrary, to offer a compact and effective government.
On the contrary, such as Vince Cable, the brilliant Liberal Democrat leader, said that the terrifying Mr Brown has changed from Stalin to Mr Bean.
The buy-back of Northern Rock, a bank in difficulty at the edge of the crack, demonstrated a weak policy and poor judgment in the event of an emergency.
Inadequate proposals to change the tax code have led to a coalition of industrial groups against the government.
The loss of 25 million personal data by the tax authorities has revealed an incredible administrative turmoil.
A trio of retired generals launched a revolt among the Lords, protesting against reductions in military spending: they proclaimed that being a minister of defence is for them a part-time job.
At present, the suspicion of shady donations from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Secretary General of Labour (and his former Chief of Vigilance) have caused them to resign.
None of this means that Mr. Brown is always heading for the exit.
However, governments can arrive at a point where it would be impossible to govern.
People do not like politicians, and do not trust them, but generally leave their doubts aside when a new government comes to power.
It seems obvious that a prime minister cannot improve things, or even rule for a long time, when he risks the suspension: the public administration no longer works; the cabinets of ministers take stock; the press searches for bad stories; and the government becomes defensive and without any further objectives.
In a sense, Mr. Brown's position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders, he cannot boast of being a beginner.
Although he would like to repudiate Tony Blair, he was still his superior lieutenant.
The problems with Northern Rock and tax data, for example, are related to Mr. Brown's decisions made when he was Chancellor of the British Treasury.
And even if he is not directly involved in Blair's misfortunes, such as the long investigation into the party's "money for members of the House of Lords" funds, voters might think otherwise.
But Mr. Brown's difficult situation is not as tragic as it looks.
The gaffes are not as monstrous as the members of the Tories make him believe.
As in Mr. Bean, there are no victims or scams.
And the remedy, though painful, could be to put Mr. Brown's Stalinist tendencies into practice forever, in favour of a reliable and slightly brutal government.
The new scandal about political donations is a good example.
Abrahams, a very particular character, comparing his donations to charity, said he did not want any public recognition of his charity.
He may have his opinion, but it's not up to him to decide.
The laws against the anonymity of the big grantors of politicians are clear, and they exist for a good reason: The public has the right to know which contributes to the success of those who will govern the country.
Mr. Watt, who stated that he was aware of Mr. Abrahams' programs, without knowing that this was illegal, will therefore have to be questioned, as well as Jon Mendlesohn, the person responsible for the grant collections who spoke about the doubtful donations in October.
But so far Mr. Brown is not involved: There is no evidence that he was aware of these steps, even though most of the payments made were made as a result of his arrival in government in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has made half.
He quickly condemned the legislative flaw of his party, but he did not draw attention to the fact that the decision-making power rests on something he knows well, resorting to a committee of inquiry on this subject composed of a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the lessons to be learned are not complicated.
And if the law has been violated, it's up to the police.
In addition, there are many other things Mr. Brown needs to do, such as finding a permanent chair for the independent committee of Public Living Standards, without a leader for six months, and preparing a good reform on the financial aspects of political parties.
This would force the Labour Party, in a moment of weakness, to collaborate with the Tories, which could lead it to renounce its particular financial relationship with the confederations; in short, a bitter pill for a partisan like Mr Brown.
But he should face certain partisan facts.
The Conservative party now has a good advantage for the elections; it has two years to win back the voters, and the only way to win is to demonstrate irreproachable integrity and strong skills.
Card scams.
Would the mortgage crisis contaminate the US credit card market?
When there's blood in the water, it's normal to see fins squeezing, whirling around.
Now that the U.S. real estate market is going through a critical phase, predators are targeting the U.S. credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts believe credit card losses could reach $99 billion if contagion extends from mortgages to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in the rates of costs and insolvency, which measure unrecoverable or unrecoverable balance sheet shares, more than 30 days later.
HSBC announced last month that it took $1.4 billion in its credit to the consumer, partly because of the weakness of cardholders.
It's still too early to panic.
Costs and insolvency are still moderate.
According to Moody, a tax agency, the insolvency rate of 3.89% in the third quarter is almost one point lower than its historical average.
The deterioration of rates is partly explained by technical factors.
A change in the laws in 2005 in the United States regarding personal bankruptcy caused a sharp fall in the bankruptcy archives, which in turn caused heavy losses for credit cards; the number of archives (and thus insolvency rates) could increase even if the terms of borrowing were to worsen.
The industry also announces fixed payment rates, which highlight the monthly amount of debt that consumers have to pay.
and confidence in the security of credit card capital is quite strong despite the paralysis of other aspects of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research company, predicted that the 2007 issue volume would be 25% higher than last year.
Direct infection links between the mortgage crisis and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers may prefer to increase their debt now that fair mortgages have disappeared.
But card issuers pay more attention to cash flows than to the value of assets, and therefore the fall in real estate prices has not necessarily led to a change in borrowers' credibility.
They could even bring benefits to credit issuers.
Consumer premiums for mortgage payments fall if the properties cost less than the value of the loan; therefore, credit card debt would become a priority to repay the whole.
Card issuers are able to respond much faster than mortgages and more flexibly to such crisis conditions, as they can change interest rates or alter credit limits.
This should in theory reduce the risk of a rapid resumption of actions.
"We're not going to wake up one morning and re-evaluate all the borrowings," said Gary Perlin, Capital One's director.
If a financial disaster in the credit card market is unlikely, there is a high risk of a significant decline.
If the lower prices of real estate and a contraction in the credit market lead America to recession, the industry will certainly have to face a ghastly future.
Be careful with the dorsal fins.
British bankers plead guilty to the Enron case.
The three British bankers who were to testify to their roles in relation to a fraud committed by Enron's previous financial director, Andrew Fastow, changed their statement, pleading guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had first declared themselves innocent of the seven charges of alleged collusive fraud in 2000, committed by Fastow in a secret financial scam to enrich themselves despite their employees.
They are expected to appear in court in January.
But during a hearing chaired by U.S. judge Ewing Werlein Jr, they all pleaded guilty to fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a subsidiary of the Royal Bank of Scotland's PLC group, became famous throughout Britain because of extradition proceedings that lasted two years.
In the United States, their case remains an outstanding issue for this investigation launched following the fall of Enron in 2001.
The charges imposed on them in 2002 made it clear to Fastow that he was the subject of the government's investigation into Enron's debacle.
The accusations against the bankers, nicknamed the "three of Natwest" claim to have come to Houston in 2000, to organize a fraudulent scenario with Fastow and his former right-hand man, Michael Kopper.
NatWest Greenwich invested in a subsidiary of an Enron partner controlled by Fastow, who was the director of many fraudulent scenarios, which helped him rig bankruptcy proceedings.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had estimated its interest in the subsidiary to be zero, but in fact the three British already know its value.
A company controlled by Kopper bought the bank interest of the subsidiary for £1 million.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 as interest for this company.
According to the prosecution, Fastow falsely announced to Enron that the energy company was willing to pay Greenwich NatWest $20 million for its shares in the subsidiary.
But in truth these $20 million went into the pockets of British bankers, Fastow and others.
According to the charges, the bankers would have won $7.3 while Fastow, Kopper and the others would have won $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty to his active role in two conspiracies in Enron's debacle.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving six years in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is incarcerated for three years and a month in a prison in Texarkana.
The three British were released on bail of $1 million each, forcing them to live in the United States during the trial.
Enron, formerly the seventh largest national company, in bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of accounting trickery, could no longer hide its billions of debt or even offer its phony speculations as profitable.
The collapse caused thousands of layoffs, more than $60 billion loss of market value and more than $2 billion loss for pension plans.
Enron's founder, Kenneth Lay and former President Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their involvement in the collapse of society.
Skilling was sentenced to more than 24 years in prison.
The charges against Lay for conspiracy, fraud and other crimes were futile because of his death due to a heart attack last year.
Not ass, not out of Moscow.
The cost of a G550 Gulfstream aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and with sufficient fuel autonomy to fly without stopover from Moscow to Los Angeles, is $54 million.
But this is only a small change for some Russians.
"It can carry up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
"Even if no one really needs as many seats as it is more of a family aircraft or for the president of a company."
Mr. Firer was present at the Gulfstream stand last Friday at the Millionaires' Fair, a four-day consumer incentive orgy held in a huge exhibition centre around the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other exhibitors were present with their stands, hoping to attract the interest of the new rich Russians for their various products, ranging from mahogany yachts to cars filled with diamonds like those of 50 Cent.
Mr. Firer was checking out a bright orange Porsche, exposed next to his stand.
"It's a nice car, but nothing comparable to our product," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest private aircraft market."
"Thanks to an oil boom, the Russian capital seems to be rolling in black gold, like Dallas"
"We experienced the same thing in the 1890s, when some Americans became so rich and landed in Europe where they were considered materialists," said Marshall Goldman, a senior scholar in the Davis department of Russian and Eurasian studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudis in the 1970s, the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians emerge as the world's largest spenders.
The biggest luxury brands are looking for their place in the Klondike.
This week, in another location in Moscow, a conference on the luxury industry allowed Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, president of LVMH, to exchange their ideas on the strategy to be followed for the sale of luxury goods to markets like Russia.
(The conference was organized by the International Herald Tribune, which belongs to The New York Times.)
Russia has 53 billionaires worth $282 billion, according to the Forbes list listing the richest people.
In addition, two thirds of the rich are made up of 103,000 Russian millionaires who are worth $670 billion overall, according to a study on the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, carried out by economists of the economic and financial research center.
(The World Bank stated that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians lived below the poverty line).
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow, that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, a representative of Davis Morris, a London jeweler.
She participated in the show for the first time with the Russian distributor, The Soho Bijoutier Group.
"Women are all well prepared and men are worth a fortune."
Walking in the salon on Sunday evening, the two real estate agents placed on their 31st, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26 declare to be like their clients, millionaires.
"I was looking at the cars and trying to choose between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Ms. Yumatova, who was grabbing her high fashion dress like a red carpet veteran like Joan Rivers.
The show seems to be aimed above all at the new rich, the kind of buyers of Russian brands willing to line up in the corks to come to a huge warehouse where Cadillac Escalades, platinum canyons, Mövenpick ice creams, custom billiard tables, apartments in Dubai and teddy bears Gund are exposed.
The public could buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
"Russians are interested in defining the most expensive and best brands," said Mr. Gijrath, posing proudly at the Royal factory stand for the manufacture of Dutch Delf porcelain, in front of a mural painting by Raimbrant on blue tiles, handmade.
"it is certain that Russians are more interested in bling bling"
Indeed, the sellers have stated here that Russians with old capital (10 to 15 years old are too much according to Russian standards) have already passed bright logos to a kind of limited edition brand that could not sell at the show.
Despite this, thousands of people, whether millionaires, millionaires' emissaries or tourists, visit the exhibition every day.
And some even buy.
On the first night of the exhibition, last Thursday, Roman Ershow, the CEO of King Koil Beds, said he sold two sets of silk mattresses, cashmere, and cotton inlaid with gold threads.
During the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, the sales manager of A1 motorcycle, a company that equips cars with state-of-the-art alarm systems, also declared to have sold to a Russian millionaire, the bright orange Porsche, for $170,000.
By Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, the president of L.A. Connection, a company that customizes luxury cars, said he would sell three bracelet-like cars, for Rolls-Royce Phantoms, at $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter, the wheel of a car designed for the owner of a Russian casino, who wanted it to be encrusted with Swarovski crystals so that it looked like a wheel of roulette.
The set of four costs $22,000.
"The Russian millionaire who wants wheels made of ostrich leather, or a picture of his wife made of cubic zirconium, will not necessarily drive with such tires," said Mr. Karapetian.
It will certainly keep it in its garage already containing 30 or 40 vehicles »
Although many of his Russian clients are wealthy, Mr. Karapetian said that the term "Russian millionaire" is not on the agenda, given the rise in real estate prices here.
"If you had bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you would already be a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash," he said.
"There's more you could think of"
Those who are not millionaires can at least feel this emotion when they go to the stand of Alliance Continental, a Russian heritage management company.
The company has set up four stands representing British telephone booths, filled with bulk of counterfeit dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing director, said his team printed 500,000 counterfeit tickets for the Millionaire show.
Passersby arrested to throw out masses of tickets, ask their friends to photograph them on their mobile, in the middle of this false wealth or poaching a few million.
"You see, here in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire," said Mr. Karyev.
Unapproved surgeon suspected of homicide in New Jersey
It was the eve of Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked through the window bay of Just a little Healthier restaurant and observed an ambulance that had just stopped at the gates of White Cape Cod on West Scott Avenue.
Then came the police patrol.
And then another one.
"Then I saw the medical vehicle stop," a restaurant manager, Livingston, said on Wednesday.
That's where I realized someone had died.
The authorities would then learn that the deceased was a 41-year-old woman, Olga Arroyo, assistant to the Director of Newark Police Department.
Now investigators are trying to determine whether the cause of his death is due to an act performed by an unlicensed cosmetic surgeon, which the police have not yet identified, residing at 212 West Scott Avenue.
The authorities have not yet determined the causes of Miss Arroyo's death, but they are looking forward to the results of the toxicological tests which, unfortunately, will take time, but which should help resolve this mysterious death that has saddened the high ranks of Newark police.
Ms. Arroyo had been the assistant to the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was well known in various departments.
She was loyal, hard-working and tenacious," McCarthy said about Miss Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday."
"she was like a pit bull"
"she would have done anything to protect me"
Mr. McCarthy stated that Ms. Arroyo was married to Jimmy Arroyo, a former police officer from Newark who worked for the Alcoholic Beverages Control Commission, and that she left two 14- and 11-year-old sons and a daughter-in-law.
Eileen Walsj, spokesman for the Union County Public Prosecutor's Office, Theodore J. Romankow, said that the detectives were trying to determine whether Miss Arroyo died because of an unauthorized surgery.
"This is a possibility to consider."
"the investigation is continuing."
The authorities said they arrived at her house around 3:00.
and finding Miss arroyo on the sofa.
She was declared dead.
A little more than a week has passed since, and the authorities have not said much about the investigation or even about the owner of the house identified as Flor Margarita Castro.
Ms. Walsh could not confirm whether Ms. Castro was questioned by the authorities.
Investigators are trying to understand whether a part of the house was used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Miss Castro's house where a moose rose tree rests in the narrow cemetery in front, and a Dalmatian barked at the back.
A blue cane called "Ethyl Vanillin" used as a substitute for vanilla in the kitchen and for perfumes, lay in a hangar, next to a door that leads to the basement.
Two all-terrain bikes hanging on the sides.
McCarthy said that since arriving in Newark 25 years ago, at the New York Police Department, Miss Arroyo has been extremely valuable, helping her navigate the new city and abandon her framed political culture.
"She said, "You have to be careful about this," he said.
"She was there when I arrived, and again when I left.
"It was embarrassing"
Everyone hopes that the Federal Reserve will lower the rates associated with the effervescence of the world stock exchange.
The shares were exploded on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday, after the market hoped that the Federal Reserve would have tried to calm the credit conditions, subsequently reducing the interest rates promoted by the soothing statements of the Vice President of the US Central Bank.
Stock markets explode in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, number 2 after Ben Bernanke, President of the Federal Reserve, said that those who decide must be "flexible and pragmatic" in their actions in agitated financial markets.
In an obvious effort to reassure irritable markets in view of these new credit-related tensions, Mr. Kohn said that the recent turbulence has partly " reversed some improvements in the functioning of the market at the end of September and October.
In the event that this severe turbulence persists, this would increase the likelihood of subsequent rigid financial conditions for owners and businesses, he said.
These comments appear to investors as a clear signal that the Federal Reserve is ready to inject new capital into US markets, and that further interest rate reductions could stabilize credit conditions.
These remarks also helped calm Wall Street with even worse news about the US economy, such as the biggest fall in real estate sales for the month of October.
The repercussions of this financial turmoil were accentuated following the statement of Bear Stearns, an investment bank, announcing that it will lay off 650 people, that is, 4% of its staff, to reduce the costs to compensate for the heavy losses due to the losing bets of real estate loans.
Only 20 posts are planned in Londrès, where the bank employs 1500 people.
In New York, the industrial average of the Dow Jones increased by 331 points, 2.5% to 13,289.40, while the highest index, S&P 500, took 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index took 165.5 points or 2.7% concluding at 6306.2 adding more than £39 to the value of British companies.
The German Dax index increased by 2.6% and the French CAC40 took 2.3%.
Previously, the re-emergence of credit difficulties in the markets was highlighted due to the strong demand for a monthly sorting auction from the European Central Bank, which cut these loans to European commercial banks at a high rate of 4.7%, the highest since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to follow the EDF and the ECB and to inject further funds into the London financial markets causing credit tensions, have caused the monthly sorting rates Libor the British banks, have caused their highest growth since September last, at 6,59% following a strong upturn since November 12.
England faces an appeal to judgment in relation to the criticisms of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara.
We are facing two dilemmas, one as difficult as the other.
Who will be the number 6 drummer for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And even more important in a context as broad as the first Test against Sri Lanka, who will make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the President of the Breeders who was there exceptionally to help Peter Moores, Chief Coach, and Michael Vaughan, the Captain, make his decision, and because the office of Hugh Morris, the President General of England, begins to fill out the application forms to become a national breeder, at least on a part-time basis.
Anyone who fails to win the 6th record will be unlucky, but life is often unfair and sport is also unfair.
It is never easy to destroy what allows one man to reach the top of his profession while another will never reach beyond the lower level, sometimes due to lack of luck more than due to lack of skill.
It is not only in cricket that selection is difficult, because in the end the judgment remains subjective.
Is this the right time to make Bopara emerge?
Is it just about Shah?
The same could be proposed in another context, which choose between John Edwards or Banerjee "tubby"?; both new executives who have obtained good degrees, professional, should be promoted: but there is room for only one of them.
Who has the right to determine the correct level of a cricket unless given at least one chance?
Figures are important in decisions, but also opportunities.
Within a team, a cricket must capture the captain's eye, at the same time he must take the door and a drummer must be lucky to touch the one-day cricket.
But capturing the eyes of the selectors is much more complicated.
Many have done better last season, for example, James Anderson who seemed certain to play the first Test, even though Stephen Harmison declared himself in good shape and continued to train to serve.
Anderson took 32 first-class doors out of 33 laps to win a seat.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 to the same average, but both have already experienced their moment of glory at the highest level and hope to offer yet.
If it's Shah or Bopara playing at Asgiriya Stadium, it's just a matter of opinion.
This choice could destroy or build a man's career, but it makes little difference.
Four years ago, in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in each Test and did well in the first, with five doors and 40 useful laps, but it was Paul Collingwood, who was also struggling to emerge, who managed to become the primary cricket of the Test, and this, despite the fact that his double-cent mark against Australia in Australia may still be underestimated.
The probability is that Graveney, Vaughan, and Moores, following another discussion after today's session at Asgiriya Stadium, will certainly follow their conservative instincts and foster Shah's greatest experience against the exuberance of young Bopara.
They both have good arguments.
In favour of Shah, his brilliant and considerable start at the 88 test innings in Bombay, 32 cents first class versus six for Bopara, who at age 22 is seven years younger, and his excellent ranking at the launch.
But Shah did only ten laps during his two innings in May against the Caribbean during the Test to Lord, his Middlesex player city, and that, the immediate rejection by the breeders when Vaughan was back in shape, claimed his place for the next game, seems to have afflicted his so obvious momentum in Bombay.
Unlike him, the player of Essex is full of joy to live.
Nothing scares him on a cricket pitch and he overreacted when he recently flipped on a 4x4 during a presentation by Volkswagen, a sponsor of England.
He reported only slight injuries, was shocked, even though the first thing he did was take his Vodafone (sponsor of course) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate who looked at him from afar, to ask him if "he had seen this?"
Bopara is by far the best drummer, his shooting style allows him to do services that go to him, and that he beat with confidence and professionalism.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Maybe this is the real art of selection?
I'd be happy to give Bopara his chance, which doesn't mean Shah shouldn't apply if, as the tea leaves suggest, he'll be the one to play this weekend.
Buses bring people back to work, and fight al Qaeda.
The first bus filled with Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, spilling these exiles without money or visa renewals, or others hoping that the city has regained normalcy.
Some have returned to fight against militants who have taken them away from their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of 800 people in convoys of dozens of buses from the official government, the terminal was filled with refugees from Syria and Jordan who returned by their means.
"I decided to go to Syria after they killed several doctors in Baghdad," said Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came home today because I saw on TV and read in the newspapers what happened in Baghdad and since the city is safer now."
"They say that the Mahdi army no longer commits crimes!" he said, referring to the Shia militia of the ecclesiastical activist Moqtada al-Sadr, who imposed on his men to move away for the time being.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shia teacher from the Sunni-dominated Amariyah area, returned with his two children because he could no longer renew his Syrian visa and because the regime prevented Iraqis from working.
His neighbors from Shia to Amariyah called him to inform him that the United States-assisted militia, allowed him to hunt Al Qaeda from the west of the capital, and invited him back.
One of Jordan's newcomers is the leader of a Sunni and Shia tribe who had to leave his home north of Baghdad because of a grenade attack after he incited citizens to rebel against Al-Qaeda.
But he had to go home to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they had set up an anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh, and that they needed me and my boys."
"That's why I'm coming home today," said 62-year-old Sabaah Alu Obeidi.
Many say they have attracted the growing calm of the capital since American troops arrived, and at the sight of continuing formation of well-armed "citizen groups" and collaborating with the American military to defend their neighbourhood.
But still others say they were forced to return because of the visa problem and the decadence of the capital of Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in the past years.
The 51-year-old Salaam al-Samarrai, father of three children, expressed everyone's suspicion about the visas for exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, Prime Minister Shia, would have asked the Syrian government to limit to force people to return to the country.
More than two and a half million people reportedly fled the country because of sectarian death squads.
"we had no problem until al-Maliki came to Syria and urged the government to stop issuing visas to Iraqis, to force them to return to Iraq," said retired Sunni.
"I can't trust a government that supports criminals who burned down my house when I left."
The decrease in violence can be explained in part by the fact that the Sunnis were driven out of Shia and vice versa, creating places where tensions are lower.
It is feared that a sudden influx of refugees will once again increase sectarian tensions and bring back the fighting.
Little Sarre, good training.
The smallest Federated State conducts vocational training, and even shines through the international orientation of its higher schools.
It is only in one area that a deficit weighs on the Sarrois, similar to that of the rest of the country.
"I explained yesterday for the 50th time to a non-Sarrois, that we are not French" - it is the slogan that the smallest federated state, by self-derision, displays for its 50th anniversary.
At this level, France and Luxembourg play a major role in the training system of the Saarland, which is placed fifth in the training monitor of the German Economic Institute of Cologne.
Thus, by tradition, higher schools cooperate closely with neighbouring countries.
The university was founded in Sarrebruck in 1948 by the French.
To date, students have the opportunity to complete their studies there with a double or even a triple degree.
This is evidenced by the high proportion of foreign students 15.6 per cent.
The Saar also leads the country's children to higher-than-average schools - many of them without a Gymnasium degree.
"In Sarre, we take advantage of the vocational training system," says Axel Plünnecke, an expert in training at IW.
More than one in five young people get their degree in a vocational school, so the Saarland is more than seven points above the national average.
The possibilities for combining vocational and academic training are also relatively well developed.
In view of the number of inhabitants, the double-cursus panel is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and increasing demand, however, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by a third in recent years.
For this reason, the Ministry of Education has forced the higher schools to carry out a marketing campaign in the fields of engineering science.
"After the first PISA studies, we celebrated a large number of reforms in general schools," said a spokesman for the Ministry of Education.
Thus, the government introduced comparison tests throughout the federated state.
For children to start learning earlier, the last year of daycare is law-free - a model that in the meantime other federated states also copy.
Only future comparative studies will show whether students' performance is improving in a sustainable way.
In the PISA studies in 2003, the proportion of at-risk students decreased from 29 per cent to 20 per cent.
In total, however, the Saar has not improved as much as other federated states.
The Bavarians are doing better.
And in spite of the laughter, foreign language knowledge is not measured by PISA studies - otherwise we could gain points in this area.
Because the language of the neighbor is compulsory in high schools - even if the sarrois are not French.
Chavez adjusts the watches
In Venezuela, watches will soon make ticking other than in the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chavez will take the half-hour stopwatch back to South America.
Chavez becomes a caricature in Spain in the meantime.
As the official newspaper of Venezuela communicated, as a result of a new law, watches will be set to less than four and a half hours of universal time.
In this way, the South American country obtains a time zone that does not exist in any other state of the world.
The anti-American Chávez justified his position, among other things, by the fact that the United States would have imposed on the world the separation of time zones in full hours.
In addition, Chávez announced Wednesday (local time) the cessation of relations with the neighbouring country, Colombia, as a result of a hostage case.
The left-wing nationalist announced that as long as Conservative Alvaro Uribe remained president of Colombia, he would have no relations with either the head of state or the Colombian government.
"I can't do that, because of my dignity," Chávez said, who is eager to see a constitutional reform that the citizens of the oil country will have to vote on by referendum on Sunday.
With this reform, it would significantly strengthen its power in the country.
The trigger for this dispute was Uribe's decision to withdraw from Chávez the mandate of negotiations on the release of hostages with Marxist rebels in Colombia.
Uribe allegedly "cracked in the face" of Venezuela with this decision, he criticized Sunday Chávez.
In Spain too Chávez is in all mouths.
A new mobile phone ringer rages in the country: "Why don't you shut up" (why don't you shut up) is the phrase that already more than half a million people have downloaded on the internet.
It was pronounced by the Spanish king Juan Carlos who, at the most recent Ibero-American summit, was annoyed by the constant interpellations of the left populists and who told him to shut up.
A fall in wages threatens Germany in 2007.
Despite the strong economic situation, according to a forecast, a real wage loss threatens German employees this year.
Experts have cited all sorts of reasons to explain their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a calculation by the Hans-Böckler Foundation, employees are expected to expect a real decrease in their payroll in 2007 compared to the previous year.
"The fault lies in the low growth of wages, the increase in the value-added tax and the rise in food and energy prices," said Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economic Research in the "Bild" newspaper.
New costs could also be incurred in terms of unemployment insurance for the employee.
The Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told the newspaper "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the projected decline in unemployment insurance of 3.3 per cent for the new year was certainly correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the National Employment Agency no longer has the right to be embarrassed to ask the Federation for credits or financial aid, according to the words of the SPD politician.
On Tuesday, it was known that the explosion in food and oil prices had pushed inflation to its highest level in 13 years.
In total, prices increased by 3.0 per cent from year to year.
Venus is the infernal twin of the Earth.
Despite its hostile atmosphere to life, Venus looks more like the Earth than we thought until now: the European space probe "Venus Express" has discovered lightning in the atmosphere and wind whirls at the poles, similar to those that appear in winter on Earth.
For almost three decades, scientists have assumed that there are flashes on Venus.
The European probe "Venus Express" has now brought proof of this - it has detected electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere: the lightning on Venus burst at a height of about 56 kilometers of cloud cloud, reports Christopher Russell of the University of California in Los Angeles in the scientific magazine "Nature".
According to the famous cyprine theory, lightning would have made life appear on Earth: the storm would have stimulated reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, the corner stone of life.
This is not the case on Venus: "If there was a life, it must have been at a very old date in history," explains Sean Solomon of the "Carnegie Institution" in Washington.
There should now be few living things on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, there are sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees.
"Venus may be the infernal twin of the Earth, but it remains a twin," Russell said.
Why Venus, which looks so much like the Earth in mass and dimensions, has been struck by such a different evolution, is the fundamental question of the ESA mission.
The departure of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was an important step in Venetian research, since no more probes were on their way to explore this planet since the 1980s.
In the opinion of the researchers, the most recent research results that have now been presented in several "Nature" articles not only highlight the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system.
They also show that the commonalities with the Earth of our neighboring planet are more numerous than assumed at first.
So the researchers found, in addition to the wind whirlwinds already known at the north pole, a cloud whirlwind at the south pole, which rotates even faster.
The phenomenon recalls the currents of air in the terrestrial hemispheres in winter, writes a team of researchers around Giuseppe Piccioni of the Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica italiana.
The second planet of the solar system has almost the same mass as the Earth and is, with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers, almost as large.
The planet described as an evening or morning star revolves around the sun in just 225 days.
However, it turns much more slowly on itself: one day Venus lasts 243 Earth days.
Although Venus, with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, hardly recalls the Earth, scientists assume that the two planets have formed under similar conditions.
Of the two, the water accumulated and remained on Earth in the form of oceans, but was lost in space on Venus.
And while carbon dioxide has settled on Earth in the form of carbonate, it constitutes the bulk of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel's encounter with the Dalai Lama.
The President of the Federal Republic of Germany Köhler demands the end of the party's quarrel over the reception of the Dalai Lama at the Chancellery.
Indirectly, he criticized the SPDs for attacks on the Chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler cares about the appearance of Germany and adds up to the great coalition of closing the dispute over the reception of the Dalai Lama.
"We must not present to the outside world a divided nation on this issue," Köhler said at Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler showed understanding for the reception of the Dalai Lama by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"Human rights have universal validity, even though I have respect for differences between cultures," Köhler said.
Everyone knows that Germany should maintain a sensitive foreign policy balance, stressed the President of the Federal Republic, but defended Merkel against the accusations that it would organize a new policy of China.
The German Chancellor did not distance herself from the traditional policy of one China.
"China knows that too," Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steimeier (SPD) had indirectly expressed his discontent with the reception of the Dalai Lama and had been attacked for this outside the CDU.
Steinmeier complained in particular about the CDU's "front policy" on foreign policy.
After the reception of the Dalai Lama at the Chancery, virulent irritations were felt in the German-Chinese relations.
Thus the Chinese government not only decommissioned the German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but also, according to Spiegel, frozen the so-called strategy dialogue of the foreign ministers of both countries.
China's head of government Wen Jiabao now demands German Chancellor Angela Merkel to acknowledge that the reception of the Dalai Lama was a mistake.
China refused to allow European politicians to receive the spiritual leader of Tibet in his official duties, thus supporting Wen Jiabao's Chinese position.
The Dalai Lama's words and actions would show that it is trying to separate Tibet and other Tibetan regions from China, which also includes other current provinces.
Schäuble warns against riots like those of France.
Street fighting with police, shooting, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against riots like those of France.
Every effort must be made to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not erupt in the streets through violence, the German Minister of the Interior demanded.
Barricades that burn, crackers that shoot at the police with hunting rifles: after the serious riots of young people in France, the German Minister of the Interior Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar evolution in Germany.
We must ensure that a social explosive does not also constitute itself at home and defuses itself into violence.
We have to take this seriously," he said to the "New Press" published in Hanover.
Not all young people would be able to cope with the rapid transformations of social reality.
The Federation, the federated states and the communes were already working hard to reduce the problems, Schäuble said.
This would not only affect the integration of immigrants.
"From integration summits to conferences on Islam, it already shows its first successes."
However, it would be too early for an end to alert.
Schäuble points out at the same time as in the German suburbs, there are no sociological problems nor from the point of view of urbanism as in France.
In northern Paris, young people had been engaged in serious street battles with the police over the past few nights.
In Toulouse too, cars and public buildings burned down.
Greater integration efforts by the German government were required by the President of the Turkish communities in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In view of the riots in France, Kolat warned against "imitation effects".
The situation in Germany would certainly not be as explosive as in France.
However, action would still be necessary.
Kolat emphasises that the unemployment rate among young people under 25 years of age from immigration would be higher than the average.
More training should be provided in the first place.
Kolat insisted: "We must give young people a perspective".
The President of the Turkish communities added, however, that social control in families took place more in Germany than in France.
Many young people from immigration also do not want to destroy what their parents built here.
Kolat urged: "But we still have to be careful."
Young people should be "quietly given the opportunity to participate in work and training".
Meanwhile, in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel, everything remained very quiet during the night.
Police units were in place, a helicopter was flying over the area with projectors.
The authorities in place reported three arrests as well as a few burnt cars and garbage cans.
Since the conference, a deployment of about 1000 security forces has ensured calm.
The police will intervene as long as necessary, announced the Minister of the Interior Michelle Alliot-Marie, after a visit to the suburbs.
On Tuesday night, nearly 80 police officers were injured during riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The next night, the troubles overflowed in Toulouse.
The riots broke out after a traffic accident in which two young people lost their lives on Sunday.
According to the first elements of the Public Prosecutor's Office, the police are not responsible for the death of young people.
In the empire of Angela Merkel.
The chancellor's utopian entry shows that the coalition has finished with the background - and that there is nothing left to wait for from it.
What country does this chancellor live in?
After his desolating intervention in the general debates of the German Parliament, which was chaotic and poor in content, it must be said: not here - not in the country which should, in the end, be governed by it.
The criticism of too much focus on politics was rejected by Angela Merkel by a harsh and presumptuous phrase.
It is provincial, she said, and has only shown by this that she does not want to understand what critics want.
In Parliament, it has made visible to all the extent to which this criticism was correct.
There was no real interest in, or little feeling for, the country's problems.
Instead, Angela presented herself as a cloud: a pessimistic politician, who flees into foreign politics and who even there remains in the near future.
For example, climate protection: in this respect, it welcomes again and again the Heiligendam agreements, but does not say how climate objectives will have to be achieved in our country.
Even, self-praising - having so little modesty, the head of the CDU would have refused it again two years ago.
Now she's cramming to all-made formulas, which growth would affect people.
By this she destroys her image as a pragmatist, which solves problems instead of beautifying the world.
But in the empire of the Angela cloud, domestic policy problems are a marginal phenomenon.
Child poverty and the concerns of low-wage workers?
He has a few additional sentences left for this.
In this regard, the number of times she makes lapses when it comes to family allowances is revealing.
Here, Merkel needs three startups to pronounce a half-precise sentence.
She hesitates in unknown terrain, from the moment it becomes concrete.
The Attack branch
In the YouTube debate of Republican presidential candidates, the two favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney are engaged in a tough offensive battle - and must now fear an outsider candidate.
The tension of the candidates is already erupting on the first subject.
He allegedly made New York a "refugee for the underground," Mitt Romney reproaches his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
"I would say that his own house was a haven for illegals," Giuliani replied and reproached the former governor of Massachusetts for having employed undocumented immigrants.
Candidates rise to the attack: since the Republican base also has no official favorites, the eight presidential candidates use the CNN debates first and foremost to discredit their opponents.
The 30-second amateur movies that Internet users sent via Youtube are hardly more than blowers.
"It was with this kind of isolationism that we let Hitler come to power," John McCain tells his candidate Ron Paul who is the only one in the round to claim an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney is also strongly taught by Vietnam's veterans, when he refuses to condemn as a torture what is called "Waterboarding", a method of interrogation in which drowning is simulated.
However, the fact that the important themes of the campaign go beyond the war in Iraq in the meantime and the debates on torture can be seen in the reactions of the St. Petersburg Joint Hall in Florida.
Whether the conservative values are rented or the future tax increases are refused, the applause goes to the auditorium.
This is where the weaknesses of the two favourites are once again revealed.
"I made a mistake at that time," Romney contrites and apologizes to the base and the television audience for having been still a supporter of abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, goes into a node when asked for his opinion on literal interpretations of the Bible.
Musharraf reigns for the first time in civilian.
One day after his retirement as head of army, Pakistani powerman Musharraf was invested as president.
Thus, eight years of military domination end.
Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf was invested on Thursday for a new five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live at the presidential palace of the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf has sworn to respect the Constitution and to act for the well-being of the Nation.
On Wednesday he had handed over his position as head of the armed forces to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and thus bowed to international pressure, including that of the United States.
Eight years after his takeover by a putsch without bloodshed, the former general now reigns for the first time as head of civil status.
By withdrawing from the post of commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf had fulfilled the main requirement of the opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is the end of the state of emergency that Musharraf had decreed on 3 November.
Soon after his inauguration Musharraf will suspend the state of emergency, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, and thus fulfill another Western requirement.
The Supreme Court of the country, which Musharraf had occupied after the establishment of the state of emergency with lawyers of its ranks, had rejected all appeals last week against the controversial re-election of the head of state on 6 October.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed in the northern tribal region of North Waziristan in an attack on a military convoy, and four others were wounded.
According to the army spokesman, a bomb exploded in a street near the Afghanistan border.
Krautrock's fathers are returning.
Germany's supergroups in the 1970s replayed: the three members of the Harmonia group again took their console in a concert in Berlin.
For their return they appeared recordings of their great success "Live 1974".
Already at that time, they were much better known abroad.
The expected sensation then occurs in the form of three gentlemen announced on the evening poster.
Everyone has his little box in front of him, his cable and above all his buttons.
Dieter Moebius, 63, sits in the middle of a white shirt like snow.
He is flanked to the left by 57-year-old Michael Rother with a laptop and a guitar.
On the right, observed by the entire auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, bends on his console.
Everyone contributes to the noise, among other things even a Beat.
And sometimes this is inadvertently added to a piece of traditional music.
This does not seem to bother the gentlemen themselves too much.
The fact that Harmonia is playing again has ensured a few emotions among Krautrock's fans.
We have the right to reveal it here: targeted surveys reveal that, of course, the name is reasoning in the collective memory of pop, but in no case in such a long-lasting way that this group has missed so painfully for 32 years.
But why wouldn't the German also have the right to celebrate his living legends of the seventies?
All the more so since what is dubiously called "Krautrock" has always been more pleasant in England and America than in the country of origin.
When the music industry awarded in 2003 the Echo Award to the survivors of the Cologne Can group for their work, German pop interviewers were seen in the room.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the groups La Düsseldorf and Neu! in the panegyric praise, the astonishment no longer had limits.
Later, during the concerts, Michael Rother jumped on the Red Hot Chili Peppers scene as an old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and transfiguration in the unknown is the only and only one.
The memory is thus already taken by Harmonia, because the trio only existed two years and that during this period, the impact power that felt was much lower than what was subsequently attributed to it by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already played with artist Conrad Schnitzler under the very promising name of Cluster.
We first played in the cellars below the Berlin scene.
Then in Düsseldorf, for a label subsidized by the church, for financial reasons.
Rother had briefly broken into Kraftwerk and finally made a name as a guitarist with Neu!, which was at the time perhaps the most radical German band.
Around 1973, however, Rother followed the musicians of Cluster in exile in the forests of Weserbergland.
There, in an old farm of the Weser, a ruin of the 16th century, they lived as members of communities fleeing the city.
Less ideological than in the "Kommune I" community, where Roedelius had the right to be tormented as a nurse.
Rather an artistic existence like Spitzweg.
So-called was in the trash a fan of the choir Harmonia Ottenstein and also a name for art.
Many kept Harmonia away from it.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia", and the next album was called "De Luxe".
Because as serene and modest as music sounded, the band suffered from material misery.
The harvest of dead wood was not in itself a search for self.
The recently released CD "Live 1974" was recorded at a concert in Griessem in front of a record audience of nearly 50 heads, as someone thinks they remember.
Rother issued at that time the desire to force Harmonia to train from time to time.
It was an immoral requirement for Roedelius and Moebius.
The group announced its separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the spheres of esotericism and assumed his existence with albums like "Flammende Herzen" (hearts in flames).
Cluster is revived in the 1980s and has since been more successful than Harmonia has ever had.
We owe Griessem's Live album to Herbert Grönemeyer.
Its Grönland label set itself the goal of maintaining Krautrock as a German contribution inherent in contemporary music.
Neu! had already been dug up on this occasion as the personal work of Roedelius.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place at the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
Publicly subsidized, as part of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is here, the British, former punk and author of the pocket book "Krautrock Sampler".
There's also the inventor of Loveparade, Dr. Motte.
By which the entire fluctuation margin of Krautrock's influence would be identified with respect to future pop music.
The place left empty by the group will be filled by Harmonia.
Brian Eno's sentence hovers in the room in the midst of the singular sounds: "The only true music you hear is the future."
There are photos that show the producers with Harmonia in the farm room.
The projections of other black and white photographs of wired tools in bazaar are used to form the legend.
In front, the three veterans are again busy improvising.
But more by sticking microphones to the organ and the battery, to pull into the instruments new sounds thanks to the effects instruments built themselves.
Today, electronic music resembles electronic music.
All three of them in big tech fignolers.
Even at this the choir of the house will not change anything.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, we cough and whisper under the cloud of sounds, and we sing at a beautiful moment "Aaaaaaaah" with emphasis.
Krautrock has always been a very English concept.
It's never been about rock.
Roots have been less searched in blues than in music conservatories (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or in the flight of artistic or social conventions (Cluster).
The one who shouts "68" is not totally wrong, and Harmonia too is no longer irritated by it now.
But what is most self-evident will be carefully covered on the stage.
Where does the music begin and where does it end?
This can hit someone's nerves (?) or give fleeting moments of great joy.
Richard Gere is simply not cynical enough.
With "The Hunting Party" and "Peace Killer", two films again address the Balkan War.
But they're both not convincing.
Either the projects rely too much on action and the exchange of senseless shots or on the contrary they are too tiring.
Here, even Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party" can't help.
The good news first: certainly the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the Balkan mountains, but it is right there, in the most gloomy hinterland of the Bosnian war, that actor Richard Gere is then found.
We had finally lost sight of the most beautiful man of the 1980s, because much too many nice and futile roles in movies with feelings for women and too many press conferences on the theme of Buddhism delighted him to show off.
Today Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to watch "The Hunting Party" - when the hunter becomes the hunted one (why should today's films be as long and confused as collective agreements of locomotive drivers?)
He gives a magnificent representation full of winks: in the background, his war reporter character Simon Hunt is what Gere could have become, if the destiny and the film industry were not as benevolent: a man who has his best moments for a long time behind him, but who, even as a monument in ruins to his decline, has nevertheless kept visible remains of his former charm.
But despite this asset, "The Hunting Party" continues together with the German production "Peace Killer", which also comes out this week, the endless sequence of films missed on the Balkan War.
From "Peace Killer" one can quickly make the trial: the film speaks of two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a Serb from the Kosovar snipers, in which one of the two falls still quickly in love.
Although it is welcome that the Serbs here are not for once presented as the only causes of all evils, this flat film as a telefilm is lost far too quickly in action and exchanges of senseless shots.
This remains a kind of "Alarm for Cobra 11" without highway but with a war instead.
On the contrary, one can examine in the perfect example of "The Hunting Party", why in the background there was never a real good film about the Balkan War.
The story of the three American war reporters, who are conditioned to track down the high war criminal "the fox", could perhaps have become, with another director and another writer (both Richard Shepard) at another time a new "Apocalypse Now".
Because the stories look strikingly similar: two males go on a small team in the forest, to accomplish something that the military cannot do and for the two males, it becomes a journey into madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that we simply don't let Simon Hunt be the desert cynic with a heart, as he is presented to us at the beginning.
No, the script must also attribute a romantic adventure to her with a Bosniac later murdered.
Then "The Hunting Party" becomes definitely bad, when the reporter, in the space of the last five minutes, by an accelerated process, manages to get NATO, the CIA and all the world's bounty hunters to fail in five years: catch the war criminal and leave him for just revenge to the Bosnian Muslims.
It is so bad that the International Court of the Hague of Crime against Cinematographic Logic should be brought before it.
In this case, the film has too deep a human concern.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic are still at large, and he suspects the Americans and the French (here they must exceptionally agree) not to conduct the hunt in a rather intensive manner due to secret political agreements.
But the well-intentioned and the wicked are so similar this time that a famous Brecht poem comes to mind.
He speaks of a wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet's work table: "Compatible, I see the veins of the forehead swollen, clearly: how tiring it is to be wicked."
Movies like "The Hunting Party" have exactly such tumescent heads, but they suggest how tiring it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the kind of movies about the Balkan war.
Recently, it has been reported in this newspaper that all Hollywood films about Iraq were big flops.
One can add: there have never been good movies about South Africa before.
What's worth every time: when a star hangs around a crisis center or a minefield, he then comes out of something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Jenseits aller Grenzen" with Angelina Jolie or ""Blutdiamanten" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
It is possible that all these conflicts are still simply too close in time.
In any case, decades have always passed before Hollywood can make a good holocaust film with "Schindler's List".
Some films still have to mature - those that today are worth classic works about Vietnam "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" have in no way been celebrated unanimously in their time as masterpieces.
But maybe we know today too simply too much about the conflicts of the world, where every hecatomb comes live on two screens at the same time at home,
And that's a delight to the writers for the lack of scruples they need to tell beautiful stories.
"Being or not being" or "The dictator" have actually become as good also because Lubtisch and Chaplin did not yet know how much the Nazi regime really dominated.
Maybe you don't want to be good at making good movies.
Perhaps you should have the sarcastic and distant artistic look of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallel between his historical novel "Dictionnaire de Lempraière" and the Balkan War, he replied: "It is only because some things never change".
"The big cities will always be horribly dangerous, the men will always be murdered in a horrifying way and the war will always reign in Yugoslavia."
Von Beust is critical of the cancellation of the Olympiads.
The retreat of the mayor from Hamburg's candidacy for the Summer Olympic Games was met with virulent criticism in politics and the economy.
Many want to continue fighting for the Games by the water.
But Von Beust calls for realism in assessing opportunities.
The principal director of the Chamber of Commerce in Hamburg, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, described Wednesday an abandonment as "bad for the local economy".
Recently, no other project had deployed as many motivational forces in the city as the Olympiads' idea.
"Without this objective, the political-sport momentum could not have been maintained in the same measures."
Schmidt-Trenz invites the Senate not to bury the project, but to find it a new starting point in the longer term, "which takes another modified agenda as its starting point."
Mayor Ole von Beust remained on Wednesday in his previous statements that Hamburg's Olympic ambitions were unrealistic at least until 2028.
"It is not Hamburg that decides to apply for the Olympiads, but the German Olympic Sports Federation" said Von Beust to WELT ONLINE.
He refers to the Federation of Sports' expected decision at the beginning of December, regarding Munich's bid for the 2018 Winter Games.
This preference means for us, that in the period of time that we had planned until 2028 until then, we will have no chance."
However the dream does not belong definitively to the past, said Von Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regretted Beust's statements.
From this the impression would be given that Hamburg no longer wants to apply for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It is too early to close an opportunity, burying the projects already now," said HSB President Günter Ploß on Wednesday.
An abandonment of the candidacy would also be in contradiction with the statements of the head of the Senate on the occasion of the reception in plenary of the German Federation of Higher Schools of Sport.
There, Von Beust would have qualified Hamburg's bid at the 2015 Universiades as not "a substitute" for the Hamburg Olympics.
The Federation of Higher Sports Schools had first in the past weeks named Hamburg as a candidate city.
The mayor's SPD fraction blamed the Senate for not having used this precious time in the construction of housing in Hamburg.
"The development of the Petit Grasbrook was denied by the Senate for years because it played the Olympiads card and excluded the construction of housing," said SPD delegates Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD has always called for a plan for the Petit Grasbrook to be integrated into the Olympiads and a subsequent use of housing, the CDU would have relied exclusively on the "Event Factor".
The application for the 2012 Summer Olympic Games would have raised great enthusiasm in Hamburg.
Hamburg, however, had broken down against Leipzig.
These aren't Warhols' crates.
The one who connects the concepts Sweden and wooden case, thinks of Ikea, but not Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
At the moment, wooden boxes made in Sweden cast shadows on Warhol's list of works.
Much of the 90 Brillo-Boxes of "Type Stockholm" listed there are counterfeits.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" questioned the authenticity of the 1968 Brillo-Boxes by Andy Warhol, the internal research of the Moderna Museet in Stockholm today leads to a disenchanting result: the six "Brillo-Boxes", whose former director of the Pontus Hulten Museum gave a gift in 1995 at the Moderna Museet, are copies - as well as much of the other hundreds of Brillo-Boxen from "Type Stockholm", which circulate on the international art market.
The ancient history is intertwined, a disconcerting chain of artistic and curative productions.
In 1964, Warhol created his first "Brillo-Boxes" in New York, painted wooden boxes, which are based on the red-blue-white design of the powdered soap boxes "Brillo".
An exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museet in 1968 - with the agreement of Warhol - presented hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard: These did not come (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but had been delivered directly from the Brillo cardboard factory.
These were not works of art, but rather their models, exhibition samples.
At the same time, Warhol had given permission in 1968 to produce some Brillo wooden boxes in Sweden, which were not exposed at the Moderna Museet.
Witnesses of the time speak today of about fifteen wooden crates that at the time would have entered law into the history of art and auctions, as the original Brillo-Boxes of Andy Warhol authorized, with the name "Type Stockholm".
Some of them have reached over $100,000 in auction sales.
The problem now is that the legendary director of the Pontus Hultén Museum claimed, wrongly, later that about a hundred wooden boxes had been produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, that Warhol would then have sold them to him.
In truth, the 105 crates of Hultén were produced in Malmö only in 1990 for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By that time, Warhol had already been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, the curator-in-chief of the Moderna Museet, examined, alongside the museum's six Brillo-Boxes, three other Swedish private collections, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: their laminated panels were first printed and sanded, then applied with a brush of white oil paint.
The texture of the copies dating back to 1990 reveals, on the contrary, that the paint was directly applied to laminated panels, using a paint roll - moreover, it is not an oil painting, but an acrylic one.
"These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and should be removed from Andy Warhol's official list of Brillo Boxes," says the director of the Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not come up with another decision, the Moderna Museet will classify the six boxes in its collection as copies/exposure material."
Already in July the Authentication Board of course announced, that it would investigate the "heavy accusations" that will be raised in the case of powdered soap boxes.
But since then there has been an inexorable silence.
The rebel soldiers of Manila abandon
In the Philippines, the rebel soldiers abandoned, the same ones who had broken into a hotel in Manila, and who had demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Chief Antonio Trillanes, who blamed the President for corruption and electoral fraud, told reporters in the hotel that he could not respond to any bloodshed.
The faithful soldiers in power had just before stormed the hotel with tear gas.
The two dozen soldiers had been in the building for hours.
About half of them stood before the courts on Wednesday because of a failed attempt at putsch in 2003 - among them Trillanes.
He took advantage of the audience to suddenly overshadow himself with about 30 sympathizers.
The military police, who normally had to monitor them, apparently deserted in his favor and joined his mutiny.
They entered the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
The loyal troops in power closed the area around the respectable hotel.
The President convened an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
The National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the action of the soldiers.
"People are sick of it," Trillanes said.
"We call on people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, who was in command before the Scout Rangers' elite unit, said that other units of the army soon wanted to join the march.
The regime's critics had called for a major demonstration against the President on Wednesday.
His government has been surrounded for months by accusations of corruption.
Since 2003, Manila's financial district had already been the scene of the attempted mutiny of about 200 members of the army against Arroyo.
The insurgency broke almost 24 hours after the army refused to join.
Since 1986 there have already been at least seven attempts at putsch against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes a principal shareholder of Versatel.
United Internet has secured a stake of more than 20 percent of the Versatel telecommunications company.
The average price per share is 14.46 euros, as announced by the company on Wednesday.
Only 20.05 per cent of the share capital would be held.
We'd already speculated on a buyback.
The option would remain open to further increase participation in Versatel.
With this step we are seeking to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market, United Internet said.
Just before, suppositions had already been made on Wednesday about an entry, after the Berenberg bank increased its participation in the Düsseldorf network operator from 5 per cent to 15.1 per cent.
The credit institution would hold the money only for a third part, it is said on the market.
The previous day, United Internet had already acquired a stake of almost 10 percent in the mobile phone company Drillisch.
As part of a capital increase, Drillisch placed on the stock exchange 17.4 million new shares worth EUR 106.4 million.
United Internet bought 5.15 million euros for 31.1 million euros.
In addition, companies have opened negotiations on cooperation in the marketing of DSL products and mobile telephony.
"We are strengthening our partnership," said a United Internet spokesperson.
Both companies founded the MSP holding company to absorb the Freenet competitor.
For the time being, both companies want to be satisfied with their ten percent stake in Freenet, and not make use of their additional 18.49 percent stake in Freenet, United Internet said on Thursday.
However, the two companies would leave all options open, especially to increase participation in the SA Freenet, it was learned.
Negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership had ended in mid-October.
Freenet poker, which has lasted for months, is still difficult to predict and is part of the consolidation of the German telecoms market.
Freenet had at the end of the third quarter 2.9 million mobile customers and 1.27 million DSL customers and full subscriptions.
United Internet and Drillisch Holding had a direct stake in Freenet of 6.01 percent so far.
It was now agreed that Drillisch would provide approximately four percent more.
The right to purchase the 18.49 percent of the Vatas investment company had already been decided in August.
