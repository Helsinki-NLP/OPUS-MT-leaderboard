Parliament did not support an amendment to release Tymoshenko
The Ukrainian Parliament today rejected the proposal to repeal the amendment to the section of the Criminal Code condemning opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko.
The amendment would open the door to the release of the minister, but parliamentarians rejected the proposal to reduce penalties for economic crimes at second reading.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for the alleged signing of a disadvantageous agreement with Russia for Ukraine on the purchase of natural gas.
The judgement is not yet final, the court of appeal has an obligation to review it in December.
Tymoshenko was convinced that this was a political revenge of the regime, and even in the West doubts have arisen about the impartiality of the court.
The proposal to withdraw paragraph 365 of the Criminal Code condemning the former Prime Minister was supported by 147 deputies in the vote.
226 votes were required for approval.
Libya's Victory
The story of Libya's liberation, or of the Libyan rebellion, already has its losers.
Muammar el-Gaddafi was buried in a secret place in the desert and without him there is no more war.
It remains to be defined who is the winner
As is customary in the region, Islamists won the elections, but now it is a question of clarifying whether they are moderate or radical.
The Transitional National Council has brought into force the traditional law, Shariah, which we already know in some way.
Libya will become a country without crime, because thieves will be cut off.
Women can already forget to emancipate and apostates wait for their execution and so on.
Instead of the dictator's person, society, composed of warrior tribes, will unite by the Koran.
In Libya, an order will be established that we cannot even imagine and that we certainly cannot.
However, our way of life is neither the only nor objectively the best and probably not suitable for the Libyans already mentioned.
The truth is that it is not surprising that Islamic fighters accepted gratefully the help of unfaithful dogs.
The only justification was that, from their point of view, NATO attacks were not directed by an American general, but great is Allah, whose greatness they celebrated after each of the successful interventions.
When winners are sought in Libya, the West is not among them.
We are trapped in a shooting that is used by Islamists and our politicians to get rid of a dictator in the person of a political ally without any guarantees of profit.
After recent bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not occupy Libya militarily.
In this case, the locals do not have a problem expelling the "crossroads"
But, without occupation, will the oil companies manage to make with Libyan black gold only in good words?
It is quite possible not, but it may finally be that the West can boast of protecting human rights.
As long as the Sharia followers don't cross us.
A New Age of Crisis Begins
France and the rest of Europe go after the investor seeker
A statistical whirlwind spread across Europe
Individual States have published their GDP data for Q3.
The Czech economy in the inter-quarter period has stagnated, while France and Germany have grown.
However, the bond market today has broken records.
Investors are no longer fixed only in Italy, but also in Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of the Eurozone, Germany, the Czech Republic and other European countries have already published their preliminary estimates of economic growth in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP grew by 0.5 per cent, France's by 0.4 per cent
Both countries have released the data of the second quarter, in Germany it has improved more than expected (increase of 0.3% instead of expected 0.1%), although in France there was a slight reduction of 0.1% (the original data spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% annually in the third quarter of this year.
However, over the four-month period, gross domestic product (GDP) has stagnated and ČSÚ notes that the trend towards gradual deceleration in the growth of economic development is being shaped.
The results are even worse than the analysts' forecasts.
Main events:
Interannually, the Czech economy grew in the third quarter of this year by 1.5%, but four-monthly it has stagnated.
In the third quarter, the German economy, according to the previous data and seasonally recalculated, grew by 0.5%.
The economy of the Eurozone and also of the European Union, between July and September and compared to the previous quarter, grew by 0.2%, which is in line with analysts' expectations.
The Greek economy has fallen by 5.2% annually.
The interest of your ten-year bonds is 28.45%.
The interest of Italian and Spanish bonds has grown to critical limits.
The problem is also beginning to affect Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc.
The interests of Czech ten-year bonds remain at 4%, although in the area the situation is worsening.
In Germany, there are voices that say that the ECB should ultimately grant loans.
Czechs are classified for the Euro Cup.
They won 1:0 and celebrate the ranking with a premium of 200 million.
The football team fulfills the most difficult task of the whole season!
In Montenegro, thanks to the excellent Čech and the brilliant goalkeeper Petr Jiráček, he won by 1:0.
The Czech team, together with a good dose of luck in the second half, was fantastically defending itself from the attacks of the local team, so it will not miss the European championship date.
Ihned.cz followed in detail the development of the party in a thorough report.
There was almost no emotion in the first half and a good dose of luck in the second.
The Czech team, thanks to the collapse of the local team towards the end, and also to the excellent Čech game and the heroic Jiráček, won by 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates their pass to the European Championship.
Due to the very correct Czech defense, Montenegrins did not press until the second half.
The two injured of the party were Damjanovič and Vučinič, who let go of two great occasions.
Moreover, thanks to the great Petr Čech, the Czech eleven won't miss the European Cup date, so the national football coffers will receive a bonus of approximately 200 million kroner.
Already from the first few minutes a good offensive game was played.
Both teams were just trying to maintain the lines and played nothing else around the center of the field.
There was no pressure from local players in the first half, kicks to the other field in defense, just what the Czech defense knew to avoid.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country's nuclear program.
They formed a human shield.
Several hundred university students formed human shields around nuclear installations in Iran.
With his gesture they wish to express their support for his country's nuclear programme in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
The students began to pray on Tuesday at noon in front of the facilities and then chanted death slogans to the United States and Israel.
Several hundred university students formed on Tuesday in the Iranian city of Isfahan human shields around the nuclear technology center where they work with uranium.
They intend to demonstrate their willingness to defend their country ' s nuclear programme with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), in a recent report, found that Iran, according to all indications, is struggling to obtain nuclear weapons.
In Israel, there is talk of a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
The students began praying at noon at the nuclear facilities in Isfahan and then launched death slogans against the US and Israel.
In the event of an attack, aimed at paralysing the Iranian nuclear programme, Israeli sources said that the nuclear power station in Isfahan would not only be reached, but also the facilities in Natanz, where uranium is enriched.
Daily menu of an obese child: don't eat breakfast and dinner sausages
More than one third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 have overweight problems, where overweight affects 9 per cent of the school population and obesity affects 5 per cent.
Obese children mostly come from families with an unhealthy lifestyle, according to current research.
The importance of the environment where it grows for a healthy development of the person, as well as the models that serve as a reference, is again demonstrated.
At the table, obsessed children eat, for example, sausages at least twice as often as children in families with normal weight.
For dinner, more than 19% of obese people had had French fries the day before the analysis, which is linked to the prevention program "Obesity is not a chance".
In families of overweight children there is no practice of sports, which is applicable to most current families, where only 15 per cent of children responded that their parents, at least once a week, find time for physical exercise.
Survey of 900 children
The survey was conducted at the end of last school year and took part in almost 900 basic education children from all over the Czech Republic.
It was already the second edition of the program of "Obesity of Not a Chance", which supports the General Health Insurance Company and Unilever company.
So far, more than 12,000 children have participated in the project from the 4th to the 8th grade.
An adequate diet and plenty of exercise in the family are determining factors, which significantly reduce the number of overweight and even obese children.
"Only half of the children surveyed have responded that they have five meals per day according to the diet: breakfast, lunch, food, snack and dinner, which is one of the basic conditions for a healthy diet," reports one of the survey results.
No breakfast but with a snack for dinner
Specialists warn that, in a healthy development, they are also important details, which also count, such as having a fixed hour for family breakfast.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23% of school families have breakfast at the same time.
In most families, everyone has breakfast alone.
But the worst thing was to find out that 10% of households have nothing to eat.
Breakfast is, however, the basis of a proper daily diet.
The study shows that in the families of obese children, French fries are consumed much more frequently.
Almost all - regardless of weight - drink sweet soft drinks daily (70%).
As a rule, more than 40 per cent of the children surveyed sport, but among their parents this result is reduced to less than half, only 15 per cent.
Make Your Diet
The next phase of the study allowed the chosen boys (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to create their own diets based on all possible offers according to their tastes and opinions.
"The food preferences of Czech children between the ages of 12 and 15, from the point of view of healthy food, are far removed from the ideal."
Among its favorite foods are pasta, meat and sweets
"The popularity of sweet soft drinks is above all alarming," the final report of the study warns.
As main food you take the palm paste and follow closely the poultry meat.
Practically, children always reject the vegetable and the taste for fish and vegetables is very low.
Changing to Healthy Habits
At the same time, the study shows that children are willing to change their eating habits if they receive the right information.
"In the control group of the participants in the study, who completed the questionnaire after the end of the prevention program "Obesity is not a coincidence", in many cases an important change was made in favor of the principles of healthy eating", is pointed out in the results of the study.
It draws attention, for example, to the issue of sweet drinks, where many children would start to prefer normal and running water.
Children would also more frequently choose in the questionnaire poultry meat and fish for the main meal and would restrict the consumption of sweet food and flour products.
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, the professionals argue
In the introductory article, How stylists Learn, I complained a little bit that the initial lessons were already quite full.
I had no idea how that would go.
Lectures by three professionals in the field, how to dress up problematic characters and, in addition, a seminar on how it works in the entertainment world.
And it'll be worse.
The closer the final exams are, the more information and practical tasks await us
And although the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, there is no longer a pin.
We have once studied with the director, Alena, (in the course there is no man) on how to dress the woman who does not have a perfect symmetry.
And so is the great majority.
Someone's short, someone's got a stylized figure without the right curves and someone's overweighted.
The stylist must know how to optically soften wide shoulders, lengthen a neck or recreate the necessary curves
We've been given some tricks on how to highlight the body of Jennifer Lopez's type women, huge breasts and hips but tight waist and at the same time not dress it in a way too challenging
If, for example, the difference between the waist and hips is so much that the skirt or pants don't fit, it's worth sewing at least one piece of extra fabric to measure.
You will certainly not regret it, because the clothes you feel perfectly are priceless.
With a tailored skirt you will feel much better than with one that does not stop moving, getting up, dancing on the waist, etc.
The stylized body can be allowed to wear clothes with folds, ornaments, embroidery or drapes.
There are certainly a lot of different kinds of information and bodies, so I'm glad I have all week to put all this information in order in my head.
And even so, I fear that with the task assigned, I have more than enough.
Each participant in the course has been assigned two famous ones, to which two costumes must be designed: one for the day and the other for the night.
The current aspect, the style of fashion that suits the person in question, must be taken into account.
I've been "dressing" Miranda Kerr, maybe you know her from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
Crying from the inside, for me it is much better than, for example, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who has recently gained weight about 100 kilos (please take account of the exaggeration), or the young Selena Gómez.
We have to cut the dresses from the magazines or search them online and print them, then make them graphically.
The moodboard, which is called the complete result, also expresses our personal style and our relationship with graphic design.
It is also important to think about the graphic part of stylism.
The stylist, therefore, did not see only physically, but also dealt, for example, with the product pages in the magazines (specific topics such as trends, bags, coats, etc.).
The designer and designer Mario Kameník told us about all this.
But all of this is already on Sunday.
The stylist must have a global vision.
The three guest specialists encouraged the Saturday conference with information on all types of bodies.
Designer Honza Pokorný, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to take advantage of this.
And a good stylist knows how to work with the same garment in different ways.
Variability is, in this case, fundamental.
Thus, such a gabardine (or as they say in English, trench-coat) can be dressed in the classic with jeans and t-shirt, but it also serves to dress the naked body with heel shoes and photograph it as if it were actually a dress.
Or just roll it up and up your neck to get a completely different picture.
"Play with it," he insisted.
What I value most is the following advice: "To start working, you must first know all the rules."
"Then you can break them," Jakub said.
It is finally clear to me why we memorize all these formulas, what is combined with what, why, if it turns out that in fashion magazines we find different results.
Not to mention the parades.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I know that a stylist has to have more types of clothes on the reserve than he intends to photograph.
So, for a fashion story that has ten pages (so ten outfits), you have to have ready, ready to use, at least fifteen.
And besides that the photos the clothes work in combination with other garments, all of them different from those used in reality.
All this must be taken into account when designing the outfit.
Honza Pokorný assured us that image and style alone, in many cases, represent half of the success.
Just look at Madonna, who is not exactly an extraordinary singer, but the image and the marquetin have made her a world star.
In the Czech Republic, for the time being, there is not yet a clear tendency to use the services of stylists.
Even the famous characters also find it useless (my abilities are enough for me, my physical appearance is not so important).
And when someone asks us for our services, we have to bear in mind that it is very likely that they will tell us a size very different from their actual (minor) size.
Then there's just to guggle and find out if the heart magazines have already written on the subject, whether a certain celebrity has grown fat/adjusted, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario insisted that the stylist is not enough to focus on fashion, but has to understand outfit.
During your work, you should especially communicate with the people you saw, so it is essential to be a good psychologist.
He knows how to value people, he doesn't miss them, he defends their opinions.
"When a director hires you to classify her wardrobe and fill it with pretty clothes, you can't take and throw away everything and say, "Oh, what a horror."
"Find at least a couple of things you can think about and recommend so someone can put them on," says Mario.
He also showed us that everything should fit in the so-called "placovka", that is, the work bag.
This is fixed around the waist and you have all the necessary tools there.
They are objects such as scissors, scissors, cutapels, or unmissable. There is also nylon thread (which serves the stylist during the photo shoot of products such as bags or hats), special claws of garment hooks in front, if it is larger (the pins and other types of hooks are not allowed, as they could damage the fabric), or a sewing set.
In order not to stay in passive listening and put something into practice, we have learned to put on the sole of the shoes.
Even during photo sessions in the studio, on a flat surface, you could damage the sole and much more the exterior.
And all we did was put on and put on.
We couldn't touch our shoes with scissors so we wouldn't hurt them by accident.
So you had to be very skilled.
Mario has given me a joy in commending my work unreservedly.
I don't really get those skills very well.
This is just a small part of everything we've heard throughout the weekend, in the second part of the course.
I've already realized that professional styling is not a pink road, but I don't care exactly what people say.
In Need for Speed: The Run competes all over America.
Review
A trip, in principle carefree, is complicated by a series of improper carelessness of a routine trip during tomorrow's shift.
To some extent, the expectations were met, but this is of no use, if, in fact, nothing extraordinary was meant to be done.
The new delivery, to which the title is added The Run, raised high expectations already before its premiere.
I promised that I would give new air to the old Need for Speed racing saga and, as a result of what I showed, it appears as a game that should not end up being a genre of action again without more.
We are also curious to know how the scenes would remain inserted, where the main character descends from the car and walks on his own foot.
As is often the case in the NFS series, the results do not vary greatly from what we expected.
There are races that can be considered acceptable, but in the total calculation points are lost due to absurd failures, which have already appeared in the series for years.
In fact, mistakes cannot be called mistakes, but rather the incomprehensible misdemeanour of programmers.
The adventure begins very well.
You are introduced into a story, whose protagonist, Jack, has certain personal problems; to solve them, you are offered to participate in an illegal race throughout America.
You sit behind the wheel on the west coast, in San Francisco, and your mission is to get the first to New York.
The idea is to offer something interesting.
The route is divided into ten stages and then more than fifty races.
It follows that each race takes place on a different route and the stages are located in different environments, which are quite diverse and interesting.
In this way, one does not even remotely have the feeling that the game always offers the same.
Some of the environments are even pleasant to see, although the technical level of the graph is equivalent to that of previous deliveries of the series.
Therefore, it is nothing of the other world.
But the walk through the desert, the autumn landscape or the high snow-covered mountains produce a very pleasant visual effect.
In addition, races are diversified from time to time by an atypical element.
Thus, for example, in the desert you find yourself a sandstorm that reduces visibility.
Instead, in the mountains you have to be careful not to bury an avalanche.
According to that, each of the races is very well developed.
There's only a couple of models, but that's enough.
For a moment, you try to advance a number of required rivals (normally in a classic race), then you try to buy time (chronographed classic duel) and then a duel awaits you against a single opponent.
In the midst of all this sometimes the police appear, which only makes things even more difficult.
The novelty is the landscapes outside the car.
Interactive animations are presented when Jack, in most cases, has to escape from someone and you have to help him, always pressing the button right at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are quite fewer landscapes in the game than could be expected (in particular there are only three).
But the final result is positive, because this element does not become annoying and, in the context already mentioned, is one of the elements that make the game more interesting.
The driving model follows the footprints of the previous episodes.
That means that today is no longer a big deal, but it cannot be said to be bad.
If you're looking for a realistic simulation, you can look somewhere else.
But a race conceived with a lot of action suits this style of driving, although we can find something better among the games of the competition.
So far, all in order.
But problems arise after a certain time.
Unlike the correct driving models, the same is no longer true of collisions.
Of such games you can not expect it to recreate deformations and complicated collisions, but in fact before a blow against any object, you cannot predict how your car will react, with which not everything is in order.
It is typical that, by making a very tight advance or running the car with a normal traffic, there are only light rocks, but in other almost identical situations, your car ends up doing uncontrolled pirouettes.
Or even ends up totally destroyed.
Thanks to the reset system, no big problems arise, but it can put you in a bad mood.
Resets are programmed in such a way that when you suffer an accident or get off the track, the game returns you to the last rescue point on the track.
However, only five resets are available for each race.
If you consume them all, you have to restart the race from the beginning.
So it is only a help in case something goes wrong, but it is not very reliable.
Sometimes, even reset helps, it only helps to learn the given stage of memory.
A great disadvantage of the game is that the same facts are repeated in different places.
In some curves, for example, it is necessary to enter in a specific way; otherwise, they are impossible to take.
Other times you find yourself somewhere "civil" vehicles always with the same configuration, even if you are the first, fifth or arrive five minutes before or after.
This makes you gloat especially in situations, when you see that two cars that go to meet in opposite directions, your opponent advances without problems, but when you arrive, you have to turn or stop.
It is the same when you arrive, because it is programmed because the "surprise" will always happen in front of your noses.
The adversaries also have one more advantage.
Throughout the game you will arrive at places where, regardless of the moment, the same opponent will always advance you to the same site.
This also happens at the end of the game, on a long bridge, which is even more shocking.
Your opponent must arrive before you, at any price.
When it goes in front of you, it makes it difficult for you to see the cars coming from the front, so at first you can make the car tickle.
You can understand the idea of creating a game with maximum doses of suspense and adrenaline, but the execution is so apparent that it will surely disappoint you right away.
And it's a shame, because even though the model of the trip is simple, the game is fun and with action, so it's often not possible to follow in detail what happens or where.
And it really doesn't matter, if the merit is taken the idea with fifty exclusive clues or the classification in the race so that it doesn't fit boredom, or anything else.
An unusual idea is the change of cars during the races.
You have to pay attention to the gas suppliers next to the road, because right there you have to change cars, although in the vast majority of cases you will have enough of what you have.
The cars are divided into three categories.
Sports are suitable for urban areas, strong American cars for straight motorways and exotic supersports for technical driving, for example, on mountain roads with bends.
In addition, the main narrative thread also appears a thread of parallel challenges, that is, there are races in specific places that you will know by the stories.
Here you will get not only medals, but also points of experience for your profile, which serves both challenges and stories.
When reaching the top level, the driver opens up several possibilities, starting with the car and ending with funds for the profile.
At the same time, an online Autolog feature is connected, which compares your results with those of other players and provides other community functions.
One of the most difficult elements to understand is how the last race in history is made.
With the car you reach the metro tunnel (pass), where you run dark down the tracks (pass).
The speedometer marks you between 150 and 200 km/h (pass) and, suddenly, from behind you arrive the convoy of the metro and you are taken forward without more.
In the writing we will surely have a discussion about this for several days, about whether during the programming of the game no one even thought a little or whether the authors really take us for a panda of fools.
The technical part of the game is nothing extraordinary, but at least the general visual effects result in most pleasant cases, sometimes even superb.
It is a pity that, in the most tense moments, image quality is reduced and sometimes in a serious way.
This mainly affects accidents where many participants are involved, when the continuous image quality is no longer valid.
The audio is fine and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In order to please most of the youth group, the soundtrack belongs to the category "each of their father and mother", but it can be assumed that no one would buy the game only for their music.
The final feeling of Need for Speed: The Run is thus quite confusing.
If the game avoided absolutely silly mistakes, we would have trouble affirming that The Run is the best NFS game in recent years.
It gives the feeling that the game is not over.
Fun is assured, but be prepared because mistakes will strike you in the eyes with the force of airport reflectors.

The Ambassador to the EU, Vice-Nová:
Czechs have a reputation for negativists and Eurosceptics.
"The Lisbon Treaty has significantly affected the balance between individual institutions"
"I wasn't expecting a war without a barracks."
"It will last five, six years, before the situation stabilizes a little, calms down and new players get used to their new roles," Czech ambassador to the EU, Milena Vicenová, began her conference at the Faculty of Law.
How can we not take seriously its slogan "clearly and openly about Europe", which he said at the first part of his conference, when he was able to describe each EU body and its relations with such precision and clarity, as it would be the envy of many speakers of the U. Carolina Faculty of Law.
Vicenová also discussed the work of the new permanent President of the European Council, Herman van Rompuy:
"First the criticisms arise, that if it is insulted, a grey official, able to assume any role, but I must say that it left everyone bewildered, because it assumes its roles perfectly."
"He is a man who knows how to listen to the members of the 27 states, communicate with them and has a very clear vision of where the EU should go."
The new post of Foreign Policy and Security Representative is explained from the question: "Who is this EU? What number can I call it?" It is therefore an important step towards the unification and clarification of political union in the face of states such as China or India.
Nobody wants to ban us on Olomouc's cheese.
Vice-Nová has also taken care of the agenda continued, continues and will follow the European Council in the near future.
The Czech presidency of two years ago was a success.
The Czechs dealt with the emerging economic crisis, resolved the gas crisis and organized a summit for the Eastern Partnership.
The fall of the government at that time was identified as a very negative aspect, which seriously affected the Czech Republic.
Czech representation in the EU currently has many commitments.
In the words of the ambassador: "a good stir", not only the presidency, but also the financial crisis, which is now being dealt with.
On the other hand, the EU's seven-year budget, caused by the current, much more complicated economic situation, must be approved.
If the budget is simpler and more effective, which sectors will have priority, which countries will receive more support and which less? That is something that will be present on the agenda of the next meeting.
The ambassador also recalled her main slogans, with which she arrived in Europe: "About Europe clearly".
"The truth is that I don't like ugly abbreviations, alienisms or jargons that people don't understand."
"How can a citizen understand that in Brussels cucumbers are not really invented curved or round cucumbers, bananas of various sizes or that no one is going to ban us from Olomouc cheese?"
It also aims to take more advantage of the EU's environment and bring more Czech citizens closer to the European institutions.
The Europe of Speeds is waiting for us
According to the ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation for Eurosceptics and people perceive the negative rather than the positive aspects.
He also regretted the low participation of Czechs in the European institutions.
The fault lies in many factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivational messages, but also the little support of the Czechs.
In addition to the success of the Czech Presidency, he highlighted the strength and collaboration of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me that when a Polish and a Hungarian come to me and a Slovak comes to me, a Frenchman next to me says, "What have you left, those of the Visegrad Group?", and you can see that it doesn't make him any grace."
In the future, the EU, according to Vice-Nová, is awaiting tough new budgetary policy rules for the Member States.
It is perceived as something very real of the concept of the two speeds, if not more, in Europe, than the new one of the "European Federation".
"We have countries in the Eurozone and countries outside the Eurozone."
"We have the Schengen area and we also have the enhanced cooperation procedure."
"It was said for the first time that only countries that want to cooperate and those that do not cooperate should remain out."
"These procedures will be increasingly and will strengthen the Europe of both speeds," Vicenová is expected.
In this regard, he also stressed the role of the Czech Republic and Herman van Rompuy in implementing the principle that all issues affecting the whole of the EU should be discussed among the Member States, not only among the members of the Eurozone.
Brand story:
The innovative IBM begins its second century of existence
If someone were looking for a term that defined IBM's strategy with great precision, the closest one would be "long term".
For the general public, IBM is the symbol of a technological revolution, a company that is perceived as current and, however, a hundred years have passed since its foundation.
The foundation of this long-term character was laid by the first head of the firm, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He already coined the motto that many problems in the world have a solution if people are willing to think.
His motto "Think!" became his seal, around which the life of the giant future will be built (it was also the title of an internal magazine that IBM began publishing in 1935).
Watson was also the basis of a carefully raised corporate culture.
"For us, IBM implies a long-term thought, a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM has survived and prospered for a hundred years for that reason, because it remained faithful to its basic principles, but without fearing the changes around.
This has allowed us, during our first century, to transform technology, business and society.
We hope to prosper even more in our second century," said Samuel J. Palmisano's current director during his anniversary.
A sophisticated system
Watson, already in the 1930s, cared about the care of his employees such as the businessman of Baoya in Chechnya (IBM employees were among the first American operators who enjoyed paid vacations, insurance, elegant uniforms and a sophisticated pay system that rewarded the best inventors and sellers.
The same long-term sophistication maintains IBM's relationship with the customer.
Already from the beginning the company was able to discover talents (as one of the world's first companies to end any kind of discrimination, it could choose without problems).
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy is IBM's current plan, whereby Palmisano will be replaced next year by a woman: Virginia Rometty.
She has already worked for thirty years at IBM, where she has been head of sales, marketing and strategies.
Over the past few years, IBM has participated in so-called virtual meetings, a rain of online ideas, from which countless future strategies and innovations emerge.
It is not surprising that ideas arise, as almost half a million people work in the firm.
An institution with a good reputation
The fixed position in the business provides the company with a strong internal and external image.
"From the beginning, IBM maintained a concept of institution rather than technological enterprise," says Harvard Business School's economist professor and author of the book on IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that tries to solve business problems for technology users," George Colony of Forrester Research's consultant pointed out.
As the company itself says there is a difference between entering the business and creating a business directly.
IBM - or the "Great Green" - as it is known in the U.S. familiarly because of its logo, has become in the last hundred years one of the largest companies in the world.
It is possibly the most versatile technology company (develops both equipment and software, infrastructure and web hosting services within a wide range of services ranging from servers to nanotechnology).
It holds the highest number of patents of all American technology companies and five of its employees have received the Nobel Prize.
Among its inventions are the ATM, payment cards, financial swaps, barcodes and floppies.
IBM will bill $220 billion this year. This year it has become the second technology firm for market capitalization (the first is Apple), when it first surpassed Microsoft in 1996.
Looking to the Future
Not all products and innovations have just satisfied the customers' taste and timing (IBM did not bet on its own operating system, OS/2, Prodigy online services or PCjr IBM computers).
"If your business is based on moving forward, it cannot be emotionally anchored in the past," recognized Samuel J. Palmisano.
That's why IBM has no problem building its bases on other platforms (and also, if they don't work, abandon them).
And that's the difference in competition, Microsoft, which basically stays and always falls exclusively with Windows.
Future technology
In terms of sales, IBM is mainly engaged in services, of which approximately one-fifth are in programmes and one-fifth are in equipment.
However, even in 1990 the teams accounted for more than half of the supplier's share.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-yielding assets for a total value of $15 billion. During the same period, it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of future technology.
Investments have continued since 2008, when the modern global financial crisis first manifested itself.
IBM acts according to the premises of its first boss, Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis of 29th increased investments.
It seems that so far the IBM company has managed to cope with the crisis.
The value of IBM's shares since the beginning of 2008 has grown stratospherically up to 120%, the net profit of the company has not stopped increasing.
IBM's currency is to change everything except its value.
It can therefore be expected that when the next crisis comes, this flexible giant will endure.
History of IBM: from the cheese cutter to space flights
The company IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago, being its original name Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM is already adopted in 1924 - originally it was a brand used in the branches of Canada and South America.
The foundation that gave rise to the birth of IBM comes from the merger of four companies dating back to the 1880s.
It had inventions such as the famous "log-in clock", which allows to control the entry and exit of employees.
The architect of the new company was businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who also chaired his supervisory council until 1930.
Flint told the head of a competition company, Thomas J. Watson, to help him with the management of the company.
The new leader overshadowed the founder of IBM (Watson's ideas remain the firm foundation on which corporate culture and identity are based).
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name indicates, started with the production and sale of all kinds of business appliances, from meat and cheese cutters to cash registers.
During the first four years that Watson led the company, billing doubled by $9 million and began the company's large expansion across the continents.
Watson was so crucial to the company that, almost forty years after occupying the chief's chair, he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s IBM staff and computers helped NASA guide flights to space (to Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the famous flight to the Moon).
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first generation of computers, the IBM System/360 series.
The classic "fishes", which established the computer standard of that time, came to the market under the name of IBM 5150 in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, which, for its part, acquired the consulting part of the company Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began to offer complete advice and services of high added value.
The strategy that IBM has paid for over the past three years is the Smarter Planet concept, that is, "a smarter planet."
Its aim is to make more rational use of technology, although the areas have not yet been planned and circumstances, for example in the area of transport and city administration, have not improved.
For the trade sector, IBM not long ago introduced the "Smart Commerce" platform that allows retailers to manage the full business cycle.
IBM has a long history in this country.
Already in 1932 it opened a branch in Czechoslovakia at the time, the first country to have it in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM ČR also operates the strategic outsourcing centre in Brno.
The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe is in Prague. Also here is a world-famous research team working with voice recognition.
Rychtářová about her unfaithful husband:
Iveta, stay with that donkey, I don't want him anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) said it's over!
After her husband Josef Rychtář (53) had become the sole protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), but also her lover, Darina continued to hope that Josef would wake up from his pink dream and return home.
However, it will no longer wait and has established clear rules for life in the future.
"Pepe can come home, but no longer as my partner," Rychtářová explained.
When Darina Rychtářová welcomed Bartošové to her home during the summer, she could not imagine how her marriage would end.
Despite the request, Iveta hadn't moved thirty days after Ičany and Pepe didn't abandon the singer.
He even publicly declared that he loved her.
In time, Darina resigned, apparently accepted her husband's relationship and even said goodbye to him forever.
Rychytář doesn't care who his wife sleeps with.
If Rychtář broke up with Bartošová one day, his wife would not wait for him at home with open arms.
He is the biological father of my children and, if he wants to live the rest of his life in our house, no one will throw him out."
"But here I would live no longer as my dear old drunkard who was wrong, but as a man to whom certain bonds bind me," Rychtářová said and added that he had already disengaged from her husband and insisted only on mutual respect.
Josef so far doesn't care if he's a woman who's locked the back door.
"I accept my wife's decision."
"I'll be with Iveta and there's no change."
"My wife established this as a marriage on paper and I respect it."
"The company is still in place, I make the house arrangements, I take care of the garden, the home, I make the shopping."
"Darina and I talked normally, the only thing is that we don't share a bed," Rychtář said.
If Rychtářová found a new love, he would not oppose it.
"We don't sleep together and I don't care where she goes or if she has a boyfriend.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I assume all responsibility," ends Josef.
Women's worst vices: Do they also refer to you?
If you ask men to be able to quote some typical vices of women, in general each of them will name them without thinking.
Dear women, do you recognize yourselves in the following lines, where certain female vices are cited that make men boil blood?
Go shopping
Do you blame your half-orange for being dependent on purchases?
Do you have to buy at least one trapite a week?
Do you like to buy on sale often?
Then in your case you can say that shopping has become a vice.
Some women realize that they should appease their passion for shopping, at least a little.
But to see, what woman could resist the temptation to simply walk through the clothing stores, look for tight clothes and then try them all on the tester (ideally in all different colors)?
Although for most women shopping is a hobby, for men it can almost become hell.
Just remember how many times you've already told your partner to better wait for you in front of the door.
Constant Dissatisfaction
"Am I not too fat?"
"I'd need to lose at least five kilos - should I start exercising?"
"Do you really like me?"
Don't these phrases ring a bell?
Are you sure?
So she's one of those women who's obsessed with her looks.
It's not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but many men are allergic to listening to your partner complain all the time about their physical appearance.
Strong sex also agrees that the more the frequency of complaints increases, the more annoying women become.
Order and cleaning in the first place
It's like an infinite tiovivo.
Clean the windows, pass the vacuum cleaner, scrub the floor, remove the dust, scrub the bathtub and all that at least twice a week.
Do you blame your partner for stepping on the clean floor with a dirty foot, your children who dirtyed a freshly cleaned washbasin and a shelf with glass doors that cost you so much to clean?
In case you suffer from this "difference", try to be aware that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and cleanliness should certainly not be of paramount importance to the family.
This harmless desire for cleansing could threaten your relationships and family well-being.
Make unpleasant comments
"The used underpants are left with dirty clothes."
"You want to wear those socks tomorrow too"
"The wet rag is not left on the floor!"
If you make those cometaries to your partner more times a day, know that this will get you out of your boxes.
Of course. You don't mean anything bad, you just want to get everything in order.
Perhaps, if men knew this, women, for their part, would not make so many comments.
Calumnies and gossip
Some women also have slanders, gossips, but also offenses and conspiracy against someone.
Women focus on relationships, so they like to talk to each other about things like who, where, with whom, how and why.
Maybe each one of us sometimes misses a little harmless gossip.
With your hand in your heart, this is typical of almost all women.
On the other hand, there are gossipy women who don't control themselves, who love to gossip and often do, who despise everyone and are dangerous to those around them, especially in a women's work team.
Jágr and Voráček helped with their assistance to defeat Philadelphia
Hockey forward Jaromír Jágr participated on Monday in the NHL meeting with two assists that brought victory over Philadelphia 5:3 in the Carolina court and put Czech players back at the forefront of the competition.
In both cases Claude Giroux took advantage of the 39-year-old star's play, and took one step further and was declared the best player in the game.
Two assists were awarded in the party as well as Jágr's partner, Jakub Voráček.
After the meeting, Jágr stated to the overseas journalists that Giroux had predicted a great night.
"I told him before the game I'd triplet."
"I was in it."
"Sometimes they seem ambushed," Jágr explained, after his performance gave Giroux a goal, following the first leg of the Flyers.
A while later, the team's second intervention also had a Czech track.
Voráček made the album behind the Hurricanes' gate and moved it between the circles to Maxim Talbot, who scored a goal.
A second before the first break a local player, Patrick Dwyer, was expelled, but from the beginning of the second part the Flyers were already dominated.
Specifically for Giroux.
After collaborating with Jágr, he scored the third goal, after his shot slid through Wayne Simmonds's door room.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't mean to say he's the best player on the field, but he's definitely among the top three," Jágr said to his head office.
"It would never have occurred to me that at the end of my career I was going to play with a sportsman like him."
"I'm very satisfied with it."
"I want to play for him."
All these years at the NHL, my colleagues played for me, and that now produces results," adds Jágr.
Carolina still turned the game into a drama, with the goal of Tuom Ruutu and then again of Dwyer, of penalty, until he got to a goal away.
Matt Read did not allow any more complications, although they ended up outnumbering two to one.
"Pronger had a good performance in our field."
"He cleared the disk, I took speed and Read went to the farthest part."
"I tried to tie him to the record and I'm happy because I got it," described Voráček the last goal of the game as he lived it.
With his victory, Philadelphia has put itself at the head of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal, Jaroslav Špaček, did not play until the end of the match against Buffalo, in the second third he withdrew for an injury to the upper body.
The Canadiens lost not only a player with a lot of experience in defense, but also by a difference of two goals, 2:3.
Tomáš Plekanec could not take advantage of one of the shots.
More than the points lost to the local coach regretted the large number of injured in the last row, and play the game only with five defenses.
"That's bad."
"We played the game with only one veteran player, the rest were novels."
"Finally, but nothing can be done about it, we have to deal with it," Jacques Martin said.
"So much rotating the players turned against us, we couldn't resist it."
"We had to simplify the game even more, get the record out of our field."
"And so we left holes," explained one of the defenses, P.K. Subban.
Porter Ondřej Pavelec contributed thirty Winnipeg interventions in the 5:2 victory over the Tampa Bay.
The goals of Jets were scored by five players who ended a series of defeats that already lasted five games.
How travel prices have evolved since 1989
Until 1989 there were only five authorized state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
Travel agencies at that time were in most cases selling trips only to the socialist bloc, as trips to the West were very restricted.
Czech tourists therefore went on holiday to the beaches of the GDR (German Democratic Republic), the Soviet Union, (Sochi in Crimea in the Black Sea) Bulgaria and Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A positive exception was the period between 1962 and 1972, when one could travel to Yugoslavia, however, after the Yugoslav regime leaned westward and the travels of Czech tourists were then quite restricted.
A great paradox of socialism was the fact that the citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. also the Czechoslovaks) were not allowed to travel freely and individually even to socialist countries.
If a citizen wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter, if not, the individual trip was not possible.
Travel agencies also offered in those times trips to the West, but one had to put in line with a sleeping bag and spend the whole night, or have "good acquaintances" in the agency.
Still, it wasn't all won.
The so-called "promise of change" that was the condition for travel to the West, was not granted to the "politically unreliable people", who thus could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely convertible currency and, without a guarantee of exchange, it was not possible to obtain the resources (the western currency) to travel to the West.
The vast majority of Czechs spent their holidays in their own country, so there were a large number of cottages and summer houses, which the Czechs bought. This custom still persists.
The Czechs' way of travelling has undergone a real revolution since 1989.
While until 1989 for us it was no longer going to spend the holidays in the GDR or Bulgaria, last year the Czechs made 4.5 million holiday trips to countries all over the world.
There is no great paradox, of which we are no longer aware today, the fact that Croatia, the currently favourite destination, until 1989, could not travel freely, because it was part of Yugoslavia at the time.
In the early 1990s, visa waivers were imposed to travel to neighbouring Western European States, resulting in a huge wave of short-term visits, especially to Vienna or Germany.
The Czechoslovaks, for a long time, did not see enough of the excursions to the West, everyone wanted to see it at least for a moment.
For example, in Paris Czech groups slept in the parks in tents, as our income at the time did not allow us to pay a hotel or a pension.
A typical characteristic of the Czechs of that time was to take with them food (conservatives, sausages, etc.) to save.
Another important moment was the introduction of the convertibility of the Czech crown, so our tourists could finally, after decades, buy free Western currency.
Our standard of living increased and with it also average wages, which around 1997 led to an increase in the demand for travel.
With the increase in travel demand, the agencies began to prepare travel regularly from 1997 on, using charter flights connections, which caused travel prices to drop incredibly compared to the past, thanks to the possibility of obtaining discounts for the volume of passengers.
By the end of the 90th century, Czechs were travelling without a visa to almost all developed countries, except the US, which further simplified our travel.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary tourism happened as early as 2000, when it was organized, thanks to a huge demand, the first direct flight from the Czech Republic to an exotic country, and went to Thailand.
From that year, direct charter flights with Czech tourists depart every year to distant and warm countries. This winter will already fly directly from Czech Republic to 12 exotic destinations.
The exotic countries are currently visiting close to 100,000 Czechs a year.
Another interesting moment of this time, which symbolizes our post-revolutionary development, came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the US eliminated visas for Czech tourists, making our country one of the most developed countries in the world.
In 2008, Czechs, for the first time in their history, have spent more than half of their holiday abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history, have spent more than 15,000 Czech kroner per head on trips abroad, including expenses on the stay site.
Ordinary General Assembly convened to elect the president, who could end up in a standstill again.
For almost five months Czech football has been without a president and it is likely that Ivan Hašek's successor as President of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR), will not be known even after the convening of the next Extraordinary General Assembly that will take place this Thursday in Nymburk.
In fact, no agreement has yet been reached on the voting rules to be followed.
Without them, one cannot even vote to choose from among the three candidates.
Those interested in chairing Czech football are Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
Hašek resigned his post in June not without first summoning his colleagues for the purpose of finding a strong person who would know how to handle football in the future.
However, after the conclusion of the Hašek era, a dispute arose between the two federations of the association unable to reach an agreement to choose a common candidate.
This became evident on 16 September when the new president had to be elected.
Delegates of the General Assembly met in vain at the National House (Národní dům), located in the Praguen district of Smíchov, because the talks had been blocked and not only as regards the method of election.
No consensus was reached on who in the General Assembly had the right to vote - only legal representatives or also delegates with full powers.
From that moment on, and because of this single point, a partial agreement was reached, supported also by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, according to which representation by full powers is not possible.
However, disputes over the electoral code remain open.
More light on the situation could no longer be shed by the Executive Committee which, in its ordinary or extraordinary meetings, basically did not resolve anything.
The opinion on the possibility of voting has changed a couple of times already, but the nerve point remains the same.
The question is: how to proceed in the third round to avoid the impasse?
"The dispute revolves around whether to proceed according to the statutes or find another model," says Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice presidents of FAČR, who, from the leadership of the association, represents professional football.
According to the model proposed in the statutes, in the third round will win the candidate with the highest percentage of support in the federation to which he will submit his candidacy.
The Moravian Region is ready to reach a compromise so that it can win that candidate with a higher total percentage of votes in both federations.
The bohemian side, however, imposes the condition that the winner, according to these percentage calculations, should have a majority of at least two thirds.
"This would, however, take away the meaning of the two previous rounds and completely deny the concept of a bicameral system", is how Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian party, according to which it would be best not to touch the order and vote according to the applicable statutes.
Surprisingly, he also agreed with Tomaš Paclík, although the electoral regulations established by the statutes of all candidates were supposed to be better suited to Pelta.
"I would like to see a maximum vote in accordance with the statutes."
"So that no nonsense is invented about representatives like the last General Assembly," says Victoria Plzen's owner, who runs for the first time as a candidate and leads his remarks mainly against Pelta.
Pelta is still optimistic.
According to him, Nymburk will decide on the new president and he believes that the candidates in the future will cooperate constructively.
"All passions will calm down with today's party of our national team in the European Championship.
"Football will be a major player again, and it will be more cooperative," says the representative of Jablonice, who out of the three candidates has more experience in football management, both professionally and regionally.
Rajchl is the most reluctant.
"I hope that agreement will be reached, but, unfortunately, the situation is much more complicated."
"It's not about the conflict between Bohemians and Moravians, but there are attempts to adjust the rules to their own convenience."
"This may result in a further blockade of the General Assembly."
"However, I hope that common sense will be imposed," Rajchl said.
There is not much time left for all parties to reach an agreement.
Some negotiations had to take place in Montenegro, but who can know until the game starts if the football team is complete?
The special plane, in which they had to travel to Podgorica, among others the vice presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, did not leave this morning due to technical problems in Prague, having to look for an alternative to transport part of the executive committee to the place where the classification party will take place.
Perhaps the decisive meeting, at last, could be the one that will take place at ministerial level, which they say will be held this Wednesday.
Josef Dobeš, Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, would very much like to incorporate the divided parties into the most powerful sports organization in the country to reach an agreement.
There is a lot at stake: state subsidies, the credibility of football and also the forthcoming General Assembly of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Sports Federation (ČSTV) which will try to give a new direction to Czech sport following the financial problems of the Sazka lottery house.
Paclík will fight to reach the presidency, because he does not find a more suitable candidate.
If the head of the Pilsen footballers, Tomaš Paclik, before the extraordinary General Assembly knew the name of a suitable candidate who would satisfy all his ideas about the new president of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR), he would not stand as a candidate for such a relevant position.
"If there was a suitable person, I would be fighting for it and not running for election."
"But to this day it has not been possible to find such a person," Paclík said for the Czech News Agency (ČTK)
What motivates Paclík to enter the challenge with Miroslav Pelta and Henry Rajchl is exactly the possibility of blocking Pelta, the supposed winner of the elections, who opens the way to the presidency of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR).
Paclík also points out that, should he win, he would remain in the office of president only until 2013, when the ordinary general assembly came to office.
In that position he would like to see an expert and good manager who is not too closely related to football events.
"I've already talked to some people I could take into account."
"For me it was crazy to hear some say that at the moment they don't even want to identify with Czech football."
"I'd like to change that vision," she adds.
What is supposedly most disturbing to Paclík at this time is Pelta's relationship with the President of the Regional Football Association of Pilsen Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial past, known outside the world as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the voting of delegates in the general assembly.
For Paclík it's so unacceptable to see Pelta sitting on the presidential chair.
"In case he wins, he will keep his status and nothing in football will change."
"With the support of Berbra, an ambitious businessman, football will benefit even less," Paclík said.
He also mentions the fact that a few years ago Pelta's name was associated with a phone call during the investigation of a corruption case, from which Pelta came out unpunished.
"I don't know what prestige football could bring Pelta's victory."
"And with what eyes will UEFA and FIFA look at us," Paclík said, who also takes with some caution his previous statement that "would sell Club Pilsen if Pelta becomes president."
In the event of winning Thursday's election, Paclík could consider cooperation with Pelta in the future.
It is the same view that the other candidate, Rajchl, has been supported by Paclík before the September General Assembly, which ended in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first to follow."
"He's very capable."
"I could imagine, for example, as head of the show."
"but not as an association manager."
"I also don't stick my nose where I don't feel capable," added Paclík, who in September attracted much attention to support the suspension of the Arbitration Commission chaired by Ludek Macel, then replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
Paclík admits that he would dare to manage the association.
He resorts to his management skills of private companies, since last summer he is also the Director of Pilsen, who with his support celebrated in May the triumph in the first division.
"I have the strength to change some things in the football field and contribute to their safe practice."
"To reduce the influence of some pressure groups, which probably tend to influence the decisions of the disciplinary and appeal committee, producing unpleasant situations, Paclík said without hiding his antipathy towards the president of Sparta Daniel Křetínský.
One of the priorities would also be to consolidate the relationship between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which it exerted pressure on political leaders to spend more money on the sports of lottery taxes.
"It's one of the key problems the new president should be dedicated to."
"If taxes on gambling were increased, as the political parties have announced, I would support their arguments, but, frankly, they have to tell us where all this money is going," he says.
Moreover, Paclík now does not even take into account his association with Club Pilsner, although he himself claims that the President of the FAČR should be "non-partisan".
Pelta is in turn associated with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla of Prague.
"It's not ideal."
"But I don't see any point in hypocritically ceding my actions from the Pilsen Club to someone else and then going back there after a year and a half," Paclík said.
Pelta promised FAČR new statutes that would put an end to the deadlock in the elections.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association one of the presidential candidates, Miroslav Pelt, promised that, should he be elected, he would ensure that the FAČR had new statutes that would serve definitively to resolve, in the future, disputes over the electoral regulations.
The representative of Jablonec is optimistic about this Thursday's meeting in Nymburk, and believes that the pre-election conflict could move towards a solution today with the possible victory of the football team.
Already before the elections not held in September, Pelta promised to focus, if elected, precisely on representation and fund-raising.
He decided to participate in the last minute of the last general assembly, so this two-month postponement could go well to defend and present, in a broader context, his ideas on football management.
"People at all levels have been in charge of football for a long time and hope to meet the new President this Thursday."
"They feel the time has come for someone to run the association," thinks the man who is mainly associated with the Club de Jablonice, but who worked in Sparta and the Association's executive committee.
For this reason, he believes he has enough experience to manage Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the elections lies the euphoria that prevailed in Ivan Hašek's time.
"Unfortunately, the June General Assembly adopted the statutes that were not as perfect as everyone thought."
"If we exclude certain interpretations, we have a president since September," Pelta warned.
Exactly the readaptation of the most important document of the Civic Association was used as a lure to win the delegates.
"If I'm elected president, I'll take it as a personal challenge and I'm willing to answer in case this fails."
"It is a matter of principles, without which we cannot exist," says Pelta.
Also, in theory, he tries not to mess with his opponents.
Already in the past he had warned that he was collaborating with Henry Rajchl, whom he respected for his training in law, being aware that his opponent would also be his first vice president.
It's been a long time since Thomas Paclík was attacked, who, unlike Pelta, left no puppet head.
"He's been in the football world for over a year, and he's already achieved some successes."
"His attacks but were embarrassing and many people were surprised by the election campaign."
"That's why many of them doubt their true character," he told his opponent Pelta, who remains faithful to the statements announced as early as September.
His most powerful weapon is, according to him, his knowledge of football, from the lowest competitions to the highest.
The latter should be a football promotion showcase.
"Also, I would try to solve all the scandals that arose because of the Bohemians as a result of last year's corruption scandal."
"I would immediately be involved in negotiations with the public and private sectors, to ensure that there is enough money for all football," the 46-year-old candidate told ČTK two months ago.
He then also promised that his appointment as president of football would not entail any personal modification of the staff.
"I would have to know each employee's tasks first," he said, referring to Strahov where, after a long period of anarchy, there is an understandable nervousness.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that are predicted at the next general assembly, he believes that delegates will not travel in vain this Thursday to Nymburk.
"If the only point of disagreement is how to vote in the third round, we will certainly be able to overcome it.
"Football needs credibility, which will only recover if it finally has a leader," still two days before the most decisive day in his representative career, Pelta remains optimistic.
Rajchl promises, that under his leadership, the FAČR would start working eagerly.
If current Vice President Jindrich Rajchl is elected as the new president of the Czech Football Association at the Fourth General Assembly, many people would surely be resentful.
Rajchl promises that, should he be elected, he would work hard.
It wants to implement a systematic change and make the members of the executive committee responsible for each area of football individually.
It is also committed to resolving the Bohemian case, improving relations with UEFA and FIFA, getting more money for football and continuing the work initiated by former President Ivan Hašek.
"As president, I would like to devote myself completely to football."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to selection, through professional football or the training of young high-performance footballers."
"With this I don't mean to say that I would do it all alone," Rajchl said in an interview for ČTK.
"I am a team player and I want to divide the executive committee's competencies so that each member can devote himself to a specific area."
"And I will assign difficult tasks so that football can, in each of these segments, move forward with a lot of momentum."
"Many people will probably not like this, because it will mean starting to work very hard and not just criticizing the work of others," he added.
Due to the atmosphere of criticism in the football movement, it is said that it has considered the possibility of not running again as a candidate.
"Everybody knows, I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that this will make sense and that there will be no people behind me who will stop me and hinder me at every step," he explained the reasons for his indecision.
"Many people have told me that I should not give up because then others would also give up."
"It's about having faith not to give up like this, just like that," he said.
According to them, it also motivates him to continue the work that has already begun with Hašek.
"During those two years, a large part of the work that I don't want to lose now is over."
"There are processes that had begun and that will have their effect within a couple of years and I would not like anyone to stop them," he said concerned that if they chose the other candidate, Miroslav Pelta, the situation in the association could be back as it was before Hašek's time.
"I believe in order, and it is something that, in my opinion, Mirek Pelta is not able to maintain.
"Behind him is above all all those people who would take care of football so that it was only a privilege for a few chosen ones."
"I can blame a lot of things, but not the fact that I'm in favor of someone."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to make a football for everyone, because that's the only way they'll feel good about everyone and not just the chosen ones," Rajchl said.
He also rejects the idea that only the president would be bohemian.
"Although some people try to say otherwise, I have in mind to do my utmost for Moravia."
"For example, it's time to think about dividing the second division into a Czech part and a Moravian part, whose winners would go to the first division."
"We wouldn't have the current situation where we only have three Moravian teams, which is a problem for young Moravian players," Rajchl said.
Although Tomaš Paclík, president of the Pilsner Club, joined the presidential elections in the fight, Rajchl continues to believe in his chances of being elected.
"I'm still sorry to have strong support from the Czech Federation, which chose me as its vice president and knows that there are clear successes behind me," Rajchl said, whose successes include saving about tens of millions of kroner of disadvantaged contracts, negotiations on television contracts and negotiations on lottery law.
On the other hand, he acknowledges his part of the guilt that the federation is not united.
And while proclaiming that Pelta is "disqualified to regain confidence in Czech football," he considers the other rival, Paclík, as a strong candidate who does have something to offer to football.
"No one can deny that he did a great job for Pilsen that year."
"In the event that he is elected, he will probably follow what Ivan Hašek has already started and would not significantly change the staffing of the committees."
"I don't want to use that in my favor," he evaluates his rivals Rajchl.
The most beautiful pools in Europe
Jump to blue
by Julia Stanek
Swimming pools from an incredible perspective, sumptuous baths in Budapest: Those who visit Europe can experience their blue wonder, and, after a visit to the city or a walk, rest their tired legs in bubble baths.
A book shows where the best well-being is in the water.
When Iris Meder made an investigation trip over the past year and a half, there was something he couldn't miss in his luggage, a swimsuit.
Lying back on the water, he looked at the artistic dome at the top, swimming towards the marble angels, who waited for it at the edge of the pool and was amazed at the meticulously restored modernist indoor pool.
He liked the bathroom, took note in his notebook at the time of all the interesting details about the style and history of the building.
Architectural historian Meder explored more than 200 swimming pools in this way and presents them in her recent book "Badefreuden": the indoor swimming pools in Munich, the historic bathing palaces in the Black Forest, the "constructions of concrete" in Taunus.
He made his "travel through the most extraordinary baths in Central Europe" in 13 countries: In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, he visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia respectively.
This 46-year-old German is a true enthusiast of bath culture.
He doesn't want to have anything to do with sport, Meder says, only water is different.
It only bothers you that bathroom fans have to settle for blue tiles and chlorine stench, while lovers can breathe the fascinating smell of spruce forests or listen to the joyous bird trine in the park.
"One day I wondered why swimming pools always have to be so ugly," says this Vienna resident.
"I started collecting beautiful pools."
The surface of the water doubles the architecture.
The splash in the pool and the ethereal oils in the sauna. The wellness factor in the pools is so great because all senses are taken care of, according to Meder.
And if the builder strives, the indoor pools can be a real gift for the view: "Instead of flooring, the bathrooms have a water surface."
"On the one hand it is transparent, on the other it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything folds optically: the high vaults, the colored tiles, the trampolines.
The book with photographs in small format "Badefreuden" provides in 190 pages very interesting data about the architecture and history of art in the historical oasis of well-being, but, mainly, it wants to jump to the blue.
Meder, the pool collector discovers the highlights of her research in Hungary.
Alongside the magnificent medicinal baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, there are nitrated waters in a unique karstic cavity (cavities baths in Miskolc-Tapolca), as well as thermal baths, whose pools are of alkaline waters and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
Many outdoor swimming pools in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views: While the whole city puts its eyes on Zurich's roofed swimming pool, you can look at Arlberb, covered in snow, from the outdoor swimming pool of a bath in St. Antón, and: In the Turkish bath there is a window from which you can observe the practice on the ski slopes.
Perhaps the most extraordinary design awaits customers in Längenfeld: Ötztal's water cathedral looks like an UFO that has just landed in the Alps.
From three open sources steams in winter, while the Ötztal mountains are raised in the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Meder, the pool collector, didn't invade the smell of chlorine in all the pools.
Many thermal baths smell like sulphur, in the Árpád baths in Békescsaba, Hungary, the oil pest is so strong that people think they have reached a sanitary bath.
The smell comes from the medicinal waters that contain bicarbonate and alkali and whose legamo is glued to the skin when entering the pool, a enjoyment of well-being in a special way.
Iris Meder was also disappointed in a place in his search for beautiful places for the bath, when he wanted to visit open pools and sunbathing in the Czech bath of Luhatschowitz, he found a blocked land.
The 1902 bathroom of architect Duan Jurkovic was closed.
When Meder looked through the crumbling windows of the red, white and yellow modernist building, he saw the weed grow among the tiles.
The decadence was countered in a lovely pool in the Black Forest: the Thermal Palace in Bad Wildbald.
These bathrooms have three phases of construction after themselves; they can not only discover neo-monic elements of the times of their construction in 1844, but also an Alhambra-style Arab hall, added in 1900.
Since its careful modernization in 1995, the Thermal Palace is the favorite bath of the pool collector, Iris Meder, and not only because it is natural from the Black Forest.
"It has a lot of merit to merge different architectural styles into such a fantastic unit," Meder says.
In such a palace immersion in the thermal pool apparently doesn't matter much.
Agrarian speculation
Deutsche Bank analyses raw materials business
By Christian Teevs
Does Deutsche Bank give up its business with agricultural raw materials?
According to information from SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to check the consequences of speculation for the world's poor.
In January, the head of the consortium wants to show the consequences.
Hamburg,
For the citizens, the matter is clear, according to one study, 84 percent of Germans do not seem acceptable for banks to speculate on agricultural raw materials such as wheat or maize.
Two thirds of respondents claim that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions withdraw from this business because it intensifies the problems of the world's poorest.
This is the result of a survey commissioned by the Foodwatch consumer organization.
The study is based on a report submitted to Foodwatch in mid-October.
Author Harald Schumann shows that global commodity stock exchanges raise prices, and banks bear responsibility for the global hunger problem.
The consumer campaign is aimed specifically at Josef Ackermann, director of the Deutsche Bank, although large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Originally, commodity bets were designed to protect traders from price fluctuations.
Leading experts agree that players have decoupled from offers and demands, and profit from the costs of the poorest.
Ackermann reacted to criticism differently than American competitors: He promised to review the claims and said that no business "needs to compromise Deutsche Bank's reputation."
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is reviewing the demands of the Foodwatch report.
The analysis should be completed by the end of the year, then the results will be presented to the Deutsche Bank directive, together with the recommendation on how to handle the matter.
At the end of January, the bank's management will report on the consequences.
In the end, there could be a reduction in the raw materials business, or even its total abandonment.
Ackermann is trying to fix his image.
Thilo Bode, founder of Foodwatch, welcomed the news, but reaffirmed his criticism of the financial sector: "The high-priced bets on food show in a particularly drastic way how ruthless banks are currently harming public welfare."
Ackermann is the largest bank lobby, especially in bonds.
"The Deutsche Bank must cancel all investments in its portfolio in which it puts money at stake for food price bets," Bode said.
"It doesn't matter if Ackermann deals with the issue of starving people or the Deutsche Bank's fame."
Ackermann's inspection is surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the head of the consortium wants to offer a perfect image a few months before leaving his post.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank published that the chairman of the board of directors will change something different from what was not planned on the board of directors.
With the abandonment of controversial agrarian speculation it can perfect its image.
And you need to barely care about any losses, that's what your successor will do.
Two-thirds would cancel the investment in raw materials
Foodwatch strives to keep the pressure on the manager high.
So far, more than 30,000 netizens have participated in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Forsa Institute had asked 1,001 people on 7 and 8 November.
Just 10 percent considered it legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments in which food prices were bet.
Many of the bank's clients showed personal consequences when they discovered that their bank was involved in such businesses: according to the survey, two-thirds would cancel all the investments from which money comes out of agrarian speculation.
43 percent would advise such a bank to its acquaintances, 49 percent would ask, after reflection, cancel their account and move to another institute.
House 21 in Vienna
The moved pavilion
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with ups and downs and a happy ending, the pavilion of the 1958 Austrian universal exhibition in Brussels won prizes, was in Vienna for a museum, was empty and collapsed.
Now it reopens as an exhibition house.
Modern post-management architecture is passionate, clear shapes, glass halls, brave curves and new building materials, typical of thinking about technical progress, for which, the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 Brussels universal exhibition is an appropriate and well-known example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion then obtained the Grand Prix of Architecture for its light and floating construction of steel and glass.
Construction is considered to be a contemporary milestone in architecture.
He made the architect so well-known that he also built the Austrian pavilion at the next universal exhibition.
With its legendary four-cylinder tower for MBW plus the adjacent building flattened in Munich, it became internationally known.
Its pavilion, designed as a temporary exhibition building, was erected after the universal exhibition at Schweizer Garten next to Vienna's southern station, was reformed in 1962 and a 20th-century museum was opened inside, called the "House 20".
The building was suitable but lacked the spaces and technology suitable for a museum; without any wall to hang art, nor a good atmosphere.
Nevertheless, it was used until contemporary art in Vienna had a new home.
The building has been empty since 2001 and is falling more and more.
Currently, the architect Adolf Krischanitz reformed the pavilion, now called it "house 21" and will be used in the future as a museum of contemporary art.
On Tuesday afternoon the belvedere museum, to which the house belongs, was inaugurated, with the first exhibition, a stroke of luck in a certain way.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, the new director of the Austrian Belvedere gallery since 2007, achieved a new start.
Husslein-Arco, PhD in art history with a considerable career, among other things, ice skating artist in her youth, later in Sotheby, the Guggenheim Museum and founding director of the Salzburg Museum of Modern Art, carried out the reforms with the insistence of politicians and monument protectors, provided public funds and private sponsors and established their use.
With the exception of contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba of the homonymous foundation are exhibited, there should be a cafeteria and a bookstore and a building of offices should be built.
Strict control, low budget
Krischanitz was the best choice to do it.
Not only did he reform the secession of Joseph Olbrichs in Vienna in a sensitive way, he expanded it and was awarded the competition, but he studied with Schwanzwer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was for him an "important and immense place", in which he contemplated "almost every weekend" the exhibitions.
He was aware of the project and the problem of the building, which disappeared with its transfer to Vienna in exchange for its generous and easy use.
In the current reforms there are major problems, the building was "an energy eater," Krischanitz said.
The window profile of the glass facade was changed, an insulating glass reinforced with fiberglass was installed and the glass ceiling was replaced with a special safety glass.
Thermal bridges and steel beams were reinforced or replaced and asbestos ceilings rehabilitated.
Two basements were used for the new use, a light panel descending between the house and the street provides lighting, a bridge serves to enter the building almost new, but still Schwanzer's pavilion.
The original exterior doors remain, the house is painted in ancient mahogany tones and protected against oxidation.
And the cinema is exactly as it used to be.
And all this with strict control by the monument office and a low budget.
"I often had to find material that was good, cheap and also liked the monument protection office," Krischanitz says and warns of rough soil in the basement.
Despite all pressures, problems and reforms, the building remains flexible and lightweight.
The "Brussels" pavilion has been difficult, Krischanitz said recently, a typical "accidental appearance in the history of the city".
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and that is why he wanted to "awaken the proper consciousness".
In this case house 21 is not in the wrong place, a hit of urban luck has happened. The totally new and planned "central station barrio", with houses and offices, is located next to the Schweizer Garten.
And perhaps another stroke of luck happens: House 21 could receive a reinforcement of another construction of Krischanitz, as collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berlin temporary art room and, as we hear, negotiate with the city about a neighboring place in the Schweizer Garten.
Deutsche Bahn plans a multi-million-dollar winter crisis package
The company has devised a crisis plan, which would avoid train breakdowns in winter.
The number of staff must be doubled.
Which costs millions.
In the fight against winter-related train failures and delays, Deutsche Bahn has spent more than €70 million this year, according to a journalistic report.
The newspaper "Bild" reported, invoking an internal crisis plan of the group, the planned investments until 2005 of about 300 million euros.
In order to achieve better availability of vehicles and the railway network even in extreme time.
Among other things, it is planned to double internal and external employees to 16,000 posts to remove snow from roads and platforms.
The goal is to clean the snow and ice platforms for operation and 90 percent of the needles needed for operation within four to five hours.
Two months ago, Deutsche Bahn's president, Rüdiger Grube, warned of faults and delays on trains also during this winter after a summit with the government and industry.
Last winter Deutsche Bahn suffered considerable problems in the transport of passengers, as, among other things, it lacked reserves in the face of adverse weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for an authorization from the federal railway office for years.
There is also a delay in the delivery of high-speed trains.
Deutsche Bahn has been working for years to check the axles of high-speed trains frequently in the workshop, after a high-speed train suffered the break of an axle at Cologne Central Station.
Deutsche Bank pays millions of fines in the US.
After the riot over President Josef Ackerman, a new US problem appears, the Deutsche Bank must pay a millionaire fine there.
As if the problems were not enough for the Deutche Bank, its past in the US acquires the giant in the sector, the Frankfurt Institute pays $145 million (EUR 106 million) in an agreement, to put an end to the disputes caused by the bankruptcy of five large credit unions during the financial crisis.
It's about the sale of mortgages.
The NCUA financial market regulator blames many large banks to induce credit unions with false promises to buy financial products; they have minimized risks.
These securities lost their value during the financial crisis and drag the banks to the depths.
"We are pleased to be able to clarify the issue without the parties having to go to court," said a Deutsche Bank spokesman in New York.
The bank admits no guilt with the agreement.
This also applies to Citigroup, which required a payment of $20.5 million.
Debbie Matz, President of NCUA, welcomed the deference of both financial institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for US credit unions and provides bankruptcy support to protect client investments.
The NCUA is trying to reintegrate the losses of millions generated.
The agreements currently closed are their first type.
The regulator had also requested accounts from other large banks and in the summer filed lawsuits against JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In the question of dubious mortgage securities, these are so-called mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on housing credits.
When the U.S. real estate bubble exploded in 2007, it led to the destruction of many financial institutions.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Although the results happened a few years ago, it is currently blowing a complicated wind for American banks.
Investors and the inspection have instituted countless processes to receive compensation or sanction faults.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has produced the largest number of demands.
It looks to the 18 major international banks that the two US state mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have taken advantage of the mortgage business in a volume of approximately $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank also has a demand for FHFA, which is worth $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The inspection requires that the Frankfurt Institute be held accountable for "substantial losses", without naming an exact figure.
Deutsche Bank rejected the debts as unfounded and explained that it wants to defend itself.
Warren Buffett contributes 10 billion to IBM
The finance guru, Buffett, invests heavily in the IT company IBM.
Since March it has acquired shares worth more than ten billion dollars.
So far the great American investor Warren Buffett has always stated not to invest in computer companies or Information Technologies since the forecasts of the long-term development of companies are negative.
But he has read IBM's trade report and changed his mind about investing in the sector.
He must have understood long before IBM offered mainly services and sought computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
In the financial world, an investment by Warren Buffett is considered an honor.
Therefore, the primitive of Information Technologies should be called "Sir IBM".
Buffett has now unveiled at the CNBC economics station that has acquired shares of IBM worth $10.7 billion since March.
His investment Berkshire Hathaway has thus raised one of IBM's largest shareholders with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said IBM didn't know anything about the engagement so far.
He commended the leadership that dealt with the regular benefits in the economic crisis.
"They've done a great job," Buffett said about the strategy.
IBM has for some time established lucrative information technology services as the operation of computing centres.
The old computer pioneer over 100 years old also offers software and advice as well as powerful equipment for companies.
Buffett has avoided technology companies to date.
He said he only invested in companies whose businesses he understood.
On the contrary, Buffett took the opportunity on a freight train, a lubricant manufacturer or a mechanical engineer.
Its Berkshire Hathaway has about 80 own subsidiaries, as well as part of a whole series of major consortia such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, formerly Münchener Rück.
Buffett, 81, took over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and, with wise investments, expanded it to become one of the most valuable companies in the world.
However, his lifestyle is humble.
That's why it's an idol for countless investors from all over the world.
His quick and infallible sense of making money has given him the nickname of "Omaha's Oracle."
After discovering Buffett's investment, IBM stock in stock went up one percent.
"The Blue Giant", as IBM is known, has a stock market value of more than $220 billion and is, along with Apple and Microsoft, among the most valuable technology companies in the world.
With Microsoft, Buffett said, he does not want to collaborate.
Bill Gates, his founder, is a close friend.
The threat is real
After the discovery of "the Zwickau cell", the Turkish media doubted the German rule of law.
A newspaper speaks of a "bloody ideology" that rekindles itself.
The murders of eight small entrepreneurs tricks and Greeks between 2001 and 2006 have a far-right background.
Turkey and the German population of Turkish origin have reacted with fear and concern to this news.
For many Germans of Turkish origin, a ghost that had long been believed to have died, since the fires in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, no more episodes of extreme right-wing violence against Turks had occurred.
However, it has never been questioned whether there is xenophobia in Germany.
The uncovered ultra-right network reveals a magnitude whose dimensions were not, much less, predictable.
"Is the bloody ideology revived again?" headlines the online edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
The newspaper "Sabah" points out on the contrary that one of the perpetrators of the crime was an informant of the Federal Office of Defence of the Constitution and is concerned that the German authorities may be involved in the ultra-rightist pantanal.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted sensibly, the weekend reminded the victims of racist violence with a vigil at the Brandenburg Gate.
Two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin together with German and Turkish politicians reflected on a solemn act on the fiftieth anniversary of the Turkish-German agreement.
The coexistence was staged with cheerful colors, like a story with a happy ending.
The information came to some Turkish media like a slap: "The German gift for the 50th anniversary", says the title of an article on the Turkish internet platform "Haber X", referring to the background of the chain of murders.
Nor does the German broadcast "Hürriyet" insist on tracing this mental connection.
"It starts to smell bad," says the title of Ahmet Külahci's column.
He points out that the murdered were people who paid their taxes and made an important contribution with their work to the reconstruction of Germany.
In the German Internet forums of Turkish origin, the police's behaviour and subsequent success in the searches are discussed very critically.
The authors are surprised that the German authorities have not long before sought suspects in the ultra-right circle.
Some people are less rhetorical about the drastic media: "From now on, immigrants are lost, they have nothing but self-defense and armament."
"This will be the best self-protection."
"The internal peace of Germany depends heavily on the quality of the clarification and the adequacy of the sanction to the whole network," writes Selen.
This means that if Germany's internal peace is in danger, the Mölln and Solingen attacks will be clarified in 90 years.
The image of the ruins of Solingen's fire has been recorded in German and Turkish memories.
No other event showed more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a specific threat and, to the Germans, that mistrust and distance can lead to violence.
The attacks exacerbate the Turkish side's group feeling.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press it was then mainly criticized the weakness of German politics after the attacks, Helmut Kohl refuses to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After Solingen's arson attack he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish President and Klaus Kinkel, his Foreign Minister, replaced him at the Cologne funeral. Kinkel detailed in his speech what the German Turks contribute with taxes.
It is clear how a person's value is calculated according to the amount of his or her taxes.
The current information from the Turkish media again shows how deep it is since then that many Germans of Turkish origin have distrusted the legality of this country.
In addition to the effort of a broad explanation and a reassessment of extreme right-wing terrorism in Germany, frank words are needed this time.
The scandal bank of Lake Zurich
The most risky bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS almost went bankrupt in the financial crisis and since then has slipped from one crisis to the next.
Now she's headed by a German.
I'm sure Axel Weber hadn't thought about it.
After his spectacular departure from the summit of the federal bank, in July it was known that in 2013 he would begin in a new and almost equally spectacular work: Chairman of the board of the great Swiss bank UBS, an unexpected and lucrative step in his career.
Axel Weber rejoices publicly, praises Switzerland for its beauty and the UBS for its newly acquired solidity and drops friendly remarks about its future companions.
"The USB has achieved a revitalization."
"I am happy to collaborate with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
In September it became clear that everything would be completely different.
A USB financial operator in London avoided all the bank's security systems and defrauded 1.7 billion euros.
Oswald Grübel, director general of the USB, a banker not only known in Switzerland, had to come.
The president of the board of directors of the USB was considered since then equally touched, and everyone asked: When does Axel Weber arrive?
It was known that Weber will have to advise the bank since February 2012.
And he will take over the chair of the board of directors in May, not early 2013, as the bank reported on Tuesday.
This is hard for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, rather, professor of economics and counselor and has had a period of adaptation that is certainly necessary.
Suddenly he becomes responsible for the strategy of a bank, which has just reproved that he deserves the title "the largest bank in the scandal of Europe" for a long time.
On the one hand, the USB is huge, until recently it was the world's largest asset manager, and on the other, for years, it has slipped from one scandal to the next.
Nothing, it seems, saves so proud a Swiss bank.
The financial crisis began.
The USB had an excellent reputation until 2007.
The image of the Swiss asset manager discreet and solid, but also soft, was combined with ambitious objectives, also wanted to be a large number in investment banks.
On the one hand, with $1.6 billion, the USB manages more money from wealthy customers than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, he advanced as an investment bank in the league of the great banks of the world.
This is impressive.
Hans Geiger, the former banker and later professor of banking in Zurich for many years explains: "Before my students, I have always qualified the USB as a model of a good bank."
"From the current point of view, one wonders: How could I be wrong?"
I was in a big mistake.
In 2007 it came to light that something went very wrong on the USB.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, general manager, who until then was considered a brilliant and very intelligent banker, resigned surprisingly.
A few months later, the reason was suspected.
The bank's investment fund embarked on losses with high-risk securities and had to amortize billions.
To charge with this, the USB announced a capital injection of no less than 13 billion francs.
For this he found investors, of course, that some looked with contempt until just before: an Asian and opaque state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund, so discreet, that his name had never been heard.
This was just the first blow.
In April 2008, it got worse.
The bank had to declare the loss of billions, Marcel Ospel, president of the board of directors, in 2006 in the second best paid board of directors of Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, the catastrophe continued, in view of its wrong investments, the UBS found itself in the financial crisis in the face of bankruptcy and had to be rescued by the state.
The national bank bought problematic values from the UBS for many billions, the Helvetica Confederation gave six billions of francs for a bond that was obligatoryly convertible, by which it became co-owner of the bank.
All Switzerland was affected, it was stated how dramatic this was for a small country, if it housed such large banks.
Finally, the sum of the balance sheet of the UBS in 2007 was more than five times higher than Switzerland's economic performance (see graph).
"We can't rescue UBS again," said Geiger, a banking expert.
The first catastrophe was joined by the second.
A few months later, the UBS capitulated in a fiscal conflict with America and was willing to deliver the data of wealthy customers, who had possibly defrauded taxes with the help of the bank.
In addition, it approves an amount of $780 billion, repayment of unjustified profits from these businesses with compensation for payment.
With this, the UBS confessed more or less to having helped in tax fraud.
At the same time he lost something that had always been his capital in the competition for rich customers: the halo of discretion.
After the scandal, the secret of the Swiss bank is no longer the same.
This was followed by the resignation of the chairman of the board of directors and the chairman of the board of directors.
And the exodus of clients' funds.
In this way, in a few months the bank lost its credibility in its two central sectors: in investment banking through mis speculation and in the administration of assets through aid to tax fraud.
And just when it was something quieter again, just when it was thought that the UBS was getting it again, this unfortunate operator's story happens, an individual operator defrauded 1.7 billion euros, before the bank realized something was wrong.
And it was revealed, apparently, this still doesn't work well with risk management in the investment bank.
"The Adoboli case shows that risk controls have changed too little," says Martin Janssen, professor of economics and finance at the Banking Institute of the University of Zurich.
The financial director of a large German bank is also sure: "The problem with UBS is that it does not dominate risk controls."
So came the idea of caution, with which Swiss bankers had long presented themselves, being the guardians of the world's largest assets: no risk too great, instead, the security of money wants to break on the other side of the Alpine republic.
The Swiss banks' security deposits were the symbol of unbreakable reliability, such as Lindt and Sprüngli of authentic chocolate.
The central office of the UBS in Zurich doesn't fit the cliché of the solid Swiss private bank, it's just a little bigger.
The situation is classic.
The bank has its head office on Bahnhofstraße Street in Zurich, which runs from the main station directly to Lake Zurich, framed by the snow-covered peaks of the Swiss mountains.
Here the buildings are ostentatious, the rentals are one of the highest in Europe.
Here you will find jewelry like Tiffany`s among traditional Swiss businesses like Sprüngli Confectionery.
Swiss banks have resided here for years: from the national bank, passing through the palace of Credit Suisse, to the elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
It enters the reception room of the UBS by means of a heavy revolving door.
Inside the walls are covered with marble, front are large leather armchairs, next to the logo of the bench there is a large sign to indicate "security".
The UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: Security.
The two large Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, have at some point moved the idea of the large Swiss bank, or betrayed it, as the president of a small Swiss private bank believes.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, after all he does, like all Swiss bankers, also with the businesses of both big banks.
The UBS has become too large, he believes, mainly in the investment bank, where the Anglo-Saxons have gained ground.
There the Swiss had nothing else to say.
"And they have long become accustomed to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons."
In fact, the UBS changed the Anglo-Saxon investment bank, delivered its first big profit and then the disaster came, no European financial institution had lost as much money in the high-risk jungle as the large Swiss bank.
On 15 October 2008, the catastrophe was evident.
"That Wednesday the government coalition of the small country of seven million decided the largest rescue operation in the history of its nation," author Lukas Hässig writes in his book "Der UBS-Crash" ("The crash of the UBS" in Spanish).
Politicians granted up to 68 billion francs or about 45 billion euros to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
How do you think?
They talk to Swiss bankers, so they see the problem in the UBS dimension.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks merged into a powerful consortium.
A bank emerges that, due to the merger, was too big for little Switzerland, and continues to grow.
So it served to make the two different precursor banks of the UBS complement each other: a rich but sleeping bank with the center of the administration of goods in Zurich and a poorer but stronger internationalization.
Suddenly, the internationalized investment banks arrived in a timely manner with a lot of money, with which they could make a great financial bike run.
There are two names related to this rise of the UBS: Peter Wuffli, head of the consortium of the UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then president of the administrative board.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a perfect team," says banking expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the intellectual, modest, who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive that managed to open up from learning in the bank to the summit."
Finally, Ospel trusted Wuffli.
And in the end Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake: "He thought his models were a reality," says Geiger.
"It's a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
It's clear: The desatine came before the case.
The employees of the UBS clearly remember the meetings of directors, at which Wuffli, the head of the consortium, always repeated the same motto: Down from the throne to Goldman Sachs.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
They headed the "League Tables", the classifications that then documented the success of the banks.
The UBS wanted to be at the summit.
Some steps worked out for him.
In foreign exchange operations and stock trading it was at the highest.
However, the consultants of the companies in charge highlighted a weak point: In the business of international interest, in the "fixed income" banking language, there is a huge compensation for the big banks.
The UBS has gaps in American mortgage products.
To fill these gaps, the UBS began an adventure that almost cost it its existence.
Avid for growth, they invested both the same bank and one of their high-risk funds created in high-risk American investments.
It became a powerful machine to securitize American mortgages and then sell them, keeping certain risks on its own.
And also, as other banks sought the descent for a long time.
"In the summer of 2007, as the American real estate market was on fire, the UBS bought there," said Geiger, a banking expert.
So great the euphoria, so deep the fall.
A manager had to leave, as the attempt to order was more complicated than they expected.
The posts at UBS have become projectible seats and are insecure to date.
At present, who runs a large bank, has an almost impossible job.
You must find a strategy for a bank, to which all logical business models are lost.
Geiger, a bank expert, has an idea, put an end to the investment bank, focus on the management of assets, return to Swiss roots.
The bank doesn't want to get that far (yet).
But the investment bank must decrease considerably, it is now clear.
The next Thursday, Sergio Ermotti, the bank's new president, will present his future strategy to the world.
In fact, it was only thought of the 51-year-old Italian-Swiss as a transitional solution, since the bank the bank separated surprisingly from its predecessor Grübel.
Meanwhile, he imposed himself: He must permanently run the UBS business, the Zurich bank announced on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to return the investment bank to its state in the mid-nineties.
Remove 3,500 posts.
But this isn't enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is it?
What do you want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is sure to ask at the moment.
So far he's just saying that he'll be looking for a house with his wife in Zurich first.
Next year.

Smart hedgehogs spread out in the cities
In many places grajos are considered "problematic birds": these intelligent animals are not expelled from the cities for a long time, experts say.
Some like them, others want to get rid of them very quickly, the hooligans have belonged for years to the image of the city, but in many municipalities the complaints of the neighbors are piled up for the filth and the noise of the animals.
Although no means has appeared against the "problematic birds" so far.
The hooligans no longer leave the cities, say the experts at the first symposium on hooligans in Leer, East Frisia.
There specialists from all over the country discuss possible solutions.
Search for alternatives in cities
Ecologists attribute the problems of cities to the migration of certain protected barns from the countryside; chemical applications in agriculture visibly end with traditional vital spaces.
Hunting, growing building and falling trees that host them make the life of birds difficult.
The hogs are protected.
There are large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs in Soest, Westfalia, among others, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim in Bremen, as well as in Read.
There in 2005 a controversial project to mass murder the district boys jumped to the negative press headlines.
Critics have called hunting animals by means of bird traps and the murder with sticks as especially brutal.
"By expelling them and fleeing them in a normal way nothing is achieved," said Werner Klöver, urban planner and landscaper of Leer.
Shooting the nests with water or throwing the trees are often unwanted consequences, says Manfred Kaiser, environmental expert at Lahr, Baden-Württemberg.
"Animals deviate, large colonies divide and distribute elsewhere."
Getting them out is only possible as an exception in hospitals, old people's homes or schools.
"We must live with them, we no longer catch them."
Without the surroundings, the problem is not solved in the cities, says Wolfgang Kellner, mayor of Leer.
A combination of removing animals from sensitive residential areas and baits is possible to re-sit elsewhere.
"Information panels instead of chain saws" Uta Maria Jürgens, psychologist and ethnologist advertises against in order to treat animals in a completely different way: "The best thing is that we can hold a peak in the face with aplom."
Jürgens co-founded in Schleswig-Holstein the teaching circuit on Ascheberger's hedgehogs, where signs tell about the lives of intelligent birds.
Meanwhile, the project is accepted by tourists.
Jürgens also has his own opinion on the criticisms of the noise of birds: "They are all forms of communication, they have much to say."
The intelligence and skill of these animals are legendary, the pigs not only take advantage of the resources to access weird bites, but they make tools to use them as resources.
Recently, etologists from the University of Cambridge checked in four grates how far the intelligence of birds comes.
In an experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to drop a stone on a platform to reach a moth larva.
Without much training, they recognized with determination the size and shape of the stone to fall on the platform.
In a second trial, the smart guys had to solve a complicated problem.
The researchers placed a small cube with a moth larva in a vertical cylinder.
Birds couldn't reach their prey with the beak.
But the investigators left them a piece of wire.
With which the four animals formed a hook, with which they fished the cube in the pipe shooter.
Three of the four guys got it on the first try.
Portugal at the 2012 Euro Cup thanks to Cristiano Ronaldo
The Bosnians and the Turks have no hope in the championship.
The favourites, Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland will also be in the 2012 Euro Cup.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have sealed on the play-offs the latest Euro 2012 tickets in Poland and Ukraine.

Former Bundesliga professional Zvjezdan Misimovic with a penalty (41.) and Captain Emir Spahic (65.) shortened distances twice for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic obtained a red card (54.).
Bosnia failed because of Portugal in the 2010 play-offs of the South African World Cup.
At the Stadium da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal began perfectly.
Ronaldo executed a free direct from more than 30 meters to get to the head at the points.
A quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his dowry to score from afar and got 2-0 from 25 meters.
The Bosnians, who did not show up in the first half hour, had their first clear chance thanks to the scorer Edin Dzeko.
The former player of the Wolfsburg team, leader of English Manchester City sent a head to the pole, but the ball did not cross the gate line (33).
Jiracek hit for the Czech Republic
Then collegiate Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding was in the eye of the hurricane.
After the attack on Helder Postiga in the Bosnian penati area, he decided to show the Portuguese the yellow card for being thrown to the ground (36.).
On the opposite side, Stark pitted a controversial penalty after an action by Fabio Coentrao, who transformed Misimovic.
After the break, the 2004 European vice-champion clarified everything with 4 goals.
The Czechs ended the last doubt in the 81st minute with Petr Jiracek's goal.
The 1976 European champion is ranked for the fifth time in a row for the European Cup.
Coach Michal Bilek's team with Bundesliga legionaire Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1. FC Nürnberg) were also lucky and had to overcome a second reaction in the initial phase.
At the last moment, the goalkeeper Petr Cech avoided with a reflection a possible goal in his own door to Tomas Sivok (9).
Montenegro had more possibilities with the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic in action.
Damjanovic marked in the 40th minute of the turn of the front, very right in Cech's doorway.
After the break, the Czechs had to protect the world-famous goalkeeper's spearhead, the FC Seoul frontman once again escaped (50.).
Finally, the goal before the end sentenced the game.
Meanwhile, Turkey missed the wonder of Zagreb football.
Four days after 0-3 in Istanbul, the Turks did not pass a 0-0 in Zagreb.
While it was almost certain that national coach Guus Hiddink had to leave his seat on the third-party bench of the 2002 World Cup, the Croats celebrated their fourth turnout at the end of the Euro Cup.
Before 31,000 spectators at Maksimir Stadium, the Turks almost achieved a dream principle.
In the seventh minute and with a long-distance kick, Selcuk Inan only managed to touch the pole. Assailant Kazim Kazim was also not able to send the ball inside the gate.
After the second reaction, Croatia took on more and more control.
After the break, Croatia did not let any goals be scored.
Along with Mario Mandzukic of VfL Wolfsburg, who in the 62nd minute made room for Ivan Perisic of Dortmund, Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) are the legionaries of the Bundesliga in practice.
Trapattoni goes to the Euro Cup
In Dublin, the Irish have been celebrating their first Euro Cup appearance since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward led coach Giovanni Trapattoni's team, who triumphed with the 4-0 in the one-way game prepared for a previous decision, to take the lead in the 32nd minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57.) tied with the guest team.
Ireland pressed from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute, when Robbie Keane from Los Angeles Galaxy had her first big chance.
From the very first moment, the Estonian defense avoided possible goals of advantage.
But in the 32nd minute, he pushed it forward.
After a defense of goalkeeper Pavel Londak, Ward appeared and kicked the ball across the line, achieving 1-0.

Personal slaughter
Peter Englund's Intense and Generous New Book, The Beauty and Pain of the Battle (The Beauty and the Sorrow): An intimate story about World War I, "starts with a long dramatis personae of the kind that can cause one to fall to his feet.
Here are some action tips: Gently start this page and turn it into your brand pages.
You will get to know these people very well in Mr Englund's novelistic narrative, and this dramatis personae will work as your GPS, a beacon during those few moments when, as one of your men and women, you are confused and helpless in the fog of war.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
What he has written here is an unusual book, which rightly describes as "an anti-history work."
It contains some notable names, important treatises or famous battles; there are practically no ambassadors, elegant journalists or discussions about tactics or material.
It's not so much a book about what happened, he explains, as "a book about how it happened." It's about "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods."
"The beauty and pain of the battle" combines the experiences in wartime of about 20 ordinary men and women, on both sides of the war, from schoolgirls and botanists to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and administrators.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Some will become prisoners of war, or lose their members, go crazy, or die.
Their lives flash here like votive candles lit in a church; some new ones are added to the mix while others are turned off.
Mr. Englund's book is a deviation from the standard history books.
It is also a corrective to the notion that World War I was only the disastrous trench war on the western front.
"The beauty and pain of battle" moves expertly through other theatres of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book fall on the hives; one spends Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; the tse-tse flies are an intractable problem.
This is a moving book, almost from the beginning.
The war floods the lives of these people as a natural catastrophe, a hurricane Katrina that stinks of rope.
When the artillery fire is heard in the distance, and you are a woman who is at home with your children, do you stay or run away?
Anyway, who's coming?
Almost nobody understands what's going on, not even why we have to fight this war.
"Failure of facts," notes Mr Englund, "has been filled with conjectures, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"The beauty and pain of battle" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German sailor of the high seas fleet.
Their stories have mostly been obtained from memoirs, letters and other material previously published.
The explanations of their lives may be terrifying or touching, but they are more full of life in the accumulation of small moments, lost details, of Mr Englund.
Many of these are about deprivations and dealing with what's left.
About telling the story of a German high school girl says, "Successive, everywhere."
"Coffee substitute, fake aluminum, imitation rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He continues to talk about the next meal in Germany.
It describes "meat made from cooked rice and pressed into sheep fat (and finished with a fake bone made of wood); tobacco made from roots and peels of dried potatoes; shoes with wooden soles".
There are, he notes, "837 meat substitutes allowed in the production of sausages, 511 coffee substitutes registered".
Some stories are about honor and courage.
An American recognizes his own impulse towards savagery and manifests about war: "You feel that, after all, this is what men are designed for and not to sit in armchairs with a cigarette and a whisky, the afternoon newspaper or a best seller, and pretend that that varnish means civilization and that there is no barbarian behind that mounded and tachy sin."
Instead, a British soldier realizes that he will probably die, and that no one will know or care.
"Once you resign yourself to the thought of sacrificing yourself, you would like to think it could happen in front of the public," he writes.
On the other hand, it is horribly similar to "a convicted man being strangled in secret."
Other observations are about an old Europe disappearing, and about new types of terror.
"The conflict has increasingly become an economic competition," writes Mr. Englund, "a war between factories."
It reflects the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the bestiary of the young century: The mass murderer eloquently and ideologically convinced with clothing of good clothing that executes his butchery while sitting behind a desk."
People behave in unforeseen ways; there is both innoble and heroic behavior.
Mr. Englund talks about the soldiers who actively tried to catch a venereal disease of prostitutes as a way to evade service on the front.
"The most grotesque expression of this can be seen the trade of gonococcal pus, which soldiers buy and bag their genitals with it in the hope of ending up in the hospital," he writes.
"Those who are truly desperate rub it over their eyes, which often leads to blindness for life."
In this Swedish translation by Peter Graves, Mr Englund's agile but not extravagant prose is perfectly adapted to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes it reflects the way in which the war "disengaged exceptionally uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People are beginning to wonder why their leaders are making them fight.
The best books about World War I have often been indirect, such as The Great War and Paul Fussell's modern memory, or novels like No News on the Front of Erich Maria Remark, rather than integral stories.
Mr Englund's volume joins an unconventional pantheon.
His book has one of the most devastating endings I can remember in a nonfiction work.
I won't reveal it.
But it's like he came from his book, ripped out of your fingers that dramatis personae page, and burned it with a match.
After a previous false step, a planned assault per minute
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing riot helmets.
The night from Monday to Tuesday was chosen because Zuccotti Park would be more empty.
The operation was kept secret except for a few high-ranking officers, initially telling others that they were joining an exercise.
Police inspector Raymond W. Kelly was in the center, his presence underlined how the operation was plagued by challenges for the police department.
The episodes of recent weeks, such as spraying pepper spray on protesters, could not be repeated, violating the department's rules and creating a storm of public sympathy for the "okupas".
And so the police operation to clear Zuccotti Park of protesters was revealed after two weeks of planning and training.
The agents had prepared themselves to see how the occupations had developed in other cities.
A major catastrophe simulation was taking place on Randalls Island, with an eye looking towards Zuccotti.
The officers increased the so-called riot training - counter-terrorism measures that involved rapidly mobilizing a large number of police officers - to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session was Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The orders to enter the park came in the "last minute," someone familiar with the orders said, who referred to the mission only as "an exercise."
"The few cops I know who were called for this, they didn't tell them it was to enter Zuccotti Park," said the person, who spoke anonymously.
"The only people who knew they were going to enter Zuccotti Park were at the highest levels of the department."
One reason for secrecy was a lesson learned by the city.
On October 14, some agents wanted to clear the park, but they gave up when hundreds of protesters emerged early after hearing about the plans.
Tuesday's operation involved officers from several police units, including special forces from all over the municipal district - dozens of mobile agents who used to flood neighborhoods with high crime rates.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, like those who travel to work daily, had been coming and going from the park during the day, making 1 a.m. a good time to enter.
"It was appropriate to do so when the least number of people were in the park," he said.
Trucks from the Emergency Service Unit with spotlights and speakers gathered at the Pike Slip crossing with Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before leaving.
The pre-recorded lights and messages that resounded from the loudspeakers seemed to intimidate many protesters.
Community affairs agents went to the park with their light blue windbreakers, many protesters simply picked up their things and left.
No tent was touched until 1:45 a.m., the police said, giving the protesters time to collect their belongings.
Other teams of agents were seen gathering in the perimeter to enter if arrests were needed in the park.
Journalists in the park were forced to leave him.
Paul J. Browne, the chief spokesman for the Police Department, said it was for his safety.
But many journalists said that they tried to prevent the police from taking action in the park, and that they had been brutally treated by the officers.
Mr. Browne said that the mobile television units on Church Street, along the western edge of the park, were able to capture images.
As the police moved west through the dense maran of protesters' personal belongings, including luggage and bags of paper and plastic trash packed with clothes, teams of the Department of Cleaning followed them, collecting what was left behind.
Some protesters who refused to move were dragged out, appearing images on the Internet shortly afterwards.
A central group of protesters took positions near the camp's kitchen area, near the center of the park.
Some made a barrier, and the police came in to arrest them methodically.
About 10 people in the epicenter of the camp were locked between them by their arms.
And two people chained themselves to trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Emergency service officers were called to cut the padlocks.
No arrests were made in the park until about 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly said.
The clearance operation was completed about 75 minutes later, police said.
Mr. Browne said that about 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests were for "altering public order and resistance to authority," he said.
The highest-ranking agent on the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the uniformed senior officer in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, the head of detectives in the department, was there, too.
Mr. Kelly, while present, "was not running the operations," Mr. Browne said.
A second group of agents waited along the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar streets, in case they had to enter.
Barricades were erected on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block south.
From these positions, the police were seen expanding the perimeter even beyond Zuccotti Park.
At one point, a series of agents, many of them with shields, were seen pushing people out.
There were about 28 people on the north perimeter.
Some of the loudest action of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5 a.m., south of Pine Street, a protester jumped over the hood of a police car, and others were seen taking the air off the wheels of a police van.
At one point, a piece of plywood flew out of the crowd.
In the end, an agent and a protestor were hospitalized.
The union of support workers will sue the city for dismissals
The union representing hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month plans to sue the city on Wednesday, claiming that the layoffs were unnecessary and discriminatory due to their disproportionate impact on schools serving poor students.
The lawsuit is possibly the last weapon at the disposal of the union, in the district 37, in its effort to revoke the dismissals.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, the coordinators of parents and other employees who were among the city's worst paid lost their jobs on October 7, in a movement that union leaders have described as a political revenge for their refusal to allow, last spring, access by the city to a health care fund by working groups to close its budget gap.
The municipal authorities have categorically denied this accusation.
At a hearing at City Hall last month, the education counselor, Dennis M. Walcott, said that layoffs were part of the budget approved in June.
A member of the Council counterattacked, saying that nothing in the budget specified that members of the school support staff would be fired.
Municipal District officials 37 said they filed the claim in writing, warning the Department of Education that he would be sued. A press conference will be held on Wednesday to announce the official filing of the claim, at the State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The lawsuit will include Mr. Walcott and the City's Department of Education as defendants, with eight workers dismissed as plaintiffs, all black or Latino women, as well as most of the assistants who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokesperson for the City's Legal Department, said the city had not seen the lawsuit and could therefore not comment on her specific allegations.
According to a draft of the New York Times demand, the union has focused on the number of redundancies in the city's poor-area schools to support a claim for unfair treatment, saying that poor schools lost more assistants, as they had been undersubsidized chronically.
It is noted that while there were no redundancies on Staten Island and a few redundancies in schools on the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school assistants lost their jobs in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 were fired in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
Taking into account the loss of five of the eight assistants employed by Public School 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the demand says, "This is not a neighborhood of wealthy parents who can raise funds to cover the budget deficit."
P.D. District budget 36 was reduced by 3.26 percent this year, and it also lost money when the city changed the way it calculates additional funding for each enrolment per poor student in schools.
The union also states that the principals of secondary schools may have been deceived by language in a memorandum authorizing the dismissal of the parents' coordinators.
The memorandum used the word "exceeding" to describe the action, although "exceeding" more frequently describes the act of transferring a teacher on the payroll from a school to a work bag, whose salaries are paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six parents coordinators were fired," says the draft complaint, "and not just in surplus."
Mission completed, Congress prepared to reach agreement on Libya
It seems that finally Republicans and Democrats in the Capitol are willing to agree on something related to the uprising in Libya.
All that was needed was for the rebellion to succeed, for veteran dictator Muamar the Gaddafi to be captured and killed, and for the participation of the United States to come to an end.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee will consider a resolution, sponsored by President John Kerry (Democratic for Massachusetts), along with Senators John McCain (Republican for Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent for Connecticut), applauding the Libyans for their successful rebellion and US troops for their "valence."
"This resolution is to honor the brave people of Libya, as they begin to rebuild their country," Kerry said.
"It is an affirmation of bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations."
Language may seem harmless, but nothing about the debate on Libya has been easy so far.
This summer, the legislators of both parties were fighting with each other and with the White House on the drafting of a series of resolutions to approve or reject the role of the US military in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain filed a resolution authorizing the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated in the House by a broad bipartisan margin, which never came to be voted in the Senate.
But on the same day that the bill was rejected in the House, the House also rejected a measure that would have cut funds for US operations in Libya.
That left the US mission in a sort of legislative purgatory - with Congress annoying enough to criticize Obama's handling of the mission, but not as angry as to actually reap the grass under his feet.
The indecision of the Congress was then overcome by events.
Tripoli fell into the hands of the Libyan rebels in August, and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
Now the Senate could be ready to act.
The Foreign Affairs Committee resolution "congratulates the people of Libya for their tremendous courage and extraordinary resistance to liberate themselves" and "praising the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism."
The resolution also "declares the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new measure gain the full support of the Foreign Affairs Committee, or will it divide the legislators as did the June bill?
The last version was rejected by Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indian), the main Republican of the committee.
The Local Spokesman said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new bill.
On the other side of the Capitol, the House is going to vote this week on a constitutional amendment demanding a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republican congressmen and some Democrats.
The bill, sponsored by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Republican by Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment to the budget or any other matter that actually achieves a vote by the entire assembly in the House or Senate in this Congress.
Other legislators have not been successful so far in bringing their amendments to the assembly, but not for lack of attempts.
Goodlatte's is just one of 68 constitutional amendments that have been introduced in this Congress, covering a wide range of topics.
Some are duplicated - the same bill is proposed both in the House and in the Senate - and others with slight variations between themselves.
There are at least 15 versions of the budget balance amendment in the House alone, and another handful that "will control federal spending."
Some of these bills are also identical to each other, but they give their sponsors - especially novice Republicans who seek to refine their résumés - the opportunity to boast that they were the "authors" of this measure.
The Budget Control Act, which was passed in August, required both the House and the Senate to vote on an amendment to the budget balance.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution that supports the idea of that amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of terms that Congress members can serve, while representative José E. Serrano (New York Democrat) wants to remove the limit of two terms for presidents.
Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democratic for Illinois) has proposed a number of amendments that guarantee the right to quality education and health care, among other issues.
An amendment prohibiting homosexual marriage is a perennial proposal, as well as one prohibiting the burning of flags.
Some legislators also want to allow the annulment of federal laws if they are rejected by two thirds of states.
So enthusiastic that members have been in proposing amendments, they are not moving at a faster pace than in previous years.
At the 111th Congress, legislators proposed 77 amendments, and presented 66 in the 110th.
The pace is unacceptable compared to the 1990s when members regularly tabled more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they were not much more successful then than they are now.
The last amendment that was added - the 27 - was ratified in 1992, but in fact was proposed by Congress in 1789.
Giffords talks in his first TV interview since the shooting
Ten months after a gunman shot him on fire at a constituent act in Tucson, representative Gabrielle Giffords (Democratic for Arizona) appeared on national television on Monday night, sang accompanied by Broadway's melody "The sun will come out tomorrow" and said she wanted to recover more than she wanted to return to Congress.
At his appearance in ABC News "20/20", with Diane Sawyer, Giffords struggled to form prayers and needed help to walk.
The program documented his difficult way back from the damage caused by a bullet that fractured his skull and pierced the left side of his brain, and which passed from the front to the back of his head.
Three months ago, he came back by surprise to the House to cast his triumphant vote on the debt ceiling agreement.
In his first television interview since the January shooting, which killed six and wounded 13, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and described his recovery as "difficult".
When Sawyer asked him how he felt, 41-year-old Giffords replied, "Very well."
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of an hour-long special "20/20" program, which was released on the eve of the release of the couple's new book, "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope."
The special program analyzed the recovery of Giffords since the January 8 shooting.
In videos recorded by Kelly in the first few weeks, she is seen in her hospital bed, with her head shaved and a long scar crossing her forehead.
She can only keep one or two fingers up while her husband cheers her up.
Months later, Giffords is seen sitting in a wheelchair while therapists teach her how to perform simple actions.
A head move.
A frowning of the lips.
And then his first word, "What."
In a few days, Giffords uttered another word - "cooked", a change request on his breakfast menu.
Videos released by ABC show that music played a central role in the recovery of Giffords: The congresswoman is seen singing along with the therapists the songs "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" by Cyndi Lauper and "Free Falling" by Tom Petty.
In the interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who two hours ago in therapy every day, said he doesn't remember the day of the shooting.
Her husband said he was reading Giffords an article in the newspaper about the March 12 murder when she arrested him to ask for the first time about the six who had died in the incident.
The suspect gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is detained in a Missouri prison and is being forcibly medicated while awaiting trial.
"Many people died," Giffords told Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard."
Kelly told Sawyer that at a time of his wife's recovery, she said, "I've been defeated."
"So, I said, 'Gabby, you haven't been defeated," Kelly said.
"You've just been beaten.
And you're gonna get out of this, and you're gonna recover and you're gonna come back stronger than ever."
Troops make you feel more sorry than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about impotence, frustration and loss.
At that time, several hundred soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines broke into their posts around him.
The crowd of labels stood up and applauded.
"Men and women were considered heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the spring fundraiser.
A high-ranking military officer at the gala, also known as the then President of the Joint Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They showed them as some kind of orphan child," the officer wrote in an email.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know they had them.
But it wasn't respect, really.
The markedly contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship that has taken over the military and an American public often distant, sometimes worshipping.
Troops are praised for their sacrifices.
But praise has a price, the members of the service say.
The public is increasingly acting as if they were pitied by the uniformed.
"We are not victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded the troops in Iraq and will soon leave for Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way some people will show their support is to put us in the role of helpless souls."
The issue is a very sensitive one for military leaders, who do not want to appear ungrateful or disagree with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger faced by the troops who returned in the last years of the Vietnam war was much worse.
As a result, most of the grief talks are conducted quietly and privately among war veterans.
After their two children returned from fighting with the Navy Infantry, retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that people apart from the military would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with a sense of fear because they faced the insurgents and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if there would be an "angry and violent veteran under the surface," said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to high-level government work in Washington.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some interviewers had subtly asked him if he would be able to endure under pressure from a demanding Washington job immediately after his combat tour.
"When you talk about your service, you need to deal with negative impressions," Cancian recalled by telling his children.
The military concern arises, in part, from American indifference to wars.
Achievements on the battlefield are rarely chosen for praise by a country that has little familiarity with the military and sees few direct benefits from the wars of Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We, as a nation, no longer value military heroism in ways that were quite common in World War II," retired Lieutenant General David Barno, who commanded US troops in Afghanistan, said.
On the other hand, the praises of politicians and the public largely focus on the depth of the suffering of a member of the service.
The troops are recognized for the number of tours they have endured, the number of friends they have lost or the extent of their injuries.
Army faces growing pressure to end rape
This week, a historic hearing will decide whether 28 women and men have a case against the army for their alleged passivity in the face of rape.
If not, hundreds of plaintiffs are organizing for the next one.
First-class soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years and 11 weeks pregnant the night she says she was raped by a partner.
It was October 2008, and he was heading back to his headquarters at Miramar Air Base, north of San Diego, after dinner with a friend when he met a colleague who was carrying a pack of 12 cans of beer.
He asked her if she could join her in her room for a drink.
"It sounded like an alarm," says Lyman.
However, the Texas native left aside her concern.
I thought, no, he's 19.
"He's from Texas," he says.
"I wish I'd listened to my instincts."
Within minutes of entering Lyman's room, the man approached him from behind, pulling him down and raping her, he claims.
This week, on November 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military personnel eagerly await a court decision in a historic trial to be held in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether their lawsuit against former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will go to trial.
The claim alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to reduce the widespread violation among the military, in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
Presented in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, D.C., the lawsuit initially involved 17 plaintiffs, but grew to 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men, all claim that they were raped or sexually assaulted by their peers, and that the army failed to investigate, prosecute, or provide adequate justice after the alleged assaults.
Burke says he's going to get the army's main plane, because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a structure from top to bottom," he says.
"Who are the people who are in a position to eradicate the culture of reprisals?
Burke also says that since February, about 400 more survivors have been contacted, many of whom could be part of future demands.
Its strategy: Instead of accumulating all the applicants in this case, putting all the eggs in the same basket, so to speak, will present several cases, if necessary, to maintain the pressure.
The defence team for the Department of Defense, headed by federal prosecutor Neil MacBride, has filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defence strategy - in essence, that the military cannot be sued by current or former soldiers for injuries suffered in the armed forces.
By a 1950 Supreme Court ruling called the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for the damage suffered by active service personnel.
"The damage claimed is part of the plaintiffs' military service," the documents say.
The Department of Defense refused to comment on this article.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women are still officially forbidden to serve in combat, this distinction is only nominal: Modern wars rarely have clear front lines.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, women's soldier teams are playing increasingly important roles, especially to reach local women in war zones.
The result: between these two wars, 150 female soldiers have died and two thirds of them in combat situations.
It's time for the army to modernize, too, Burke says.
She's not alone in her struggle, and three other demands are underway, in addition to hers.
In Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Services Clinic is preparing a case against the four major military academies for allegedly promoting a misogynistic environment.
On the other hand, the non-profit Vietnam Veterans of America is filing a lawsuit against the army that focuses on the "personality disorder" diagnoses assigned to rape victims in order to release them from service - a common event, according to activists, such as Anu Bhagwati of the Women in Service Action Network, a human rights group.
His group filed a lawsuit in December against the Veterans Administration, accusing it of discriminatory practices in the way it handles benefit claims for persons who claim to have been sexually assaulted in the service.
Nine separate bills have been introduced in Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing a number of corrections.
In 2010, there were 3,158 reported sexual assaults, according to the Office for the Prevention of Sexual Assault and Response of the Department of Defense.
However, the attacks are significantly below reported, and by the Pentagon's own estimates, which accounted for approximately 13.5 per cent of the estimated 19,000 incidents that occurred that year.
The report, published in March, also examines the prosecution rates: in 2010, 20 per cent of the cases reported in the army went to trial - half as much as in the civil justice system.
The plaintiffs in Burke's case describe his attacks as just the first in a series of traumas.
In Lyman's case, he reported the alleged rape to the military police less than an hour after it occurred.
That night, he says, he was asked to count the details of his rape 11 times different from a crowd of police, doctors, and commanders.
She submitted to a rape kit, and her assailant's blood - from a cut in her arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended a hearing before a judge, during which he was asked about having sex with his boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six persons testified as personality witnesses on behalf of the alleged author, who was finally acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was read," says Lyman.
"I thought I was gonna go to work and I found myself screaming from the living room."
"They put me in the psych unit, and when I got out, I remember saying to my commanding officer, "That wasn't your judgment. That was my judgment."
Lyman was ordered to visit a military psychiatrist, who finally diagnosed a personality disorder, which made her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was released from service under less-than-honourable terms, preventing her from receiving any benefits.
As to whether the case presented by Lyman and his fellow plaintiffs continues, it is a very remote possibility, says John Turley, Professor of Law at George Washington Law School.
However, he points out, "In my opinion, they should be able to move forward."
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first published.
I've been a permanent critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The army is decades behind because it does not have the same incentive and deterrence as responsibility.
And he adds, "The odds are strongly against them... but it's important for them to try."
These things only change when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing doesn't go its way, Burke, counsel for the plaintiffs, will put her other hundreds of plaintiffs in line for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the army on this issue until the reform takes place," he says.
"Or until we die, whatever happens first.
The walls have eyes: How researchers are studying you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the far right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was simply another type that aired his anti-immigration views online.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to having carried out a massacre in Norway in July, who left 77 dead, faced his first public court hearing.
While Breivik may have acted alone, he was far from being alone in cyberspace: He had spent most of the time preceding his attack on his computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social media.
After this summer's tragedy, researchers wanted to know more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easy - you just have to go on Facebook.
"We realized that it wasn't that hard to get to them," says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recently published report on European digital populism by the UK DEMOS study centre.
Facebook's personal information stash is so encyclopedic, says Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the advertising tool to determine their desired demographic characteristics with scientific precision - the way vendors have been using it for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million fans of right-wing groups across Europe and then directed ads to them, but instead of linking them to a new band or diet product, ads invited users to complete a survey that asked about their educational level, attitudes towards violence and optimism about their own future.
Arriving via Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to study more than 10,000 followers of 14 extreme right-wing parties in 11 European countries - all without leaving the office.
"It's a whole new way to do an investigation," Bartlett says.
Some of the results are not at all surprising: Online supporters of right-wing groups tend to be young, men and angry with immigration.
However, in a kind of twist, "those who combine their online activism with offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who stand behind the computer screen."
DEMOS's work is just an example of how Facebook is becoming a new and important tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centers, medical researchers and political scientists are using the site to study everything, from health problems to social trends as expressed in the "I like", messages on the walls and state updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three pieces of content a day, Facebook's "data supernova" is generating an upsurge in research, driving the number of academic works with the name of the site in the title up to almost 800% in the last five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it allows you to study people you couldn't approach with a folder on the street.
"Before, when you were trying to survey people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You'd have to go through the game, and they'd never allow you access," Bartlett says.
"Facebook eliminates all that - you go to them directly."
Others say the site could provide a way to identify and address health-social problems.
A recent study conducted by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and her colleagues found that university students who talked about their drinking exploits on Facebook had a significantly higher risk of drinking problems than students who remained silent on the subject.
Moreno suggests that fellow students, such as residential counselors, could control the site and intervene to help a student who posts too many status updates with their drunkards.
"You can't deal with a problem if you can't diagnose it," said Dimitri Christakis, Moreno's co-author and director of the Child Health, Behavior and Development Center at Seattle's Institute for Child Research, the Washington Post said.
"We have found a way to identify children at risk who would otherwise not be diagnosed."
Facebook is also constantly "pinking" its own population for data.
The site's Data Team has compiled statistics on the status of the relationship and Valentine's Day, the expectation of electoral participation in the middle of the 2010 legislative period, and a National Happiness Index (mainly using the information that can be accessed - advocates of digital freedom long ago claiming that the site should make available to others its large amount of data for research).
However, Facebook users know that the site is watching, whether they like it or not - the sacrifice to be able to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away is to allow the site to mine your personal information.
But what happens when Facebook users become part of a survey they don't even know?
While researchers have well-defined guidelines on how to collect your data offline, online is a free bar for everyone.
"I don't think many of the users have even thought about the fact that a researcher might be looking at their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist from the London Knowledge Laboratory, about a 2006 study that he conducted with the student Facebook public walls.
"As far as they were concerned, it was only between them and their friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research topic is being completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know that part of the user profile information and wall messages are true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do off Facebook are two completely different things," Selwyn says.
That's why, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn believes that a clipboard and a pen are still the best research tools that no one can use.
"There is no substitute for entering the real world and talking to real people," he says.
"Social research is supposed to be about social - and a lot of social still happens offline."
"Cold and inhuman: Anders Behring Breivik makes his first public appearance in court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to being the brain of the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, has described himself as a "resistance" fighter during his first public appearance in the Oslo court.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and in the Templar Knights of Norway," he said in front of a room full of 500 people.
"I oppose the court, as it received the mandate of organizations that support the ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I recognize the facts, but I do not plead guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during that monologue, because "he did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform to express his views."
For the same reason he refused to allow Breivik, who brought a written speech in advance, to address the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, banned him from access to the media for four weeks, and said the authorities would have to have strict control over all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came with the hope of looking Breivik in the eyes, others to confirm that he is locked up.
All attended with the aim of moving towards conclusion.
"I thought it seemed cold and inhuman," a survivor of Utoya said to the Norwegian station NRK.
"It was uncomfortable, but for me it was a step forward after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Dressed in a dark suit and blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the audience and looked journalists and survivors in the eye when he entered and exited the building.
Despite Breivik's strange notion of being part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge determined that he is not a mentally ill, and said that there is no evidence that he acted with accomplices.
Some may be comforted by the fact that the July 22 attacks seem to be the work of an extremist rather than a group of radicals.
But that does not automatically soften the pain and confusion that an entire nation still feels.
"I'd like it to look like a monster, but it doesn't," said a relative of a victim.
"It would be a lot easier if it looked like it."
7 Lessons from Steve Jobs' lost interview, shown in a theater this week
After the death of Steve Jobs on October 5, there were some who compared him to Henry Ford - distinguishing the genius from technology as the Great Modern Inventor.
But what Apple fans might find most revealing, in a recently rediscovered Job interview that has been dusted as an advance of a series of special projections in the biggest markets this week, is how much this creative mind understood about the business processes and workflows of the products.
He was undoubtedly a self-recognized designer, dreamer and hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer and a flow diagram yonki - a man who believed that many executives suffered "a disease that consists in thinking that a great idea is 90 percent of the work... [but] there is a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely was developing the television series The Triumph of the Nerds on the dawn of the personal computer, and sat for more than an hour with Jobs for an extensive and rare conversation.
At that time it had been barely 10 years since Jobs had been forced to leave Apple, and he was already working intensively on his new NeXT computer company, waiting for the popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of Cringely's interview was used in Nerds, he said the originals of the interview disappeared during his transport.
It was only after the death of Jobs that a full copy was discovered in VHS in the director's garage.
This slightly reissued archive material is the basis of Steve Jobs: The 68-minute lost interview that arrives at the Landmark cinemas this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known to hate in-depth interviews, Jobs here seems surprisingly willing to expose their technological philosophies and business strategies.
And very thoughtful.
At four different points throughout the interview, there are great silences between the questions and the answers - from 10 to 15 seconds of reflections, where Jobs is clearly weighing his thoughts, seeking precision.
There are also times when Job's perfectionism comes to the surface, where he seems impatient due to Cringely's questions, pushing him to move faster towards the most important topics or arguments.
Filmed before the Pixar era, the iPod or the iPhone, there is something strangely prophetic in The Lost Interview, when Jobs evaluates what he sees other companies doing right and wrong, and offers his own vision of the future of computing.
One thing is to read posthumous evaluations of Jobs' career, but there is something raw and inspiring about the Jobs that we see here, the dreamer anxious at the edge of greatness.
He has a vision of how things can and should be.
Not long after explaining everything in detail here, it was and did.
A quick summary of seven notable sequences of The Lost Interview:
About how he learned to run a business:
"Over the years in business, I always asked, "Why do you do things?" and the answers that give you invariably are, "Oh, that's just the way it's done."
Nobody knows why they do what they do, in business nobody thinks about things very deeply.
That's what I found.
Jobs takes to detail their efforts to simplify Apple's accounting.
Disconcerted by the way in which the costs were recorded - often starting with a "standard cost" that was done with a good cover eye, and which was then adjusted with a "variable" - it developed an automated factory that ensured that they could determine the commercial costs in detail.
About the Pope's joke:
Jobs narrates the "Blue Box" that he himself built with Steve Wozniak - a device that allowed people to effectively hack the phone company and make free long-distance calls.
It has been written extensively about the device, but the euphoria of Jobs here describing the Blue Box as an act of empowerment is contagious.
It describes how he and Wozniak tested the box using a pay phone, making a call, and then connecting from one AT & T network to another, while creating a loop with as many satellites as possible.
"We were wrapping things around the world half a dozen times and you were screaming through the pay phone and going back a minute later to the pay phone next door," says Jobs with a laugh.
"We were young and what we learned was that we could build something ourselves that could control billions of dollars in infrastructure around the world."
We both didn't know much, but we could build a little thing that could control a giant thing - it was an incredible lesson, and I don't think Apple would ever have existed without it.
Jobs continues to describe a glorious joke that he and Wozniak almost abandoned, calling the Vatican through the Blue Box in the middle of the night and asking to speak to the Pope, while doing his best imitation of Henry Kissinger.
As several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to speak with the American diplomat, the two burst into jeopardy just before the Pope himself was awakened to answer the phone.
About falling in love with technology (and selling by phone with Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, hunting for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he looked for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and made a call.
Shortly after his 20-minute phone conversation, Jobs obtained a part-time summer job in Hewlett-Packard.
"That was a remarkable influence on me, it was the only company I had seen at that age and formed my vision of what a company was and how well they treated their employees."
Jobs later became one of HP's employees who visited the company's research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desk computer ever made."
It was as big as a suitcase, it had a small cathode-tube screen, and I fell in love with it.
I'd get a trip to HP as a teenager and waste time with that machine and write programs for her.
On improvising innovation:
At several points in the interview, Jobs talks about inventing new products on the move.
Soon in his career, as he dedicated himself to selling a handful of base plates, a client asked him if he could assemble the entire team.
Working with only 30 days of credit, I had to find out the assembly and delivery of the finished devices.
Later, while in Apple, he recalls the struggles he faced in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember having dramatic arguments... they were yelling at me that it would take five years [to create a mouse that would cost $300], and I got tired and I left and found a designer.
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could build for $15 and that was totally reliable.
On big companies losing strength:
Long before he led Apple's renaissance, Jobs prophetically predicted how many industry leaders would stumble into his vision, and lose control of his market share.
"Say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make photocopiers and printers better, so what?"
You have the monopoly of market share, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing departments increase success, so it is this kind of people who end up leading companies and people in charge of products are expelled from the decision-making forum.
The genius of the products that led to this monopoly position is rotted by people who do not have the notion of good products vs bad products - knowledge of the necessary trade.
That's what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
It could have been ten times its size, it could have been the Microsoft of the 90s...
They took the defeat of victory.
On innovation as an artistic expression:
"There is a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product... as the great idea evolves, changes and grows."
Much is learned about the subtleties of it.
There are sacrifices you have to make - some things you can't make the electrons, the glass makes them, the robots do them, the factories do them.
You have to keep 5000 things in your brain - these concepts - adjust them all at once...
In the end everything is reduced to taste - it is reduced to trying to expose you to the best that a team of humans has done, and then try to adapt those things to those things that you are doing.
Picasso said good artists copy, great artists steal.
We've never been ashamed about stealing big ideas.
What made Macintosh great in part was that the people who were working on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, who were by chance the best computer scientists in the world.
If it wasn't for computer science, I could be doing wonderful things in other fields.
Scalia and Thomas dine with the rivals of the health care law while the court accepts the case
The day the Supreme Court met in private to examine the politically controversial issue of whether they would accept the challenge to President Obama's health care law, two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were hoarded at a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will present the case to the High Court.
The occasion was last Thursday, when the nine judges met at a preliminary hearing to study carefully the requests for review.
One of the cases in question was a petition by 26 states challenging the total reform of health care passed by Congress last year, a law that has been a war cry for conservative activists across the country.
The judges agreed to admit the lawsuit to trial and, in fact, a five-and-a-half-hour historical allegation is expected by March, and the outcome will likely further disrupt the 2012 presidential race, which will be in full swing at the time the court's decision is known.
The lawyer who will appear in court and argue that the law must be dismissed will probably be Paul Clement, who served as U.S. Attorney General during George W. Bush's rule.
Clement's law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the Federalist Society's annual dinner, a group that has been dedicated to upholding conservative legal principles for many years.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the litigation.
Dinner was held in a Washington hotel hours after the court hearing on the case.
Among the attendees were Mitch McConnell, the most important Republican in the Senate and a declared opponent of the health care law.
Special guests at dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
It's nothing new: The two judges have been attending Federalist Society events for years.
And it's not something that conflicts with ethical standards.
In fact, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct governing the actions of lower federal judges.
If they were not, it might be said that they would fall under the Canon 4C Code, which says: "A judge may attend events to raise funds from law - related organizations and others, although the judge may not be a speaker, a guest of honor, or appear on the program of such an event. "
However, the absolute proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the law firms in the case, as well as to a company with a huge financial interest, was enough to alarm the ethics activists in the government.
"This impressive gap in ethics and indifference to the code goes against the demands of several judges who obey the court for the same rules that apply to all federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of Common Cause.
"The judges were hoarded in a gala fundraiser with lawyers who have cases pending before the court."
Their appearance and assistance in raising funds for this event undermines any demand for impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little interest in the criticism that they say mix too easily the court's activity with the agenda driven by groups such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife, Ginni, is a prominent conservative activist.
On the other hand, conservatives argue that it is Judge Elena Kagan, who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan worked as Attorney General of the Obama administration when the first legal challenges to the law were presented in the court of first instance.
His critics have pressured Kagan to refrain from seeing the case, saying she was too involved in defending the law as to now be impartial.
Kagan has given no indication that he will.
Boeing receives a record order of $18 billion
The Emirates airline asks for 50 aircraft with a double Boeing 777 corridor, with an option of 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner aircraft to Oman Air, an operation valued at over a billion dollars.
Rarely is news when a company gets an order for 50 units of its product.
But it's a big deal when the company is the Boeing Co. aircraft manufacturer and the selling price for the 50 aircraft amounts to a record $18 billion.
It is as large as the place from which Boeing received the order: Middle East, a gold mine growing from future aircraft orders.
In a study released on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that for the next 20 years, airlines in the Middle East will need 2,520 planes worth $450 billion.
Boeing announced during the weekend its largest order of history for commercial aircraft worth in dollars - 50 jets Boing 777 double corridor.
The successful order came from the Emirates airline in Dubai.
The airline also has an option to buy 20 more aircraft, which would raise the total selling price to $26 billion, announced Boeing at the Dubai Air Show 2011.
Then, on Monday, Boeing said that Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, which boasts fuel savings and spectacular passenger services.
The selling price for six of them is over $1 billion.
"This clearly has a huge positive effect on Boeing," said Morningstar Neal Dihora analyst.
"The quality of these particular customers is very strong."
Many airlines in the Middle East are owned by their oil-producing nations.
Therefore, not only do they have the money to pay for airplanes, but an increase in fuel prices - usually harmful to airlines, because it is one of the biggest costs - is not so damaging, because the country is making money with rising oil prices.
That's important because they are less likely than other airlines to cancel or delay flight orders when fuel prices rise, Dihora said.
"They have natural protection," he said.
The Emirates' request solidifies Boeing's leadership in the market for wide fuselage aircraft and helps keep its competitor Airbus SAS's attempt to invade its domain with the A350 passenger aircraft at bay.
Boeing's victory at the air fair takes place four months after Airbus said it was going to delay the debut of the biggest A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
He delayed the debut to add more momentum after customers demanded an increase in payload and range.
Boeing Co's shares rose by 1.5 per cent to $67.94.
The sister of the President of Mexico, apparently defeated in Michoacán's vote
Luisa María Calderón claims that the drug traffickers helped her PRI opponent, Fausto Vallejo, in the contest for governor.
President Felipe Calderón's sister seems to have lost her candidacy as governor of Michoacán during the violent state elections, and she stated on Monday that drug traffickers helped tilt the race in favor of one of her opponents.
Preliminary results led to Fausto Vallejo, of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, being the governor of the western state.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the electoral process and, especially yesterday, is alarming, not only for Michoacán, but for the whole country," said Luisa María Calderón in a radio interview one day after Sunday's vote.
"They threatened our candidates, our election workers... they took over the polls, installed barricades... and ordered people to vote" in favor of the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost the presidency in 2000.
However, it is the staging of a return, and victory in Michoacán is an important step in that effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential elections in July.
Vallejo seems to have outstripped Calderón, who had led the polls before the elections.
Calderón, a candidate of his brother's conservative National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the left-wing candidate for the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, who currently holds the post of governor, was in third place, a great defeat for the divided and unfortunate left before the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to acknowledge the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the state capital of Morelia, denied links with drug trafficking and urged the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.
It is President Calderón's home state, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military offensive against the traffickers in December 2006.
However, violence has persisted.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the election while campaigning for Luisa María Calderón, and many candidates left the local candidatures out of fear.
Although for the PRI, no matter how unpleasant the election looks to Michoacán, a victory will help push the party forward.
The man who is supposed to represent the PRI in the presidential election, Enrique Peña Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said, "I think this victory should be very encouraging, in view of next year."
ADB urges Asia to help rescue the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has called on India and China to prepare to help rescue the eurozone from its sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term recession that would prevent the growth of Asian economies.
Rajat Nag, Managing Director of the Asian Development Bank based in Manila, said the two fastest-growing economies in the world had to "do everything possible" to accelerate the recovery of the economic bloc either through the International Monetary Fund or directly through bilateral agreements.
He warned against the BRIC [Brazil, Russia, India, China] countries that observe Europe's difficulties in a "unbiased" manner and said that Asia's financial assistance along with European leadership and resources would help prevent a long-term crisis in the global economy.
"We're all in this together."
"So anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis is useful," he told the Financial Times in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asia can be protected to some extent, but it cannot be immune."
"So if China and India can help, let it be by all means."
European monetary union has been severely undermined by a sovereign debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy's borrowing costs have gone up dangerously and the Italian and Greek prime ministers have resigned.
The current sovereign debt crisis in Europe has increased fears that it could push the world economy into recession and has generated calls for major emerging economies to join together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that any support from Asia would be channelled through the IMF, but he said that bilateral assistance - such as the purchase of bonds from the EU rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Fund - offered greater bargaining power for Asian partners in Europe.
Anand Sharma, Indian Minister of Commerce, said that "India will do everything possible" to help the eurozone as its own economy was now suffering from the drop in exports and the depletion of foreign capital inflows.
"No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent," he said.
"We have monumental challenges and we have to maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not an option, it's an imperative, because where do we find jobs for tens of millions of our young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies like India have no responsibility to help rich Europeans when faced with their own profound economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, professor at Brown University in the U.S., said it would be politically very difficult to sell aid to Europe for the billion two hundred thousand people in India, of whom up to 800 million live on about $2 a day or less.
"Sometimes they will realize that the Greeks retire at the age of 50 and go on vacation to the beaches and that won't go well," he said.
Lee Howell, Managing Director of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India's reserves should be used to keep the many well-paid workers in the Greek public sector, in jobs of poorly run companies, and generating losses such as railways.
Mr Nag said that the eurozone crisis threatens "significant chain effects" throughout Asia.
The Asian Development Bank's forecast of 7.5 percent economic growth in Asia for 2011/12 now faces "low risk" due to Europe's threat.
He said that vulnerable emerging markets needed to make " contingency plans" to protect themselves from a crisis and significant capital outflows from their economies.
Pentagon's serious warnings about possible defence cuts
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta warmed the Congress on Monday, warning that the upcoming automatic budget cuts could undermine national security and trigger a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon corridors, to the battlefields of Afghanistan, to the civilian assembly chains.
The Pentagon is already digesting $450 billion in reductions over the next decade, but now fears an additional $600 billion or more in cuts that may be imminent if Congress fails to reach agreement on spending.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating to the department," Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, Republican for Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, Republican for South Carolina.
He said that the failure of Congress to reach agreement on the budget and its consequence, the so-called "kidnapping," would result in 23 percent global reductions and a halt to many new projects.
"Such a large cut, applied in this indiscriminate way, would make most of our shipbuilding and construction projects impossible to execute - you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and seriously damage other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We would also be forced to remove many of our civil servants involuntarily and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, it is almost certain that we would have to dismiss civilians in order to achieve the goal."
"These changes would break faith with those who maintain our army and would seriously damage good will."
The cuts over time would reach the combat troops, Panetta said.
"While wartime financing in the accounts of Overseas Contingency Operations is not directly affected by the kidnapping, war efforts would be negatively affected by serious disruptions in the core budgets," Panetta warned.
"The recruitment of personnel would be reduced, leading to delays in the contracts and supervision of the contract that supports the war."
"The payroll staff would be reduced, leading to delays in payments to suppliers in time of war, and legal and political support would be interrupted."
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days ago, asking for information on the possible impact of automatic cuts on the Department of Defense.
"The consequence of a kidnapping in the Department of Defense would lead to a rapid decline in the United States as the world's main military power."
"We are firmly against this draconian action," Senators said in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when they published Panetta's letter.
"This is not a result you can live with, and it is certainly not one we should impose ourselves with."
"Abduction is a threat to the interests of the national security of the United States, and it should not be allowed to happen."
If Panetta's letter and Senators' recent warnings increase the pressure for a budget commitment or intensify calls to exempt the Pentagon from cuts is to be seen.
Panetta has been more and more frank about the possible cuts, even though she came to work at the top of the Pentagon with years of budget experience in Congress and the White House and knowing that she was facing difficult decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Defense Secretary painted a gloomy picture of what might be ahead - an army with a shell, but not a core.
"It's a boat without sailors."
"It's a bulletless brigade."
"It's an aerial wing without enough trained pilots."
"It's a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough soldiers trained to carry out the mission," Panetta said in his opening words at the Pentagon.
"It is a force that suffers from low morale, poor preparation and is unable to keep up with potential adversaries."
"Indeed, he invites aggression..."
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta sets out new details of how reductions "create significant operational risks: delay in response time to crises, conflicts and disasters; severely limits our ability to be deployed and committed previously around the world; and poses an unacceptable risk in future combat operations."
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defense projects could face the axe, including those that are already being tested and some only in the early stages of planning.
This list includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter fighter, a new planned bomber, the new generation ballistic submarine, the new coastal combat ship and the new ground combat vehicle that the Army and Navy need to replace, the humvee.
Stopping the development and additional testing of the F35 could generate about $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but its supporters say it is the next vital step in improving and addressing the potential threats of China and other rivals.
How to detect a lie
A look at the most recent headlines tells us how serious and omnipresent deception and lying are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging allegations of sexual harassment with several women; each party accuses of lying to the other.
The administrators of Pennsylvania State University have been accused of perjury for allegedly hiding reports that a retired football coach was sexually assaulting children.
Last week, French President Nicolás Sarkozy was "pilled" with an open microphone affirming US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
Lying has destroyed careers and convulsed countries.
The New York Congressman and Internet exhibitor, Anthony Weiner, made a mockery of his denials quickly rebutted by the irrefutable test.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been charged with infractions in campaign funding related to the cover-up of an extramarital relationship.
And again, no one who lived it will ever forget the media circus unleashed by President Bill Clinton when he lied during his second term about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Legends of traps in school and university examinations are widespread.
There have been cases where teachers have given the answers of the exams to students in order to be better seen in their performance evaluations.
Mentors who should be teaching otherwise are sending the message that lying and cheating are acceptable.
How much deception do we find?
On any day, studies show that they can lie to you anywhere from 10 to 200 times.
That's for sure, many of those lies are godly lies.
Another study showed that strangers lied three times in the first 10 minutes of getting to know each other.
Detecting lies, or "the location of lies", is an essential skill that we must all acquire, for both personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a table game similar to, for example, Charada, where the goal is to exclaim: "I have you", the detection of deception is a branch of serious knowledge based on scientific data obtained over the last six decades in prestigious universities that carried out in-depth research projects, especially in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the investigation is that the old myths about the lie have been rebutted.
The liars do look into their eyes.
They don't always stutter, babbling, blush, or restless.
Nor can it be concluded that liars are difficult to detect or unmask.
A trained lie detector can come to the truth by learning about the structure of the statement, microfacial expressions, question formation, and times.
I spent several years canvassing scientific discoveries about deception in the vast and ever-emerging body of knowledge, and it was clear that the detection of deception is a modern technique that is easy to learn and helps navigate our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring, interviews, or negotiation management.
Good liars have the ability to read well to others, making them feel at ease, managing their own emotions and intuitively feeling how others perceive them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more than introverts, that men say more "minority oriented towards themselves," while women say more lies "directed towards others" -- usually to protect someone's feelings -- that married people lie less often to their partners than non-married people (but the lies they usually say tend to be "huge").
We also know that if you are perceived as an evildoer, others will feel less guilty when you lie to him.
How do you know if someone's lying?
First, observe the usual behavior of the subject.
This is called "creating a baseline."
Helps provide benchmarks to measure changes later.
Observe the posture of the subject, laughter and vocal characteristic.
It's best that you know if someone normally hits his foot all the time so you don't make unfair accusations when he sees his feet hitting in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for deceptive, verbal and non-verbal behavior groups.
Consider these behavior groups as alarm signals, not as evidence of deception.
People who cheat can freeze the upper part of the body by trying to remember their story, can point their feet towards the door, lean towards an exit, change their posture meaningfully, or display a "post-interview relief" -- that exaggerated sigh of relief and change of posture once all the difficult questions are over.
Interrogators often falsely show that the interview has ended just to seek that post-interview relief.
He also pays attention to the subject's vocabulary.
Scott Peterson screwed up and used the past time as he claimed that his murdered wife was alive, launching a nationwide search for her.
People who cheat can also use a distance language: "I did not have sex with that woman... Miss Lewinsky" or repeat a difficult question in its entirety.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "restrictive language" when they answer a difficult question: "Well... to tell you the truth... until I understand it."
This makes the answer a perception rather than a fact and is often a warning signal.
There is no magic formula for detecting lies, but developing skills to discover deception is possible.
These skills will improve the possibilities of anyone to avoid being victimized by the con artists in their professional and personal lives.
The controversial plan of the diverted pipeline following the threat of US delay in its approval
Days after Obama's administration threatened to delay the approval of a planned pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- enraged trade unions as it appeased ecologists -- the company seeking to build the pipeline says it is willing to redirect the project to reroute it.
TransCanada said Monday night that it will move the planned pipeline out of the ecologically sensitive area of Sandhills in Nebraska, and trusts that the project will gain approval.
The company announced the decision at the press conference at the Nebraska Capitol.
TransCanada's manager, Alex Pourbax, says the company maintains its confidence that the pipeline will eventually be approved, although it is true that with a different route.
This comes after the announcement last week by the State Department that they would delay the decision by a federal permit for the project until new potential routes to avoid the areas of Nebraska Sandhills and the Ogallala aquifer, a vast supply of groundwater, were studied.
"This is a real path of progress," Representative Lee Terry, Nebraska Republican, told Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the State Department may set aside any decision until 2013, after next year's elections, although officials denied that the policy was involved in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the Department of State's request, and expressed his full support to them.
The 1,700-kilometre pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would take 700,000 barrels a day from Alberta province to refineries in Texas.
To do this, it would be necessary for him to cross six states.
He is hated by the ecologists, but loved by the working groups, who have bet on the estimate of 20,000 jobs linked to the pipeline.
But Nebraska legislators opposed to the plan are weighing down legislation to force a departure from the Sandhills region and the Ogallala aquifer, the largest source of drinking water and irrigation.
The Department of State's current environmental impact study found that the project only had limited adverse environmental impacts, but the source of the energy industry said that the department's Inspector General has ordered an independent test of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is whether the lobby member hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliot, who was Hillary Clinton's campaign advisor in 2008, represents a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is whether a signature that was hired to run the original study was an inappropriate choice because it was linked to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle sued for allegedly causing a child to throw up in fear
A New York family claim that the diva of disco music, Patti LaBelle, behaved like a madwoman in the lobby of her Manhattan building, landing her little daughter to the point that she threw up in fear.
The diatribe of the singer of "Lady Marmalade" frightened 18-month-old Genevieve Monk, so much so that she suffered "personality changes, sleep disorders" and "increased her fear of strangers," says her family at the Manhattan Supreme Court.
It was on November 10th last year when Tramoist Kevin Monk, his wife, Roseanna, kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were preparing to go on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was taking the car, Roseanna Monk went down to the lobby of the Riverside Boulevard building, with her luggage, taking Genevieve.
Roseanna Monk said she stood by the door and put her daughter on the floor for a moment.
"Someone came up from behind and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said, "Yes," and I went to get her," she said.
LaBelle admonished the pregnant woman.
"He said in an aggressive tone, "I shouldn't have left his daughter by the door," Roseanna Monk said.
"I said, "I have no interest in what you say or think."
He got angry and started using bad words - the word C and the word J out loud...
He had a bottle of water and started to throw the water out of the bottle on me."
He said Genevieve got hysterical.
"I told this woman, "Look what you've done to my daughter," said the child's mother.
LaBelle shook herself over the mother -- who was still subject to Genevieve -- and had to be restrained by her surroundings and removed from a car waiting for her, Roseanna Monk said.
The little girl was crying so hard that she threw up, she added.
Later, the family sent a note asking for an apology from LaBelle, but did not get an answer.
The lawyer and LaBelle representatives did not return the calls to comment on what had happened.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, but family lawyer Sam Davis said he took the case for free and the family plans to donate all the money it can to a support association for children with cancer.
"The purpose is to make Patti LaBelle responsible for her behavior," Davis said.
"That kind of behavior is completely unacceptable, especially when it is directed at a kindergarten teacher who carries an 18-month-old child in her arms."
Climate adversity braked the economy
During the first year of management of Mario López Valdez, in Sinaloa has increased unemployment and informality, decreased foreign investment and contracted the economy
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of the government of Mario López Valdez, self-named of the change, that generated great expectations regarding the progress in the economy, but given the climate adversity of the beginning of the year, there is no growth, instead there is a deterioration in the main indicators of economic development.
The low temperatures of February, in addition to causing millions of losses for the agricultural sector, limited the possibilities of the state economy to grow, caused a contraction in economic activity in general of 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, mainly justified by the historical drop of 31.16 percent in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of the other economic sectors.
According to the report of effects on frost, issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, there were damage to 582,835 hectares of cultivated land, of which 78,03 percent suffered total damage and the remaining 21.07 percent suffered partial damage, the main crops damaged were vegetables, corn and chickpeas.
The fall in economic activity has generated, until November, a steady increase in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the rate of state unemployment during the first three quarters of the year was observed an accelerated growth, since while January to March 55,053 people were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 percent of the economically active population, for the second quarter the rate increased to 5,28 percent, and between July and September the average continued to rise to 6,19 percent, a rate that casts more than 74,000 unemployed people, an increase over the first half of 18,969 individuals.
Less liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, for economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the growth of unemployment can be explained indirectly, depending on the actions that have been carried out from public policy.
"What is being seen is an increase in unemployment that has to do with several factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market due to the effects of a restriction of resources by the legislation that was passed at the congress to combat money laundering, already for people who illegally grab dollars it is not easy for them to work, invest and use them in something," he said.
Detained migration
López Cervantes pointed out that there is also a demographic factor in the rise in unemployment.
"The number of people leaving the state in search of work abroad, in the United States has been restricted, first because of the difficulties to enter, and second because entering already have many difficulties to find work, these people are staying and are demanding sources of work here in the state, which makes unemployment rise," he said.
Informality
The analysis of the Danish labour market is aggravated by considering the high level of informality that prevails among working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 per cent of the population employed in the state works without being contributing as a worker to any social security institution.
Together with unemployment and informality, another of the state's labor lags are low wages, the entity has the lowest wages in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Social Security Institute and the Ministry of Labour and Social Security.
The average monthly income of the Danish workers was, until September, 5 thousand 352 pesos, well below the national average, located at 7 thousand 375 pesos.
Contraction of FDI
Combined with the decline in economic activity and the increase in unemployment, during 2011 there was the largest decline in foreign direct investment in the last 10 years, according to the Ministry of Economy from January to June of the state FDI totaled $630,697, representing a decrease of 87.74 per cent compared to the $5,143,312 registered during the same period of the previous year.
For its part, the Ministry of Economic Development of the State Government accounts for a total investment of 17.280 million pesos in the year, mainly from companies in the tertiary sector.
Debt
Faced with the economic downturn, the state government asked the state congress in July to approve a loan of 3 billion pesos, which would be earmarked for investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, in order to revive the economy, the approval of the local congress was for an amount of 2 billion pesos, and until November they have not observed the benefits of indebtedness in any sector of the state economy.
Reactions
For representatives of the business sector, Mario López Valdés' first year of government shows a lack of management capacity of the government.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of Transformation Industry, said that during 2011 there was no harmonization of the will of the various sectors, including the state government itself.
"The performance of the economy in Sinaloa during this year has been really very poor, we have to work intensively to recover the ground that we lost this year, in 2012 we have to redouble our efforts, failed to align the effort of everyone and above all the already synchronised good march of this new government team, we hope that next year will be much better," he said.
Economic slowness
Loredo López stated that events like the frosts of the beginning of the year stopped the state economy and restricted its performance and growth.
"The low economic flow is the product of several events, including frost, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that doesn't turn fast enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows us to have an acceptable level of flow in processes, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year we are closing well below our expectations," he said.
Redefining vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confederación Patronal de la República Mexicana in Sinaloa, said it is necessary to prosecute the state towards productive activities of greater dynamism.
"In general terms we have observed that we have been working, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program that redefines the vocation and economic direction of the state, because it is important that the full potential of the material and human resource Sinaloa has detonated," he said.
Work to be done
The president of Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision for the future that better addresses the Government's efforts.
"In general terms, I would say that the Government has been striving to achieve good results in various areas, in terms of economic development there is some progress, but it is important that a long-term programme be developed," he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown progress in its way of conducting public policy.
"There are elements that make it possible to say that the government is being more inclusive, I can say that there is work done and I think the government is aware that there is work to be done," he said.
He's convicted of 8 kilos of marijuana.
Five years in prison and a fine of 100 days was imposed on a neighbor of Navolato for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The Office of the Attorney General of the Republic reported that the narcomenudist sentenced is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for the crime against health, in his variant of possession of marijuana for commercial purposes.
According to the AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I file, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by elements of the Mexican Army on 7 June 2010 in a surveillance operation on Cipriano Valdez Street, opposite post 80, in the village of El Castillo, Navolato.
The narcenonutist was circulating in a white pick-up truck, where he was carrying a black bag in the vehicle box and in the co-pilot's seat a small backpack, where the military found eight kilograms of marijuana.
For these reasons, the insured person remained at the disposal of the Second District Judge and the sentenced person remains in the Centre for the Execution of the Legal Consequences of Crime.
It must contribute to works
Social works included in programmes such as Habitat, Public Space Rescue and 3x1 for migrants are at risk of not being completed or having serious delays due to lack of economic resources, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The director of municipal social development indicated that although the work programmes have progressed so far, they are at risk by failing to comply with the State Government's contributions, which amount to more than 11 million pesos in the three programmes.
He pointed out that in total the investment in these three programmes is almost 50 million pesos, of which the State accounts for 25 per cent and that so far only the Federation and the Municipality have provided resources for the works, so that the possible delay in the completion of these works becomes effective.
"It's almost 12 million that they have to contribute and even though the year is about to end they haven't given us a fifth, when since July they had to give us a share," he said, "we, in order not to delay, have started the works and are very advanced, but we need the money."
He mentioned that last year, in the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the state did not comply with their contributions, so at the beginning of the administration the municipality had to apply for a credit to cover the more than 7 million that did not provide the state administration on that occasion.
"It has already happened to us in the previous six years because the state did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programs continued to walk, and this year we had to get the resources to cover what the state left pending," he said.
Despite the commitment of the State authorities to meet the delivery of these resources, he noted that the request had been made to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to expedite efforts to ensure that the percentages corresponding to them reached as soon as possible.
"It's almost 12 million that they have to contribute and even though the year is about to end they haven't given us a fifth."
Valid "analog blackout" in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of analog signals by digital is one of the most important changes the world has undergone in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) rejected the constitutional disputes brought by the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies against the presidential decree that advances the so-called "analogue blackout" from 2021 to 2015, by not gathering the eight votes necessary to invalidate it.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his powers by issuing the decree detailing the actions to be taken to implement the transition to digital terrestrial television.
With this result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic was dismissed for failing to reach a qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to rule on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and the decree remains in force.
The draft judgment, drawn up by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed declaring the decree unconstitutional, because the regulation of radio and television matters is a statutory reserved power of the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of hierarchical subordination and reservation of law.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted for the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies promoted two constitutional disputes to challenge the decree, and by admitting the demands, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions in it arranged for the digital transition.
The plenary of ministers also decided to dismiss the request made by the Chamber of Deputies, without going into the discussion of the project, also by Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Minister-President said that he did not agree with the project's arguments that the federal executive could not structure through general rules the measures for the public administration to be prepared.
"I do not consider that if I did so, the autonomy of the regulatory body would be affected," he recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the federal executive, who has the constitutional mandate, the rectorate of the state.
The replacement of analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has undergone in recent years, and results in better use of the radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
Deferring the change, he said, would be to postpone the benefits of digitisation, which implies a decision in the public interest, which does not only have a technical dimension, "as it covers economic, social, political and national security issues".
These issues, he stressed, "require the operation of the entire established system, in accordance with the principle of economic rectorship of the State, includes a group of powers that the Constitution leads to the power of the State Executive".
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world have already completed the digital transition, and have done so through the Executive, despite having highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, in issuing the contested decree, which somehow invades the sphere of competence of the Congress, since compliance with the laws issued by the Legislature is being ensured in the administrative sphere.
They analyze the possibility of a "vote-by-vote" count in Michoacán
According to the data released by the PREP the difference between first and second place of the governor's election is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6,000 74 minutes total.
The possibility of counting "vote by vote" is a reality in terms of this year's election process in Michoacán, where according to the data released by the Preliminary Electoral Results Program (PREP) the difference between first and second place in the election of governor is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 out of the 6 thousand 74 total minutes.
In this regard, the President of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, just on 9 November, the electoral body adopted a series of guidelines in order to harmonize local rules with federal electoral reform.
As will be recalled, Michoacán did not approve his Political Constitution or Electoral Code of the State or its Electoral Justice Act, since the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the completion of the legal deadline for them to enter into force in the current electoral process, and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel omitted to publish them within the deadlines provided for in the State Newspaper Act, arguing that he had some objections.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional dispute promoted by the local legislature and called the state's representative's vote on constitutional reforms "invalid and illegal", since he has no right to "sanction or veto them".
Interviewed about the possibility of "vote by vote", María de los Angeles Llanderal explained that thanks to the approval of the corresponding guidelines by the General Council of the IEM it will be possible to carry out partial and total counts of the vote by the local electoral body.
In this way, the partial counting of votes, of one or more electoral packages, may take place on the assumption that: the results of the minutes do not coincide; there is no record of scrutiny and calculation in the file of the box or does not work in the possession of the president of the same; or, where there are obvious errors or alterations in the records.
In addition, the total count of the vote received in all the boxes of the election may be made where there is evidence that the difference between the candidate presumed winner of the election in question and the candidate who obtained the second place in the vote is equal to or less than one percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the session there is an express request from the representative of the party and/or coalition who applied for the second of the nominated candidates.
The total count of the vote may also be made if at the end of the ordinary count it is established that the difference between the candidate allegedly winning and the candidate second is equal to or less than one percentage point, provided that there is an express request from the representative of the political party whose candidate was second, in which case electoral packages which have been partially counted will be excluded.
It should be mentioned that in this situation there is the election of Morelia, where according to the PREP the difference between the first and the second place is only 0.16 percent, but without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total minutes.

Some people didn't believe him because they said he was even getting dizzy in the truck; however, he always tried to fulfill his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio reminds him as a very good person, "only in Saltillo was the whole family wanted to greet him, as the occasion when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo".

Three abandoned corpses are located in Caderoyta NL farm
Hours before the discovery, the military authority brought before the media eleven persons who were arrested in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found shot to death in different parts of the body and with the shot of grace, on an abandoned farm in the municipality of Caderoyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The discovery took place on the 1.5 km road from Caderoyta to Santiago, at the height of the community known as El Castillo.
Several people who passed through the place observed that on the fifth, whose bard is beige color with coffee, the gate was open from pair to pair.
When they looked inside, about three metres away, they located the bodies of three people, and they immediately gave notice to the corresponding authorities.
One of the individuals was wearing a yellow shirt with a dark, shoeless pant; next to him was another with a white straped shirt.
Just a meter away was the body of another individual with a red shirt and blue pants.
The three of them were face down.
According to the data obtained on the site, the three people would have been killed elsewhere, as no shells were found on the site.
On the fifth bard are legends that are directed from one organized crime group to another, as well as several bullet holes in it and the gate.
Capture at 11 in Caderoyta
The Ministry of National Defence introduced 11 persons, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group operating mainly in the municipality of Caderoyta and who were associated with kidnappings, homicides, "halcone" and clandestine burials.

The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put that country on the brink of economic disaster
The appointed Italian Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet on Wednesday with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of economic disaster and has endangered the entire eurozone.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, will meet on Wednesday with the president, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that he can form a government.
It is expected to present a cabinet composed mostly of technocrats, although it is not clear when the new executive will take office.
Monti said he will present to the president the outcome of his talks with the political parties in their attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," the former European Commissioner told journalists.
Monti did not explicitly say that he could form a government but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles had been overcome.
The "frame is now well outlined," he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, much less than normal, while Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has driven the costs of its debt to unsustainable levels.
The new administration led by the former European Commissioner Monti must approve a tough austerity package demanded by European leaders to regain the beaten confidence in Italy.
Underscoring the pressure on Monti to hurry, market instability placed the yield of Italian BTP bonds at 10 years above 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland were forced to be rescued.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian employer Confindustria, told the press after meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government a lot."
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy to emerge from this emergency situation.
Monti's chances of success were greatly boosted by the support of Silvio Berlusconi's PDL party, which the crisis forced to resign on Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are destined to have a good result," Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party, told the press.
The support of the PDL, Italy's largest party, is significant because so far many of its members had opposed the technocratic majority government that is forming Monti.
Parliamentary support
The new Monti Government must have strong parliamentary support to implement what is likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockage or delay in their efforts could provoke a new and devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks joined the pressure to warn that a failure of Monti would be a disaster.
Monti began his consultations on Monday with political parties, trade unions and business groups, as well as with youth and women's organizations.
You'll end your round of meetings on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by Napolitano, who has enabled an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief break at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would resign, Italian debt costs have now returned to critical levels between uncertainty as to whether the new prime minister will succeed.
To rescue Italy, with a public debt of EUR 1.8 billion, would be too much for the current financial defenses of the eurozone.
Monti has said that his government should last until the next elections, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms before advancing the elections.
Monti has said that he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the big parties insist that he must be made up only of technicians, a sign of his opposition to a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources pointed out that mutual mistrust and disagreement between parties are complicating the attempt to include political figures.
The roce of the Spaniards is superior to that of the ticks
Of the 22 footballers called from Spain, ten outnumber the 50 international games.
On the Costa Rican side only one of the 22 convoked arrived at the 50 meetings.
A capital contrast to that of Costa Rica, if you compare the 22 called by both countries for today's friendly, at 3:05 p.m., in the National Stadium of San José.
While world and European champions, number one in FIFA's monthly ranch, count a large record of class A interselection games, the Tricolor only owns defender Michael Umaña as the only one to have the 50 international matches.
This figure was reached the previous Friday in the match against Panama (0-2), in the Rommel Fernández.
Spanish footballers who play in the League of the Stars and in powerful clubs of the Premier League of England, maintain an intense activity each year in league championships and domestic cup, and high-level shocks in European cups like Champions League.
To the above is added the experience with the Spanish Fury in complicated eliminations of the Euro Cup and the World Cup.
On the other hand, footballers in the United States have a limited international rock in an area, such as the Concacaf, which is considered to be the lowest level within FIFA.
We see that the maximum record of the Spanish selection is of the archer Iker Casillas, who on the previous Saturday before England (fall 0-1 in London) equalled the record of the exporter Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international meetings.
Casillas will play today in front of the Tricolor and will set a new record for Spain of 127 internationalities.
Xavi Hernández, Barcelona's brain steering wheel, owns 106.
Casillas and Xavi, even, were recognized the previous week by UEFA along with the other centenaries of the Iberian team, the mentioned Zubizarreta with 126 and the ram of the Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
Almost around the centenary number is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
He was followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61; and David Silva, with 53.
On the tic side, and near Michael Umaña, are the left side Junior Díaz, with 48 presences and the gunner Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five beat the 30 matches: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least.
More than 30 presentations in Spain include Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 presences, Roy Miller appears with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest isn't close to 8:00.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolivar owns only one and Olman Vargas and Edder Nelson still do not debut.
The historical scorer of Spain is David Villa, with 50 targets, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one who records the most with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto included the country on his two-decade tour of his career
"Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true"
In an exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam said the band is ready to offer one of their best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
They have been more than 20 years waiting, but the band assures that for them it will also become a reality the dream of playing in the country.
This was assured by the bass player and founding member, Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively with Viva, from Brazil, last week.
The group is located in the South American wing of its two-decade tour of work and on Sunday 20 will make its only stopover in Central America.
That day they will perform at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., next to the Angeline band The X and the nationals of Las Robertas.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, whose full transcript is on The Nation on the Internet.
For his Costa Rican followers, it's a dream come true that Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica, are you aware of what your fans are experiencing?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too.
This is just our second time in South and Central America and so far has been great.
I've only been to Costa Rica once and on vacation; it's such a beautiful country and I think we'll be able to stay there for a few days.
So we're excited to take our music there.
I ask because there is a kind of devotion to the band, fans live intensely the previous days.
What do you say to your most fervent followers?
Thank you for staying by our side throughout all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica; thank you for waiting so long and we regret that it took us so long to get there.
Some people even already refer to their concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does that add some pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we've played over the past 21 years have happened over the last couple of weeks.
We played a couple of giant shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that this has put us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we're really looking forward to playing there.
We love that country, we love surfing and the jungle; for both, Costa Rica is among the best in the world.
How did they discover Costa Rica and its waves to surf?
We have many friends who are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves there are amazing.
My friends were always going surfing to Costa Rica and Nicaragua, along with Mexico, are great places to surf; that's how we found out, through people who love surfing.
Watching the tour, they've been delivering huge shows with many songs.
What have you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we've never touched there before, then we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to give the best possible show with a good variety of songs; we will try to play a couple of songs from each album and give our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
What's this all about?
I think it's partially because we have nine albums and we can play over 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, so it's hard to choose which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we have not played for a while, that keeps us focused and also keeps us surprised because it reminds us of the reasons why we liked those songs and that we might have been forgotten.
That makes the show more interesting for us and, therefore, I think it also makes it more interesting for people.
With this tour, they are celebrating 20 years of trajectory.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you've accomplished?
Yes, absolutely.
First of all, I don't think any of us imagined we'd be in a big rock band and having done it for over 20 years ago it looked like a dream.
We continue to tell our blessings and we are very excited that we can continue to make music together.
We all love each other and we love to create music.
We're lucky to go to places in the world we've always wanted to go.
Things couldn't be better for us.
What did it mean for you to have been a fundamental part of the grunge's emergence?
It's always been an honor to be part of that group of big bands.
We are very close to the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It's amazing when a movement comes from a group of friends and it's something unusual.
From time to time, a band comes from a city, but it's much weirder when five or ten bands come out of the same city at the same time.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year, we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on his tour, so we're lucky to be friends with all of them yet and we're honored to be part of that Seattle sound that came out.
It's also very strange that a band like yours stays together and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which alone is much longer than many bands last.
Firstly, I believe that we are all fortunate to be still alive and, secondly, we all care about others.
We are all very close friends and, thanks to that, musical avenues have also been opened that give everyone freedom to experience.
We trust each other with each other's music and it couldn't be better.
Your relationship with the word fame has not been easy; however, thanks to your success, you have been able to do what you want.
How do they find a balance?
The way we've been growing up, it's been easier to find a balance sheet.
We make sure you're not too much of a tour because it's easy to fall into that game of big crowds and people who love your music.
As long as you remember that people are there for the music, that reminds you that you must respect the music and what brought it, without being captivated by being famous and being a rock star, something that none of us really care about.
How do you remember your other Mother Love Bone project?
I think we wrote very good songs and at first it was something great.
We were a band for almost three years and never released a record until after Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
There were many frustrations because it lasted so long and the most important thing is that we are still very close to Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started in the band with us and when I hear a song or see a picture I think of the amazing person Andy was and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh, talk about music and football and more.
He was a surprising human being, and we missed him.
The national band Las Robertas will be in charge of opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know your work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose it for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos with several proposals and that was the band we liked the most, so we are looking forward to seeing what Las Robertas can offer live and must be very entertaining.
Why do they always change Yellow Ledbetter's lyrics live?
That's a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He sings it and I think he does it with the first thing that comes to mind.
As a bassist, what are their influences?
There's so many of them.
Among the first to come to mind are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many I could talk about all afternoon about the bassists I love.
How has Pearl Jam managed to keep the grunge relevant even though it is no longer a fashion?
I think we all always feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the bands I mentioned earlier, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all that came up at the same time, and, if there's any relevance now, I think it's something wonderful because it's music worth listening to and bands like Mudhoney are now making better music than ever.
At first, his music had darker content and has now become more positive.
What is the reason for this change?
It's interesting because I think there are a couple of songs on the new album that may look lighter, but there are also songs, like The End or Just Breathe that qualify as very dark songs although they may sound a little positive.
With both of them, when Ed touched them, I cried when I heard them and they're deep dark songs.
I think when you grow up and there's some trauma in your life and a relative or a friend is lost, those things start to influence your art and your music and those two songs, no doubt, represent that to me.
Also, I think you can be a happy person and still be able to make music that is dark.
Peru:
Fujimori is interned again for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was admitted to a public hospital on Tuesday to be evaluated for the loss of muscle strength in his legs, his head doctor reported.
Fujimori, 72, who is serving a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed during his government (1990-2000), suffers from a number of illnesses, including cancer in the language for which he has been operated four times and remains under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal doctor, told Channel N of television that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the reason for the pain and loss of strength of his lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate to obtain the benefit of pardon for humanitarian reasons, however, he said he did not want it because he knows he is innocent.
He was operated on four times from cancer to the tongue, he has a weight loss of 18 kilos that has been combined with other pathologies such as severe erosive gastritis, pancreas cyst, kidney stones, hypertension, and leg circulatory problems, the doctor enumerated.
Fujimori has been in detention since September 2007 in the National Directorate of Special Police Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people at the hands of an army annihilation squad that operated clandestinely in the early years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official committee, led by Uruguayan President José Mujica and composed of several ministers and entrepreneurs, will begin a visit to Mexico this Tuesday in order to expand trade between the two nations and address political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with her Mexican partner, Felipe Calderón, the highest point of an extensive agenda of meetings with political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the Uruguayan community living in Mexico, according to the agenda disseminated by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents, in the city of Guadalajara, will be "a propriety for the exchange of information in all political matters between the two nations", according to the President of the South American country on his website.
According to local media, Mujica would seek to get Calderon to support Uruguay in the incident with France that arose when the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, included the South American country in a list of tax havens, at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that remain tax havens, a statement that provoked Uruguay's rejection and the call to consult its ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November, a group composed of the most powerful emerging and developed countries in the world, and has been in force with the South American country since January this year, an agreement to exchange tax information in order to avoid double taxation.
In recent years, the Uruguayan government has tried to speed up the conclusion of tax exchange agreements in order to emerge from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) "grey list", made up of countries that did not implement all international standards of tax cooperation.
At the commercial level, Mexico and Uruguay have had a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in force since 2004, which has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The bigoted plumber passes the three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has struggled, tirelessly, over 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but never before had he done so in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the girl's love in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which comes this month to stores all over the world, has been designed from the beginning to take advantage of the features of the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which allows playing in three dimensions without the need to use glasses.
"Mario is the character who has to say how the stereoscopy without glasses should work," said Nintendo's specialist press officer in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez indicated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "Nintendo's first video game originally designed for that support", since so far successes such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
Nintendo's spokesperson has argued that despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "accessible" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and fluid game.
Álvarez has said that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to engage less skilled users.
Once overtaken, the most experts will be able to give a "second turn" to the levels of play, which this time present greater difficulty.
In addition, users will be able to choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it will be necessary to play in three dimensions in order to overcome the different challenges and "not succumb to optical illusions".
This incursion of Super Mario in all three dimensions also implies the return of the character to a portable console, which did not occur since 2005.
In this video game Nintendo winks the followers of the saga and repeats the formula of the success of the previous deliveries, consisting in that the mustache plumber will have to go through platforms minced with dangers in order to free Princess Peach.
Although the player will find new features in movements, environments, costumes and enemies and also a "playable" Luigi.
Colom backs Portillo's extradition to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced this Tuesday that he gave the extradition of ex-governor Alfonso Portillo to respond in the United States for the $70 million conspiracy to wash.
This concludes the process for Guatemala to respond to the request of the northern country that called on Portillo to try him there.
At a press conference, Colom stated that his decision was based on the independence of the judiciary and the executive, bearing in mind that a sentencing court had already ordered extradition.
He claimed that during his term he "did not get his hands on" judicial decisions and dealt with all the extraditions he has known.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will be extradited for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
What Colom has done is an executive procedure after all the judicial and constitutional bodies have been exhausted to prosecute the ex-employee from 2000 to 2004.
According to resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo must be extradited once his legal status in Guatemala has been resolved and his human rights guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted for the embezzlement of Q120 million in the Ministry of Defence when he was president, which was the process leading up to extradition, but the Public Prosecutor's Office appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people at risk
The entity was born to avoid falling into the marginality of untrained boys
The balance of the first 25 years of life of the social support institution Trinijove is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have been helped to overcome a difficult situation throughout this quarter of the century.
In addition to this, the 100 jobs currently achieved for this social group are long.
The anniversary served yesterday to take stock of an event held in the old factory complex of Fabra i Coats attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijove was born in the district of Trinitat Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with little training, without work, with problems of dogradition or in a situation of falling into marginality.
Yesterday's celebration in Sant Andreu focused on a large number of leaders of entities and institutions that have collaborated with the association in these 25 years.
The varied political representation, in full electoral time, showed the unitary nature of the work carried out by Trinijove.
Together with the President of the Generalitat, Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, the former councillor of Socialist Education, Ernest Maragall, and the former mayor and current eco-socialist councillor Ricard Gomà, attended the event.
The current councillor of Benestar Social i Família, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the director general of the social work of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa, also attended the Grand Hall of the Fabra i Coats.
More stated that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and that the current one is also, but added that the work done so far "is a good basis".
The president set Trinijove as an example of how to fight against bad circumstances and to give hope to people with difficulties.
"The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it does," he said.
Evicted an octopus farm where macro-fests were made
The invaders had taken over 11 of the 13 floors of the building in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants left the farm yesterday noon without offering resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare lived by the neighbours of 51 Balmes Street has come to an end.
Twelve people left yesterday's noon voluntarily the illegally occupied property, where they organized macro-fiestas that despaired of the neighborhood, by court order and without the need for police intervention.
When the operation was completed, the door lock was changed to prevent the situation from being repeated.
"From now on there will be an access control," said the administrator.
The Okupas, which had invaded 11 of the 13 floors of the building - the rest are inhabited - took all the electrical installation and part of the water, in addition to painting the walls and leaving waste of all kinds, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
The first three floors were the scene of the crowd feasts, which lasted up to two days and despaired of the tenants.
Next to the building there is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which has also been damaged.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat explained to Europa Press that since the building was occupied the business has dropped by 80%.
The owner of the club points out that the invaders of the farm made him unfair competition, since they sold the cups for three euros, while in the club they are worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the entertainment venue had had to respond to neighborhood noise complaints, while, according to the report, the discomforts were not caused by the clients of the club, but by the inhabitants of the okupada house and, above all, by the attendees of the parties organized there, who had increased their frequency and intensity in recent weeks, according to the angry neighbors of the area.
The head of the club explained that the inconveniences were so great that he even reached an agreement with the owner of the property and nine months ago that he "forgave" the rent.
The Urban Guard also confirmed that over the past few weeks it had received more complaints from neighbors about the situation.
The president of the PP's municipal group in the city hall, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had claimed last week "immediately dislodge the property to end the problems of coexistence and civicism that produce the neighbors, as well as the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that before summer there was only one floor of the occupied building, but over the last few months the Okupas had been entering all the floors of the building and almost all the floors, and that there had even been thefts in some.
In this sense, he added, "it is necessary to end impunity and to be forceful against the incivism that has been generated on the farm".
Also yesterday, the Mossos evicted a building in Nou Barris.
At 3.30 p.m. the police headed to 35 Mont-ral Street, after receiving a call from a neighbour who had observed that four people were accessing the building.
All four were arrested at the time.
Park or mountain?
The architects agree on the opportunity of the call beyond polemics about fees
The municipal competition on the 16 doors reopens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the middle of the 80's, at the height of the already extinct Barcelona Metropolitan Corporation (CMB), this Administration printed a promotional passquins of Collserola.
The brochure defined the mountain as the great park of the metropolitan Barcelona.
Moreover, it was accompanied by a comparison, in figures, with New York Central Park.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park was again located, in the imagination of many, as the upper limit of Barcelona, being the Catalan capital of the few that are not oriented on the north-south axis but above (mountain) - below (sea).
Collserola's rating as a natural park is reflected in this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with the wild boars playing the role of the Yogi bear.
In these it was until, in September, the town council convened a megacompetition composed of 16 competitions for other so many access doors to Collserola.
A door refers to the idea of a park, no doubt.
Either that or someone's trying to put doors to the field.
The question comes out alone: Collserola, park or mountain?
The contest, both for its purely organizational aspect and for what it means to reflect on the city, is the topic of conversation among all Barcelona architects.
It's almost a recurring theme to hand over when two members of this old caste of elect are recognized in an elevator.
And this fact gives rise, precisely, to one of the few coincidences between what three Barcelona architects think, and university professors, who have presented themselves.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Mòdol and Marta Bayona: the contest is timely.
For Roldán, after approaching the coastal front "it is necessary" to discuss "the mountain front", since the speech of Ildefons Cerdà, that of the green apples, has not been carried out.
"It should start from the base that the most extensive park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things for its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex", says the architect for whom the title of "Collserola doors" contains a "lexic trap": they should not be thought of "as the accesses to a park, but the delimitation of some areas where we have to act".
Mòdol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban world, describes the proposal as an "intellectual right" with "some dangers".
Hazards arising from the "uncertainness that it is today to project the public space" after the experience lived in the 80s and that it had in the area of the Forum "his swan song".
The first fear is the very delimitation of borders over where it can be built.
"Limiting something is already fixing the next step," that is, its overtaking.
"We need to think about new urban planning instruments, because the current ones [in reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (GMP)] can give rise to real disasters."
Closer to the question, Mòdol believes that, simplifying, the Vallesana side of Collserola "can be understood as a park, that of Barcelona, no", on a purely topographical question.
Mòdol recalls that there is already a work done by the Patronat de Collserola that "should not fall into a broken sack", although he appreciates the opportunity that the city council offers to its guild to intervene in this project "from the first moment".
And even more, he understands that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the safe conduct that allows the architects to enter the debate, but "doubts" about whether it is this technical profile that should lead the multidisciplinary teams ("all right," he points out) that they have had to create: "The architects should be just a tool".
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gives the title to this piece is complex, because in the bases of the contest there is a global vision of Collserola: "16 cross-sectional contests have been convened - she says - in the direction of mountain-sea, but there is no longitudinal reading, which sees and understands the area as a whole".
This leads, at least where appropriate, to the choice of participating in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, a project for one of the doors can clash in program and definition with that of the next door architect.
In his view, that is the case, the city council should ensure that the strip immediately above the Dalt Round should provide, in all its extension, for an area of equipment that would make a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonas Larrazábal and will come free
After 72 days of rooting out, the legal guardian of Casino Red granted pardon to the brother of the mayor of Monterrey for the process that was followed by alleged blackmails
After remaining 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the legal guardian of Casino Red has granted him forgiveness before the Second District Criminal Court, which follows a process of blackmail against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
After the attack on Casino Royale, the owner of Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, made public a series of photographs and videos in which Manuel Jonás allegedly demanded payment of an economic fee for the regional council to allow the clandestine operation of the gambling house.
Following the public complaint, the State Prosecutor ' s Office opened a criminal trial against the brother of the mayor of Panista and on 2 September he was arrested and rooted for 30 days.
After four hours before the Public Prosecutor's Office 3 in Property Crimes, he was transferred to the House of Arraigo 1, located in the Old Quarter of the state capital.
He remained there for the 49 days following the issuance of a second warrant of rooting after the officer of the Public Prosecutor ' s Office dismissed the crimes of conspiracy and organized crime.
On 19 October he was transferred to Caderoyta prison allegedly for blackmailing the owners of the Casino Red with a million and a half pesos; however, he remained only a few hours in the medium-security prison as there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to continue the trial in the municipal cells of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On 25 October, he was arrested by the secretary of the Second District Criminal Court, Jorge Yanez, who said that almost two months after investigations, sufficient evidence was found to determine Jonah's guilt, such as the charge of 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the gambling house in exchange for allowing the operation of the gambling house.
On Monday, Casino Red's legal guardian, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, went to the judge José Luis Pecina to ask forgiveness for the brother of the royal mayor; so in the next few hours he could regain his freedom.
During the legal proceedings, the prosecutor attached to the court, Ramiro Arias, questioned García Gómez if the damage had been repaired and who of the partners in the gambling house was the one who granted the pardon, although the lawyer tried to reserve the name.
On the basis of file 197/2011, legal pardon is granted to Jonas Larrazábal and thereafter no claim can be made concerning the proceedings followed; in addition, no compensation for damages or punishment will be required.
After the hearing to the legal guardian of the gambling house, around 15:50 the immediate freedom of Larrazabal Breton was ordered.
The secretary of the court, Jorge Yánez, moved to the prison of the municipality of San Nicolás de los Garza to notify Jonas that he has been legally pardoned and his file will be filed.
You will also notify him of the immediate release order issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the air accident where the Secretary of the Interior, Francisco Blake, and seven more people lost their lives.
The Secretariat for Communications and Transport (SCT) reported that the results of the accident in which the Secretary of the Interior, Francisco Blake Mora, and seven others lost their lives indicate that the helicopter was directly impacted on the ground in full structural integrity, without the pilot being able to attempt a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that before taking off the aircraft, the pilot found that the weather conditions were the right ones to fly.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had several contacts with the ground, the blades had contact with trees at 25 meters where the unit lost the fuselage."
He also reported that the unit was designed for 19 people, so it had the necessary requirements to transport the staff.
In addition, he said that investigations in the impact zone do not report the appearance of pieces in the field.
"In one search it is reported that there are no parts or components of the ship elsewhere, the impact was presented structurally.
"The helicopter design was for 19 passengers, with adequate requirements to transport passengers.
The terrain has a slope of seven degrees at 30 degrees of inclination.
For the time being, the secretary assured that it is a priority to have the results before possible; however, the investigation can last for several months, it could even reach a year.
For his part, Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Airports and Auxiliary Services, assured that at the time of the impact, the helicopter of the Presidential Staff operated at cruising speed and that this happened on a soft ascending terrain.
"This information strengthens the hypothesis of a normal cruise operation at the time of impact," he said.
At the press conference, SCT leader Pérez Jácome listed six relevant elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to the aeronautical regulations, the flight was conducted under visual flight rules, which means that the crew must have visibility during the flight and the terrain.
Weather conditions:
Reports at the AICM found conditions suitable for take-off, as the aircraft moved towards the border area between the DF and the State of Mexico, cloud layers were present at low altitude.
Selected routes:
It is likely that due to cloud conditions the crew sought a lower elevation area and greater visibility towards the Cuernavaca Valley.
Impact location.
The impact coordinates and the last record of the radar aircraft coincide, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or alteration in the flight path.
Dispersion of aircraft remains in a reduced area:
The information available so far suggests that the impact occurred on a straight and side-by-side trajectory.
The pattern of dispersal of the aircraft remains suggests that the helicopter was impacted in the field under structural integrity conditions.
No evidence of fire or explosion has been detected:
At the crash site, there is still no evidence on the ship's remains of any kind of explosion or fire.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that he may have had multiple contacts with the field.
During the field work, parts of the aircraft have been found at an elevation of 9,000,200 feet above the mid-sea level, the terrain has a slope ranging from seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which it was expected to disarticulate along this route.
The information provides elements that appear to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts on the ground.
After thorough search in a larger area than the tuned site, around the accident, no scattered pieces of the aircraft have been found, which strengthens the presumption that the impact was presented under conditions of structural integrity.
MSS announces protocol to find obesity gene
Leads Social Security research to discover the obesity gene in children and young people; is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) announced that it is conducting a research to discover the gene of obesity in children and young people, called the 'Genetics of Obesity of Childhood and Adolescents' protocol, which will allow to have markers associated with overweight.
In a statement, the head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry of the Specialty Hospital of the National Medical Center XXI century, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers was integrated.
This team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Center for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
In the research, the population is invited to participate whether or not it is entitled to participate, to go to the participating sports units of the IMSS in the Valley of Mexico, where the tests are carried out for minors, every Saturday from 8:00 a.m.
He stressed that the protocol began in the Cuauhtémoc Sports Unit (State of Mexico Poniente) and that since October 8, the activity is carried out in the Nezahualcoyolt Sports Unit (State of Mexico Orient).
Once the goal of bringing together 500 or 600 minors is met, the study will continue in the Sports Independence Unit (south of the Federal District) and finally in the Sports Morelos Unit (north of the Federal District).
He explained that the purpose of this research is to know the components and importance of genetics with regard to the development of obesity and to identify risk factors in Mexican children and young people to prevent the emergence of chronic degenerative diseases.
At World Diabetes Day on 14 November, he stated that the goal is to bring together 3,000 children and young people between six and 14 years of age, with the consent and supervision of their parents, for the implementation of specific questionnaires on food.
They will also be asked about the physical activity and family history of diseases, in order to avoid risk factors that trigger conditions such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He explained that Saturdays are applied to all participants anthropometric measurements (weight, size, waist circumference), blood pressure intake, determination of glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin levels and genetics (the aim is to identify genes associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz López pointed out that this research is due to the concern of health professionals for the alarming weight gain in minors.
'The 1999 and 2006 health surveys indicated that in just six years there was an increase, in the case of boys, of 77 per cent in obesity, and of girls of 47 per cent; in terms of overweight, a dramatic rise was also observed,' said the IMSS specialist.
He indicated that the justification for the search for markers is based on the fact that the population of the country differs from others because of its genetic history.
He reported that on average, Mexicans have 65 percent American Indian inheritance, 30 percent European and five percent African and this condition is reflected in genes associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity results in the inability to burn the excess energy we consume (calories) and that it is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for the participants is the comprehensive assessment of the children, which makes it possible to detect whether they have any degree of overweight or obesity.
Even, he said, the presence of dark-coloured folds (acantosis) in the neck and forearm, which indicate the probability of suffering from metabolic alterations and even prediabetes.
The information is handled confidentially, the doctors hand it over in writing to the parents, to whom each of the measurements and lifestyle changes they must make to prevent diseases are explained.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: sedentary lifestyle, which is the lack of daily physical activity, stay most of the day sitting in front of the television and use means of transport instead of walking short distances.
It is also due to high caloric intake, i.e. the increased consumption of sugary drinks, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with high fat and protein content and the genetics analyzed in this protocol.
UNAM asphalt would avoid bumps
Rafael Herrera, researcher at UNAM's Faculty of Chemistry, develops polymer-modified asphalts to produce a mixture with better performance, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions
If the signals sent by the pavement were met, it would not be necessary to repair nearly 200,000 bumps each rainy season in the Metropolitan Area of the Valley of Mexico, warned Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher of the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of UNAM, who assured that if the process of construction and maintenance of an asphalt floor is the right one, the bumps could be reduced in quantity or even eliminated completely.
At his conference A technological opinion of the baches, dictated within the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, revealed that the laboratory in charge develops asphalts modified with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of the asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance, both at high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera estimated that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, like some cities in the north of the country, to improve their performance and therefore the formation of bumps.
He explained that asphalt, the heaviest part of oil, is a set of hydrocarbons molecules, some of them of high molecular weight, called asphaltenes, and others of low molecular weight, called Maltese, which together give the pavement its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behavior of asphalt consists in that at high temperatures, about 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees centigrade its viscosity is very high and at 50 degrees centigrade it has an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes brittle, he added.
The above means that in the streets the resistance of asphalt is not uniform, but is being modified during the day according to the environmental and temperature conditions, the specialist in chemical engineering warned.
The FQ researcher observed that the streets of Mexico City are mostly covered by flexible pavement, which consists of six layers of materials, of which the last three involve asphalt.
Among the most superficial layers is the asphalt folder, made up of small stones bathed in asphalt and then compacted.
Each of the stones that constitutes the folder, he pointed out, is bathed with asphalt.
By transiting the vehicles and generating effort, it allows the forces to spread very well on the pavement.
If it were modified asphalt, they would spread even better, the chemical engineer said.
On the asphalt folder, he abounded, placing a last layer called rolling folder, which is made of a fine stone material, that is, a sand that also bathes in asphalt.
Since it is the layer that will be in contact with the wheels of the vehicles, it must have more mechanical strength than the asphalt folder and provide friction on the road.
Being the part of the pavement that will receive and spread the efforts, the rolling folder also needs to have the right thickness and care should be taken for the material it is made of.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially water, he said, because it significantly affects the performance of the asphalt folder.
When the soil is wet, the water spreads inside the folder and it is difficult to get out, this causes a softening of all the layers of the pavement and, therefore, the formation of bumps.
In the process of forming a bump, he said, the first to wear is the rolling film and only after it affects the asphalt folder, but the damage does not happen instantly, but it is a process that should be attended to the first signals with adequate maintenance programs.
The member of the National Researcher System also explained that the vehicle load is another important factor in the formation of bumps and, therefore, the thickness of each layer of the pavement must always go in relation to the vehicle load and ensure that it is complied with, in order to prevent frequent bumps from forming.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still a lot to investigate and work on asphalt, for example, asphalt emulsions, which in other countries are already in the market and allow repair of bumps with ease and without the need to use high temperatures.
What did the valley candidate miss to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that caused Melina Ramírez Serna not to reach the crown of Miss Colombia.
The Valley receives its title number 14 as a princess.
Once again the Valle del Cauca is left with the wishes of the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to settle for being on the podium of winners, wearing the silver crown and the band that credited her as Colombia's new princess.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlantic rose with the crown and scepter, the department already adds 14 titles of Princess and Melina joins the legion of women from Vallecauca who have been close to the crown but who were proclaimed princesses among them Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Monica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
Today the big question that many ask themselves is what was missing?
Because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite who in each presentation demonstrated that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, it was not in vain elected Queen of the Police and Best Rostro Jolie of Vogue, titles that obtained queens such as Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor that is considered key in the jury's decision to appoint the First Princess is that she did not convince with her answer to the question "What is that book that has marked you and why?" made by Martín Murillo Gómez, of the Literary Way Leamos.
To the questioner the Vallecaucana replied:
"I read a lot, I believe a lot in literature, I think it's a way of culturalizing, I definitely think the book that marked me as a childhood is "The Prince", is a rather deep book.
I now read "Crime and Punishment", it is a book of universal literature that we must all read; and today I am reading the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book called "The Burning of Blood".
A response that little liked first for the term "culturalize" and second for not explaining in a concrete way how each of the books he cited have marked it.
But at the end of the Melina ceremony, he expressed his peace and happiness with the result: "The universe is wise, what has to happen happens.
And for all people, please read a little, "The Prince" is a great book.
Among the hypotheses launched, it is said that Valle was burned by favoritism.
A Bogotan journalist insinuated that being the favorite, the ovatory and the candidate who took all the preliminary prizes (the Oster cuisine challenge, the public's vote for the best craft costume, and Queen Mother), "that awakened the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and therefore did not shine on the stage."
And that was noted in his first presentation in swimsuit on Hilton Beach and his two parades on the coronation evening.
Although he looked safe in both, it was noted that he lacked the strength and momentum that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantic did demonstrate.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the "How to At Home" program of the RCN Canal, said that the fact that Melina was appointed princess "checks that the candidate who wins the most prizes during the contest does not remain as queen".
In addition, Valle showed himself to the last very elusive with the press, and there he was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury about its interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
For something, two days before the election, the international jury Lucy Doughty stated that they were looking for a woman who was committed to her country's social needs.
"Beauty alone is not enough in a Miss Colombia, you have to look beyond the physical and focus on your social sensitivity, which before entering the Contest are already involved in projects," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned for her defects in the back and the fibrosis that was noticed in her abdomen, but it is contradictory because precisely the jury chose her as the candidate 'Natural Beauty' with the healthiest body, good food and responsible physical work.
The queens preparer Jorge Hernán Orozco admits that Melina did not have the best body, that there were the best, "but her problem of fibrosis in the abdomen, that the truth for me was not very notorious, dropped points on the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of Cromos magazine considers that the error of the Vallecaucana were the surgical interventions that were practiced.
"The surgeries are fine, but Valle didn't know how to do them.
Her body was never her fort and here she was charged."
For this award, which for the first time delivers the National Beauty Contest, after the parade in bathing suit arose a cruel prophecy that was fulfilled last night, because it was said that this was the contentment that Raymundo granted Melina to not give her the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that since today Melina begins a year of reign, not as a sovereign, but as a princess, a position that gives her the possibility to represent Colombia in one of the international contests by appointment of the National Competition itself.
However, she will pass into history as one of the queens who, despite her overwhelming passage through Cartagena, was elusive to her crown.
So it was the work of the calenian who identified Alfonso Cano's corpse.
A lophoscopist from Cali passed into history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials is key.
Last November 4th a Lophoscopist of the CTI of Cali passed into history as the man who confirmed the identity of the highest leader of the FARC: "Alfonso Cano", through the collation of his fingerprints.
Of the seven lophoscopists working in the CTI section, Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working in the area of judicial investigation for 21 years, was on the turn of "availability".
At the beginning of his career, González worked in the municipalities of Chocó, where he often had to stay for more than five days in the jungle to get to the place where the bodies were to be identified.
In 2000 he moved to the capital of Valle and, after taking the corresponding courses, he specialized in lophoscopy, which is the study of friction skin, that is, palms of the hands and feet.
The week of operation against alias Alfonso Cano to Eliazar warned him to wear minimum clothes for three days.
Something big was waiting for him.
On Friday night he left for the Cauca in a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew that he had to identify two corpses and that one of them was suspected of being the man who was leading the oldest guerrilla in the world, so they asked him to carry Guillermo León Sáenz's death card (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the investigation team at the site where the body was located, he did not recognize it because of its physical appearance, as it was very different from what he had seen in the media.
He was without a beard, dressed like a local peasant, no glasses and much thinner.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Accompanied by a galtonian magnifying glass, ink, a transplanter and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the body to those of the card.
His eye didn't fail: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was in charge of confirming to the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that he was indeed the chief of the FARC.
In search of the footprint
For a typist from the Sijín de Cali, the recognition made by President Juan Manuel Santos to Eliazar González, at the press conference for the operation against "Cano", is very significant.
A lot of people don't know our work.
Typhyloscopy is an accurate science, without any margin of error, that can become key to the resolution of crimes.
Apart from the identification of corpses, lophoscopists support investigations for crimes such as theft and murder and confirm the identity of the captured persons.
When they are captured, many criminals present false ballots or do not have papers.
We take the fingerprint and search them in the database.
The investigator said that, in a theft case, he had to remove a piece of wall from a house, because at that place the thief had supported his hand to take out a safe full of jewelry and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not suitable surfaces to make a fingerprint, but in that case we were able to get the print from all hands and identify the offender, who had participated in different thefts," he recalled.
Fingerprints can also rule out or reaffirm suspects in homicide cases.
Recently they found a dead man, with bottles of liquor around him.
The investigation determined that a relative could be suspected of the crime and, indeed, a print on the bottle coincided.
Although this doesn't guarantee he was the killer, it does place him at the crime scene.
A CTI typist explained that in objects "prints are removed with chemical or physical reagents".
When they appear, a transplanter or tape is used to lift them.
After this, the impressions are sent to Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the Registry.
"The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians," said the CTI expert.
He clarified that not everything is as shown on the TV program CSI.
Just as not everything that shines is gold, not everything that is touched becomes footprint.
However, if it can be used, if the respective collage is performed.
The "indignant" defy authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters crowded in front of Zuccotti Square to camp.
A large part attended the eviction order and moved to a nearby paruqe.
Members of the Occupy Wall Street movement challenged the New York authorities this Tuesday by trying to re-enter, under a court order, Manhattan Square from which they were evicted at dawn and by trying to occupy another park in the Big Apple.
Hundreds of protesters were beating up at Zuccotti Square, where they wanted access thanks to a court order allowing the "indignant" to return to camp, while another part of the movement responded to the eviction occupying a park further north of the city, where there have been new arrests.
"Our idea is that if the court doesn't allow us to camp back in the square, we're going to settle somewhere else and continue the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, as well as through peaceful sit-downs and demonstrations," said one of the spokespersons of the "Occupy Wall Street" movement, Mark Bray.
Bray explained that the response of the "indignant" to the eviction of her camp personally dictated by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, reached the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting forced evacuation of the site and allowing protesters to remain camped.
In addition, the "indignant" proceeded to the occupation of a new park located at the confluence of the central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and property of the Trinity Church parish.
At least for an hour they managed to take the place, but then the police came and proceeded to arrest some of the protesters, although Bray could not confirm the specific figure, while assuring Ephe that he saw several journalists who were also handcuffed.
The organization assures that there are several hundred people who had settled at that point, where a delegation of religious leaders has already been displaced in support of the members of the movement and has tried to mediate with the police.
Meanwhile, the Zuccotti Square, which is a privately owned compound, remains closed pending the holding of a judicial hearing scheduled for this very Tuesday in which it is necessary to analyze the legality of the evacuation of this morning.
Some of the protesters displaced there were carrying and handing over copies of that court order at these hours and even handing them over to the officers who guarded the square, which caused "some small clashes," said Bray, who reported that some officers beat up the protesters.
The court order prohibits the authorities from evicting Occupy Wall Street members or applying "laws that were published after the occupation began or prohibit protesters from re-entering the park with stores or other properties they used previously."
Mayor Bloomberg told the press that, due to this court order, the city had suspended the reopening of space to the public and protesters, who were warned, however, that local laws do not allow them to re-install themselves with tents and sleeping bags.
The governor personally defended the early eviction of Zuccotti Square, an operation in which around 200 arrests were carried out and which was decided because the protesters were "violation of the law".
Bloomberg explained that he gave the order to evacuate the square because it was becoming "a place where people did not come to protest, but to violate the laws and, in some cases, to harm other people", since "some businesses had received threats" and the neighbors feared "for their quality of life".
"This morning's eviction was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is more interested in preserving financial interests than those of American workers," added the spokesman for the movement, who accused the mayor of "lacking respect for freedom of expression."
"Ocupa Wall Street" officials also indicated that they plan to organize "great actions" for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and trade unions, to commemorate the two months of protests, which began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary on a special TV Christmas
Along with Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, he will appear on the TV show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st
Canadian Pamela Anderson has been Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", rescuer in "Baywatch", bunny of "Playboy", the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a Canadian television Christmas special.
The private television channel CTV announced today that Anderson, along with the "crooner" (balladist) Michael Bublé and other outstanding Canadians, will appear on the TV show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" next December 1 giving life to a very particular Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed images of the television program in which Anderson, also known for the wide distribution on the internet of a pornographic home video in which she appears together with her then husband, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, appears dressed as the Virgin Mary holding in a manger a doll representing Jesus.
On the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently performed as a presenter in part of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" tour, appears as Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, CTV's Christmas special features Canadian singer Bublé, who married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires at the end of March, and who is no stranger to the controversy.
Recently, Bublé called American Kim Kardashian "bitch" during one of his concerts in New York.
Japan Reborns after Earthquake · Global Voices
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and puts an end to the spiral of falls that began in March
Since last March, Japan's economy has been paralysed, yet convalescent by the devastating earthquake that has become a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster that the Japanese country has suffered since World War II.
The initial estimates of the Tokyo Government amounted to $30 billion in material losses, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, appears to have been mitigated.
After three consecutive quarters of falls, the Gross Domestic Product data between July and September served to move over the page, definitely: GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% in annualised rate.
The recorded in the second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year starts in March 2012 - also represents the highest rate of growth from January to March 2010.
The recovery is partly explained by the upsurge in the purchase of machinery to restore earthquake-stricken areas and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1 per cent, compared to the 0.9 per cent decrease in capital expenditure observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of uninterrupted increases.
However, the true revulsive of the Japanese economy is not based exclusively on the Keynesian impulse that invites to take advantage of the crises to strengthen - or rebuild - the infrastructures, to use the shortcomings to grow from scratch.
Japan has awakened, above all, thanks to the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60 per cent of Japanese GDP.
This variable climbed by 1%, driven by increased expenditure on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo has been entrusted to the internal market, when the yen - the Japanese currency - has become one of the "housing values" chosen by investors fleeing the debt crisis in the euro area and the turbulent US forecasts, a privilege that weighs like a slab in the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose economic flotation line is determined by the health of large technological groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, rated their weak results between July and September at the Yen quotation.
As the markets continue to siege the peripheral countries of the EU, Yoshihiko Noda's government does not lower its guard.
"We must pay attention to the risks that persist, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen," said Secretary of State for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa yesterday.
Indeed, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) noted that most member countries presented clearer signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator anticipating the turning points in the world economy highlighted that the major powers are slowing down.
Since it dropped four tenths to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 August.
The euro area, even, was below the average, which is at level 100, as it precipitated eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens re-energizes doubts
Papadimos says the adjustments will be approved, but the conservatives will not sign any written compromises
With the peripheral risk premiums triggered and the uncertainty re-established in the parks, Greece continues to entangle in the labyrinth leading to the exit of the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new Greek transitional government is being imposed more by the Brussels demands than by a genuine conviction of the political forces is beginning to be confirmed by facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, warned yesterday that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the 100-day period agreed upon in his appointment may be short to apply, the leader of the Conservative party New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, assured that he will not support new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his demand for new elections by the scheduled date, February 19.
"The main task of this government is to implement the decisions of the 26 October summit," Papadimos said when he opened yesterday a parliamentary debate that will culminate tomorrow with a vote of confidence in the new executive.
A package of 24 programmes to boost employment, reform of the civil servants' disciplinary code and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras' message does not cast doubt on his position: "We have committed ourselves to helping the Transitional Government, but we have not committed ourselves to anything else."
The conservative leader was a step further in his pulse to the EU and the IMF, the bodies that must unlock the 8 billion Athens urgently needs, and made it clear that he will not give his approval to any letter of commitment to comply with the adjustments.
But the European Commission, still chosen because of the impact caused by the order of the referendum in Papandreu, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will not unlock the aid if the new government and the leaders of the main Hellenic parties do not sign "a written compromise without ambiguity and as soon as possible".
The spokesman for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the Troika inspectors will return "very soon" to Athens to discuss with the new government "what is needed to pay the sixth tranche" of 8 billion, although there is no final date.
The Greek tree still has a thread for a while.
Dona Sofia: "They are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen highlights Spain's "preponding" place in relation to this type of finance
Spain "has reached a world-leading place in the role of Microfinance".
Queen Doña Sofía recalled yesterday that the country has become in the last two decades the second donor of the proposal in relation to this instrument of cooperation, whose "essentialness" stated that it is a "tool for social progress, justice and the hope of a better future for all humanity, based on trust in the human being".
Yesterday, the Queen inaugurated the Fifth World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid with the conviction that "there is no doubt" that such operations are "absolutely indispensable" to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the United Nations by 2015, and, "especially in the one that aims to reduce to half the volume of people living on less than one dollar a day, with which the "mural of poverty" is fixed.
Spain "continue to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "to all corners of the planet, and assume this task with "responsibility", said Doña Sofia, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions that originate at the Summit, which will be extended until Thursday, "ensure the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest, and especially for women", the main beneficiaries of these loans.
There are "many achievements" and "many challenges we face."
The Microcredit Summit is not only a forum for discussion, but also a platform from which to push "two basic goals".
Thus, His Majesty explained that it is hoped that by the end of 2015 there will be 175 million poor families who have accessed these financial services and that one hundred million of these households will go out of the poverty line on which they are buried.
The impulse in the conception of microcredits in Spain and the rest of the world "has followed the path begun years ago in a pioneering way" by Muhammad Yunus, emphasized Dona Sofia as an "act of justice and due recognition".
And he described the father of this tool as an "admirable idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty", whose work she has known for 15 years, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to learn about her loan policy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada 2006, and "in all I have been able to see the continuous evolution", explained His Majesty, whose connection to this project earned him yesterday the qualification of the "head of the family" gathered in Valladolid by the "baquero of the poor".
Finally, Queen Doña Sofia concluded her speech by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to advance the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for every democratic state.
In this regard, he stated that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to times of economic prosperity, as it is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez considered that microcredits are "a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to eradicating poverty", and now "more than ever" developed country governments must work on solidarity criteria and not let it fall victim to cuts.
For Spain, microcredit consists of "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
For her part, the Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, applauded "the success" of giving "confidence" to people "excluded from all who close the doors"; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed those present to a city that "opens its doors infected with the spirit of solidarity".
CDU proposes to elect the European President by universal suffrage
The first day of the Congress of the Christian-Democratic Union (CDU), Monday, November 14, in Leipzig, has passed without great difficulty for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and President of the Christian-Democratic Party.
Initially, the future of Europe had not been included in the agenda, but the issue was imposed in the autumn, in particular to satisfy the militants who consider that the government's policy is currently too weak with the Greeks and could be so in the future with the Italians.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the management, was adopted virtually unanimously.
Of the 1,001 delegates, only nine votes against and ten abstentions were registered.
The several-minute standing ovation that was won, with her interventions, Angela Merkel and, after several hours, Wolfgang Schäuble, the Europhile Minister of Finance, clear up any possible doubts.
The key idea of the Chancellor, and of the motion, is summed up in a motto: the response to the crisis "is not less Europe, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe represents peace, but also because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
For the Chancellor, "the time has come to open the way in Europe".
This could be reflected in amendments to the Lisbon Treaty to strengthen the European Union's control over the budgetary policies of the euro area countries, but could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage to "give Europe a face".
In any case, that is one of the proposals of the motion adopted by Congress, clearly the idea of Wolfgang Schäuble.
Undoubtedly, it is unlikely that the twenty-seven will quickly reach agreement on this radical change: Britain is hostile to him and the CDU leaders seem to know that Nicolas Sarkozy too.
But the ball is on the ground.
On the other hand, the delegates rejected by a crushing majority the proposal to weigh the weight of each country of the directive of the European Central Bank according to the weight of each economy, which would obviously reinforce the weight of Germany.
Anxiety for calming the spirits within her party, the Chancellor has increased the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. But it is also not that she has tried to win her congress at the expense of the "small" European countries or countries in difficulty willing to criticize arrogant Germany.
Although the motion on Europe devotes a section to the importance of "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel has not lied to France.
Except for the past.
Recalling that, two centuries ago, there was a bloody battle in Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats for Napoleon's army.
The incidence of sick leave fraud
After the subsidies, the UMP and the Government are taking an offensive against sick leave.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday 15 November to visit a box responsible for family allowances and to deliver a speech on the issue, already recurring since 2007, of the fight against social fraud and aid.
In addition, to accompany such an offensive, which starts from the desire to save rigorously, but still recalls an axis of the presidential right-wing campaign, most want to focus on sick leave.
First, to implement budget cuts: the Government plans to impose a fourth day of shortage on private sector workers before they can take the leave.
In short, unless there is a specific company agreement, a worker who falls ill would lose four days' wages, i.e. at least 15% of his monthly income.
This is a measure that could raise a wave of anger, but that would save 280 million euros, according to Les Echos.
In addition, it would be accompanied by another measure with a more symbolic scope: to impose on staff a day of unpaid absence in the event of unemployment (so far, they have no shortage, compared to the three days that apply in the private sector).
While these issues are being discussed, the majority also put on the table the issue of fraud, this time oriented towards the abuse of job losses.
"Controls are going to increase considerably and, in addition, if someone is discovered committing fraud, they will have to reimburse the amounts," Xavier Bertrand warned speaking in RTL on Sunday, November 13.
As in the other cases, the effects of the advertisement appear to be slightly disproportionate to the reality of job losses fraud.
Indeed, there has been constant follow-up on this issue since 2002 and a number of political offensives have been launched, which have normally borne fruit.
The French are sick only in the rest of Europe.
Let us look carefully, first of all, at the national figures.
According to the French Social Security Institute (CNAM), in 2006 more than €237 million was paid in unemployment benefits.
According to the French Institute for Health Economics Research and Documentation, subsidies for casualties accounted for 5 per cent of health expenditure in 2008, amounting to EUR 11.3 billion.
Of this amount, 46 per cent corresponds to maternity and work-related injuries, while 54 per cent is related to sick leave, which amounts to EUR 6.2 billion.
Consequently, 2.5 per cent of health expenditure.
In 2010, the French took an average of 14.5 days off work, compared to 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
An average that undoubtedly hides deviations: another survey, published in 2007 by Syrian professional management Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed claimed that they had not taken a single day off from illness.
Another study, in this case of the Health Insurance, indicates that in 2010 37% of the sick leavers had a duration of less than 8 days, 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11% were longer.
If we compare them with our European neighbours, French workers are no more likely than in other areas to take sick leave.
A long study carried out in 2010 by two CNRS researchers indicated that, between 1994 and 2001, the overall absence rate from work (both for health and other reasons) ranged from 10% to 11% in France, from 20% to 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or from 16% to 18% in the Netherlands.
Sick leave fraud is not particularly significant compared to undeclared work.
Fraud has a rather limited scope.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has led to systematic checks on sick leave of more than 45 days.
In 2008, of 1.5 million inspections, CNAM found, in 13 per cent of the 285,000 completed, that the short-term casualties were "unwarranted or too long", that is, 37,050 cases.
In the case of casualties of more than 45 days, subject to systematic inspections, 11 per cent of the cases were considered to be "duely adapted or unjustified; a figure of $1.2 million is 132,000.
Thus, a total of 169,000 "unjustified" cases are reached among several million workers who took a sick leave.
Undoubtedly, an insignificant figure compared, for example, to black work.
According to UMP Member Dominique Tian, the author of a report on this issue in June, this practice would represent tax revenue losses of between EUR 9,000 and EUR 15 billion per year, i.e. more than the total cost of lower subsidies and, no doubt, considerably more than fraud in the latter area.
Papadémos: Greece to implement a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment plan to straighten its economy.
This is what Prime Minister Lucas Papadémos told Parliament on Monday 14 November; he added that the hundred days granted to his union government would not be enough to achieve this goal.
"To make efforts to bring about economic recovery, we need the support of our European partners and a new budgetary adjustment programme," said the Head of Government, who delivered his first public speech during the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken during the Eurozone Summit on 27 October will be the "main task" of the new government, since "the country's stay in the euro area is at stake", he added.
As a result, Papadémos has forecast that the country's public deficit will be reduced "to around 9%" of GDP by the end of the year, after reaching 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
Right rejects new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right-wing group, showed his support for the measures already adopted to try to get out of the debt crisis on Monday, but he has warned that his party will not commit to additional austerity measures.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said during a meeting with the deputies of his party "New Democracy".
He noted that he agreed with the objectives of reducing deficit and debt, as well as combating waste, but against any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
To Olli Rehn, European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the necessary EUR 8 billion loan without a written guarantee of all parties' support for the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his word would be sufficient and that he would not sign anything because of external pressure.
A committee of experts states that euthanasia and assisted suicide must be legalized
Canadians live by denying death, according to the Royal Society of Canada report
In the area of palliative care, the Committee calls on Governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, not just in cancer cases.
Canadian society continues to deny death.
In fact, only 9% of Canadians are willing to talk to their doctor about the conditions in which they wish to die and make arrangements to do so.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, which was attended by six experts from various fields, including ethics, legal and medical.
This committee recommends that the Government amend the Criminal Code to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, when the patient proposes this option and has been judged competent to make the decision.
For starters, experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit that compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada ranks tenth, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has generated a culture in which people are afraid to address the issue of death."
On medication or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, according to experts selected by the Royal Society of Canada.
And, although most Canadians want to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying in the hospital.
Overall, the highest rate in this regard is recorded in Quebec, where 86% of deaths occur in the hospital.
With regard to the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report reached conclusions that do not coincide with the position of the Federal Government, which has already stated that it does not wish to amend the Criminal Code in relation to euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to experts, who have also studied the situation in all countries where such practices have been legalized or do not constitute a criminal offence, there is no evidence that the fact that they are not considered a criminal offence has not led to an abuse of their application, i.e. the use of euthanasia or assisted suicide with persons who are not competent or who have not given their consent.
Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, said yesterday by teleconference that, on the contrary, more excesses were observed in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide have not been legalized.
"Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, although it is clearly illegal."
"Assisted suicide is practised in Canada, although it is clearly illegal," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians in favor of euthanasia
Let us remember that 85% of Canadians have already spoken in favour of euthanasia, as they believe that it would allow people whose death is near to alleviate their suffering, as indicated by an Angus Reid survey conducted in 2010.
In addition, 66 per cent believe that legalizing euthanasia will not imply that the lives of elderly or disabled people are less valuable.
As for those who have experienced assisted suicide, 41 per cent of respondents felt that a trial should not be initiated against them.
Regarding the maintenance or interruption of a patient's health care, the situation is not so clear, as the authors of the report indicate.
Furthermore, its recommendations suggest that the Criminal Code should indicate that the withdrawal of health care, if legally rejected, does not constitute a criminal offence.
The expert committee also requests that health professionals be trained in the duty to respect the fact that a patient rejects end-of-life care without fear of facing a complaint.
In the area of palliative care, the Committee calls on Governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, not just in cancer cases.
Finally, with regard to palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the Committee requests that, unless it serves to reduce physical pain, it be considered euthanasia and subjected to the same procedures.
Other experts express reservations
Other health law experts have already expressed reservations about the findings of the Royal Society of Canada experts' report.
Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, has described as "extreme" the position of the experts who sign the report, among other things because the practice of euthanasia is not limited to the terminally ill.
"This leaves the door open to a situation where someone who is tired of living and over 18 years of age can ask for help to commit suicide," says Deschamps, who consulted a summary of the report yesterday.
Mr Deschamps also stressed that the authors of the report seemed to give priority to personal autonomy over any other value of society.
However, he adds that "in society, there are labels and limitations."
Health Law Specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed her "strong opposition" to the conclusions of the report, which she described as "a manifesto in favor of euthanasia".
Margaret Somerville, who also belongs to the Royal Society of Canada, particularly questions the lack of abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal, as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan urges President El Assad to abandon power
Damascus denounces a "complot"
Syria is increasingly isolated
The supporters of Bashar El Assad spoke yesterday in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs building.
Yesterday the diplomatic pressure on Syria of Bashar El Assad, which, with the support of Russia, resists it and denounces that there is a "comlot" against the country.
Two days after the Arab League's suspension of Syria, the European Union has reinforced sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, neighbours of Syria, have expressed support for President Assad's abandonment of power.
King Abdalah II of Jordan was yesterday the first Arab leader to ask President Bashar El Assad to "give up power" in Syria, where a quarantine of civilians and members of the regime's forces have already died.
"If Bashar really cares about his country, he should resign, in addition to creating the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life," said the king of Jordan, a neighbouring country of Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
For his part, the head of Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu, has regretted that Turkey's mediation efforts since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime have ended in failure.
"Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot satisfy them will leave," he said, referring to Syria, a neighbouring country with which Turkey is taking an increasingly harsh stance.
For its part, following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union, the United States welcomed the Syrian "strengthening of consensus against Assad and the actions of the regime".
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and other countries, such as Turkey, are adopting an increasingly harsh tone" with regard to repression in Syria, says Mark Toner, spokesman for the State Department.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime's forces have already lost their lives in the Deraa region of southern Syria, as announced by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH).
Two other civilians have died "during bombings and shootings with heavy machine guns in Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs, according to the NGO.
During a press conference, the Syrian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid Al Mualem, considers that the country is "moving towards the end of the crisis".
In addition, it has reacted strongly to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damasco from his duties, which in his view constitutes "a dangerous step".
Syria "will not weaken," he added, ensuring that "conspiracies plotted against Syria will fail."
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently studying a "civil protection mechanism" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé has also expressed his support for sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime which, in his view, is enclosed in "paranoia".
A new extraordinary meeting of the League is scheduled to be held tomorrow in Rabat to finalize the implementation of the exit plan for the crisis adopted on 2 November, which provides, in particular, for the withdrawal of the armed forces from the cities in the hands of the opposition and the release of the detained demonstrators.
The Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Sergei Lavrov, yesterday judged the Arab League's decision as "incorrect", while China urged Syria to implement the exit plan for the crisis, although it did not express its support for the implementation of possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti takes time to markets and sacrifices to Italians
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has requested some time from the markets to form his team and set up a programme that will include "sacrifices" intended to regain the credibility lost during the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner discussed yesterday with the political parties and today met with trade unions and employers.
It should form a relatively restricted cabinet, composed of technocrats outside Parliament.
"Monti has spoken of a broad programme with numerous sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, deputy of one of the large small parliamentary groups that participated in the meetings, after meeting with the President of the Council appointed.
For his part, the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, has said that he hopes that Mario Monti will ask for a vote of confidence in Parliament before Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultations will end with the presentation by Mr Monti of a limited list, no doubt from a dozen ministers, to the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Monti has commented on the nervousness of stock markets and bondholders yesterday, asking for time.
In the "democracy, there are precise deadlines" to form a government and prepare its program, he stressed, adding that he is "sure that markets will have patience and will understand".
Its designation by the President was initially welcomed by the markets, but then the concern was imposed, in particular after an unexpected fall in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The Prime Minister-designate should create a team primarily made up of technocrats, even if he has stressed that he would like to include "politics".
The new government will have to operate until 2013, the date of the next legislation, it considers.
According to the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will get Parliament's vote of confidence by Friday.
Monti has pledged that, when he takes office, he will work in the light of the urgency and with the aim of having Italy "recover its role" in Europe.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy will not change".
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its objective of achieving a budgetary balance in 2013 despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, has called for further rigorous measures.
The Italian "chief of chiefs" Emma Marcegaglia, who will see him on mates, also insisted on the need to boost the economy, "since a country that does not grow cannot meet the deficit requirements".
Monti, famous for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "period shift" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism"; the "teacher" symbolizes "the challenge of seriousness" and "another Italy", according to the editorialists.
The great unknown will be the longevity of your team.
President Napolitano wants to avoid early elections, since Italy has to place some 200,000 million euros in state bonds before April 2012.
Russian scientist has collaborated with Iranian nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, has collaborated with Iran in the development of a detonator that can be used with a nuclear weapon, according to an American NGO specializing in atomic risk on Monday.
For the identification of the researcher, the Institute of International Science and Security (ISIS) is based on a recent report from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents issued by that UN agency.
The IAEA expressed last week its "serious concern" about a "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear programme.
According to ISIS, based extensively on IAEA documents, Danilenko, born in 1934, had worked for three decades, since the 1960s, at a Soviet military nuclear centre in Cheliabinsk, Oural, and had participated in the manufacture of synthetic explosion diamonds.
In 1989 or 1991, he would have left the centre to form a company focused on the production of "nanodiamonds" in Kiev.
His company's economic problems would have led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Subsequently, it is believed that it cooperated with the Iranian programme between 1996 and 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its last report, the IAEA mentions that there are "clear indications that Iran is developing" a nuclear detonation system "with the help of a foreign expert, who not only knew the technique well, but also, according to one Member State to the Agency, worked for most of his career in nuclear technology in the military nuclear programme of his country of origin".
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by 50 per cent
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by nearly 50 per cent between 2009 and 2010, while, during the same period, other types of racial and religious violence have decreased or increased only slightly, according to statistics published by the FBI on Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of acts of violence against Muslims has increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, that is, it has increased by 49 per cent, compared to a 13 per cent increase in violence against Catholics, a 4 per cent reduction in crimes against Jews and a 14 per cent overall increase in the number of crimes and anti-religious crimes.
The total number of "hate crimes" has grown slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% are due to racial differences and 20% to religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it is worrying that these crimes and crimes have increased again," said human rights organization Human Rights First, "the increase in violence against Muslims is particularly significant," the organization added in a statement.
"Human Rights First has been pointing out for a long time that violence against Muslims, as well as all types of hate crimes, should be considered a serious violation of human rights," adds a head of the organization, Paul Legendre.
"The U.S. government can and should strive to put an end to such abuses," he adds, considering that such efforts could include an improvement in police reports on "hate crimes."
The "crime of hatred" in U.S. federal law was inherited from the time of the civil rights struggle.
This legislation was adopted following the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence linked to race, skin color, religion, origin and now sexual inclination.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
The Twitter microblogging site modified the presentation of its platform on Monday to allow its users, in particular, to observe the activity of the people they follow, which causes their service to look a little more like Facebook.
A new tab "activity" and another so-called "name" allow you to follow more legibly and live the activity of other "Twittos", that is, of those netizens whose messages ("tweets") are still on the Internet or following you.
This lets you know if you follow up on messages, if you subscribe to new accounts, if you rate a favorite message, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested "with a small percentage of users in August" before spreading it to the rest of the network on Monday, according to AFP Twitter spokesperson Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, which was known for its little instinctive operation, con slightly esoteric terms (RT para resendar une message de otro persona, followfriday para recomendar de seguir une otro user) making the happiness of the initiates, opens up to a wider audience with a more similar handling to that of the Facebook and Google+ general public networks.
In the network, users have discussed the interest of this innovation at the same time as tweets with different opinions.
"It's useless, it's invasive and it looks too much like Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"The Activity feature will help me better track some elements of my Twitter stream," writes @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Introduction of a "golden rule" budget in the Constitution
The government of the large Social Democratic/Christian coalition in power in Austria decided on Tuesday to include in the Constitution a "golden rule" budget to reduce the public deficit and thus avoid a possible degradation of Austria's sovereign note by credit rating agencies (triple A).
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor himself, Werner Faymann, who announced this decision after a Council of Ministers, when the Austrian public debt reached 74.6%, a figure far above the 60% ceiling set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly below the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency were reduced to one level, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay €3 billion more in interest each year," said Christian Democratic Foreign Minister Michael Spindelegger.
Austria thus responds to a request from the Brussels Summit to the euro area member countries of 26 October: in it, the Heads of State and Government called for the inclusion, before the end of 2012, of the reduction of the public deficit and the recovery of the balance of public accounts in the Constitution or in a law of equivalent value.
The scheme adopted by the Austrian Government is close to the "German model", since Germany was the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
Before 2017, the structural government deficit is expected to decrease by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year, and from 2017, the federal government's structural government deficit should not exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while regional states, as well as communes, should present balanced budgets.
The objective is to reduce public debt by 2020/2021 under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty.
A strong yen
Noda threatens a new market intervention
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would once again take action to mark the change if the yen continued to increase.
"We will intervene, as we did last time, if we find that there is excessive volatility" at the yen exchange rate, Noda told the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen rose to levels close to the historical peaks that produced the intervention of the Japanese authorities on 31 October.
That day, Tokyo sold massive yen for dollars to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which had just reached a new record since 1945 compared to the U.S. currency.
But the yen has been gradually dating back ever since, driven by the purchases of investors who consider it a "safe haven value" in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar was re-quoted on Tuesday at less than 77 yen and the euro fell below the symbolic bar of 105 yen, reaching levels close to those caused by the last intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was quoted at about 120 yen and the euro at more than 160 yen.
This explosion of the Japanese currency harms the exports of the archipelago, as it increases the value of the Made in Japan products and reduces the value of the income earned abroad by Japanese companies when they convert them into the national currency.
"Japan is struggling to rebuild itself" after the earthquake and tsunami of 11 March, which devastated the region of Tohoku (northeast), stressed Noda, who fears that the Yen's upliftment at the root of the weak recovery.
The third world economic power has recovered growth in the third quarter (1.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter), for the first time in a year, thanks to an increase in exports and consumption of disaster-affected households.
But the Prime Minister considers that the high level of the yen did not reflect the "economic bases of Japan".
Finance Minister Jun Azumi has asked the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its Monetary Policy Council on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
However, the Deputy Governor of the institution, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken "the right measures", implying that greater monetary flexibility should not be expected on Wednesday.
During its last meeting at the end of October, the issuing institute increased its purchases of Treasury Letters by five billion yen (47 billion euros), bringing to 55 billion yen (519,000 euros) the threshold of funds dedicated to the acquisition of various financial securities to flood the liquidity market.
Euro area:
The guys grow up, the bags flabby
The risk of contagion of the debt crisis continues to be detrimental to European indices.
Despite the appointment of new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy, as well as better growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of the weakest countries continue to rise.
Still concerned about the stability of the stability of the euro area, the European exchanges sink a little further into the negative zone on Tuesday 15 November.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., ACC 40 loses 1.4% and is set at 3,064 points.
Dax loses 0.4% in Frankfurt and 0.1% in London.
"Taking into account the new tensions over the returns on loans from the most affected euro area States, stock markets around the world continue to make part of their recent gains."
"Investors, nervous, are perfectly aware of the risk of contagion," explains Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange has closed with a fall of 0.7%, renewing the concerns of market players regarding Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has a fixed look in Europe and exchanges will continue to take place in a limited margin of variation, so investors will not have proof that the situation has stabilized," says Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
The resurgence of concerns about the future of the euro area affects the single currency, which continues to fall on Tuesday.
The euro has remained at its lowest level for a month and a half.
Around 10 a.m., the European currency was worth $1,3570, a drop of 0.4 per cent.
According to the Corridors, it has lost its value after the party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, the CDU, which met Monday in Congress, adopted a motion providing, in particular, the option for a country in difficulty to leave the euro area without leaving the European Union.
The Italian and Spanish types exceed by more than 6%
The credit rates in Italy and Spain remain at a very worrying level.
On Tuesday morning, the performance of Italian bonds at 10 years old was 6.85%, while Spanish bonds at the same time offered 6.2%.
These tensions with regard to interest rates in the countries of the south, but also in France, continue to fuel the fears of the interveners.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked for time from the markets to improve the situation in Italy, which runs the risk of being stifled by the weight of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, for his part, has said that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone Summit on 27 October would be the "main work" of his Government.
Spain is at the forefront of the markets, while the legislative elections will be held there on Sunday.
The difference in rates ("spread") between 10-year bonds in Germany and Spain has reached a new historical peak.
Pending growth figures for the euro area
From the statistical point of view, France recorded an economic growth of 0.4 per cent in the third quarter, i.e. a more favourable figure than the projected 0.3 per cent, driven by domestic consumption.
The Insee, however, has revised the figure for the second quarter downwards, with a 0.1 per cent reduction in gross domestic product (GDP) rather than a stagnation.
Moreover, the fourth quarter is the one that really worries economists.
Germany, for its part, has recorded a growth of 0.5% over the same period.
The first forecasts for the euro area as a whole are expected at 11 a.m., after the European Commission has warned of the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
facts must be worth more than dogmas.
If there is one issue that cannot be dealt with in the light of short-term considerations or simply thinking about emotions, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly influences the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is appropriate that an election meeting be the time to reflect on such issues and the place of nuclear energy.
The debate will only be useful if it examines the overall economic, social and environmental implications of the proposed options.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, on rational data.
Now that we are 7 billion people on the planet, demographic evolution will mean doubling electricity demand by 2050, unless a huge part of the world's population is deprived of a vital element.
At the same time, the increasing scarcity of fossil resources will have to be alleviated in order to continue to produce electricity continuously, not forgetting the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change, an issue that has disappeared from the ecological debate.
Fukushima's accident does not alter any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains alone in its decision to renounce nuclear energy.
That is not the case with Belgium, which is subject to the need to find a source capable of replacing it, nor with Switzerland, which is only intended to build state-of-the-art power stations.
On the other hand, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to cite a few examples, are moving forward with determination with their projects.
The United States, for its part, after Fukushima decided to add a unit to its park, resuming the construction of a power plant interrupted after the Three Mile Island accident.
If the German model, based on renewable energies, is sometimes presented as an example, the reality goes against such a discourse.
The choice of Berlin will entail an increase in the price of electricity, an increase in energy dependence due to the increased need for gas imported, in particular from Russia, an increase in CO2 emissions from the construction of gas and coal plants.
In a few months, the harmful effects will be noted.
The case of Denmark should be considered.
Europe's champion in the wind sector, from which 30% of its electricity is obtained, is also one of the major users of coal and gas due to wind intermittence; for this reason, its CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are respectively 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the constancy of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity bill than those of French households.
While in a globalised economy the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of the maintenance of industrial utility in the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
For that reason, any significant reduction in nuclear energy would mean a sharp rise in the price of electricity, which would reduce realism to the wonderful declarations about the re-industrialization of our country and the defence of our purchasing power.
This is a price that the vast majority of French people refuse to pay and, in fact, do not object in principle to this type of energy, as the surveys show.
Let us remember that our country's energy policy has lost building an industrial sector with 125,000 leading jobs and 410,000 indirect jobs.
Widely export-oriented, it covers a galaxy of SMEs specialized in international markets and which can create non-displaceable jobs.
If France decided to abandon nuclear energy, it would mean the sacrifice of a large part of these SMEs and the loss of EUR 6 billion per year in French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
Which electrician would commission an EPR designed to run sixty years, when its manufacturer's collapse is planned?
To solve the nuclear energy equation, we must admit that there is no miraculous source of electricity production, as there is no diabolical source either.
Areva's development of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable solutions demonstrates the complementary nature of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is essential to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France, we have a security authority that exercises strict and transparent control over both existing power stations and the construction of Flamanville.
Our teams, of recognized professionalism, are also obsessed with security.
In half a century, the nuclear sector has suffered three serious accidents.
Only one, that of Three Mile Island, occurred under normal operating conditions; it did not cause consequences for people or the environment.
In Chernobyl, the accident was due to the reactor design and unforgivable human failures.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident was due to two natural disasters of unprecedented scope, which resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear sector will learn from this accident, as it did from the previous two.
Thanks to this progress and cooperation between the security authorities and French and German operators and builders, the EPR presents a design capable of resisting such phenomena.
As it is studied by all the electrical actors who wish to build a power plant, the interruption of its construction in Flamanville would be a great gift for the competitors of Areva and EDF, since it would leave them free to take the lead in the inevitable development of the nuclear sector.
It is indispensable and legitimate to seek the best energy options for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotion, dogma and partisan maneuvers dominate such an important debate for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Immigration, a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy applied by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various points of view: the saturation of the police, judicial and administrative services subject to the policy of figures, the compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of the "country of human rights" of France.
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students that has jumped to the headlines, with the Minister of the Interior (see the newspaper Libération of May 23rd) proclaiming in the past that France "does not need foreign talents, workers or waiters".
However, it is rarely analysed from an economic point of view.
The point is that, on this subject, there is quite a consensus between the left and the right.
In the case of the right, Jacques Chirac set the orientation stating in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem for a country with nearly two million immigrant workers", while on the left, the tone was set by Michel Rocard explaining that France "cannot take care of all the misery of the world" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, both the left and the right shared the fear of the invasion of national territory by a multitude of Polish plumbers.
On both sides, immigrants are seen as a burden on the French economy and society.
The only difference is in the degree of generosity with which they act with respect to immigrants.
In his programme, François Hollande confines himself to including banalities, indicating that co-development will solve the "problem of migration".
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may be profitable electorally, but economically it comes out very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron point out in a recent work summarizing the most recent knowledge about immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among specialists on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries receiving immigrants.
The limitation of immigration weakens growth and undermines employment.
Fears related to the impact of immigrants are based on the idea that they can replace national workers, particularly the low-skilled, by pushing for their wages to be reduced.
But experience shows that, in reality, immigrants are more complementary than substitutes for national workers and mainly exercise professions in sectors with a lack of employment.
Unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national workers and the most skilled in dynamic sectors where training does not meet the demand for staff.
A positive effect on wages
Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country lacking anaesthetics, the complementarity between nationals and immigrants causes the arrival of the latter to have a positive influence on the salaries and employment of nationals.
Taking this into account, Giovanni Peri estimated that an increase of 1% in migration flows represents an increase in real long-term wages of between 0.6 and 0.9%.
And, regardless of the fact that the diversity that immigrants bring contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (there is a large proportion of naturalized American Nobel prizes and companies such as Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Immigrants are also net contributors to social systems, as they contribute an average of 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The International Labour Organization estimates, for example, that in Germany an immigrant who arrives at the age of 30 will make a net contribution (income minus expenditure) of EUR 150,000 to the average public budgets throughout his life.
At the beginning of his mandate, Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to go and look for the growth points he lacked "with his teeth".
These teeth, which dissuade immigrants, had exactly the opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, it just needs to think of a European democracy
Democracy is a precious but also fragile asset.
The European continent should be able to remember this because, although it was invented in Athens more than two thousand years ago, throughout the twentieth century it has suffered the tragedies of the World War, totalitarianisms, the Holocaust, the gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the crowns in Greece.
Some may have believed that, in order for democracy to triumph definitively over its enemies, it would be sufficient to exercise the vote and in the most direct way possible.
We know from Napoleon "the Little One" that it was something thought of.
Universal suffrage, although it is a necessary condition for democracy, is not enough on its own and can even become an "instrument of oppression", as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a separation and control of powers, an education, Lights, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis we are experiencing in Europe is an economic crisis, but it is about to become a political and democratic crisis.
The palinody of the true-false Greek referendum had, in this regard, a dual revealing effect: it showed the need for a powerful return from the political sphere, but also the worrying feeling of its impossibility, of its incongruity.
You must reflect on this ambivalence in order to overcome it.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic battle have now shifted and that, in many cases, Republican soldiers are no longer moving in the right direction.
We will not win if we demand a succession of national referendums, organized according to needs and in a disorderly manner.
A blank signature of the absolute European monarch or a gap in the nationalist hole: what options for the citizen!
No, we do not want to strike any blows at all, but rather a common exercise, full, calm and continuous, of options and democracy, this time at European level.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal (in fact, we wouldn't know where to finish the list), because there is only one crisis, the crisis in Europe.
It is Europe as a whole that is subject to the orders of the markets and rating agencies, and it is Europe that suffers from its powerlessness and lack of solidarity.
It is Europe as a whole that suffers humiliation in the international sphere.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but it is the whole of Europe that slowly loses sovereignty and, with it, each of its nations.
The most urgent thing is that popular sovereignty recovers the helm of the European project.
Because only together will Europeans be able to reduce the burden of their debts, free themselves from markets and prepare their future through investment.
The exit from the crisis will require decisions at European level that cannot be taken without complete democratic legitimacy, unless it is to lead us to the disaster.
Having fought for a long time against this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone today calls for European economic governance.
So be it.
But thinking about it without greater political and democratic integration, and without being lived as such by the citizens, would be a new madness and lead us to a new impasse.
We must take on a new stage in European construction.
To build the Republic in France, it was necessary to "make" republicans.
The interest-driven revolution would not be enough.
This lesson remains applicable.
We must build a more economically integrated Europe.
Only by building a more democratic Europe at the political level, a true European popular sovereignty, can we be achieved.
To build Europe, let's make Europe.
Cards with "no contact" chip are generalized
The world chip card lounge starts on Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, with an optimistic atmosphere.
In fact, 2011 should end with an 11% increase in global sales of microprocessor cards (bank cards, SIM cards, etc.), with a total of 6 billion units, according to Eurosmart cabinet calculations.
The most powerful segment is that of contactless technology, which allows you to pay for public transport or purchases simply by bringing the card closer to a reader.
This year will be sold worldwide 460 million cards with no contact chip, 320 million more than the previous year!
Its share is expected to continue to increase in 2012 (an estimated 580 million units) and represent about 10% of the global chip card market (6,925 million cards).
Europe, which has been lagging behind the Asia-Pacific region for a long time, is gaining ground in the non-contact payment sector.
About 26 million Visa banking cards already have this feature, which is accepted at 75,000 payment terminals.
In France, its beginnings are more modest: 400,000 Visa cards are being used without contact.
But the large surfaces work for four.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million MasterCard Pass cards without contact this year.
To put the top gear, however, it is necessary for banks to make them available to their customers.
"There are two large French establishments that have committed themselves to systematically disseminating non-contact banking cards to their customers in the future," announces Gérard Nébouy, Director General of Visa Europe France.
Banks Test Mobile Payment
But it is only a first step towards the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
At present, there are few devices equipped with the Near Field Communication (NFC) technology, which is essential for making transactions.
"They're falling behind."
"But I should finally experience a real boom next year."
"We expect between 80 and 120 million units to be sold in 2012 worldwide," explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks take the lead.
The Crédit agricole bank announced yesterday the launch of a test between December and next June in Caen.
The iPhones will be equipped with around 200 customers and collaborators with a cover that allows the payment without contact.
The OPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseilles.
And the Société General has also stated yesterday that it is preparing the marketing of an offer that allows its customers to pay without contact through their mobile phone.
From Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front is on the rise
Paris is concerned about the links between Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The links between the Al Qaeda terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect of Boko Haram, which had long been suspected, have been confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel even said that Algiers already "has certainty."
"The way both organizations operate and intelligence reports show that they are cooperating," he explained, without providing further details.
Paris seems to come to a similar conclusion.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger last January would have resumed the catwalks.
Kidnapped in a Niamey restaurant by people related to Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory died the following day along with several of their kidnappers during an operation launched by the French special forces.
In the rubble of the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators discovered several telephone chips belonging to the terrorists.
Terrorist axis
The survey of calls indicates several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two issues especially captured the interest of the researchers: one leads to a Nigerian who remained for a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram, and the other to a man who is supposedly close to Aqmi and the sect.
"This is progress, but we must certainly wait to have more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"We have known for years that the sect enjoys external financial and intellectual support and is increasingly active," says Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, these "supports" had become increasingly evident in the evolution and discourses of Boko Haram or his operational modes, which now involve the use of increasingly complex kamikazes or explosive devices in the same style as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has since been pushing Abuya to take into account the problems generated by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities, in fact, have long regarded the group as an illumined community of unworthy interest.
A Fast Success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist magnet Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram (meaning, in Hausa, "Western education is a sin"), encourages the establishment of an Islamic emirate in northern Muslim Nigeria.
In this poor region, the partnership is experiencing rapid success.
It politicizes and demands strict respect for the sharia, while its militants launch themselves into the struggle against the ungodly central government.
The latter are primarily directed to churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram activists were especially active and attacks on police stations increased.
Abuya's reaction was, as usual, widespread.
The army attacked the city and 800 people were killed.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested alive, receives death in prison.
Since then, the sect has been radicalized and abandoned its northern feuds.
Last Christmas, he claims an attack that causes 80 deaths in Jos and then another in Abuya.
In June, Boko Haram again attacked Abuya, particularly the police protected headquarters, with a suicide attack, the first of its kind.
In August, the United Nations headquarters became its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria, is a source of concern to all security specialists.
While Aqmi has attacked Mali and Niger and Al-Chebab Somalis operate in Kenya, Boko Haram emerges as a new threat in the centre of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned him against Boko Haram and said he was willing to "share all the information".
The world according to Republican presidential candidates
In relation to China, Iran and with the help of Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry compete in simplicity and lack of knowledge.
An America weakened by the crisis, can it manage a complex world with simple ideas or even simplistic ones?
Listening to Republican candidates for the presidential election, voters might think so.
For a few days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the other candidates have been making more and more strenuous statements and shortcuts in foreign policy, traditionally a strong point for Republicans.
The slogans, often unfounded, spread over China, Iran, helping Israel.
Mitt Romney, the best-placed candidate in the race for nomination by the "Grand Old Party", has threatened to bring the Chinese to the WTO and denounce them "for the manipulation of their currency", a key issue in an America exasperated by the migration of entire fragments from their sector to Asia.
It doesn't matter if that involves the explosion of a commercial war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former Obama Ambassador to China and the only candidate who has a sophisticated vision of foreign policy, almost drowns in an attitude that "shuts up" emotions.
He has called for a firm but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of Obama).
But Huntsman, which remains stagnant in the depths of the polls, remains inaudible.
In the style of Reagan
Romney has also promised a military intervention in Iran if the sanctions fail to disrupt its nuclear programme.
"If I get elected, I'll stop Iran," he bragging.
"If Obama gets re-elected, they'll have the bomb."
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of having failed his obligations to that partner.
The businessman Herman Cain, the second best-ranked candidate, shows a shameful lack of knowledge of such subjects.
Recently, he urged to counter the Chinese military threat because Beijing "trys to develop nuclear capacity", apparently ignoring the fact that China has already had the military atom since 1964.
Texan Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to intervene in Iran, says he is willing to deploy the US army in Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
The differences are considerable with the 2008 Republican candidate John McCain, a heavy weight in foreign policy.
Opponents of the current President reply that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
They remember that Obama himself was an amateur and had to loosen the piston in the fight against terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of their naive dialogue with Iran, on the hasty exit of Iraq's "boys" and on their misrepresentations in Libya, and label it weak.
But attacks are not easy for them.
The population is more positive in judging Obama's national security record, which ended with Bin Laden.
From Iraq, he distrusts the military interventions that generate a sinking.
And, arguing that it is necessary to rebuild America economically to resurrect its leadership, Obama gives the impression of being more just.
Nord Stream, new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which connects directly Western Europe with Russia through the Baltic Sea bottom, has already been put into service.
It must supply gas to meet the needs of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with great pomp.
Last Tuesday, more than 500 guests, including four Heads of State and Government, participated on the Baltic, between orchestra music and a delicate buffet, in the inauguration of the Nord Stream, the new pipeline that communicates directly, under the sea, Russia with Germany.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte have turned together the steering wheel of the valve controlling Russian gas entry into the Western European network.
With this new pipeline, an additional 27.5 million cubic meters of Russian gas will arrive each year to Western Europe through a first had 1,224 km connecting the Saint Petersburg region with the Land of Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
A second tube should be completed by the end of 2012 which will provide a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, i.e. sufficient to cover all French consumption.
In addition, there is already talk of the possibility of building a third tube along the same route.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this enormous work presents the air of victory.
Poland and the Baltic countries had strongly opposed the project.
In fact, the Nord Stream will allow gas to be supplied directly to Germany, avoiding land transit through third countries (Poland and Ukraine).
Suddenly, these two countries lose some of their power: for them, it will be more difficult to influence Russia by threatening to close access to Western European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare the North Stream as a "new German-Soviet pact", referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That is, whether the issue is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, supporting the Russian project, has achieved greater security of supply.
But the price is a weakening of the energy Europe, as the project has created a gap between Eastern and Western Europeans.
Russia has been able, in just five years, to win its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, large gas consumers and with increasingly limited reserves.
"This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that unites us organically," François Fillon confirmed during the opening of the pipeline, demonstrating to what extent the major contracts in the gas sector are both political and economic.
All this explains the wide smiles on the faces of Gazprom's managers, numerous in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical achievement.
The underwater tube is made of concrete-coated steel to protect it against ship anchors.
It rests on the bottom of the sea, at an average depth of 200 m.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating back to World War II.
"It was necessary to remove or destroy a hundred of them, as a precaution," says Jens Müller, spokesperson for Nord Stream society.
It was also necessary to extend measures to protect fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake that weighs about 242 Eiffel towers and is not interrupted in all its length: neither by valves nor by maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned in Sweden's waters, but the project leaders gave up the control platform, seeing that the Swedish were not very willing to allow a Russian state-owned company to establish itself permanently at sea off their coasts.
"In case of failure, we will interrupt the gas passage in less than a minute," says Jens Müller.
In the event of leakage, the gas from the pipeline will therefore be released into the atmosphere.
But the builders consider it unlikely that a leak will occur, since they have planned joints that, according to forecasts, will have a leak every 100,000 years.
Control of the pipeline's condition is ensured by means of an underwater robot, carried out by a ship, carrying out external inspections, as well as by means of a device circulating inside the pipeline.
With the shape of a cigar, it is inserted inside the tube, which has a diameter of one metre, and moves with gas.
Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at a speed of three meters per second, it provides accurate data on possible metal deformations.
The pipeline has been designed to operate for fifty years without any need for repair.
Gas circulation is guaranteed simply by pressure.
At first it is 200 bars and, at the exit of 100 bars.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leading company is Gazprom, which owns 51% of the stakes.
To it, the German E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have set up a joint venture, called Nord Stream, to build and operate the pipeline.
It is based in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then rented the entire gas transport capacity to Gazprom for a renewable period of 25 years.
"Gazprom will pay you for the total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas you actually transport," says Jens Müller.
The financing of the construction of the pipeline has been completed by 30% with the contribution of the shareholders and by 70% through bank loans.
The total cost of the work should reach 7.4 billion euros for the two tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment has reached 240 million.
But minority shareholders are confident that they will not exceed their investment, since Gazprom alone assumes the risk of spending.
The pipeline emerges from the Baltic in Lubmin, on a sandy coast planted with pine trees.
Valves with a height of 4.5 metres form the gas outlet door.
There are sensors that measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas on arrival, before it is transferred to the German pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal receives a million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
In total capacity, it will be three million per hour and in 2012, six million.
Moleskine, a brand book.
Created half a century ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to give people back their taste for writing.
It has an air of adventure, from hours of writing to the light of a candle.
The Moleskine booklet is easily recognized, with its black rectangular pastes, its rubber, its broken white leaves, as aged by time.
However, Moleskine books with the present look were born... in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided at that time to launch a design notebook, but distinguished.
Maria Sebregondi, then consultant of the company, took charge of the launch of the new product.
The booklet is inspired by an old production technique, the mole skin, which refers to a varnished cotton that was used, among other things, to cover the banquets.
This type of notebook was highly valued by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has adapted to the current taste an old and forgotten object, an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century," says Maria Sebregondi, who since then became responsible for the brand in Mode Mode.
And he achieved success.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26%, reaching a volume of 12.7 million units sold.
The confidential production of the first years has remained far away, in which only 3,000 booklets were designed.
Moleskine goes beyond Italian borders and exports its products to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to determine the buyer's profile, since the notebook attracts both businessmen and students and professionals.
Like Moleskine, its users are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cult.
The small Italian company, which had twelve workers in its beginnings, now owns about 100 and, since 2008, has two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
He distributes his notebooks in bookstores, from the Fnac to the small shops in the center of the cities, and has been able to impose his identity.
"We have adapted to the times and the need to write, despite the boom of emails," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature goes hand in hand with the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand has launched the exhibition "Detour" where architects or artists exhibit their own notebook.
In August, he also released a notebook with leopard tapas, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and this cultural aura, Moleskine has been able to diversify its products: bags, calendars, pens, computer covers... The brand covers a wide range of supports.
A success that provokes envy: in autumn 2006, Mode Mode was acquired by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, thus writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled workers still so high?
About 19 per cent of people with disabilities are seeking employment.
The XV Week for the Employment of the Disabled begins today.
Despite a determined public policy, implemented since 2005, the unemployment rate among the disabled doubles the average rate: 19 per cent, compared with 9 per cent for the entire population.
Disappointing?
"No," says Éric Blanchet, Managing Director of Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of the disabled.
"The progress made over the past 15 years is considerable.
"At the time, the unemployment rate was not twice but three times higher than the average.
"However, there is still a great deal to be done."
It should be mentioned that the disabled continue to face numerous obstacles to access to employment.
They are usually older: 37% are over 50 years of age (an average of 17%).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% have not finished high school and of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very widespread among them: 53 per cent for the disabled, compared to 38 per cent on average.
In other words, there are many issues that make it particularly difficult to return to the world of work and that "constitute the crux of the problem," says Christian Grapen, CEO of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help companies hire disabled workers.
Those are the objective obstacles.
In addition, there are those who are not mentioned; people's mentality is advancing, but too slowly.
A study carried out in April by the IMS-Entreprendre association for the Cité indicated that the directors surveyed had "a level of knowledge about low disabilities", with "excessive representation of persons in wheelchairs, physically or intellectually disabled".
The result: private companies with more than 20 workers are far from the goal of hiring 6% of disabled workers, a goal that was set in a law of... 1987.
According to the latest figures available, which date back to 2008, they reach a ratio of 2.6 per cent.
"We now reach around 3%," says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, the agency responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not comply with this law.
The proof: the number of establishments "submitted to this contribution", as well as the amounts disbursed, have decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law, which increased contributions, has created great pressure for companies," explains Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also reflects a real awareness, particularly among large groups."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59 per cent of companies with between 20 and 49 employees have disabled employees in their workforce, compared to 82 per cent of companies with between 100 and 199 workers.
Hazard: "A joy"
About to face the Bleus on Tuesday night (20:45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens do not hide the pleasure generated by this friendly match.
We will not dare to say that there was connivance between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting next to each other on the stage of the Stade de France auditorium, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have actually made peace.
Five months after his front-runner's grudge against Turkey, the Belgian selector has nothing but praise for him.
"I was very happy for Eden, for her progress and for being Belgian."
"I want to move forward," says Lille's frontman.
As for the contrast between his presentations in his team and in the selection, "it is a set", it has been justified.
"In Lille, I'm all year round, which doesn't apply to Belgium.
"I have to settle down."
Summoned to play against Romania on Friday night, considering this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally "gloat".
Not to forget the pleasure.
He has been encouraging the Bleus since he was seven years old, as well as during the victorious campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been his fan," he says.
Without a doubt, this will especially reinforce the "particular" character of the meeting.
Especially because he will face "Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami), " he recalls.
"We just faced each other a little while ago.
"To play against them is always a joy."
With simplicity, Leekens has made reference to "proud".
"Pride" for playing "a gala game."
"Pride" also for checking, as "neighbour", that France "returns to being a very high-level team", about a year after Knysna's trauma.
"Laurent Blanc has done a tremendous job," he said enthusiastically.
While Belgium will not attend the next European competition, the technician would be delighted to be able to share airplanes with the Blues towards... Brazil, in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are growing up," he said.
"We're building something; players are ambitious, hungry.
"You will be able to see him in the next matches." Including the match against France.
Portugal shows a lot of confidence
Paulo Bento's Portugal faces with great optimism the return match against Bosnia (22:00), which will be held on Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the match, both teams lacked realism.
"When these 90 minutes pass, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
There is no doubt about it; the Selection, which has been running since September 2010, will qualify for the 2012 Euro Cup.
Indeed, only 90 minutes separate Portugal from happiness.
But there is a game to play and a rival, Bosnia, to defeat.
Taking into account the game of going (0-0), Friday in hell of Zenica, it seems obvious that the thing is not decided.
Portugal dominated the game for more than an hour, yes, but could not score the valuable goal that would have given it peace of mind.
"It's a good result, but at the same time it carries a risk, since we haven't scored outside the house."
But at home, at the bright Lisbon Light Stadium, the Portuguese are convinced that they will pass, before an audience that should be equally enthusiastic, even if it is evident that the party is "very equal, " says an optimistic but lucid Bento.
"We expect the party to be very equal, but we are completely convinced that we can take the lead," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance of participating in the 2012 Euro Cup," said Carlos Queiroz's successor.
Friday's tie in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score and win.
The Bosnians could get a tie, although they also need to score.
"It's a good result, but at the same time it carries a risk, since we haven't scored outside the house," Bento regrets.
"We're going to play against a team that has great technical quality and has players with great individual quality," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will go with the intention of exerting, from the beginning, a maximum pressure on the Bosnians to "not leave them time to think".
A good idea, as long as, this time, it's realistic.
