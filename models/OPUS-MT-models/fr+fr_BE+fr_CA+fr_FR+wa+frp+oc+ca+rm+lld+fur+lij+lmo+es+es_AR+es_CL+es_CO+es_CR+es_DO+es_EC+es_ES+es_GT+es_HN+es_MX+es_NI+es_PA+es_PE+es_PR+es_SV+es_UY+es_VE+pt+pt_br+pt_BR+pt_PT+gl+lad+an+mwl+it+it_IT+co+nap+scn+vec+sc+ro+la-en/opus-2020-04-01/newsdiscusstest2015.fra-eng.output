UKIP residents who refuse those living with HIV are a perfect example.
You're talking about when Nigel Farage says that NHS should not be used to pay for those who come to the UK to do health tourism, and when, with that in mind, he answers yes when the interviewer specifically asks him if people living with HIV are included in unwanted ones.
First you use specious arguments, then you discredit them by a barely veiled homophobia.
Every time I or my family need the NHS, we have to line up behind chronic hypochondria intolerants who think everything is due to them.
I think you're the one using specious arguments.
Health tourism, as defined by right-wing lunatics, practically does not exist.
I think that's what we call democracy.
Then no one would be affected by UKIP measures against health tourism, so there is no problem.
Only in the parallel universe of UKIP can Carswell appear as a revolutionary.
A quotation from a towel does not constitute evidence.
Yeah, so shoot the messenger.
The Mail didn't write the report, he just commented on it.
Those who control the majority of the media in this country should be shot for spreading such populist propaganda as if it were reality.
I don't think you know what a specious argument is.
You also don't know anything about my personal situation or my identity, so you should be careful when you try to kill the debate by accusations of homophobia.
Farage's sentence was very surprising, but only because we rarely talk about this problem.
He made absolutely no homophobic remarks.
You're gonna have to get over it.
I'm not sure where you're coming from, but I guess you don't like it when the media talk about what you don't like.
It is rarely spoken of because unlike Farage and his mad followers of Thatcher who think that AIDS and floods are a sign of god and not a reflection on their own inability to understand that the complexities of humanity are something good, so no.
Finally, the situation is as rotten in Ireland as it is in Spain.
With the new crisis coming the period of austerity will not have arranged anything.
Expecting almost 5% growth in 2015 is a big joke.
Ireland, the ''TIGRE DE L'EUROPE''' we were praised a few years ago.
We've known the rest!
This re-reads the article.
There is an attempt to suggest that Ireland is a virtuous country and that a ''NEW ECONOMIC MIRACLE''' is happening.
With the Brussels agreement, imposed on the lowest companies in Europe, a very flexible labour market, an emigration that continues.
With these ingredients not what ''pave'' for the moment with the coming of the Poles.
In the 1980s, Irlance was one of the poorest countries in the European Union, with the Portuguese, considering a constant perimeter, without the new countries, the situation is always better than it was.
The Greek was in front.
That their development was not a long, quiet river, it is on in view of recent events.
The lowest tax rate in Europe?
That's not true!
Latvia has a 0% corporate tax rate.
Now there is a real hypocrisy in France on the part of policies on the impotence actually paid by multinationals.
According to a report released in 2008 or 2009, they pay less than 5% in France in general.
Only SMEs pay full pot.
Now I confirm that road traffic has become huge again, and there are new cars (and cheres) with all corners of the street, just like before the 2008 crisis.
I have lived in Dublin for 14 years, the recovery is evident in the daily plugs since the start.
Is this supposed to be economic news?
Don't worry, I'm sure the comments will soon ignite.
In another article they are writing, 2 Vauxhaul Astra are involved in a collision on the A140.
Does Ryanair now intend to transfer passengers from one flight to another in this way?
I think Mr. O'Leary will soon buy a whole new fleet of devices, so some bumps and scratches on the old ones will soon be forgotten.
That said, I'm flying with him next week, so I hope it won't be on one of these two once they're refitted.
Then it would be entirely the fault of the other pilot.
Did Ryanair charge passengers an extra fee for the additional fear that was provided to them?
But without that kind of Irish business, you couldn't afford to go on vacation, young man.
I never took Ryanair and the last three times I took the plane was with BA.
I prefer when the airline offers quality service.
No, but it's Ryanair, so they can enjoy it.
Any article on Ryanair triggers dozens of comments from people who would never take Ryanair for those who like to take Ryanair and think that those who pay something other than the basic rate have nothing to do with themselves, etc.
It's pretty transparent.
Ryanair will not be satisfied with the additional costs due to this incident.
I wonder what the delays will be and whether it will be necessary to compensate passengers and, if so, whether Ryanair will be able to avoid paying by saying that this was an error by airport air traffic controllers.
The passengers were put on another plane in less than an hour, they are not entitled to any compensation.
I'm sorry to disappoint you and your dreams of compensation.
Welcome aboard this British Airways flight that takes the English ISIS to Syria, not true as you say.
Have a good trip.
Last Sunday in Paris, rue des Francs-Bourgeois: the Marais is largely pedestrian, and literally crowds the world.
People do not come in bulk for the quality of restaurants (some, for the most part) or for the Salon de la revue Ã  l'Espace des Blancs-Manteaux (hyper-intellectual and slightly dusty).
The reason for this crowd is that the shops are all open and the neighborhood is incredibly lively and lively.
With many foreigners spending .....
Do you think the opening of Sunday will create jobs?
Go to Paris Rue des Francs Bourgeois where shops are open on Sunday, drunk with 50% tourists.
@aloes False!
The only argument that would seem acceptable to me is that of the areas receiving a large number of foreign tourists and it is nuanced by the fact that they buy in tax relief.
Tourist areas lose a considerable volume of turnover each year for the same reasons.
There is still the industry where expensive equipment, operated on Sunday, allows to lower prices.
Sunday rest is a right enjoyed, with exceptions, by employees.
This is why it is provided for and regulated by the Labour Code.
Neither the Minister responsible for the economy, nor the Minister responsible for foreign affairs, have the slightest competence to reform the labour code.
As they wrap it up.
What's the law for?
To satisfy part of the population and businesses who want to work on Sunday.
In Montreal on Sunday a.m. I take my grandchildren to the municipal library.
In my city of 30,000 inhabitants where I live in France the municipal library is open 4 days a week but not the we!
This is the access to culture ...
And that is also the regulation of working time.
the way of life he defended with tenacity against fascism
the way of life he defended with tenacity against fascism and Bolshevism
What if his daughter's estate was, against his will, used to pay the inheritance fee?
There are paintings.
Some are good, others are not terrible.
No doubt his estate would want his share of the cake, if you pass me the expression.
his preference for a victory of the nationalists/Franco in the Spanish civil war...
And his hostility to the independence of places like Ireland and India and his fascist ideas as a whole and also add his well-known hatred of the Jews.
Churchill wasn't perfect.
Me neither.
But for five years, and only for five years, he was perfect.
In 1940 He stood up to the other arists of the government who wanted to discuss a "agreement" with the Nazis and he very skillfully won.
Thanks to his magnificent rhetoric and energy, he united the country in the idea that fighting the fascists was the only way to win.
The inhabitants of the United Kingdom, and of France, and of Belgium and, ultimately, the whole world, can thank God for having had during these five years, just these five years, Churchill at the bar and no one else.
Churchill's greatness has nothing to do with this discussion.
That his descendants sell the paintings on the free market to raise the money from the inheritance fees, they could even make a profit.
If the public wants to be able to admire one of them in a museum, let them raise the money to buy it.
It's as simple as that.
But we could use the tax money.
No one can deny that, when it was "the moment of truth", Churchill's personality was a positive advantage for his country during the Second World War.
A revival of the internal market through public works will only favour large companies, which will increase their dividends by avoiding hiring, as infrastructure works are by definition not renewable.
As for the social reforms advocated by the Minister, they reflect the real French evil:
Return to the Princeps values.
A reform of unemployment insurance is not contradictory.
May the weakest of us not be in need!
Either in solidarity we come to his help, or he has RIGHT in exchange for the services he renders or has rendered to a minimum of resources.
The SM40H I prefer to the smic corresponds to this vision.
There is also the lessor who lives income from his property.
There is a need to differentiate between those who invest for a return at the time of retirement and those who live on their pensions.
One good to rent or two for a couple above, that's vice
The little genius of Finance is particularly lacking in imagination.
The new deal was a policy of great work, but at a time of shortage in large infrastructure.
Today, in Europe and France, this is not the case.
Developed countries are over-equipped.
The need for infrastructure is marginal so in no way a new deal could be a solution.
Especially at a time when the question of decline emerges in response to a recession that is only a wild and therefore brutal decline
You would have been right 30 years ago: more need (or possibilities) of dams, coal mines, highways...
But if we want to make the future climate-energy shock less harsh, then the need for investments is critical: isolation, renovation of the rail network, urban transport, transport and energy storage etc.
A tax that favours high incomes and annuitants.
Who's in power?
Obsessed by smartphones.
Charles Arthur is really a gallop.
Samsung's profits are undermined by iPhone 6 and its competitors of the same range
Apple's mid-September introduction of larger screens for iPhone 6 and 6 Plus may have seduced buyers who would otherwise have purchased a Galaxy
I tested all these phones and decided for LG G3.
So Samsung lost me as a client, but not to Apple.
I think it is essential that we have an alternative.
When Microsoft implemented this philosophy, we experienced a decade of stagnation that was finally broken by Google, Apple and the open source community.
We must have several dynamic platforms to stimulate competition and development.
In addition we all have different needs and they cannot be met by a single manufacturer, because they are not compatible.
For me, I tend to buy Apple, because I like their underlying philosophy and I like design.
Some people do not attach any value to design, for them the options, functionality and price take precedence.
There's nothing wrong with that.
Let's stop looking for "a better platform."
Is there "a better car manufacturer", not really, they are different, but similar.
I would like to see a thriving laptop industry, with radically different approaches to different people and markets.
It is healthier and must be encouraged.
This is in the interests of all of us.
I'm glad you found exactly what you were looking for and that it's not an Apple product, even though I made a different choice.
Most people I know have iPhones.
Our Umpfrontist friends who, according to one of them, fight ideas and not men (on the contrary, of course Parisian fools) could tell us which author(s) they fight ideas about gender and tell us the works they intend to fight.
Or do they just attack the genre as described in The Figaro, Minute or Current Values?
Their sources are Judith Butler or Eric Zemmour?
Well, Jean, I love you, and you're an intelligent and educated person.
I said this about Judith in Furusato's vein evoking Holopherne, which had not come to me (I don't have his vividness of mind).
Otherwise, in the "bottom", since you refer to it, I am not interested in this subject, and I sincerely do not see what the problem is: I hoped that you and your friends could get me out of my backwardness, because I am slow but I understand well...
@ Jean: recognize that, culturally, sending Judith back to Holopherne, it does.
Who's afraid of the world?
But what are we afraid of, those who are afraid of?
Furasato and @ give us some answers.
The first by invoking the Judith of the Bible, the second by calling Judith Butler a very symbolic throat slicer.
We can see how intimate these studies are at home.
We are obviously no longer in the debate of the idea.
It's something else, much deeper.
@ Have you read ,Jean ,that the World has published an article on the necessity of theology?
@: With regard to an idea debate I thought it was appropriate to go to the sources.
To prepare to fight ideas from the only exposition that their detractors make (Cardinal Ratzinger, inventor of Genre Theory or X Lacroix, theologian) does not seem very rigorous to me.
But, as I explained to our umpfrontist friend, it's all the difference between having an informed opinion and a simple opinion.
I'm not sure, by the way, that he understands the nuance.
I did not read Judith, the very symbolic throat slicer, I contented myself with the "Second Sex" (it was more of my time) which is I believe the source of "the source" according to Lo's wishes.
As I watched the eclipse from Melbourne, I saw red lights when the moon briefly showed itself when the clouds opened.
This sudden appearance of the red moon had its charm and somewhat compensated for the disappointment of sometimes having the view blocked by the clouds.
It was fabulous here at FNQ.
Yes, last night's cloud really covered the coast of Victoria and NSW, while most of the rest of Australia had clear weather.
Flash special blood moon.
Tony Abbott / Joe Hockey make the Labor responsible.
But if Labour accepts our unjust budget, we will give it its true color as soon as possible.
It's obsessed with you, isn't it?
I was in Melbourne so naturally I only saw clouds.
Melbourne has also managed to cover itself throughout the week of the meteor shower of the Perseids and for almost all the important astronomical phenomena of recent years.
I'm beginning to think there's a bad genius whose only goal is to keep the people of Melbourne from seeing anything from the sky.
Melbourne is really not the best place for an observatory, even though things are greatly improving on the other side of the Cordillera.
There were periods of 10 to 20 minutes when I could not see the eclipse because of the clouds above the suburbs of Melbourne.
I'm gonna put a TAXE on this eclipse.
ANYONE who looks at this eclipse should pay a TAX.
I bet your first thought of the day is for Abbott, just like the last one before you go to bed.
Who or what will haunt you when he (forcefully) disappears?
It seems that you spent a lot of time reading the discussions looking for messages in which people criticize the Abbott government and then accusing them of being obsessed with EUX.
Beautiful picture of the moon above Sydney Harbour Bridge.
Looks like Mars is going to collide with Earth!
Nothing about stock market speculation and real estate.
Nothing on the inequalities between income from labour and capital.
Nothing about tax fraud.
Ultraliberalism is killing Europe.
Nothing about the gardens of Babylon...
The article says too much or not enough.
The details and arguments of these recommendations are not given.
No hyperlink to the original documents so you can get an opinion.
Go see today Tuesday, October 15th the results of the miracle recipes: in Spain, exports have been at the lowest for five years.
In Greece the stock market collapses.
Yet these are the examples to follow.
The reform of notaries would generate a claim for compensation of the order of EUR 8 billion.
The Ministry of Economy tells us that these claims for compensation are unfounded.
What if the Ministry of Economics made a mistake?
Will decision-makers who have earned the political benefit resulting from the courageous attack of notaries have the same courage when presenting the invoice to the state budget?
The rest in his time.
Okay, thank you, JYL....
@lol No the state is not comparable to households in terms of the management of its budget because the temporal horizon of the state is theoretically infinite while that of the household is limited by the lifespan of its members.
Moreover, unless public expenditure is considered to be unproductive, it contributes to the financing of tangible and intangible investments in the growth of tomorrow and thus future revenues.
Some elements of response.
A regrettable decision.
But remember the sacred oath of Hippocrates: the health of the profits of world pharmaceutical companies must be preserved above all.
Nice conspiracy theory.
Unfortunately, the truth doesn't match your fantasy.
The medical staff would like to be able to use it, but they have their hands tied by the law as written by the policies.
This is the same situation as for the product that causes medical abortions rather than having risky surgery, safe shoot rooms for drug addicts rather than having them on the streets, etc.
On these issues politicians want to please the uneducated masses.
By the way, doctors don't make money with drugs.
That's why there are pharmacists.
Doctors don't make money with drugs Since Liberals want our health care system to look like the U.S., you should find out how it works.
Around the world doctors are courted in the same way, but it is more or less visible.
It may have been wrong to blame the toubibs, but the reality is that many countries, including Australia, give priority to corporate profits and "research".
Read the few reports on our spending on Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and on negotiations with pharmaceutical companies in relation to other countries.
Compare the world prices of medicines everywhere, as well as the differences between countries over what is on sale or only on prescription.
This is reinforced by a political and economic process, not a medical or scientific process, direct or indirect.
In fact, some companies are currently testing marijuana inhalations against oncological pain, despite the laws that hinder them and the costly permits required.
Although manufacturers of certain drugs may not be happy with alternatives such as marijuana, those who achieve a version offering good quality products at known doses will benefit greatly.
Sorry to tell you, ma'am, but you're wrong, there's a lot going on behind the scenes for doctors and the pharmacy.
As for this hospital, they were happy to use it until someone put the chip in the ear of a hospital manager.
We can't hold patents on grass...
If "researchers" in the social sciences did research instead of politics and networking, their "work" might be used.
A researcher investigates, he does not compare one fact to another.
It's not looking to compare.
To compare is to do pedagogy not research.
It is not possible to say "the search is completed you must apply it" and then in a single jet "you must experiment in every way".
If your research is complete, why experiment?
If your research isn't complete, why do you ask us to apply it?
Can I be explained how a "researcher" can deduce that a student who cannot assimilate mathematics alone could more easily assimilate mathematics and other subjects?
New technologies make it possible to learn on the condition that students learn to use new technologies, but how would they learn new technologies if they do not know how to learn?
Pisa tests are only an indicator, making it an indicator that allows us to find indicators that are satisfactory to us.
What's the point of building an indicator that informs you of what suits you, a desire for self-promotion, a deception?
Only one way to train teachers is to keep sophists and ideologists away from training and that practitioners teach practitioners.
make reread the paragraph on internships (which unfortunately is not very argued) and you will see that your conclusion pushes us to the most ineffective conservatism: "It is a device that leads above all to the reproduction of current practices, and that does not allow to advance the system " .
In view of the general consensus on the state of the French system it is not possible to wish that only practitioners teach practitioners, even if they have their full place in a modern training of teachers.
Education theorists must have no place.
Practitioners must have one.
Would you like to be operated on by a surgeon whose training is purely theoretical, and who has never set foot in an operating block before?
There is no consensus on the causes of the problems of the education system.
Giving more weight to the education theorists would definitely destroy it.
Your analogy is totally fucked up: if I don't want to be operated on by a practitioner who only has a theoretical training, I'd like to be operated on by a surgeon who doesn't have any theoretical training and has learned on the job.
Mike Weatherley, Conservative MP in charge of the fight against copyright infringement by David Cameron
Why doesn't he just tell Cameron to stop?
Someone should make a popular arrest.
MDR exmaiers thank you.
If one day I begin to feel guilty of violating copyright, it will be enough for me to read an article like this.
In an information economy, copyright infringement = theft.
This is the same since they must quote their sources correctly.
Often, getting a license doesn't cost anything.
No, it's a copyright violation.
Not at all the same.
By using content without the right license, you deprive artists of their livelihood.
You can always debate pedantic assumptions - but it's theft.
And you can repeat it as much as you want, it won't become so true.
It's a copyright violation.
Come on, repeat it again.
If one day I begin to feel guilty of violating copyright
You obviously don't mind depriving artists of their income.
If they think they should receive money for images used in school homework, an almost perfect definition of what should be a reasonable use, then I'm happy to deprive them of this fictitious income.
Lesson 1 should be to show how, if children themselves create anything and publish it on their favorite social networks, they abandon any intellectual property to the site under the general conditions that they have passed by one click.
Perhaps if they share the earphones of their mp3 walker with a friend on the school bus, they should be expelled for breaking the law in such a way.
Ah if we could export this resource that we are overflowing with, the scoffer who says that everything is wrong....
If it's a PS MP who says so, then we have to believe it.
I have two children and when they are of choice, I would advise them to leave France if nothing has changed by then.
France pulls people down by assisting them continuously.
I do not want my children to bear the debt that this policy has created.
What pulls France down is speeches like yours.
@gus I've been working in private business forever.
I had CHANCE to work in companies run by excellent business leaders: it exists in France but it is rare.
I'm an employee because I know that I don't have the skills to run a business and this choice allows me to shoot red balls at the bad bosses I meet frequently.
At ease in my sneakers I totally share Jean-Pierre Bernajuzan's post: he is telling the horrible truth!
@gus, if we compare with the German companies that French entrepreneurs constantly cite to demand reforms in France, in Germany the companies have been able to structure their industrial fabric to make it competitive, in particular by ensuring the link between large companies and medium and small - What do French employers expect to do with it?
That the state holds their hand?
This state they're accusing of empire?
@ Jacques L.
Always this anti-business couplet on your part!
Remind me, what have you created as a job, as an added value, to be so severe?
@ Pat I understand your reaction.
In reality, France is faced with an insoluble problem: the incompetence of French entrepreneurs unable to create jobs and who are blushing and mingling while waiting for the permanent assistance of the State!
That's terrible!
But they have solutions: removal of the Labour Code, employers' charges, taxes, 45h/week paid 35, and some, walking on eggs, dare to demand the reduction of wages if not their suppression!
I look forward to seeing all the "negative" comments on this subject.
Which is ironic given the way people always complain about First Group.
From what I see where I'm from, Last hasn't really been an investment for us taxpayers.
They tried to stay in the water rather than transform themselves.
It doesn't mean that the Scottish railways haven't improved since Last took care of it.
But they had also improved with their predecessors, including British Rail.
Unfortunately, we do not have the power to do this, unfortunately.
I've been trying to get them recently, but I haven't been able to.
But, well, Labour is gonna get us out of trouble, isn't it...
It's an international subsidiary.
They already operate trains in Germany.
There is nothing to prevent people in the UK from setting up a more moral company and taking part in tenders.
But it seems that we are not very good at managing, most of our privatized services end up being managed by a foreign operator.
I still remember the scandal and the criticism when First won the Virgin contract, all this for the decision to be finally overturned.
And there is better: MTR, a Hong Kong company has won Crossrail's operating contract for 8 years.
Well, Labour, as they told us during the referendum campaign, is totally for sharing and sharing and believes that workers must all help each other across borders.
It can therefore be assumed that they will be happy with this decision ;)
Perhaps this is because the management of the Dutch is on good track while that of the British is not.
What ScotRail needs is not just a change of ownership, but above all new ideas.
Abellio may be the least bad choice possible, but the real problem is the ridiculous franchise system, not the franchisor.
"She was a fighting girl."
God, I hate it, but I really hate that kind of expression.
Assuming that being "beating" is a quality superior to many others, the concern of others, intelligence, listening, for example, being "beating" has nothing to do with surviving a disease: cancerous "beating", who are not less dead, I know about them.
Getting out of a disease has nothing to do with merit.
Come on, let's start over, too.
I'm not telling you it's THE condition to manage, I'm telling you it helps.
Nothing to do with any merit...!
When to the examples of your life, there are only you to judge them.
I'm starting again.
Insinuating, if only for a moment, that one can have merit to get out of a disease or that one can demerit not to get out of it, is simply monstrous.
The body follows or does not follow.
A body that gives up, from everywhere, despite the will, despite the trust in medicine, you have a vague idea of what C is?
I'm sorry to think otherwise, if having a solid morale makes it possible to accept and prepare for heavy treatments more easily, to try experimental treatments as this woman did and not to refuse them out of fear..
Someone who's battling in medicine is first and foremost someone who trusts medicine.
But if we'd rather go back to the "seigneur" it's something else.
Neither with merit nor with courage.
These considerations are unique to moralists.
When you catch a dirt, a real one, you get stripped to the point of becoming a zombie.
Personally, I caught two of them, dirt, fat guys, and if I "knocked out" like these psychologists say, I totally missed it.
Unless this fight is just about tightening your teeth, suffering from hell and taking a beating.
I thought the charge against Milosevic had been decided and finalized about ten years ago.
I haven't seen that name in the papers in at least that time.
What's going on?
It's a birthday.
A forgotten birthday.
His trial was conducted "quickly" and then swept under the carpet.
Is that the story we told back then?
The Communist who became a nationalist who has waged three wars in the Balkans over the last decade?
The Communist President of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia?
Please ask what we voluntarily left aside: 1.
How could NATO bombing be legal under THE LEAST Rule of International Law?
What country has Serbia attacked?
About RTS (Radio-Television-Serbia), why don't you mention that NATO destroyed the same building by killing civilians, and then considered it a valid target.
Milosevic had no way out: if he did not defend his country against NATO attacks, he would be crucified as a traitor.
And if he defended him, he'd be swallowed by the Western compressor roller.
The Westerners used a smoke screen to detach a part of a sovereign state which then unilaterally proclaimed its independence and was readily recognized by the Western states which then lied from end to end about the situation on the ground.
The Serbian population has now completely disappeared (ethnic cleansing).
Vojislav Kostunica, who is mentioned here, died politically after his first term in office because he could not understand the situation that had developed.
Zoran Djindjic was one of the most controversial figures in the political world of the time.
Ultimately, the Guardian should not qualify Milosevic as a tyrant (even if we do not love him).
To my knowledge, there is only one method of predicting earthquakes in Greece that works approximately, measuring the piezoelectric level in quartz.
This kind of study is undoubtedly useful and thank you for sharing the results.
This water has nothing to do with that of the exoplanet named HAT-P-11b, located about 124 light years from Earth in the Cygnus constellation, which would be "the smallest and coldest planet to present detectable water molecules," according to a study conducted by Drake Deming and Jonathan Fraine of the University of Maryland.
Method to be followed.
Just like those that involve animals smelling a threat come.
Thank you Science Passer to treat us, often, to these experimental prowess that are made in the world.
How would animals know (in advance)?
Probably by the perception of other elements whose rate changes in the event of an earthquake.
Like radon, for example.
An a priori odorless gas for man but perhaps detectable by animals.
All these methods are undetectable for humans, but not for the measuring instruments available to them.
But we don't have a reliable result on these tracks...
It has been observed many times (and for centuries) that some animals act strangely for a few hours with an earthquake, including chickens, cows, dogs but especially fish and snakes.
I had seen an art report telling the battle of two scientific teams, one Californian and the other Japanese, to acknowledge the validity of their work on the sensitivity of animals to terrestrial magnetic fields, and in particular to their modification before an earthquake.
So of course I'm not a scientist but their assumptions convinced me!
Where are we on this research?
Why so much contempt for this trail?
We should learn to listen to nature again...
If we examine things calmly and rigorously, we publish it in a serious journal, and no one despises it.
As soon as we talk about the "signs" given by animals, we face the same bias: everyone will remember that 5 minutes before an earthquake the red fish turned strangely round.
I don't understand that we could think Boris would make a good leader for the Conservatives.
He's done too much as mayor of London.
When you listen to the LBC program, you can't help but think that this man doesn't know anything about it and that he's always trying to make fun of a joke.
He never responds directly to anything.
He also said he agreed with Farage, then Nick Ferrari the presenter asked him about what.
He couldn't name a single point.
He made so many promises to be elected mayor, and he didn't keep one.
It just underlines how much the rest of the Conservative Party is just a bunch of shit, doesn't it?
Because he's popular.
Because he's funny.
He was in "Have I Got News For You".
Because she's a celebrity and people have been instilled in celebrity worship.
The Londoners voted for him and so will the rest of the country.
When (and not if) he takes the lead of the party, the Tories' popularity rating will crack the ceiling I'm sure.
May God help us.
I'm not so sure: people like jokes, but don't want their prime minister to be one.
That's exactly what we used to say about the Londoners.
He should have brought with him his friend the parpaing, smarter than he did.
In many ways, I think he's trying to copy R Branson.
The Americans had one as president.
The French really and always disinterested themselves in the history of the Pacific War.
For all those who have given themselves the trouble to read a few books (there are some, including a French and excellent B.
Millot), the "Solomon" and the "steel strait" speak, as unfortunately as the dead who remained there.
It is understood that the Australians, who know (one of their heavy cruisers, Australia, must always be there in the background since the Battle of Savo) do not want to go back there.
We actually passed the island of Savo, in the "Iron Bottom Sound".
Even if the mission is coming to an end.
It's the little ones.
But the green side is a total smoke.
Calculate kerozen consumes to achieve the objective totally discredits the concept..
Just browse the list of sponsors that philanthropists.
One more com operation is not done or to be done.
The cow, it makes too much desire!!!
I look forward to the web series!
Your recipe makes me review, identifying myself a little while (I also learned to navigate with the Crocos de L'Elorn at the White Mill in Brest!).
Hat also for the ecological message, even if some criticize the impact of displacement.
The end justifies the means.
Continue to review us, and proudly show that the Bretons are great travelers!

Good evening I think the red hat that has manifested against taxes is happy to know that this trip is sponsored by the Brittany Region and the City of Brest.
More seriously it seems to me that local authorities and public bodies of all kinds should not devote a penny of our taxes to financing the dreams of some even as friendly adventurers as these!
Are there any players in the current Serbian formation of Kosovar origin?
I know Dusan Bajevic in Lyon and Milos Krasic, formerly at Juventus and now at FenerbahÃ§e, are from Mitrovica, but I don't know if they're still on the team.
This is Bisevac, the defender of Lyon, not Bajevic.
Bajevic was in the middle of the field or before in the 1970s and 1980s and trained many teams in Greece, but I don't know where he is from.
Bajevic is from Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and played as an attacker in the great team of Velez who, under the tutelage of legendary Suleman Rebac, finished second in the Yugoslav League twice (and also had sizes such as Vahid Halilhodzic and the faithful teammate of ArsÃ¨ne Wenger, Boro Primorac).
Well, thank you Mole!
Of course I know Halilhodzic and Primorac.
Just out of curiosity, what happened to Krasic?
It was said that he was going to become a great player when he was at Juve, he is currently in Turkey, but the last time he appeared on my radar screen he was linked to Blackburn *frisson*
There, I can't help you.
I know he lost his place when Conte arrived, then he went to the Fener and as far as I know he's not a holder.
Maybe he can still do something, maybe in the Indian Super League?
Seriously, Serbia.
Seriously, Albania, don't be afraid.
You should love Albania because you're neighbors.
The thing is, the flag of this drone is not the flag of today's real Albania.
Apparently it was the flag of Great Albania, which encompasses all areas where there is an important Albanian presence.
A little excessive nationalism, in fact.
Fortunately, there was not too much damage (as far as I know).
In fact, it was an Albanian flag with the map not of what is called Great Albania, but of Albania before 1913, when the great European powers decided to give ends of the country to neighbouring countries.
How could one have felt "an explosion of joy" by seeing two laps collapse knowing that women, men and unsuspecting children are inside?
How?
What bothers me a little in this "testimony" is that the only fact that I have been able, even once, to rejoice spontaneously in the horrible death of thousands of people is, in my view, a "line border" personality whose "testimonies" should be taken with the utmost caution.
No doubt in the short moment of "joy" one would not have thought of the dead or the reality of the horror inflicted.
We will have just thought, for a moment, that, for once, Muslims had managed to do truly and apocalyptically wrong to the great wicked Satan in his own heart.
To do qqch of powerful.
Great.
It seems that this feeling has been shared by thousands of Muslims who have been gnawed by their sense of humiliation.
With testimonies filmed in Palestine.
Classic Schadenfreude.
We were wondering a little bit.
The West "Christian/White/Galois" cannot measure the degree of frustration, anger, hatred of the muslim when it contemplates the general misery, the social and cultural underdevelopment of today's Arab Muslim world.
I'm talking about the suburbs of Cairo or Algiers, not the towers of Dubai.
The past splendor, certainly magnified, is not a consolation, on the contrary.
How do we get the Muslim world out of this devilish funnel?
Totally in phase, 2 major poisons irrigate the Arab world l: the musty conservatism of the powers in place and the fascist nihilism.
The common point, the freezing of thought and the excommunication (sweet or armed) of its critical expression.
That we've understood before, you mustn't push the Muslims back.
It's the only way.
Did Edwy Plenel read this article?
I suppose that's true in many countries.
But in Britain, autumn marks the beginning of six long dark, humid and depressing months that affect the well-being and mood of many people.
Besides, everyone gets sick.
Seasonal depression.
I'm suffering from it myself.
When the light goes away, it becomes hell for me and those like me.
A dose of vitamin D should help a little for mood and well-being.
Autumn is beautiful in Britain, with or without rain.
The countryside in particular is breathtaking in the autumn.
Not as breathtaking as summer green when everything is alive instead of about to die.
In Britain, if you're lucky, summer falls a weekend.
We had a nice summer this year, don't make your grinning clichÃ©s!
Not everyone.
I rarely get sick in winter.
But now I'm retired and I don't develop immunity to outside germs anymore, it can change, I guess.
It's not about to die, it's just a stage in a cycle...
A wonderful stage full of intoxicating smells, with a fever that culminates with festivities such as Halloween, Guy Fawks, Christmas, the risks of snow and many other wonderful words.
Just don't stop doing things!
Here are my recommendations for the holidays for you.
Yes, these dark, gray months actually make me much happier and more relaxed.
For the taxation of child benefits, the amount collected by the State comes mainly from deciles 8 to 10 .
But with regard to the number of households that have seen their tax increase as a result of this measure , it is mainly deciles 4 and 5 that are affected ( median income ) according to Chart 2 .
The elimination of half of the share of mainly widows is not dealt with at all in the article or rather its impact is completely underestimated: 230M euros is a joke that does not take into account the impact in 2012 and 2013 and implies that it is painless.
And it's not ready to work out.
Well, we're not on straw, but thinkers.
For once the PS does a rather left-wing policy we're not gonna cry...
It is obvious that those who are among the richest 20% must bear much more than 75% of the tax increase, why not 90%?
Let's continue and you will encourage these 20% less work or leaving.
Well, I know, it's not politically correct, but I'm saying it anyway.
Long live the Trots and the recycled OICs in the PS: they have understood everything.
Adam, you don't see what you're looking at.
The proportion is still the same, here or in Bahrain: 20% of the population has 80% of the wealth.
A fair tax is when it forbids anyone to collect as much as he can.
Beyond a certain limit the money loses all its usefulness.
And once the value of money is exceeded, money is only used to make money, that is to say to make the misfortune of the greatest number.
We're one of the richest 20%.
Probably also 20% of households that work most (and create wealth of which part is logically redistributed).
A fair tax must enable these households to benefit from part of their efforts.
Or lower your arms and live social minimums, especially if you have social housing .
The utopias of the head cutters at the Khmer Rouge have fortunately lived.
I did two AirBnBs in Norway recently.
No problem.
In one of the two, we had things that we wouldn't have had in a 5-star hotel and we didn't have to show up at the reception or face the slightest hassle.
All you have to do is go to someone's house, sleep there, put it behind you and go back.
From now on, this will be my first option when I'm on a trip.
The logo has changed, people...
Check your insurance before renting your home.
In most cases you will need some kind of homeowner's insurance.
Make sure you use a service with the right logo!
Oh, six o'clock too late.
I love Airbnb.
"It's very dangerous and highly risky" No, that's not true.
You're just really out of luck.
Based on the link provided in the article:
At his discharge, Airbnb's response to Teman was fast, almost absurdly fast.
Within 24 hours, according to an e-mail provided to Gawker by Teman, Airbnb had sent a locksmith to change the locks, arranged for him to spend a week at the hotel and transferred $23,817 (for which Airbnb is insured, but still).
Then why does this article cite Teman complaining that he received no support from Airbnb?
I LOVE AIRBNB, to receive as to travel
Hello I'm looking for people who have already used air bnb just to reassure me.
I plan to pay a down payment and a month's rent at once but I'm a little afraid to send Â£1,600 to a site I've never really heard of.
But where are we going?
"Supporting the troops," the Bu$herie sang in all tones...
So harmless weapons.
I am sure it will please families and close to thousands of dead Kurds in halabja to learn that their relatives and friends have succumbed to something other than the chemical bombings of Saddam Hussein.
Unless the content of the article has been radically modified by the author, your comment is inappropriate (to remain polite).
Furthermore, how would this mass crime committed in 1988 prove that the chemical weapons discovered almost 20 years later were still usable?
It is not very clear the author's style: "in search of weapons of mass destruction.
We're fine with that.
You think it's time to weaken the army to strengthen education.
This is never the time to strengthen education, because we are still at war.
Alternative: Is it always time to strengthen education, because we are still at war?
Education would already be greatly strengthened if "they" were to work 35 hours instead of 17.
At present, our teachers are earning more than engineers.
And don't let us believe that teachers spend 18 hours a week preparing their program.
But it can't be seen since National Education can't afford to provide a college/school office to its teachers so they work at home.
A sort of forced telework in sum, except that the employer does not pay for either the computer, internet connection, or supplies.
Besides, it's so the hideout at 5pm a week and 4 months of vacation that we can't fill the Math CAPES, come on, we're waiting for you.
What do you mean you don't want to hang on to poorly-educated chiards that parents spit on you calling you a jerk?
I believe that the priority in this area is to disarm the jihadites so that the Kurdish population can flourish better.
Where we can see that the Bush administration has done absolutely everything wrong.
My first job was in the sale in London, earning three times nothing and yet it was a job for which a degree was required.
A year later, I saw an announcement to be a worker for the London subway, it was paid Â£5,000 more a year and we weren't even asking for the patent.
I never regretted it.
In this regard, don't worry if you don't find a graduate job, try to find something that either pays well or you like to do.
If I'd stayed in graduate jobs, I'd still be paying my student loan.
I don't like company work so much, so I hope to eventually spend either in the public service or in the academic world.
LOL LOL LOL This article is really late!
Exactly, when I graduated in 2011 there was already a three-year backlog.
The best way to reduce the number of unemployed graduates?
Get rid of the bison courses such as art / letters / theatre / media / philosophy / political sciences, that is to say what is called the diplomas of the unemployed.
I have one of those degrees and I've finished production director.
It turned out that the important thing was not graduation but, as the above article says, a good career path, starting at school and throughout the university.
True, the starting salary was lower, but we're moving up the ladders quickly because in the real world, what counts is the results more than knowledge.
This debate engineering studies / artistic fields have been going on for years.
Scientists cannot solve all problems, it is more important to be able to get up in the morning, get to work on time and interact with people in order to get results.
Are letters, philosophy and art a bison?
That's ridiculous.
I suppose you're talking about degrees like media study or whatever the abscond course you went to.
Letters, philosophy, political science and art are real channels.
We need people who can explain the big questions to high school students, who understand the importance of the basics of culture such as literature, art, etc., and highlight them.
Wouldn't it be better for a real territorial policy to defuse Paris and boost the rest of France?
Personally, I can't see the inhabitants of the end of the Essonne and Val-d'Oise going back and forth every day by bike to come to work in Paris.
Intramural and small belt inhabitants already have many alternatively more convenient means of public transport (metro, bus, tram).
> Several secure and locked parks, as they already exist in the cities of northern Europe, in Dijon or Lyon, will be installed on the road.
Good idea.
On the surface, the space is cannibalized by 2RMs.
Incidentally, it is hoped that the City of Paris will work with professionals from the Netherlands and Denmark.
So much for their extensive experience in the field.
Well, we haven't found a place for a single bike hanger.
The motivation seems stronger when it comes to finding an office for Bertrand DelanoÃ«....
Well, it's not okay at all.
When we discuss with pedestrians and other users of public transport the reasons why they do not pedal it seems to me that the main reasons that emerge are: 1/ it is hyper dangerous with all these cars, these trucks, these scooters that run super fast and fuck with the survival of bicycles 2/ we take full pollution in the head For me the bike paths are peas go, we have to reduce the motor traffic (urban toll type congestion charge), reduce the speed (Paris = zone 30), enforce the code of the road by systematically verbalizing (even the bikes to the semi-bottom near that we have to adapt the code of the written road for cars 100 years ago to the bikes), generalize the buffer zones after the clogged passages, not before otherwise cars and scooters do not generate.
The bike paths are apartheid, we have to cohabit but rebalance the occupation of urban space.
Nothing on the bike in the great Paris?
Not a word about the place of the bike in the public transports?
EELV's right.
The 15% target for velo travel is ridiculous.
I'm beginning to believe that Anne Hidalgo rolled the greens in the flour.
Moreover, after what OR reports, the EFTA assistants seem sceptical.
I'd rather be optimistic.
Before the racket starts, we'd better find out who's really hiding behind this massacre.
Index: it's not Russia.
I'm not sure I like the way the world evolves.
That sounds awful.
My children are not a financial asset.
A lawyer expressed his intention to bring the case before the ECHR, but I did not hear that a complaint had actually been lodged.
In addition, they should first file complaints in Germany or Ukraine.
I also expect these cases to be postponed pending the outcome of the accident investigation report and the resulting criminal investigation.
Yeah, but Libya didn't blow up Pan Am 103 either.
Malaysia Airlines is not wrong, it is the responsibility of the airspace security authority, in this case the Ukrainian government.
Was the accident foreseeable?
Other aircraft had previously been shot down, Ukraine was launching air strikes against the rebels in the area, and any aircraft could of course be considered a possible and immediate threat.
Has the Ukrainian government taken reasonable precautions in view of an obvious threat or has it chosen to play with the lives of innocent people for airlines to pay for the overflight rights of the territory?
Where are all the pro-Kiev trolls who defend their usurper government/U.K. ultranationalists from Western Ukraine - and who want to show roughly that Putin shot down the MH17 flight.
As far as I know, there is already a complaint against the Kiev government because they are responsible for what is happening in their skies.
The previous: a 1986 Judgment of the International Court of Justice which concluded that the supply of arms by the CIA to the rebel forces of the Contras in Nicaragua did not mean that the United States was responsible for their actions.
No chance Russia will let this case go to the ICJ.
It's funny to think that Abbott means to Putin that Australians were murdered by Russian-backed rebels.
I hope he can present evidence to substantiate his allegations.
So far, the investigators haven't said anything like that.
His name is Ricardo and being such an eco-beautiful guy, it's painful!
Calling Polar is losing the north is rejoicing.
Only one question from a Beotian: Is the poor of today poorer than the poor of yesterday?
I can't help but notice that those who most virulently criticize Piketty's book haven't read it!
It's easy to read, it took me a few days.
It shows the statistical evolution of income-production, income-capital, inequality-concentration, inequality of income from labour, property of capital, merit and inheritance in the log term.
It shows that the concentration of today's capital joins that of the beginning of the 20th before 1914, it shows that it is the 2 world wars that reduced the concentration of capital, from 1914 to 1945, then how the concentration resumes after...
Bernajuzan: you say no to what.
I ask you how long it took you to read this pavement knowing that an individual's ability to concentrate has some limitations.
Secondly, the question is not whether it is easy to read.
The question is whether the summary of the central thesis given by the press is fair or not.
If it is right, one can debate it without having read the book, the main thing of which is to argue in a single sense in favour of it.
No, it's easy to read...
Bernajuzan: How long did it take you to read it?
Is the central thesis of his cobblestone summarized by the press false?
I haven't read it and I won't read it.
I therefore rely on the summary of his central thesis and this is the one that seems to me to be pure smoke.
The notion of the gap between rich and poor is subsidiary.
Has not humanity been enriched overall?
And this enrichment added to an increase in the population is the real political question today.
Malala Yousafzai is an impressive personality and deserves the price no doubt.
But remember, she's only 17.
An age at which most people are just beginning to find their place in the world.
I hope that this prize will not be a burden for the girl and that she will find her way to lead a happy life.
The problem is not the price but the political capital of Western governments who want to prove the old adage that colorful perverts are the incarnation of evil.
All my wishes for happiness in Malala, but she must realize that it is used and that nothing will be done to educate girls in Pakistan or elsewhere - even in the popular neighborhoods of Britain!
Someone thought his speech was a little strange.
She thanked her father for giving her much freedom but mentioned that if she were not where she is now, she would have been married at 14.
Malala herself is not part of these "colored perverts"?
You should not have any "antenna time" on this site.
You yourself are a horrible pervert.
It's absolutely revolting.
No, her father wasn't going to marry her when she was 14.
She was 15 when he was shot.
His father runs a school where girls attend school and is in favour of equal rights for women.
It is, and has always been, for her to receive higher education and for her to have the right to decide her own marriage.
However, he is an unusual person in Pakistan, as he believes that women are equal to men.
What she said was that an average Pakistani girl often has to get married when she's 14, without having a say.
I'm sorry she didn't state it eloquently enough for you.
This may seem contradictory, but perhaps it means that if her father had not given her freedom, she would have been married at 14 years of age.
Rather disappointed by this entry in season 4 and especially by Jessica Lange who visibly has a little trouble finding her ass character from Marlene Dietrich.
I've just looked at the last two seasons that are quite different but I have to admit that it's one of the best horror series, one of the most accomplished!
A fascinating first episode.
The realization is close to perfection and the show of Jessica Lange singing Bowie's anachronistic Life on Mars is simply overturning.
I haven't looked at this new season yet (which will be the last for me, without Lange bof bof).
In the case of American Horror Story I preferred to have all at once than to watch 13 episodes spread over 3 to 4 months.
But one thing is on, apart from Jessica Lange extraordinary, it is above all the risks of staging and editing that helped me.
We have in AHS an avalanche of original plans that ridicules the aseptization of today's productions.
I'm a little short of seeing you throw the sponge in advance for the coming seasons without even waiting to be able to gauge its quality.
Jessica Lange is certainly a pillar of this series but, as you say so well, there are many more things.
No it's just that for me Jessica Lange (and especially her way and the way she uses it) is really UN of the pillars of the series apart from the technical qualities.
And good bah I look a lot at her.
Then I find that the series sins by writing, it wants to do too much at the same time.
Season 3 was slightly below, in the 2 it was too scattered despite some excellent episodes.
I don't see them doing 10 seasons of American Horror Story or it's gonna end like 24 hours that time.
But everyone does what they want!
That's why I say "I won't look after you" that everyone is obliged to do the same!
I simply share my point of view nothing more, nothing less.
Jessica Lange's loss, I think she'll be fatal.
But then, here's the thing, it's just my opinion.
Let's talk less about tax increases, please - let's cut rather in government spending.
No, let's increase the expenses, please.
Those who wanted to saber in expenses failed.
Controversy over relatively small expenditure items, such as development assistance
The problem is that this represents less than the margin of error in government spending in the UK.
The truth is that we are all talking about nuances rather than about the change of orientation that voters seem to call their wishes and throughout this time some, in each camp, pretend that these nuances are far more important and substantial than they are - and voters see clearly in their play and find them in bad faith.
Less than 1% of expenditure.
"Debt" is assets held primarily by financial institutions in that country.
"Debt" is nothing to worry about.
I wouldn't have any problems with the government taking over a third of my income (even before I talked about consumption taxes) if I thought it was going to be used properly.
But this is not the case, and many taxpayers feel the same way.
It is said that Nigel Farage has not been quite honest on how to reduce taxes, but good, if you add our net contribution to the EU, development aid, High Speed 2, subsidies to nearly useless wind turbines and nuclear power plants that cost twice as much as they should, you arrive at a figure that makes Labour and Lib-Dem's tax on the most luxurious residences look ridiculous.
Your first Â£10,000 is not taxable.
This means that someone who earns Â£35,000 per year will pay about Â£5,000 (one seventh of their salary), someone with Â£50,000 would pay about Â£10 000 (one fifth), etc. and someone with Â£200,000 will pay about Â£70,000 (a little over a third).
What about social security contributions?
The more social security contributions, the more local taxes, the more parking fees and car vignettes, and that's before VAT.
Almost exactly 30% of my money is collected from the source before local taxes and car vignettes.
I'm paid decently, but not extravagantly.
Not that it's a problem, of course, I'm happy to pay my taxes.
But let us not pretend to believe that money falls from the sky, or that it is not important to know where billions of pounds of taxes go.
How can an unemployed person looking for work at the door-to-door prove it?
Even so, 20% of the unemployed would not be looking, which means 80% are looking and not finding.
Being unemployed myself, do I have more interest in what others are looking for or not?
Whether a potential recruiter gets 10 or 20 CVs, it increases my chances.
Actually, I haven't heard from the Employment Center in months, so does that mean that the agents are more busy with control operations than actually getting job announcements in?
I don't see the point.
Because it's not up to the state to provide work.
If Pole Emploi does not provide enough jobs, then we must avoid Pole Emploi.
How is this a sensitive subject?
We all have rights and duties, in this case we make sure that the unemployed fulfil their duties in return for their rights.
Just as a controller asks users of a means of transport, a head of service or employees of their work, etc. for their transport title.
Nobody yells at the scandal in these cases, right?
It is indeed good to remember that the unemployed have rights: the only two times I had dealings with the Employment Centre, my rights to the ARE had been poorly established, and on one of the cases, amputated by 40%, it was necessary to fight firmly.
It takes time!
I'm not an expert in law.
The registration and control is taking over at present, while the statutory Employment Centre is close to being, in fact, an insurance company.
I would add that the subject of compensation should only concern employees, they are the ones who pay the costs.
Non-employee politicians and French people are granted rights that they do not actually have!
It's not normal.
I would add that decent unemployment insurance contributes to the recovery of wage labour.
More than waiting for murderous tweets in Arabic...
In fact, there must be a direct military response in Iraq/Syria that will stop Isis so that this virus does not reach this zone of conflict.
The situation would then resemble the spread of the black plague in 1348/9 in connection with the war and the displacement of populations at the time.
The Saudis had the spirit to ban this year's Hadj in Mecca from Muslim pilgrims from the three affected countries.
El Pais reports that 7,400 have been denied their visa application because of their country of origin or recent travel.
In fact, there was a case of a Bosnian pilgrim who contracted smallpox in Mecca during the Hadj in the 1980s, probably contaminated by a Somali pilgrim, where the disease still exists.
I hope that the rest of the world will have the same presence of mind.
Is it heartless to propose to prevent Ebola patients from flying to Europe?
I thought it was simple common sense but apparently those "who know" decided that we could risk the lives of tens of thousands of people...
Those West African countries where Ebola is out of control should be put into strict quarantine.
No one's going out.
Only health personnel can enter.
21 days of waiting after treating patients before they can leave.
If they contract the Ebola virus while they are there, they stay there until they are cured.
These are not drastic measures.
Just last week, people were contaminated after having had contacts with people in West Africa although they took "all the necessary precautions".
We can stop the progress of this disease.
It mainly spreads through airlines.
Let us forbid them from offering to fly to these countries.
In addition, customs officers at airports should be trained to identify people with typical Ebola symptoms so that they can be quarantined immediately.
That he is able to convey the message of the first individual and the second group (including religious) and he has earned the Nobel Peace Prize.
I doubt that he is able to dogme the image of God characterized by the total cortex of the planet in operation.
It is still far from this conception there.
It has only been 20 years since the information appeared as the given premium of humanity, while the religion, from the cerebellum, leads our actions since Lucy perhaps.
What is the point of becoming an umpteenth Protestant church?
For those who have not noticed, Catholicism is largely minority in France today, no one is forced to join it.
Those who criticize would not in any way set foot in the Church, it is only to see the small number of Protestants in France.
What's the next step, taking away the notion of sin, too "anxiogenic"?
@louise: Sorry the church does not have a vision limited to France.
And in the world, maybe that will make it possible to touch more people...
@Martine E, to be honest (as usual) respect for others as you envisage it pre-existing to the christ.
Hillel a century before said to him: "Do not do to others what you do not want to be done to you, this is the whole Torah and the rest is only commentary: go and study!".
Christianity goes far beyond mere reciprocity but introduces agape.
Your "progress justice, peace, brotherhood" but without god?
Is this a return to communism? :-)
Next step: Take away the incarnation and the resurrection.
Jesus will remain the hero who disrupted moral laws by redefining respect for others.
Christians will then be ready to assume their role in the ethical debates of our societies and to advance justice, peace and fraternity.
Not very Catholic?
I think I remember that the small number of Protestants in France is mainly due to the fact that their ancestors were exterminated and then forcibly converted and pushed to immigration a few centuries ago.
I hesitate too much between buying this, the new Alien game, or Wasteland 2.
And the new Elite game is coming out soon.
It's not made up.
I personally would choose SoM.
I like Wasteland 2 (I even took part in her fundraising campaign) but I don't think it's worth Â£30.
If you are interested in the PC version, Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM at Â£30 and also offers a 20% discount voucher.
Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM at Â£30 and also offers a 20% discount voucher.
I'll take a look.
Of course not at work.
The computer department's joysticks block all nice sites.
Hello, is it Â£30 and then 20% off, or does the Â£30 include the 20% off?
Please note, however, that the PC version is for DX11 only.
It took me by surprise, I bought it, but I can't play it.
Plus I bought it on Steam, so no refunds, that's bad.
It's time to buy a new video card
It's a Brazilian site, but you get a valid Steam ID, I think.
Caveat emptor and all that: I didn't use it myself.
Amazon Â£30 for PC, Â£35 for Xbox 360 and PS3, Â£44 for Xbox and PS4
Thank you, I'd be afraid that one day they'll erase it from your library if they decide to attack the people who buy it there while they're out of the area planned.
So join the beta version of Elite: Dangerous.
So, in 1940, France was a "putrid land"?
Say, this Nobel Prize looks like a poisoned gift to me.
Do we have to love the France of 40, the "strange defeat"?
When you see who gets the Nobel Prize in Literature you wonder if Proust or Dostoevsky would have it today.
The Nobel is not even an event, we don't even want to read the award-winning authors.
Are Brazilians, Chinese or Australians going to read Modiano which is already difficult to read in French and which describes a universe so limited and so self-centered?
I hope the other Nobels are more credible, but frankly I doubt that.
Modiano, Levy, Musso have only a distant relationship with literature.
Did you at least read it?
Or another Nobel Prize?
It'd be better to judge.
As for the Chinese, the Brazilians and others, don't worry about them.
Foreigners are very sensitive to French literature and culture.
They'll be able to appreciate Mr.
Modiano at his fair value, if they don't already know him!
For your part, continue with LÃ©vy and Musso.
I share your opinion.
Marc Levy and Guillaume Musso keep all their chances.
So let's see who got the Nobel Prize in Literature: H.
Pinter in 2005, D.
Hello, the awful ones.
Ever since I drove one to Iceland, I've been seeing Kia Sports all over the place.
I think this thing followed me so far.
Maybe she wants to crush me?
Or swallow me like Superman III's horrible computer?
Hello Dantra, still hate?
Hello DQ - no, not today, I took my meds.
It's Wednesday!
I had a few days off.
That was cool.
Last weekend I went to Nottingham's beer and cider party.
It was messy.
I was able to taste 19 different beers, Wobbly Weasel being one of my favorites.
I was pleasantly surprised by the mix of people there, there were not only CAMRA fanatics (not to be confused with the camera fanatics).
Driving back on Sunday was really hard.
Monday night we went to a friend's grandfather's house to play nine card brag.
Thanks to a real chance of a beginner I was able to leave with several decent bets.
I hope if I get to 95, I'll be as alive as he is.
Last night I went to a fancy cocktail bar in Farringdon.
One of my drinks came in with a slice of lard on it.
I admire Mr.
Read a little Buddha and you will understand how wrong you are, dear Christian.
However, without wishing to upset you, I believe that you are a little further away from the subject.
This famous whole, it forbids quests for jihadists at the exit of mosques.
She immediately reports the arms trade.
Either we have big eyes open like Meddeb and Taia or Boubaker or we have big eyes closed.
We have to choose.
It's not by keeping your eyes closed that you access the light.
Forgive me, dear Christian, but once again you are making a monumental counter-sense: all the representative authorities, organizations or associations, whether Muslim or not, having formally condemned EI and its crimes, the French, Muslim or not, have nothing to add to these unanimous official convictions.
Who doesn't say word consent.
The problem is that people like you first see them as Muslims, Arabs or Africans.
Not like French.
Unfortunately, dear Kentoc'h Mervel, doubt exists for everyone.
As I said a thousand times, some doubt the approval by the Jewish French of Israeli massacres in Gaza, but it would be stupid and indecent to accuse them a priori and to demand that they demonstrate publicly to prove to the rest of French society that they are wrong to doubt it.
This principle is, in my view, the denial of the republic and can only help to break down French society.
If there's no doubt, so to speak.
Who says word consent, but consent to what?
Consent to a closeness with IE or to the conviction of IE.
Silence is very practical, it is the main weapon of those who want to keep the goat and cabbage.
Your position is intellectually honest but pragmatically untenable.
Alex Salmond predicted that Scotland could, in the elections, "revenge" the parties represented in Westminster because a huge gap has widened between their decentralization proposals and what they promised on the eve of the independence referendum.
Cameron must be petrified with the idea of losing all these seats in Westminster...
Cameron must be trembling to laugh.
What are these threats?
The Conservatives don't give a shit about Scotland because they don't have a seat there.
They can do what they want with electoral impunity.
I don't think even Cameron is stupid enough to believe that Labour losing seats in Westminster to the SNP is a good thing for him and the Conservatives in the long run.
Who's going to shed a tear for the Labour Party.
They will be completely eliminated in Scotland by the SNP and UKIP, which will cut off their heads in the north.
Ed Miliband joined the "PROMISS" thinking he was saving his party but without realizing that he was signing the death stop of his Scottish deputies.
No wonder some Labour Members are asking their leaders for accounts.
If the SNP wins 20-25 seats and there is no majority in parliament, even if the seats do not come from the Conservatives, they will then be in a very good position to negotiate any coalition and they will be able to force both the Conservatives and Labour to do what they promised for maximum decentralization.
I think that's more important.
Not if Labour or Conservatives want to be re-elected in England one day.
Circulating the pumps by 8% to the detriment of 85% is not a super electoral strategy.
In addition, once Scottish MPs are unable to vote on matters relating to England, the Conservatives will win all votes.
Oh, I think he is.
Cameron may not have much to lose, but Miliband does.
Maggie did it with the Ulster Unionists and it worked for her.
However, he is still in the running to be Prime Minister in 2015 and this since winning the leadership of the Labour Party.
So basically, these boxes will be virtually behind every player to look over his shoulder and see what he reads, how he reads, and to the end.
This is the "Life of Others" of East Germany or the KGB applied to the world of FRIC...
Always the same fascination for surveillance techniques.
In the end, it will have at least a sterilizing effect.
I'm waiting for the next ticket: Amazon manufactures YOUR book according to YOUR profile and this automatically thanks to an algorithm of its secret!

Thank you for the article.
As under this system, the management of DRMs is not implemented, I still have to read pirated files, books in the public domain or purchased from some publishers who have the intelligence to offer files without bugs.
Given the price I paid the Kobo, it's without regret.
I am ahuri of the widespread abdication of users in the face of the widespread appropriation of their privacy.
At your general public library, you will systematically notice that everyone gives their loyalty card (fn*c, d**itre, ...).
There are also demanding masterpieces whose opening and completion rates are likely to be derisory.

@Thomas: In the Big Data era, data doesn't really need to be personal to be relevant.
Be careful not to put all literature in the same tray.
The collection of anonymous data when there is a profile....
The harvest is not anonymous.
It is the data published by Kobo that is, not allowing either readers or authors to be identified.
But Kobo has all that information.
There have been so many exaggerated, erroneous and contradictory statements on the part of the Turkish government in recent days that the country seems to be led by a kindergarten class full of acid schizophrenic kids.
This is even worse than that if you take into account Erdogan's religious fundamentalism.
It is interesting that some Erdogan supporters think that Islamist is such an insult that they suppress your comment, but not mine. ;-)
Well seen:-P But Turkey does not want to shoot itself in the foot, unless it gains something.
If she attacks ISIS, ISIS will fight back, so it's actually shooting herself in the foot.
A retired diplomat writes on his blog: "AP reports that Iran warned the United States that it would be a mistake to seek to overthrow Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad because it would endanger Israel's security.
It is not clear in the article whether Iran is sending a serious warning of reprisals or merely advising caution.
This second option is more likely and, in any case, what is really surprising is that today the Iranian and American diplomatic commitment concerns Syria, Israel and the security of the region."
Indian Punchline's reading is highly recommended to anyone who pays attention to details rather than to traditional media-balanced c*neries. The short article you link to is important and should be read keeping in mind the realistic observations / previous warnings coming from Iran proposed from Afghanistan around 1979 - 1980.
Who are these "moderates" who seriously fight the horrible secular Assad and at the same time the perverses of ISIS?
Pipeline policy pushes the world into the abyss and I would suggest to those who refer to non-existent "moderates" to pay more attention to facts and alternatives before sending the children of others to fight in the Third World War.
"It's even worse than that if you take into account Erdogan's religious fundamentalism" Are there other religious fundamentalists in power in the Middle East?
I've got one in mind.
A Nuremberg trial for the Armenian genocide committed by the Turks would be required.
Should we "should"?
Do you realize that neither criminals nor victims have a chance to be alive yet?
A little late for that, buddy...
Wouldn't the criminals be barely old now, like 120 years old?
A little late for that, isn't it?
Particularly concerning the triumvirate of the UPC that planned and led the genocide, Talaat and Djemaal killed just after the First World War by revenge by the Armenians, and Enver killed by the Bolsheviks in a lost place in Central Asia at about the same time, when he went there dreaming of founding there a Turkish empire.
That's crazy.
An impressive mastery of the sophism of the fatal slope, but apart from that, we seek in vain contact with the real.
It's just clichÃ©s without argument.
The fetus will always hear a heart beating even in the belly of a surrogate mother.
Lesbian couples may simply have a desire for a child and not a desire to be accepted.
Sterile straight couples, too.
As for the children!
What a shame to call them future psychologically unbalanced.
One day, they will be able to defend themselves, say that they are happy to live, earn a living and pay the pension of this lady (?)
The GPA is probably a temporary "solution" in the evolution of medicine that our world knows.
It's not from today.
Many women brought and gave birth to children who were not their husbands.
It's still like this, we're like this...
The important thing in this matter is that this practice is framed so that the "goodness" of the body is limited.
But aesthetic surgery, cosmetics aren't so much body merchandising?!

It is certainly more elegant to make a good girl in a faraway country wholesale via the Internet and Pay Pal than to shoulder her responsibilities and or to avoid scandal in another century near her home without shouting at that time on all the roofs! ...
These practices were no longer done in the name of the church! ...
There are not only Christians and believers who refuse these practices ...
Nevertheless, the exploitation of bodies is a real problem.
Oh shut up, this man is passionate about something.
At the end of the '70s in the Midlands I only saw this from a distance.

But if you love it and you listen to the music - this music today it always touches you as much.
I don't know why there are so many scornful comments here about what Paul Mason says, maybe they're posted by people who have never been cool, even for a few years!
I believe that in the sports section there is an article on football that awaits your comments.
Great article, very true.
Since Tony Parson's film, there has been a shortage of reports that truly reflect the reality of culture in Northern England.
No wonder Paul Mason grasped the social and political context well, he understands things well.
Northern soul still lives, but it has been vampireized by capitalism and today it is essentially a surface phenomenon.
That said, you can listen to it if you are in the London area in November: 99psoul will again pass soul vinyls, including full of Northern soul, on Saturday, November 15 at Betsey Trotsky in Farringdon.
I too thought "always the same story", but here's a little well written and well thought out article.
Your critics really need to be more constructive.
Great article.
I loved your documentary.
I guess you're glad you escaped from Newsnight.
Last train to Wigan de Victoria/Exchange and get off at Wallgate.

Whatever the station before Wigan was Ince, 15 minutes walk from Wigan after buying a ticket for the stop after Victoria!
The beginnings of the Northern soul scene are described in an excellent episode of the police series George Gently, Gently Northern Soul, which took place in Newcastle in 1968.
Business is getting more and more poisonous.
The Palestinians have no partner for peace.
Unfortunately, Netanyahu never misses an opportunity to miss an opportunity to negotiate peace.
@Jonathan: Netanyahu does not seek peace because he wants to continue to occupy-colonize (in fact, it was also the case of Rabin).
It is clear that Rabin, Netanyahu and their voters have all preferred occupation-colonisation to peace.
He took off his clothes, laid them on the rock, and entered the water.
An Israeli stole them from him.
The Israeli representative got angry and shouted, "What are you talking about?
The Israelis weren't even there at the time!"
The Palestinian representative (UN)soured and added: and now that things are clearly established
Israel and the majority of its population have no confidence in the bipolar government of the Palestinian authority and will not lower the guard ...
What displeases the anti-Israeli people is obvious, it is not the goal sought ...
Anti-Zionist: But I answered you, I translate: the global geopolitical report ...
And it has always been so since the Politics is globalized ...
Avoidance, avoidance...
In the Israeli-Colonialist conflict, for the creation of the Palestinian state, it is certain, it persists!
For the creation of Israel you do not answer.
What relationship of force has allowed the creation of Israel?
Anti-Zionist: The Israeli-Palestine conflict is still a powerful relationship today!
Do you doubt it?!!! ...
Besides, this isn't just about Russell Brand, but the Guardian's journalists seem to have a hard time going beyond anything he doesn't have to say.
Many of what he says are only pseudo-chomsky balleveties written by no other.
This proves that you don't understand what Russell Brand says, or what Noam Chomsky says.
It's just a series of personal attacks and insinuations (my 13-year-old daughter likes it, which would mean it's a matter of immaturity).
A really vicious charge, with just a hint of awareness that Russell Brand tells some truths, maybe truths that one prefers not to think about.
Hold on, this feeling is going to be more and more widespread!
I can understand why Brand hates some: he sometimes speaks pretentiously and after all the nonsense of the tabloids he actually gives the impression of being a beginner populist, but this whole story of not voting was completely misinterpreted by me.
The general consensus seems to be that it just tells people not to vote and rather to cross hands and ignore the whole political process - but if you look at the interview of Paxman and other articles/videos that he posted, it says that voting once every 5 years only for Labour or Conservatives (or Lib Dems I suppose) and limiting the democratic commitment to it is completely useless, the two parties (to slightly different degrees) ruling essentially in favor of particular interests, multinational corporations and the rich, At no time does it say to simply ignore the policy completely because these parties do not govern on our behalf: it insists that instead of just voting and disconnecting for five years, people should become much more active politically at the local level, organize movements, demonstrations, petitions, no matter and try to influence politics from that.
I do not say that I necessarily agree with his solution (because I think that being politically active by submitting his demands can go hand in hand with voting, since politicians are wankers who will change their mind if they really risk losing the elections), but it is rabid to see all these condescending answers that say that this idiot who makes Jesus tells the young people not to bother to vote and just hope that everything will be better because it is really distorting his arguments.
His solution is extremely questionable and it would be good if people were to debate what he actually says rather than simply label him as irresponsible and put aside the concerns of him and a large number of people left behind.
Yes, thank you.
The voting thing has been completely distorted.
The point of slipping a ballot paper into a ballot box every five years really pisses me off because my vote really doesn't count for anything.
I want more referendums, electronic voting, direct democracy and MEPs who report locally to their constituents.
In addition, I challenge the idea that Russell Brand's words are not his own (written by others).
He is smart enough to have his own words and ideas, even if they are strongly influenced by the kind of anti-establishment thinkers and academics from the counter-culture that Suzanne would like to group under the label "billems pseudo-chomskyists".
I am rather convinced that in a debate he would succeed in convincing Suzanne.
Maybe that's what the Guardian could do, that Suzanne would do like Polly Toynbee and interview Russell on a veranda, with even the head bumps added to the mount!
Like Max Keiser, who at first attacked Russell but eventually became one of his fans and invited him on his show, it's too easy to attack him without really understanding where he wants to come from.
It draws on a political discourse that has existed for generations, but has been marginalized by traditional media - including the Guardian - for generations.
This "fronde" reveals above all to me that the intellectual debate has not been held for a long time at the RDV of History where professional historians have become minority and where the exchanges of specialists have become impoverished for the benefit of ready-to-think condensed Sciences Po-type press dossiers.
For my part, I had seen in Pierre Bourdieu's intellectual attitude as well as that of Michel Foucault, a need to attack a guilty, scapegoat.
They develop both of the very rational reasonings, but this rationality rests on these scapegoats which are the keystone of their thinking.
I believe rather that for Foucault the state was indispensable as a culprit.
This comes from a very archaic thought, sacrificial thought, which is also magical thought.
We solve the problem of the relationship to the other by eliminating it.
There is an anarchist slope, neo-lib and / or libertarian (of the two terms the second marks a hardening of the desire to eradicate the state, the first knowing to go seek the help of the state for its markets) in the sense of at least state / not state at all at Foucault.
The old dream of the base that self-organizes beautifully.
His thought is built on the guilt of the state: without this guilt it does not stand.
Who says guilty, says elimination, murder, sacrifice.
This is not a stand against the three intellectuals cited here.
Not even a bit of support.
The totalitarian left remembers the good old days, that of his god of then, Stalin, the little father of the peoples.
Oulala, you probably read a cahouya too quickly if you took Foucault's texts on the Iranian revolution for Khomeiny's apologie.
Today, even Pierre Manent would no longer have fun attacking Michel through this...
Gauchet presents a profound reflection on the contemporary individual and the collective, on the difficulty of the accession mechanism in our advanced liberal societies.
Whether we agree with him or not, he's an original and respectable thinker.
Seeing this cabal orchestrated by researchers in the humanities of the hard left who can't stand that we move from allegiance to their mantras, is quite laughable.
The narcissism and authoritarianism of these people is limitless.
An important point to add seems to me to be the posture of these "rebels", which is only intellectual and theoretical.
The treatment of Chinese and other "yellows" I witnessed in Russia is absolutely incredible.
You didn't have the pleasure of hearing our Australian friends on this subject, then.
And where was it in Russia, that a Russian could meet a Chinese and have a personal opinion?
I don't remember when I last saw a Chinese man.
In London and they were sympathetic to me when they learned I was Russian.
In Russia here - in the 1990s last time, in a market.
The Chinese think white people are the same!
My family lives in Australia after coming from Hong Kong and Guangzhou a long time ago, in the middle of the 20th century, and I still hear some of them speak violently anti-Whites.
My father is not happy that his eldest daughter is dating a white man.
I also believe that attitudes have changed in Russia since the 1990s and especially in recent years: they are increasingly rich, prosperity is spreading outside the big cities, and thanks to this prosperity people travel abroad and see how others live.
From what I have been told, the Russians mainly have prejudices against unskilled temporary workers from the Caucasus and Central Asia, who work in trades and in areas where they are very likely to be exploited by their employers or faced with high crime and violence.
Although I have lived on the banks of the river Jensei, in Siberia.
Unfortunately, I heard the Australians' views on Chinese and Aboriginal people.
It's really weird that a stranger tells me that I can't stand the Chinese, while I've met two of them in my life (including one abroad), didn't keep bad memories, all the people are worth it, and, in fact, those in London were very nice, that's the only reason I remembered that they were Chinese.
Otherwise we don't remember who we meet, all people are worth it, how to remember who was who.
You know what's weird?
That you and the other Russian here spoke of the Chinese as a sort of unique fascination, as if they were an attraction in a zoo.
And yet you always go out with the so-called White.
How many Chinese men are with whites, by comparison?
None, because there is a lot of chance that the parents of these Whites would attack them PHYSICALLY.
No measure of the impartiality of justice.
Yet she is the mother of all battles and justice in France remains manipulated by groups strongly marked to the left as the union of the judiciary...
@Marabout: Forgiveness, but the courts are frankly branded a right.
When in the Union of the Judiciary, he represents only 25% of the judges.
If a measure of its bias can be taken on the basis of the relativity of the application of laws in the courts, it orders to remove two obstacles.
That of the political vision of the observer as that of the factual interpretation of the magistrate.
It then remains the mandatory tool of the law to refocus the assessment on fundamentals.
The measure of its non-observance in all judicial acts of magistrates, including the prosecution, forces a distinction to be made between the error and the partiality of the magistrates.
It would be futile to claim that acts of justice do not divide between these three groups.
Pretention and lack of knowledge are not part of an objective analysis.
And so if all this is not analyzed, how then to say that justice is improving in France?
Only by statistics that implicitly reveal that it starts from very low.
The previous preambular paragraph makes it possible to include the following in the third ratio.
The corruption* of the judiciary.
Sensitive subject in proportion to the power of nuisance* which is conferred on the judicial institution capable of such heresy.
The area under consideration is the depoliation* of heirs committed up to and including frauds in the proceedings* by successional genealogists commissioned by notaries.
This profession has won 150 million euros a year while benefiting from the coverage* provided by the quasi-judicial impunity* of the French notariat.
For the understanding of their mechanism, a part of it was reported in the comments following the first publication.
Where this coincides with the above-mentioned statistical improvement* moderated by the previous comment, it is that the judicial institution has produced, in many disputes between genealogists and heirs reluctant to be thus spoiled, a whole set of jurisprudence contrary to all laws favorable to heirs.
Is the presentation of European statistics that ignore this kind of rational criteria not then an elaborate form of lying?
Certainly totally prohibitive prices.
More equipment to rip off the disabled.
We can say that, but my brother has one of those tricycles all-terrain, built to measure his size and weight and it really allowed him to enjoy the outdoors as never a normal wheelchair, with cumbersome wheels and tires, could.
Like they say, taste and color...
The Tankchairi looks like what Jeremy Clarkson could invent for a challenge in Top Gear.
The Tankchair looks like an Epic.
I don't think the inventor of the Whill ever had to clean a dog shit on a caterpillar.
I'm sure my sister would love the tricycle on the ground, but it's just too expensive.
The ultra-long-distance wheelchair would be perfect for a disabled person with a longboard inclination.
There are hills here that would please them.
The prices actually seem high, but there are really people who put that kind of price on a bike, so "you see."
The tricycle on the ground seems particularly useful to me.
Not all disabled people are poor, though.
Many of them have reasonable insurance at their disposal.
Only if they've become disabled.
The thing is that the wheelchair market is a niche, so they can afford to practice high prices for things that they know very well are necessary to us.
We can't really say that the Whill is minimalist.
This is an example of excessive design.
Unfortunately it's just a draft, it's not planned to make it.
I'M CONTENT that the "long distance" wheelchair doesn't come into the market, because apparently there's no way to drive this damn thing.
Nearly 20,000 houses were destroyed by the Israeli army in Gaza during intensive bombing of densely populated residential areas.
Two million human beings have been prisoners of the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007 (Israel is the occupying power of the Palestinian territory, not Egypt).
Half are children and young people under the age of 18.
Eight-year-olds have lived their whole lives under Israeli blockade!
Unique situation in the world, unacceptable situation, illegal situation as well, since this blockade imposes a "collective penalty" on all civilians in Gaza.
" Entrepreneurs who work on their projects divert a little of their cement to the black market " ...
That's not wood tongue, rather concrete and armed the lady...
The references are there to support an argument or a fact.
Anti-Zionist...
The right cement goes through the tunnels!
There's the black market, that's for sure, and it's recognized.
Two million people have been prisoners of the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007.
Unique situation in the world, unacceptable situation for anyone who has a heart and a moral sense.
The U.S. has a well-kept land: Saudi Arabia.
Morsi did not have the time to rule because the dictatorship (supported by whom you know) excluded it!
Don't forget that after lifting it, Morsi had restored the blockade!!!
And I'm a Westerner, so I approve...
Jonathan...
The Blocus is Israeli-Egyptian...
The children of Gaza live on an underground fortress, built on the back of the population who chose their masters!
Having a boat is a lot of work, Aleks.
I hope you've given it some thought.
Couchsurfing is much cooler than Airbnb.
This is the very definition of the sharing economy, not for profit.
Many are only looking for a one-night stand on Couchsurfing.
So it's getting paid (or at least hoping for it) in another way.
It's always a lot cheaper than a hotel, if you have to look for the right addresses.
In addition, trusted owners and tenants often stop using Airbnb and deal directly in cash, thus bypassing Airbnb.
Where's the community in all this.
"What's she renting out on?"
No problem with the verb, what is the problem with your grammar?
The verb "to let" is not used in the United States.
The author simply used an American expression.
It's an international newspaper now, in case you hadn't noticed.
It would be better to have the right insurance for the boat, make sure it is 100% compliant with all the safety rules and ask those who manage canals and rivers for permission to do a commercial activity there (which they will certainly refuse). I have a boat and I tried to see how to rent it (in all honesty) on Airbnb, In short, it is really a nightmare...
Have you thought about the fact that boats can be moved, stolen and painted, sunk, etc.?
The barges are so slow that if someone tried to steal it it would always be close to where you left it.
Or hijacked by pirates...
All those Somali immigrants who come here and attack our barges...
Where are you going to tie him up?
No Marine Le Pen is not right!
Populism?
There is no truth other than the one that exposes the facts!
Poverty is increasing in France.
More than 150,000 young people leave school without training.
The increase in wealth in the hands of the richest is a reality.
Who's defending who?
Who's defending what?
In 2017 the mass will be said!
Capitalism is not going to get poorer!
High finance, speculates, plays with our companies therefore our jobs, with our raw materials, therefore our purchases, our food therefore our food, with the structures of care therefore our health, with our debts therefore our institutions.
They are a threat in our daily lives by the same and by our money they hold.
All this to the benefit of some hyper-mega-obese of the money.
Until proven otherwise, FH said, "My enemy has no name, my enemy has no face, my enemy is finance."
It was in 2012.
In 2014, he appointed Minister of Economics an ex-bank Rothschild, a story of better defending the interests of banksters, solely responsible for the 2007 crisis.
Was there no other count?
What do you call it, turning his jacket down, putting his pants down?
Primary and populist reaction
Actually, we don't really know what Marine Le Pen thinks.
Where did you see that?
Because the Germans refused to rescue the survivors.
I'm not sure that Spee really "refused" to rescue the survivors.
One aspect of this battle is that none of the parties seemed certain of the exact force of the enemy.
Robert Massie in his book "Castles of Steel" suggests that Spee quickly left the area because he had received a report indicating a British battleship in the area.
The sea was hot at the beginning of the day; I don't know if this was still the case at the end of the battle?
Similarly, the fight ended after sunset, making any rescue operation more difficult.
Compare this with the next battle, the battle of the Falklands, where, on photos showing the survivors being rescued, we see a calm sea in broad daylight.
In addition, the rescuers knew that there were no more German fighters in the area at this stage.
Hmm, it doesn't really match what I remember reading about this battle, so I did a quick search on Wikipedia:
"There was some confusion among the German ships as to the fate of the two ferret cruisers, who had disappeared in the dark after they had stopped firing, and a chase began.
The Leipzig saw something on fire, but as it approached it saw that it was just a wreck.
The NÃ¼rnberg, slower than the other German ships, joins the battle late and lives the Monmouth, bent and severely damaged but still in motion.
After pointing his projectors at the ship's flag, the proposal to surrender was refused and he opened the fire, finally sinking the ship.
Without reliable information, von Spee judged that Good Hope had to escape and stopped the search at 22:15.
Worrying about reports of a British quake in the vicinity, he set out to the north."
So, if that's true, the Germans, in the dark before the radar invention, did not know that a ship had sunk, and therefore could not look for survivors.
They also thought that there was a larger Royal Navy battleship in the area that could have seriously damaged them, so in the confusion they got away to take advantage of their advance.
They were far from their base and Spee was well aware that they would have to make their way through many Royal Navy ships.
Cradock's sacrifice had already caused them harm and cost them about half of their ammunition, thus condemning them when they were finally taken.
Several votes stand at the UMP to demand that a permanently convicted elect be entered in the law and thus permanently ineligible.
This is a courageous position, which would also affect left-wing elected officials of course.
But nooon, it's a joke.
FOR THIS IDEA I PROPOSED A REGISTRATION IN THE MURDER OF THE CONS OF MAGISTRATES
When is the prohibition of trade unions in already protected sectors?
How long will this distortion of equality between citizens be tolerated?
Maintained by politicians (s) whose vision of society is limited to these sectors, always prompt to amote those who will take advantage of their unremovability to hinder the actions of the real politicians, who are really trying to make things move, not the beautiful speakers whose immobility is commensurate with their sufficiency.
I met them in the subway around noon with their little signs" of the money for justice" they came from the province and did not make the difference between Bercy and POPB.
It supports the existence of politicized unions whose members place the enormous power they hold in the service of its party.
It would not defend the same theses if right-wing or even extreme-right-wing unions were to target individuals on its side and wage a legal-media war against them.
Your claims are totally free.
If, at the moment, the right is denouncing the judicial news, it is simply that it has committed facts that are relevant to it!
We do not have an example of a left-wing personality who has had so much to do with Justice, but all those who have been the subject of its attention have not been given preferential treatment.
On the other hand, it must be remembered that the left-wing judicial union is not the only judicial union and that it is a minority.
That a minister is so committed to supporting trade unions shows how useful they can be.
@MCR The union you're quoting may be minority among the magistrates, but its influence is great at the Chancellery, it's not a secret.
The question now arises whether the "mission" of some judges is no more dirty than instructing.
@ Gus - You should be satisfied, the MS is minority.
What are you complaining about?
@Pivoine: You forget that magistrates are not civil servants like others: they are the only ones who have the power to charge and imprison everyone.
Jade Goody?
What if none of the participants ever came back?
Hello, Katie Waissel.
I think even the most hungry idiot of glory realizes that X-Factor can only mean the end of a career, so I'd be surprised if someone accepted their offer.
Many used it as a springboard to start a successful career.
The One Direction fills the stadiums around the world.
Others then sold a lot of records or left for West End.
Popstars, the forerunner of all these programs, has launched Chreyl Cole, who, in fact, is one of the jurors.
Even ABBA, Olivia Newton-John, CÃ©line Dion, Cliff Richard, all competed for Eurovision, like so many others.
While others like Frank Sinatra and everything else participated in competitions in the United States.
In the 1970s and 1980s, New Faces and Opportunity Knocks launched most of the British television light entertainment stars.
Of course, some have fallen into oblivion.
But that's what happens anyway to most stars who don't participate in the contests.
Rare are those who, after a tube, manage to make others.
Anyway, most singers/groups can at best hope for three albums and a best of.
Yeah, but now Cole, or whatever his name is, has fans only in the UK.
His fame comes in part from his marriage to a footballer who breathes through his mouth.
Most Americans know who Jeremy Clarkson is.
can only mean the end of a career
In fact, it's more likely to lead to a career than the typical path of rock, even if in your dreams you think that all the guitarists who smoke grass in their father's garage and swing three chords on a elementary school level poem will surely become stars and that the only question is how much they want to touch before they even release an album.
And worse than ridiculous: it establishes a completely artificial distance between the Western public and the peoples studied â a distance that turns quite quickly to racism, because the sacralist ethnologists present these distant people as infinitely superstitious and petrified with ritual moustache, while most of their ways of doing are strictly equivalent to ours and inspired, like ours, by practical considerations on a daily basis.
Except you're acting recklessly in the opposite direction.
Either, but rather than say that the drum is devoid of a sacred character, is it not better to admit that our Marianne and MoliÃ¨res do not also have a somewhat sacred character?
Our bias is as recalled to see the sacred as a sort of object well defined and circumscribed to the religious sphere.
Very interesting article in any case.
It's deco ephemeral to furnish the void.
Nothing more.
Great article, thank you.
The recent Pantheonization of illustrious figures of the Republic is an illustration that the feeling of sacred still lives.
Who still believes in the interpretations of archaeologists!
Any other discipline would throw into the net not at all scientific interpretations that last the life of a mandarin, rarely less.
When is a comparative criticism of disciplines for a little laugh?
Because what is true of archaeology is also true of the interpretations given by other disciplines.
This would bring a healthy dose of modesty.
Your contempt for archaeologists is completely unjustified!
It is thanks to them that we constantly discover treasures, precious testimonies to reconstruct history, understand societies, and the example here of comparative archaeology is exciting.
This method is not very old and before archaeologists relied on their "instinct" and knowledge, and could be mistaken.
Nowadays we have technical and scientific means so efficient that the interpretation of the excavations is better but can always be questioned by other discoveries!
One is there in full (and old) controversy over the shamanism advanced by the prehistorian Jean Clottes (cf. his book "Les shamanes de la prehistoire", especially the increased re-edition of the scientific controversy, published in the editions La Maison des Roches).
Thank you for this very informative article
Do straight men like anal sex?
For you, Mike, I could start.
So it's over between us?
I don't really understand why we can't keep three?
This paper is supposed to be serious, made for adults.
Do you really need to fall into the gutter?
No, but we're not against a play on it.
We couldn't watch a musical on it, though, that would be too gay!
We could expect that kind of comment from you.
Looks like Mary Whitehouse is back from the dead.
Since your trial offer is almost complete, may I suggest you move to the Catholic Times.
I'm sure you'll feel more at home.
He prefers mikedow.
May I suggest that we all look for a newspaper that pays real, courageous journalists to write about the Middle East, Ebola, etc. at their risks and perils.
Rather than making it sneeze with these puerile ass jokes.
Not very smart.
Go on then.
If these "childish ass jokes" shock you so much, you don't have to participate, do you?
Do you also know that this newspaper also covers the Middle East and Ebola and that it is quite possible to do both and to publish an article on anal sex?
Is that the subject that shocks you, or the fact that people laugh at it?
Nevertheless we find the amateur video of the crash on the net...
amateur video of the crash on the net... ??
If the FOM chose not to show these images it is only to protect its interests under no circumstances those of the pilot.
If the FOM had wanted to protect the pilots it would have exited the safety because at the time another vehicle (for example tow truck) was entering the circuit.
But it was necessary to finish quickly before the typhoon that we knew was coming, but for which the FOM did not consider it appropriate to advance the time of departure (television right, advertising, money...).
But other than that, they protect the pilots well.
Well, I also share that view.
But there is also that if the very British FOM brings in the SC, it will allow Nico Rosberg to have a chance at the rescue to beat the English that led then...
You're letting go of this blog, my dear Dayrton.
But it's okay, I've got a little time to dig up all your shit.
No, just no.
There's been a lot of conspiracy in F1, but never one that puts commissioners in danger of death for a distant story of one pilot's chance of victory at the expense of another.
It's not the FOM that gets out of safety because it's the FIA.
Size shade.
In view of the amateur images, the lack of image allows the AIF to avoid the embarrassing questions of the type: How is it that the Commissioner shakes a green flag in full intervention and continues to do so after the accident (see the full video after the accident)
No, it is not because the video is considered too violent that the FIA blocks the images of the accident, but because one of the commissioners clearly sees a green flag agitated, sign that the race can resume normally and that one is more under yellow flag regime.
Some comments show a bleak misconception of F1.
Yes dear Etienne, the race is no longer under a yellow flag AFTER the place of the accident, hence the agitated green flag.
That's the usual procedure.
The station of commissioners just downstream of the accident (depending on the case, it can be 10 meters as well as 100 meters after the accident) shakes the green to tell the pilots to resume a normal look.
Sensationalism sells commercials.
Before I thought the media were part of the government's "patriotic" propaganda offensive, but I'm afraid it's just about money.
And sex, let's not forget sex, the fear of having no sex life, advertising and the media are good at selling us things that are supposed to improve our sex life.
The news is doing exactly the same thing.
Buzzing with information you really don't need to worry about is just to keep scaring people so you can keep controlling them.
"When the tabloids cough about Ebola, we all catch fear" It should be "derailed", not "cough".
Given the medical reference, "to cough" is much better said in this context than "to derail".
I wonder if all the people who are anxious that Ebola could begin to spread by air realize that they now believe in evolution?
You do them too much honor.
They probably think that this is the end of the world and that Ebola is just one of the signs of the coming apocalypse.
Ebola is the Antichrist!
You confuse Ebola and Murdoch...
Great article, thank you!
A short and concise article that ridicules this abject pseudo-journalism nicely and solidly.
That made me laugh.
It's depressing to me that the media are talking about most things with this optimism backwards.
The goal is once again to keep us sufficiently scared and anxious (without getting to the hysteria) for the government to make us slip when it needs it.
I think it makes perfect sense that, if we are to face a budgetary emergency in the absence of any crisis, a terrorist emergency in the absence of any attack, why not have an Ebola crisis in the absence of any proven case?
It seems that this government is trying to save us from crises that it has invented itself.
Isn't there something fundamentally problematic about the idea of running by fear?
Congratulations on this post, and on being still from this world almost 35 years later.
Also at first it must have been horrible, given the context of the 1980s-90s.
I'm bluffing, living with the certainty of going there for years .....
Testimony perfectly useless.
As always when we talk about science.
Not only are the testimonies useless: taken in isolation, they cannot be used as scientific material.
But they have a negative influence on the objective assessment of the facts.
@trafic: Testimonials cannot be used as scientific material.
This is perhaps why we refrain from asking patients in psychiatry when we have reliable observations from relatives.
My psychiatric file mentions that my mother psychiatrist explains that I was telepathically educated by her mother-in-law.
This is therefore an objective symptom.
When I say it's bullshit, it's a subjective testimony that doesn't matter.
Ah, because the attestation of a fact (= here this testimony, which attests to the contamination and effectiveness of new treatments) is useless in a scientific approach?
So what are you basing your research on, then?
On fantasies?
Do you put fantasy theories and facts at the same level (= giving rise to verifiable testimonies)?
"Resilience": the word slumped by grandmothers, fans of J-L Delarue, who think they are great psychologists after reading D'ansembourg.
@Jim: There are plenty of meaningless buzzwords in psychics.
Cyrulnik has struck us with "resilience".
As a great scientist, Cyrilnik, I hope that he has crafted us a reliable scale of measurement to quantify it, this famous resilience.
I wonder if the Air Sentinels could save us all from Farage and company??
Doesn't that make you think of Team America?
Seriously, it's not a good idea to get the Sentinels out of the air...
And why is that?
It was a great show, and it looks like the ones who pop it up are aware of it!
So let us leave our salvation to the almighty who can do miracles.
But how are they going to get the kids to hang up?
The only solution that comes to mind is the pee-caca humor, which would kill the show.
It was already a children's show.
The kids were hanging on.
Oh, because it's a children's show?
UKIP works for the Mysteryns.
So keep your Team America.
Still in Supermarionation?
It won't be the same if you don't see the wires and the animation is well done. :-)
I look forward to seeing this (although being an adult), but I hope it will give the idea to a chain to rebroadcast the old.
The series has almost never stopped being broadcast here in Australia; it's been at least 40 years since we've had one-hour episodes on Saturdays and Sundays at 6:00 p.m.
Since the arrival of free digital television a few years ago, it is on one of the second-order commercial channels and we can always see it at these times.
And in addition, half-hour episodes now pass at 5:30 a.m., Monday through Friday!
Okay, I'm probably a "sad" 60-year-old guy, but I don't watch this show every day!
There is no "Temple Mount" in or under the mosque of the esplanades!!!
Radical Zionists have invented this to give themselves political legitimacy to colonize Jerusalem.
Moreover, all the Israeli excavations below and around the mosque of the esplanades for several decades have failed to find anything.
The temple mount if it exists it is elsewhere.
Maybe in Argentina??
This mountain is not sought for the simple reason that it is the hill on which the esplanade of mosques was built.
Its summit, or dome of the Rock, protrudes in the middle of Omar's mosque.
For Muslims, Muhammad ascended to paradise from this rock.
For the Jews, it is Mount Moriah where Abraham almost sacrificed his son Isaac there.
As long as it has been taken and contextualized, there is no propaganda, but information, dear K1K1.
Israel also counts its extremists, it is good to remember it regularly, and they are unfortunately relayed to the government (Naftali Bennet, Avigdor Liebermann, and even Netanyahu, the latter had accepted the plan to 2 states, and sautÃ©ed it continuously!).
It is also good to show how peaceful the annexation of Jerusalem is not.
Can God recognize his own?
The shortest Jewish joke: "God be praised!"
To brag about tourism in Israel, we are often shown half-dressed young naÃ¯ads on the beach.
The reality is, as usual, quite different from what advertising shows us, as can be seen in the photo that illustrates the article.
It's a little scary, though.
And this photo is a beautiful propaganda work!
Too bad the photographer of Reuters did not photograph the hundreds of Palestinians allowed to return to the Temple Mount and who prefer to stoop down the Jewish faithful, praying at the Wailing Wall.
@Mat, If this photo bothers you, it is not the newspaper, nor the photographer, but this woman and the ideology that she conveys that we must condemn.
This system is not tenable and will end in tears.
The only way to put an end to this system is by revolution.
Since the economy seems to be going out of business, large companies have benefited enormously from their employees.
They have succeeded in convincing their employees that they are lucky enough to have a job and that they cannot afford to increase wages, while at the same time and without hiding, they have given ever greater wages to the small elite at the top.
You are right, it is not tenable, but it will only change in this country when the workers really speak with one voice.
Instead of grumbling and groaning when someone else strikes, support them, show some solidarity and understand that their strike is not only about their problems, but also shows your employer that you don't mess people up with impunity.
Unless we give up democracy, in which case, it's tenable.
I totally agree.
The only thing you have forgotten is that British and American companies have sold our industry and now our services to countries where social and environmental conditions are the worst.
Like China and India, for example.
It can't all end well.
It's because we're in democracy that it lasted.
Did you vote for the TTIP?
The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) aims to increase the profits of companies held by these people by short-circuiting national governments through secret courts.
That sounds incredible, but that's exactly what the investor-state dispute settlement mechanism (ISDS) proposed by the agreement is for.
The Greens are against this project and are trying to alert people about the unimaginable damage this agreement will have to our lives.
It is only recently that we start talking about it in the media: Independent Guardian World Development Movement Look at these links and you will understand what is being negotiated behind your back.
Did Churchill not say "blood, sweat and tears"?
This makes excellent spinoffs, while digital money has no reason to fall, let alone grow on trees.
The next weak link is likely to be the automotive market.
This gentleman is right, in the 18th there were trade unions in all the regiments
In the very Catholic French army, there is a sacrificial dimension.
Let her (at last, her officers, the others, nobody knows anything) believe herself the safe of the eternal values of France, and she will fight and shut her mouth.
And then with the decline of the country, globalization, Europe, the crisis of values, in short: the dissolution of the idea of Nation, having this little relic, is comforting.
Even if it's more and more uncomfortable for her...
You still lack the union of married men, singles, married women, singles, lost dogs and I don't know what else
If you don't write the French correctly, I'll join.
You're being warned, it'll be your fault.
For the defence of class interests, protected professions with trade unions are already suffering enough, which has created a breach of equality with other citizens.
We are asked not to laugh about the fear of risk on the part of a public servant.
One can very well imagine a system that guarantees a certain freedom of expression without trade unions, or then without the right to strike as in Germany, in return for the protection they enjoy.
Otherwise, it's a disaster.
And with the carts getting ready, the government welcomes it.
What security are you talking about?
Ignorance indeed...
Ignorance for ignorance Sybille I was referring to the military and other officials, since this is the subject here commented on...
Let us delete "through its delegates" in Article 8 of the preamble to the 1946 Constitution.
He'll be like, "8.
Every worker participates in the collective determination of working conditions and in the management of enterprises".
This is absolutely essential with the eruption of information power.
And yet you have opened, probably read and commented on an article specifically entitled "The Great British Bake Off Review". ????
Wait, the section was here, empty.
I thought we should start the conversation.
Anyway, it's Joffrey's wedding I watched, and I can tell you that some of them have been well seasoned.
In the episode of Joffrey's marriage we have one of the best moments (although misleading: it was wine) in the history of television.
Also, pie mmmh...
Game of Thrones!
I love GBBO!
This is the second time in a row that, strangely, the show ends with a victory of the least worst baker; no one has done like "boom, here's my fucking cake now eat it and bow before your master"!
Maybe the extra pressure from friends and parents outside finally had an effect on them?
In previous weeks, all these outsiders were kept away.
And there's also this idea of "playing security, there's always next week" that disappears last week.
I like to cook, but I can't imagine inflicting this on myself.
I am grateful to those who do so and thus offer us super entertainment and push us to try new things.
Forward for GBBO 2015!
I agree, the last challenge of last year, the wedding cake, was absurd.
Professionals usually take days to do them and they had to do one in 3-4 hours.
The three challenges were really hard to break, I don't know how they could choose a winner.
At Luis, the only real flaw they could find was the base a little dry (even though I agree with Hollywood to say that the green frosting on Richard's mill did not give way, Richard had already lost at that time).
I must admit that several challenges in this series seem somewhat artificial because of the time allotted.
There's also cancer watching, with the solar blows.
Definitely, everything is succeeding us right now.
A bad time for humanity, we hope.
You confuse solar wind and ultraviolet rays.
UV is blocked mainly by the ozone layer, which is formed precisely by the impact of residual solar wind particles and UV.
So even if the magnetic field was weakening, there wouldn't be enough solar wind to "hunt" ozone from the stratosphere.
There would be even more, and therefore less UV and "cancers".
Fortunately, the ozone layer doesn't block UV.
They have a lot of useful functions that you don't suspect.
If we limit ourselves to man they have the interest of allowing us to have bones (vitamin D synthesis), to heat us (less than infrared), to modulate our immune system and, apparently, to improve our morale.
The ozone layer blocks carcinogenic UVCs and passes through UVAs and most UVBs.
Do you know that you do not have to be condescending and consider your interlocutor to be a survivor when you post a comment?
Especially for a minor clarification that was implied in the commentary, which itself intends to show pedagogy.
Not to mention that I'm used to melanoma, UV only accelerates its development.
They're not provoking him.
For proof: not all bronzed people necessarily have melanomas.
Or, when a toubib tells you to avoid the sun and live at the bottom of a cellar, it is better not to listen because UV is necessary for any human.
The excess, on the other hand, is like everything: it kills.
But for other reasons.
UV directly causes melanoma.
Can we fold it?
And, more importantly, can we pass it to the mixer?
or put it in the mixer...
I believe that the majority of those interested in it have established that everything can be folded if sufficient force is applied to it and the robustness of iPhone 6 is perfectly acceptable, for the purpose for which it is intended.
I think the army would need something more resilient and has not yet adopted iPhone6 as frontline communication equipment.
But for the rest of us,
It's still a good choice.
the majority of those interested in it have established that everything can be folded if sufficient force is applied to it.
Except for a Nokia 3310.
More specifically, is it already folded?
We make this joke in every discussion.
I've decided to count them.
This is the fourth folding joke I read in the comments today.
It's hard to understand how a prototype can be distributed like this.
Before we install specific software, we imagine that the phone was removed from the main production chain and we don't see how it could come back.
So, hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm..........................................
The most likely is that it is a production unit on which the iOS has not been installed properly and is therefore stuck with the factory test code installed.
I don't know how they do these things at all.
But would they put test software on everyone?
The photographs on Ebay clearly show the absence of an FCC or CE logo and the presence of a prototype red connector.
ah l article for bobo par excellence.
We want cheap products and we are surprised that the industrialists produce in Â» industrial' We highlight super u but all the signs and even the small trade are concerned How to eat good, organic avac 165â¬ (average salary in French)?

For my part, food is one.
Go without grudge, I kiss you
It is called Bobos, or rather Boboecolos, people who see the world through an ideological "software" that leads them to disconnect from reality.
It's total thought-to-reason unbundling.
They are experts in gesticulation, for example they claim to save the planet because they avoided taking a shower.
They are also experts in tartuferia, joining in this the left-cavian, from which they sometimes come, for example by condemning CO2 discharges while spending their holidays in the Maldives.
The vast majority of our citizens do not support this mixture of heavy-handed ideology and truffles, so don't be surprised to often encounter criticisms about them.
Waouh, thank you for this complete and exhaustive theorization as well as for all the associated details (airplane, shower...).
I'd like to be a part of it, but I'm not there.
The concept is not so complicated.
The boboecolos are monobloc.
You understand the concept of the left-cavian?
Well, you're in a position to understand the concept of boboecolo.
It's the perfect copy with just an ideological nuance.
Classification would be more complicated if we were interested in the greens all at once.
Boboecolo is part of it, but it represents only the most visible fringe of the green because it is the one that infests the media.
Here's a nice giraffe.
Apparently, no one wants to look that giraffe in the face.
She's so badly done, she looks vaguely like a female nude.
Chut, you're next to the plate.
You have to be part of the microcosm of art to understand the amazing beauty of the truth of this work.
But you simply don't have any legitimacy to make a comment since you haven't spent countless decades studying and flattering great artists.
The important thing is not that Emin doesn't know how to draw and always seems obsessed with the same subject.
The important thing is that she really managed to become fabulously rich and famous by having no artistic ability.
That's art.
No, it's a pig.
The fact that Emin can't draw
This is not really a proven fact.
It's more of an opinion.
Unless the only thing you can enjoy are realistic reproductions of dogs that smoke by playing pool.
Judging art may be problematic, but not in this case.
Drawing is more than just representing the real.
If you're looking for only that, a camera will do the trick.
The author also talks about Emin's expressionism.
Look again and let the image speak for itself, without comparing it to the kind of drawing you might prefer.
If it's that easy, why don't you do it yourself?
There is still something to save: riding activities, the number of Republican Guard horses or the status of generals who are no longer in active service....
L(honesty obliges us to say that France is reducing its workforce, but as all countries have done, sometimes in a more drastic way, starting with Britain.
It's only half encouraging...
The operative without the support, it quickly finds its limits!
A unique approach, at a time when we see the weaknesses, the shortcomings of our defence tool, especially in the Sahel.
A bad blow for the local authorities concerned, who lose a dimension of their activities, or even part of their history.
Where is the promised sanctification?
@edmond: That's what I was saying, look somewhere else to save money but especially not at home, at home it's really not possible...
That's exactly what you're proposing to do, look somewhere else where the gabegie is certain.
Let all those who have met little or no military thing dare come here to say, eyes in the eyes that there is no money wasted in this perimeter and this without bursting of laughter...
That the same potion is applied to the public service as a whole, and public finances will be a little better.
And for Josi: really reloud: look at the inflation of public jobs in other departments and you will understand why Defence can feel a bit busy!
Well, yes, the economies that everyone agrees to say they have to be made, they have to be seen somewhere, right?
Lack of pot, those on whom it falls groan at the murder when it comes to their home, poor darlings.
It would have to be done, but most importantly, it doesn't fall on me because, in that case, it's a crime and not an economy.
Guignols, go!
How will closing the Val de Grace weaken our defence tool in the Sahel?
As for the local authorities, history is repeated at every closing of the post, maternity, hospital and barracks.
But everyone's for savings, of course.
It's weird, a UMP mayor who wants compensation and doesn't look forward to savings in public spending.
This article is really the most amazing thing I've ever read!
This embarrassing moment where the first three people commenting make the same bad joke.
It is the depression to scroll his Facebook thread and see that 80% of his friends started their status with the phrase "This embarrassing moment".
I think they're gonna make a movie of it.
He will surely rely on hilarious scenes where someone accidentally falls on his ex on the bus on his way to work and only realizes that his skirt is back in his panties.
It's not embarrassing, it's completely stupid.
Not really, in my opinion, the author takes the role of the typical British man who has always been taught to bury his emotions and to tighten his teeth.
I'm sure if you're a Kate Bush fan, the announcement of her return to the stage after 25 years of absence was something strong.
Do you realize that your comment is now at the heart of a battle to find out who will have the rights?
I don't have the Internet.
So I don't think I can comment.
I don't have a computer.
God, I need to see this movie before I die!
I can't believe this article is the most amazing thing I've ever read!
Charlie has really shown that he is at the top of the cosmic universe of satirical journalism!
I'm falling for it!
It is absolutely necessary that I share with all my friends on Facebook and Twitter so that they finally have the illumination and discover the incredible radiance and insurmountable genius that flows from Mr. Brooker's keyboard as a divine glow.
Oh, my God, that was so lame.
Especially if they're not women or transvestites.
I'm a parasite.
This shows a positive development within democracies: the rise of regional policies and effective associative initiatives.
Until further notice, we are being confiscated the right to save our planet by states that play the truffles at every meeting to save the planet.
We therefore decide, citizens, to take control of things.
With the Commissioner they planted with energy, all these beautiful recommendations flew away ....
Translate: Wind turbines and solar farms are the Round points of tomorrow.
The whole thing is financed by the tax payer.
Please stop this pro-nuclear speech.
Pollution is not limited to CO2.
Radioactivity is much more harmful in terms of its waste and in the event of an accident.
As long as the industry is not fully controlled, it is better to limit itself to laboratories.
Renewable energy is our only salvation, provided, of course, that our consumption is drastically reduced.
Electricity from renewables to combat CO2 emissions?
France is in no way concerned.
Nuclear electricity is zero CO2 emissions at production and epsilon for the other stages.
Electricity from renewable wind or PV is already more GHG on the other stages and especially gas, or worse coal as in Germany, to compensate for intermittence.
Replacing nuclear power with wind or PV renewables would go against the fight against CO2.
Christial I do not insult you I am State Doctor in Physical Sciences 1981 plus I have done research in nuclear physics I challenge you to prove the contrary of what I said.
For what I didn't say it was you who lent me ideas I didn't say anything about Germany anything in fact you didn't respond to what I was saying and like all the people on the right to demolish the interlocutor I never do.
I would also like to quote the conclusion of experts commissioned by the German Government: the current German renewable energy programme is an inefficient and inefficient means of reducing GHG emissions and should be stopped.
0 emissions if you don't count uranium extraction and construction and if you don't count water vapour greenhouse gases of less effect than the Co2 it is true to recall two thirds of the energy produced by a nuclear power plant starts in water vapour and a little in the water of the rivers.
I stopped reading when you spoke of Pakistan as a "South Asian giant"...!!
Last time, Pakistan won against Hindustan.
I'm not surprised, most Indians who post comments only want to read and comment on articles against Pakistan.
By the way, it shows your state of mind.
It would have been the same if they had called India a South Asian giant...
I have nothing against the fact that some Pakistani players participate, but having a Pakistani version would be unacceptable.
It would just open a Pandora's box full of corruption and mafiosi.
As for the ISL, today's opening match was surprisingly interesting, with Kolkata's Athletico imposing 3-0 against Mumbai.
Pakistan still has a long way to go.
Compared to the billions and billions India devotes to the cricket of IPL and now to football, how could we one day compete with our "noisy neighbors"...
The race to the low cost pitcher is paid cash.
Too bad for such a beautiful project.
For the incident, the possible design failure occurs only with a helium too cold.
So we may not be in a lack of design, but of implementation...
Unlike arianspace which is a private company, it seems well that soyuz belongs to the Russian state...
And if the rule is the same as here the state is its own insurer..
Maybe they'll pay for the satellites in frigates who know.
This is all the more unfortunate as many media take over the only headlines - and many readers only pick up these headlines.
In total this creates an erroneous impression contrary to the content of the article itself.
I agree with you that the title is not appropriate, it unfairly challenges the project while it is only a launcher problem.
