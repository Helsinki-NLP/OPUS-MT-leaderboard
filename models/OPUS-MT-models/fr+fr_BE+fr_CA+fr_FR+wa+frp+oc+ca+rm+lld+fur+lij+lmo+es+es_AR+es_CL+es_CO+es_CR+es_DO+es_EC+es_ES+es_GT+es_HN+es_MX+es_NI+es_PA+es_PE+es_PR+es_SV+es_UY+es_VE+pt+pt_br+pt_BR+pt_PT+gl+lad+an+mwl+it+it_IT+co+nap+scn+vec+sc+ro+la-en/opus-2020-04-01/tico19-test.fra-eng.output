Rapid increase in the cumulative incidence of coronavirus (COVID-19) disease in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom between 1 January and 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows a similar trend in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, thus confirming that, although at different stages, the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in all countries.
According to Italy's experience, countries, hospitals and intensive care services must prepare for a peak of patients with VOCID-19 requiring care, and in particular intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, an outbreak of cases of unknown etiology pneumonia was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Centre for Disease Prevention and Control designated the responsible agent as a new coronavirus now known as coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
To date, approximately 80% of people with COVID-19 have mild illness, i.e., respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, most of which are cured.
In approximately 14% of cases, COVID-19 causes a more severe attack requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% develop a serious form of the disease requiring intensive care.
Mortality of patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 is approximately 4%.
As part of this study, we assess the evolution of the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and United Kingdom (UK) countries, and compare it with the evolution of Hubei Province in China.
We also compare the current number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom with Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
After China, COVID-19 continued to spread, and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world are currently following that of that country.
On March 11, 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that COVID-19 is a pandemic.
In the March 5 edition of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al. reported the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe according to the WHO case definition.
Within the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 in people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
By 15 March 2020, cases of COVID-19 had been detected in each of the 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK) with 39,768 cases and 1,727 reported deaths between 31 December 2019 and that date, including 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths for Italy alone.
Obtaining Cumulative Number and Cumulative Impact of COVID-19 Cases
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the number of cases of COVID-19 reported in each country around the world, obtained only from official sources such as ministries of health, national and regional health authorities of different countries and WHO, is updated daily at 08:00.
These data were used to assess the evolution of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK, and to compare it with Italy's experience.
In order to assess the prevalence of active cases of COVID-19, we calculated the cumulative 14-day incidence of COVID-19 cases, taking into account the natural evolution of COVID-19, within each EU/EEA country and in the United Kingdom, for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also compared the cumulative number of cases reported in each country as of March 15, 2020 at 8 a.m. with Italy's data for the period from January 31 to March 15, 2020.
Evolution of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
The 14-day cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom generally followed that of Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to increase around 21 February before experiencing a drastic increase around 28 February 2020 (additional data).
This development was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of cases reported in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom presented a similar increase in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (additional data).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom compared to Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It is noted that, by 15 March at 8 a.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom had already reported a total number of cases comparable to Italy only 3 weeks earlier or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported cases of COVID-19 is increasing rapidly within the EU/EEA and the UK.
The evolution of the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggests that the pandemic is increasing at a comparable rate in all countries.
This is despite the fact that countries are at different stages and that there are differences in the responses of national public health services, potential variations in case definitions, and differences in the selection protocols for patients to be tested for confirmation of COVID-19, including for catch-up testing.
At the beginning of March 2020, physicians in the affected regions of Italy indicated that approximately 10% of patients with COVID-19 needed intensive care, and the media reported that hospitals and intensive care services in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on admission of COVID-19 cases to hospitals and/or intensive care services are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (data not presented).
There is, however, a need for systematic collection to complement current surveillance data focusing on the number of reported cases and deaths.
A study conducted in 2010–11 showed a significant difference in the number of beds available in intermediate and intensive care services in Europe, ranging from 29.2 beds per 100,000 people in Germany to 4.2 beds in Portugal.
This means that countries have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds in intensive and intermediate care per 100,000 individuals in 2010–11).
Modeling scenarios for the saturation of care capacity, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom of the prevalence of in-patient VOCID-19 cases associated with a 90% risk of overcapacity in intensive care beds, are provided in the sixth update of the CEPCM risk assessment for VOCID-19.
Since cases were previously grouped in some regions of the EU/EEA and UK countries, and hospitals and intensive care services generally host a defined regional population, case and bed data in intensive care should preferably be established at Level 2 of the Nomenclature of Territorial Statistical Units (NUTS 2).
Italy's experience and current developments in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly within the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care services must therefore prepare for a sustained community transmission scenario of SARS-CoV-2 as well as an increase in the number of patients with VOCID-19 requiring care, and in particular intensive care, as in the affected regions of Italy.
As highlighted by the recent early risk assessment of the CEPCM, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-COV-2, moving from a containment approach to a mitigation approach, as the rapid and early increase in the number of cases may not leave enough time for decision makers and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt their response accordingly, if nothing had been implemented upstream.
The rapid risk assessment also identifies public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a short window in which each country can strengthen its control efforts to slow down the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on health services.
Otherwise, it is likely that health systems in other EU/EEA countries will face a peak of patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The 2019 Coronavirus Disease Epidemic (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far resulted in more than 3,000 deaths and infected more than 80,000 people in China and around the world, causing a humanitarian disaster.
Like its counterpart, SARS-CoV, which resulted in thousands of SARS cases in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could be transmitted by bats and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has lower severity and mortality than SARS, but is much more transmissible and affects older people more than young people and more men than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on this emerging disease, this article seeks to provide a timely and comprehensive review of this growing research topic.
We will address the fundamentals of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and disease prevention.
Although many questions are still awaiting answers, we hope that this review will help to better understand and eradicate this serious disease.
The Spring Festival, on January 25, 2020, has forever marked the Chinese, who have been forced to remain cloistered for the duration of the golden week as well as for long other weeks due to the spread of a new viral disease.
The virus is highly homologous to coronavirus (CoV) which caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore it was baptized SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and associated disease called coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan and spread rapidly throughout China before spreading to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus had resulted in more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients hospitalized and more than 3,000 deaths.
For WHO, COVID-19 is "public enemy number 1", potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 works have been published on COVID-19, including in the areas of virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report on 7 January 2020 presenting the sequence of the virus, isolated from several patients.
This review attempts to synthesize the progress of research on this emerging topic.
As soon as possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another coronavirus disease, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, an epidemic that occurred in 2012).
We will also take stock of what we have learned so far in terms of disease prevention and prognosis, and address some outstanding but urgent issues.
Coronaviruses are traditionally considered non-fatal pathogens for humans, causing mainly about 15% of common colds 4.
However, during this century we experienced two highly pathogenic coronaviruses for humans, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused an epidemic that started in China in 2003 and in Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, before spreading rapidly to many other countries with high morbidity and mortality.
The current COVID-19 is therefore the third coronavirus epidemic in recent history.
As presented in Fig. Fig.1.1, outbreaks of pneumonia of unknown origin were first reported to Wuhan on December 31, 2019 to the Chinese National Health Commission.
Seven days later, the sequence of the coronavirus was revealed.
On January 15, 2020, the first fatal case was reported to Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic had spread rapidly to cities, provinces and neighbouring countries.
On January 20, it was reported that health professionals had been infected, suggesting that interhuman transmission was possible.
On 23 January, the city of Wuhan was quarantined with interruption of all public transport.
On 24 January, the first clinical study on the disease indicated that, out of 41 confirmed cases, only 21 patients had been in direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, considered to be the starting point for infection with an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, WHO described the global emergency health epidemic as a global emergency.
At the time of writing, the disease had already spread to all of China as well as to nearly 50 other countries around the world (Fig. (Fig. 2).
To the extent that the situation is changing rapidly, the final scope and severity of the epidemic remains to be determined.
On February 11, 2020, a multicentre study of 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed cases of VOCID-19, presented an updated overview of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qqq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, but mostly in the 30-65 age group.
Nearly half (47.7%) of infected persons were over 50 years of age, very few were under 20 years of age, and only 14 were under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 infected men more (0.31/100 000) than women (0.27/100 000).
COVID-19 developed in homes, mainly in Hubei province and on the periphery.
The mean duration between onset of symptoms and diagnosis of COVID-19 was 5 days (2-9).
The average incubation period was 4.8 days (3.0-7.2).
The mean duration between onset of symptoms and death was 9.5 days (4.8-13).
The base reproduction rate (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of people infected had increased exponentially until January 23, 2020, coinciding with the massive displacements that took place prior to the Spring Festival in China.
Mortality of patients identified as confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%), and adjusted mortality of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (man), age (≥ 60) and severe pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a subfamily of large enveloped viruses containing a single strand RNA.
They can be classified into four genera, namely alpha, beta, gamma and delta, the coronaviruses known to infect humans belonging to the alpha and beta genera.
Spike (S) glycoprotein of the envelope binds to the angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme (ACE2) and to the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) of its cell receptors for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and then a membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, the genomic RNA accompanied by envelope glycoproteins and nucleocapside proteins forms vesicles containing virions, which then merge with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was presented on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 has been found to be a new type of betacoronavirus, with more than 99.98% genetic identity among 10 sequenced samples taken from the source site of the epidemic, the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically closer to SARS-CoV than to MERS-CoV.
Using electron microscopy in transmission, SARS-CoV-2 particles were detected in ultrafine sections of human epithelium in the respiratory tract.
Human ACE2 was identified as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to human ACE2 less strongly than that of SARS-CoV, which coincides with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a smaller infection than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 may also form a new short protein coded by orf3b as well as a secreted protein coded by orf8.
The orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 could play a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibit the expression of IFNβ; however, the orf8 does not contain any known functional domains or motifs.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al., presented the complete human cryo-ME structure of the ACE2 at a compound resolution of 2.9 Å with the amino acid carrier B0AT1.
They found that the complex, which had open and closed conformations, was assembled as a dimer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could bind two S proteins, providing indications for the recognition and infection of the coronavirus.
B0AT1 may become a therapeutic target for drug screening to eliminate SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The host of origin and the intermediate host
It has been established that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were derived from bats and were transmitted to humans via civettes and camelids, respectively.
Following a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, bats were advanced as the native host of SARS-CoV-2, since the new virus is 96% identical to the two SARS-type coronaviruses from bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate host that allowed the virus to cross the species barrier to infect humans remains unknown, and the channel of transmission is still to be elucidated.
Ji, et al., hypothesized that the virus could have been transmitted from bats to humans by snakes, which would imply homologous recombination within the S protein.
According to a study conducted by researchers in Guangzhou, China, pangolin - a long-snout mammal feeding on ants, often used in traditional Chinese medicine - could be the intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 if it is judged by genetic homology at 99% between a coronavirus discovered in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a 1 % difference between two genomes is a significant difference; conclusive results should therefore be expected to establish concrete evidence (Fig. (Fig.33).
The physico-chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still very little known.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in dry environment and up to 5 days at a temperature of 20 °C and a humidity of 40 to 50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may very well have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 appears to be sensitive to ultraviolet rays and to a temperature of 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine-based disinfectants, peracetic acid, chloroform and other fatty solvents, but not chlorhexidine, can effectively inactivate the virus.
The human population as a whole is generally immune from SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore vulnerable to the new virus.
Currently, no detailed studies have been reported on the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies on other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. (Fig.4).
In general, when a virus infects a host, it is first recognized by the host's innate immune system through molecular pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including type C lectin receptors, Toll type receptors (TLRs), NOD type receptors (NLRs) and RIG-I type receptors (RLRs).
Through different pathways, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the macrophage phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, the N protein of SARS-CoV may allow the virus to escape immune responses.
Soon, the adaptive immune response joins the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, particularly CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defence.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells that produce virus-specific antibodies, and CD8+ T cells directly eliminate infected cells.
Help T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to support defense cells.
However, coronavirus may inhibit T-cell functions by inducing their apoptosis.
Humoral immunity, with supplements such as C3a and C5a as well as antibodies, is also essential to fight viral infection.
For example, antibodies isolated from a recovered patient neutralized the MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an excessive reaction of the immune system causes a localized explosion of the number of free radicals, which can lead to serious damage to the lungs and other organs and, in the worst case scenario, multi-visceral failure or even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by home onset, is more likely to affect the elderly with comorbidity and pregnant women.
It is commonly accepted that people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune functions are compromised are more likely to be infected than others.
The average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to be 1 to 14 days, but more generally 3 to 7 days based on a study of the first 425 cases reported to Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period was on average 3 days, ranging from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, concluded a 4.8-day incubation period (3.0-7.2) based on a population of 8,866 cases.
It is very important for health authorities to adjust the actual duration of quarantine to the most precise incubation period possible, in order to prevent infected but asymptomatic people from transmitting the virus.
Generally, people exposed to, or infected with, the virus are quarantined for 14 days.
Does the quarantine have to be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the first and main symptom of COVID-19, and may or may not be accompanied by other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients experienced dyspnoea and/or hypoxemia one week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients rapidly developed acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms as well as those with acute fever, even in the absence of chest X-ray abnormalities, should be tested for the virus to allow early diagnosis.
A demographic study conducted at the end of December 2019 showed that patients had 98% fever, 76% dry cough, 55% dyspnoea and 3% diarrhoea; 8% of patients required ventilatory assistance.
Similar findings have been reported in two recent family and household studies following transmission of the virus from an asymptomatic individual.
Similarly, a 2012 demographic study showed that the main symptoms of patients with MERS-CoV were fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnoea (55%).
However, 80% required ventilatory assistance, much more than patients with VOCID-19, which is consistent with a higher lethality of the MERS compared to VOCID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in patients with SRM.
With respect to SARS, the main symptoms were fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnoea (40%-42%), diarrhoea (20%-25%) and sore throat (13%-25%), and ventilation assistance was required for approximately 14% to 20% of patients.
As of February 14, the mortality rate for VOCID-19 was 2%, with 66,576 confirmed cases worldwide.
In comparison, SARS mortality in November 2002 was 10% for 8,096 confirmed cases.
According to a demographic study conducted in June 2012, mortality was 37% for 2,494 confirmed cases.
An earlier study reported that SARS-CoV-2 R0 reached 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, while SARS-CoV R0 was only 2-4.
A comparison of symptoms, mortality and R0 of SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV is presented in Table 1.1.
The above data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater ability to spread than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less lethal.
As a result, it is much more difficult to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than it was for the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV epidemics.
The appearance of a home often occurs in a family or in a gathering or in a vehicle, as in the case of a cruise.
Patients have often travelled or resided in Wuhan or other affected areas, or have been in contact with infected persons or patients within two weeks of the onset of symptoms.
However, it has been shown that individuals may be carriers of the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and that patients who have been recovered may be carriers of the virus again, which underlines the need to increase the duration of quarantine.
Patients have a normal or reduced number of peripheral white blood cells (including lymphocytes) in the early stages.
For example, lymphopenia with a number of white cells < 4 × 109/L and a number of lymphocytes < 1 × 109/L, as well as a high rate of aspartate aminotransferase and viraemia were identified in 1,099 patients with COPID-19.
Some patients had elevated levels of liver enzymes, muscle enzymes and myoglobin in the blood, and most had elevated C-reactive protein levels and erythrocyte sedimentation.
In the most severe cases, the D-dimer level, a product of fibrin degradation in the blood, was high, and the number of lymphocytes was gradually decreasing.
Chest X-ray abnormalities are observed in most patients with COVID-19, characterized by uneven bilateral shadows or depolic glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In the case of ARDS, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis seriously compromise gas exchange.
The dysfunction of type I and type II pneumocytes causes a decrease in surfactant rate and an increase in surface tension, thus reducing the ability of the lungs to swell and increasing the risk of lung collapse.
Therefore, the most troubling thoracic examinations often coincide with the most severe form of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of VOCID-19 revealed a desquamation of pneumocytes, the formation of hyaline membranes, interstitial lymphocytic infiltration and the presence of multinuclear syncytial cells in the lungs of a patient who died of the disease, coinciding with viral infection and ARDS pathology and similar to that of patients with SARS and ERM.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA via polymerase chain reaction after reverse transcription (RT-PCR) was used as the primary criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negatives, which can accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which was no longer based solely on RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation had been observed for the diagnosis of SARS.
Thus, the combination of medical history, clinical events, laboratory tests and radiological examinations is essential and imperative for an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang Group described a protocol for the use of the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique for SARS-CoV-2 detection, which allows the identification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA synthetic fragments between 20 × 10-18 mol/L and 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microlitre of sample) using a reactive strip in less than one hour, without requiring sophisticated equipment.
It is hoped that this new technique will significantly improve sensitivity and practicality, if its use on clinical specimens proves successful.
Due to the lack of experience with the new coronavirus, physicians can only provide support to patients with COVID-19, while trying a variety of therapies that have already been used or proposed for the treatment of other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapies include existing and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma of recovered patients, Chinese medicine as well as psychological support.
Even plasma from recovered patients was proposed for treatment.
The pharmaceutical companies are all working to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs initially and probably also, to a lesser extent, other organs expressing ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
However, dysfunction and respiratory failure are the main threat to patients and the leading cause of death.
Thus, respiratory assistance is essential to relieve symptoms and save lives; this includes general oxygen therapy, high flow oxygen therapy, non-invasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should receive extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (OMEC), a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique used to treat critical heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, maintaining electrolyte balance, preventing and treating secondary infections and septic shocks, as well as protecting vital organ functions are also essential for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
Excessive immune system reaction has been shown to cause cytokinic shock in patients with SARS and SRM.
Cytokinic shock is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a whole series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release a large number of free radicals, which are the main cause of ARDS and multi-visceral failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokinic shocks, especially in severe cases.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, a monoclonal anti-IL6 antibody, were used to treat cytokinic shocks.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokinic shocks include T-cell immune response modulation, cytokine blocking IFN-γ, IL-1 and TNF, Jak inhibition, blinatumomab, cytokine 4 reporting suppressor, and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, as immunosuppressive agents, have been widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory lesions.
However, the use of high-dose steroids did not have any beneficial effects on severe lung lesions in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
Instead, they would cause serious side effects, including avascular osteonecrosis, which significantly affects the prognosis.
However, caution in the use of short-term low-to-moderate corticosteroid cycles has been recommended for patients with a severe form of COVID-19.
At the time of writing, no effective antiviral therapy has yet been confirmed.
However, intravenous administration of remdesivir, a nucleoside analogue, was effective in an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral medicine originally developed by Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Subsequently, remdesivir also demonstrated possible inhibition of other single-strand RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS.
In the light of these findings, Gilead transmitted the compound to China to allow for a number of trials on SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals, and the results are highly anticipated.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir combination and ribavirin have been advanced as potential treatments for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other side effects may occur as a result of combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other medicinal products used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma of recovered patients and production of antibodies
Collecting blood from patients who have cured a contagious disease to treat other patients with the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from it is an ancestral practice.
Restored patients often have relatively high levels of antibodies to the pathogen.
Antibodies are immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign bodies; they recognize unique molecules in pathogens and neutralize them directly.
As a result, plasma was extracted from the blood of a group of patients who had cured COVID-19 and injected 10 severely affected patients.
Their symptoms improved in 24 hours, in combination with decreased inflammation, reduced viral load and increased oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification are necessary in order to be able to propose this method for large-scale use until specific treatment has been developed.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some drawbacks associated with plasma should be carefully examined.
For example, antibodies can cause excessive stimulation of the immune response and cause a potentially fatal cytokine release syndrome.
The level of antibodies in the blood is generally low, and the demand for plasma to treat severely ill patients is significant.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to fight a global epidemic.
Therefore, it is more essential and effective to isolate B cells from recovered patients and to identify genetic codes encoding relevant antibodies or to search for effective antibodies against the main proteins of the virus.
This would quickly increase antibody production.
MTC has been used for millennia in China to treat a wide variety of diseases.
However, its effects are largely based on the combination of multiple components in a formula that varies according to diagnosis, based on MTC theories.
Most of the effective components remain little or no known insofar as it is difficult to extract and verify them, or to know their optimal associations.
Currently, due to the absence of a specific effective treatment for COVID-19, TCM is one of the major alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or in remission of a severe form of the disease.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules have been shown to be effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
The best rates of CIDOC-19 healing were observed in provinces in China that used CCT for 87% of their patients, including Gansu province (63.7%), Ningxia region (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei province, which used only 30% of patients with CIDOC-19, has the lowest rate of cure (13%).
However, this is a rather approximate comparison since many other impact factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of the disease, must be taken into account in the assessment.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and his collaborators published a study comparing a treatment using Western medicine (MO) only and a combination treatment combining MO and MTC.
It appeared that the time to return to normal body temperature, the time to disappear symptoms and the length of hospitalization were significantly shorter for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group alone.
Even more impressive, the rate of worsening of symptoms (from mild to severe) was significantly lower for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group only (7.4% versus 46.2%); similarly, mortality was lower for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group only (8.8% versus 39%).
Nevertheless, the effectiveness and safety of TCM remains to be clarified through more scaled-up controlled trials and in more centres.
It would also be interesting to characterize the mechanism of action and clarify the effective components of TCM treatments or their associations, if possible.
Individuals identified as probable or confirmed cases of COVID-19 are generally deeply concerned about this highly contagious and deadly disease, and those quarantined also experience a sense of boredom, loneliness and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection, such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as adverse treatment effects, such as corticosteroid-induced insomnia, may lead to increased anxiety and psychological distress.
In the early stages of the SARS epidemic, multiple psychiatric illnesses have been reported, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitement, psychotic symptoms, acute confusional state and even suicidal tendencies.
Mandatory contact research and quarantine, as part of the response of public health services to the COVID-19 epidemic, can increase anxiety and lead to some guilt for the effects of contagion, quarantine, and stigmatization of their families and friends.
For example, mental health care should be provided to patients with COVID-19, to individuals identified as probable cases, to persons in contact with these populations, and to any other individuals in distress.
This psychological support should include the formation of multidisciplinary teams, clear communication with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans, as well as the use of professional electronic applications and equipment to avoid close contact.
Effective vaccines are essential to disrupt the chain of transmission of infected animal reservoirs and humans to vulnerable hosts, and are often complementary to antiviral treatment in the control of epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S-protein vaccines to produce potent long-term neutralizing antibodies and/or to induce protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Live attenuated vaccines were evaluated on animal models for SARS.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these potential vaccines in the elderly and on models subject to lethal provocation and their protection from zoonotic virus infection remains to be determined, as no clinical studies have yet been initiated.
This is probably due to the fact that SARS died 17 years ago and that no new cases have been reported since.
On the other hand, sporadic cases and outbreaks of MERS continue to occur in the Middle East and other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Various vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS using inactivated virus, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-related particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for non-immunized individuals is an urgent and essential objective for controlling the ongoing epidemic.
However, this is a real challenge because of the significant delay (18 months on average) required to develop a vaccine and the dynamic variations of coronaviruses.
To the extent that it is an emerging disease, COVID-19 is just beginning its clinical evolution through thousands of patients.
In most cases, the patients gradually recover without sequelae.
However, similar to SARS and SRM, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in the most severe cases.
Therefore, establishing a forecast model is essential for health agencies to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on clinical studies conducted to date, the factors that may affect or be associated with the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 are as follows (Table 33):
Age: Age was the main factor for SARS prognosis, and this also appears to be the case for COVID-19.
VOCID-19 mainly affects individuals between the ages of 30 and 65, with 47.7% over 50 years of age, according to a study of 8,866 cases, as described above.
Patients requiring intensive care were more likely to have underlying comorbidities and complications, and were significantly older (median age 66 years versus 51 years), suggesting age as a predictor for patients with COVID-19.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Comorbidities and Complications: Patients with VOCID-19 requiring intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute heart damage and arrhythmia.
Heart events were also the leading cause of death in patients with SARS.
It has been established that SARS-CoV-2 may also bind to positive cholangiocytes of ACE2, which may lead to hepatic dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.
It should be noted that the age and presence of underlying health problems are strongly correlated and may interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: the C-reactive protein (CRP) level in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue damage; it has been advanced as a potential predictor of disease, response to treatment, and healing.
The correlation between CRP and severity and the prognosis of COVID-19 was also proposed.
In addition, a high rate of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) may also contribute to the prognosis.
These enzymes are widely expressed in several organs, including the heart and liver, and are released in case of tissue damage.
They are therefore traditionally markers of cardiac or hepatic dysfunction.
Major clinical symptoms: thoracic X-ray results and temporal progression of clinical symptoms should be examined in combination with other elements for the determination of the prognosis and complications of VOCID-19.
Steroid use: as described above, steroids are immunosuppressants commonly used as supplemental therapy for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory lesions.
Because high dose corticosteroids were widely used in severe SARS cases, many survivors experienced avascular osteonecrosis resulting in permanent disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, the administration of steroids to patients with COVID-19 should be limited to a low dose and a short duration.
Mental stress: As described above, the outbreak of COVID-19 has resulted in a large number of cases of exceptional stress, with patients often experiencing long periods of quarantine, extreme uncertainty, and the death of relatives or other patients.
It is imperative to offer long-term psychological support and support to help these individuals overcome this stress and return to normal life.
Based on demographic studies conducted so far, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological characteristics from SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 also replicates effectively in the upper respiratory tract and does not cause or few symptoms in the first phase of infection, as do coronaviruses that cause common colds.
As a result, newly infected or incubated individuals can produce a large amount of viruses during their daily activities, which significantly impedes the control of the epidemic.
However, SARS-CoV was considered to be transmitted by severely ill patients, with a very low probability of transmission in the first phase.
The current outbreak of COVID-19 is therefore far more serious and difficult to control than that of SARS.
Considerable efforts are currently being made in China, including the confinement of Wuhan and neighbouring cities, as well as the continued quarantine of almost all the population with a view to halting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures have had a dramatic impact on the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new cases is declining, indicating a slowdown in the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimates suggest that the epidemic will end in March and that the phase of decline will last from 3 to 4 months.
However, not all experts share this optimism.
Paul Hunter, et al., believe that COVID-19, which appears to be significantly more infectious than SARS, will not go out in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., developed a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and concluded that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two thirds of the world's population.
One Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 had been detected in samples from the middle nasal cornet and throat of recovered patients 2 weeks after they left the hospital, indicating that the newly identified virus could become a cyclical episode like influenza.
However, encouraging signs were observed in China with the gradual decline of new cases, suggesting that the strategies implemented would have worked.
According to the initial estimates, the Ebola virus was expected to result in up to one million cases and half a million deaths.
However, through strict quarantine and isolation, the disease was eventually put under control.
It is possible, as for SARS-CoV, that SARS-CoV-2 weakens in terms of infectivity and eventually becomes extinct or evolves into a less pathogenic virus coexisting with Man.
A comparison of the COPID-19 epidemic with that of SARS and SRM is provided below (Fig. (Fig.55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible by coughing or sneezing, and also possibly by direct contact with contaminated materials.
The virus has also been identified in stools, thus revealing a new possibility of feco-oral transmission.
A recent study of 138 patients found that 41% of cases were possibly due to nosocomial infections, with 17 patients with previous diseases and 40 health professionals.
Precautionary measures should therefore be taken to protect individuals, including health professionals, social workers, relatives and colleagues of the sick, and even anyone who may be in contact with patients or infected persons.
The first possible line of defence to reduce the risk of infection is the wearing of facial masks; the use of surgical masks and N95 breathing masks (1860) helps control the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks prevent the projection of potentially infected droplets or their deposition on surfaces, where they could be passed on to other people.
However, only the N95 (1860) masks provide protection against the inhalation of virions from 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of the virions capable of penetrating fully; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size, since both measure about 85 nm.
Since the particles manage to cross five surgical masks stacked together, it is imperative that health professionals in direct contact with patients wear N95 (1860s) masks and not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health professionals must wear adjusted insulation blouses in order to further reduce contact with viruses.
Viruses can also infect an individual by the eye.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor turned out to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 while wearing a N95 mask; the virus may have penetrated his body by the eye due to inflammation.
Therefore, health care professionals should also wear transparent visors or protective glasses in contact with patients.
For populations in affected or potentially affected areas, it is strongly recommended to wash your hands with disinfectant soap more often than usual, to remain confined to the maximum extent possible and to limit contact with potentially infected people.
It is advisable to maintain a distance of one metre with the patients.
These measures are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus for humans, its high degree of homology with SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, must have put China on high alert after the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, on 19 January 2020, the director of the Wuhan Centre for Disease Control and Prevention reassured the population by stating that the new virus was not contagious, that it had limited inter-human transmissibility and that it would not be difficult to prevent and contain the disease.
This message led to a remarkable relaxation, particularly at a time when the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical opportunity to contain the disease in Wuhan was missed.
Chinese disease control agencies need to learn from this and take appropriate action.
For example, these agencies must (1) be more cautious in their public announcements, as each word counts and can affect the behaviour and decisions of the population; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to unusual data from clinics rather than waiting for formal reports from doctors or official agencies; (3) be more restrictive in order to contain a potential epidemic at an early stage rather than trying to reassure the population; and (4) perform more targeted and relevant exercises to raise public awareness of epidemic diseases, but also to test and regularly improve the society's response system.
The COVID-19 epidemic caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, at the time of writing this report, it has spread to all of China as well as to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
Since this virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms of COVID-19 are also close to those of SARS, the outbreak of COVID-19 gives rise to an impression of deja-vu.
However, there are significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which need to be taken into account in order to contain the epidemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people and more men than women; severity and mortality rates are also higher among older people.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91% compared to 1.44%).
The transmission of the VOCID-19 virus is possible even in the absence of symptoms, while SARS was mostly transmitted by severely ill patients; it is therefore much more difficult to contain the spread of the VOCID-19.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 has spread much faster and much wider than SARS-CoV.
Regular SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing may be negative for some patients with COVID-19.
On the other hand, patients who have recovered may again be positive for the virus.
This significantly increases the risk of spread.
Despite the rapid progress of research on COVID-19, a number of critical issues remain outstanding, including:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although a 96% genetic homology has been established between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-type coronaviruses from bats, this is not sufficient to conclude with certainty that SARS-CoV-2 originates from bats.
What is the intermediate species that allowed transmission of the virus from the original host, e.g. bats, to humans?
Without answers to questions 1 and 2, it is impossible to effectively stop transmission, and the epidemic can resume at any time.
Molecular modelling and biochemical analyses have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, but how exactly does the virus enter respiratory tract cells and how does it cause pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to cells expressing ACE2 from other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, it is impossible to define a rapid and accurate diagnosis or effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve genetically during interhuman transmission?
Will it evolve into a global pandemic, disappear like SARS, or resurface regularly like flu?
It is essential, even if it may take time, to get answers to all these and many other questions.
However, no matter what expenses this entails, we have no choice but to put an end to this epidemic as quickly as possible in order to resume the normal course of our lives.
Generally, the incubation period of these two viruses is less than one week, followed by about 2 weeks of disease.
Only a few immunocompromised patients experienced severe lower respiratory tract infection.
The first SARS case dates back to the end of 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
In addition to supertransmitters, it was estimated that each case could cause approximately two secondary cases with an incubation period of between 4 and 7 days, with the peak viral load appearing on the 10th day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially have myalgia, headaches, fever, malaise and chills, followed by dyspnoea, cough and respiratory distress as late symptoms.
Lymphopenia, impaired liver function tests, and elevated creatine kinase are common abnormalities observed in laboratory analyses in the event of suspected SARS.
Common alveolar lesions, proliferation of epithelial cells and increased macrophages are also observed in patients with SARS.
Approximately 20 to 30% of patients then require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, several organs including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidney may also be infected in these severe cases, often accompanied by a cytokinic shock, which can be fatal in particular in immunocompromised patients.
Since then, enormous efforts have been devoted to research on HCoV.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated in a 7-month-old child in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
Initially, it was prevalent in young children, the elderly and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
The presence of coryza, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis is common in the disease caused by HCV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from the nasal sampling of an 8-month-old boy suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it has been identified in the Netherlands, it is actually present throughout the world.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also called croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man hospitalized for pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
Like HCV-NL63, HCV-229E and HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1 is present globally, causing moderate respiratory diseases.
Generally, when these HCoVs acquire the ability to transmit effectively and maintain continuously in humans, they also become less virulent or pathogenic.
Another secondary epidemic occurred in South Korea in 2015, with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of SRM are similar to those of SARS and are characterized by evolving acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with ERM also developed acute renal failure, which is characteristic of ERM compared to HCV pathologies.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory confirmed cases were reported with a high death rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most deadly viruses known in humans.
Diarrhoea is also observed in some patients.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogenic but more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and could contribute to its rapid spread worldwide.
Comparison and contrast of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCVs revealed very interesting similarities and differences.
First, the incubation period and duration of HCoV disease are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the overall trend of the remaining six HCVs.
Second, the severity of symptoms of COVID-19 lies between SARS-CoV and the four Community HCVs (HCV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1 and HCV-NL63).
On the other hand, a small subgroup of severe cases of VOCID-19 is also observed as in SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Finally, like other HCVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in stool samples.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and its sustainable diffusion after transmission to humans, will have an influence on the ultimate fate of the current outbreak of COVID-19.
The four community HCoVs causing moderate symptoms have adapted well to humans.
In other words, both could be survivors of previous HCoV pandemics.
In order for this to happen, HCoVs must replicate in humans in a sufficient proportion to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that compensate for host restriction factors.
With this in mind, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic persists and the greater the number of people infected, the more likely it is that the virus will fully adapt to humans.
If it adapts well, its transmission between men will be difficult to stop by about 40 or other measures of infection control.
For many years, the four community-acquired CoVs have been circulating within the population, triggering a simple cold in immunocompetent subjects.
These viruses do not require an animal reservoir.
On the other hand, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted well to humans and their transmission between men is not sustainable.
They must maintain and spread in their zoonotic reservoirs and seek an opportunity to reach potential human targets, probably via one or more intermediate hosts and amplifiers.
SARS-CoV-2 has characteristics similar to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four community-acquired HCVs.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired HCVs and less pathogenic than SARS-Cov or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it will fully adapt to human beings and will circulate among them without a reservoir or intermediate animal host.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCoV, it will be useful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary hosts, natural, reservoirs, intermediates and amplifiers of HCoV.
An animal serves as an evolutionary host of an HCoV if it houses a nearby ascendant sharing a high homology at the nucleotide sequence level.
The original virus has often adapted well and is not pathogenic to its host.
In the same way, a tank host houses the HCoV continuously and in the long term.
On the other hand, HCVs can also adapt to the intermediate host and even establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes a natural reservoir host.
In particular, since 80% of the animals in the Guangzhou market have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibilities that several species of small mammals can also serve as intermediate host amplifiers cannot be excluded.
These bats are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and the genomic sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These studies laid the foundation for a new concept that bats are the hosts of emerging human pathogens.
The human angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme (ACE2) is known as the SARS-CoV receptor.
Despite high homology between these two viruses, it is generally estimated that WIV1 is not the immediate parent of SARS-CoV and bats are not the immediate reservoir host of SARS-CoV.
This is why bats cannot be the intermediate tank host of the MERS-CoV.
In addition, studies in the Middle East have shown that dromedaries are seropositive to specific antibodies neutralizing MERS-CoV, as are camels from the Middle East present in several African countries.
In addition, infected camels excrete the virus not only through the respiratory tract but also via faeces, which is also the main route of excretion of bats.
We cannot rule out the possibility of the pangolin being one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even smaller than the distance between beta-CoV associated with SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 from the pangolin.
Recombination is a common factor in the evolution of beta-CoV.
Scientists remain divided on the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, the zoonotic origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Phylogenetic evidence indicates that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E could be derived from bat CoV, whereas the parent viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 were found in rodents.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically associated with another bat CoV, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, detected in Ghana, while camelids were also suspected to be intermediate hosts.
When the HCoV-OC43 crossed the species barrier to infect humans from domestic cattle around 1890, a respiratory infection pandemic was reported.
The history of interspecies transmission of HCV-229E is less clear.
Alpha-CoV bats close to the HCV-229E were found.
First, unlike alpaca, men can have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
On the other hand, humans have close contact with alpaca.
Second, alpha-CoV of bats related to HCV-229E are numerous and non-pathogenic in bats, while alpha-CoV of alpaca caused an outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, the alpha-CoV of alpaca was not found in wild animals.
In fact, bats are the direct source of human pathogens, including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
It is therefore not surprising that bats can transmit the HCV-229E directly to humans.
Another possibility, while bat alpha-CoVs serve as a genetic reservoir for HCV-229E, alpacas and dromedaries could serve as intermediate hosts transmitting viruses to humans, just as in the case of MERS-CoV.
The MERS-CoV is an excellent example of interspecies transmission from bats to dromadaries and dromadaries to humans.
The evolutionary origin of the MERS-CoV found in bats is known due to its initial identification and has also been reinforced by subsequent discoveries.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been present in dromedaries for decades.
It has adapted well in these camels that have passed from intermediate host to stable natural reservoir hosts.
Contrary to the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, if they have one, is different.
In particular, pangolin beta-CoV is highly pathogenic in pangolins.
Several possibilities for interspecies transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans have been included or excluded from future studies.
First, bats could be the reservoir host of a SARS-CoV-2-related virus almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans could share an ecological niche with bats through scrapping or coal mines.
Second, pangolins could be one of the intermediate amplifier hosts to which a SARS-CoV-2-related virus has recently been introduced.
Humans contract the virus by cutting and consuming game meat.
Many mammals, including domestic animals, may be sensitive to SARS-CoV-2.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have taken place in a third species that has been in contact with bats and pangolins at the same time.
Research on the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 is ongoing.
Compared to other single-strand RNA viruses, estimated CoV mutation rates could be considered "moderate" to "high" with an average substitution rate of ~10-4 substitutions per site per year, depending on the phase of adaptation of CoV to new hosts.
Nevertheless, the rates of coV mutation are about a million times higher than those of their hosts.
In addition, the rate of mutation is often high when the CoVs have not adapted well to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV, with a high rate of mutation, the rate of mutation of SARS-CoV-2 is apparently lower, suggesting a higher rate of adaptation to humans.
It can be assumed that he has already adapted to another host close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which has been well adapted to dromedaries.
In theory, genetic drift is unlikely to render vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective in the short term.
Third, CoVs randomly and frequently change models when RNA is replicated through a unique "choose-copy" mechanism.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination was found for both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as for coV observed in animals such as SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9.
Virus-host interaction in connection with transmission
Beyond these three viral factors listed above, viral interaction with a host receptor is another key factor influencing interspecies transmission.
The recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example here; it also shows evidence of positive selection during interspecies transmission episodes.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions can be key factors in adapting the virus to humans.
It is interesting to note that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cell receptor as SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 protein unit means that the affinity of this S protein with human ACE2 may have been altered.
Indeed, an electronic cryomicroscopic study indicates a 10 to 20-fold greater affinity of this binding than that observed between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S protein.
It will also be interesting to determine whether another co-receptor may be required for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Strangely, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2 but with a different part of the S protein.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E, and sialic acid 9-O-acetylated for HCoV-OC43.
The divergence of host proteins between humans and HCoV natural reservoir hosts, such as bats, dromadaries and rodents, could constitute a barrier to interspecies transmission.
Emerging new HCoV: back to square one
The diversity of bat CoVs offers many opportunities for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this sense, bat CoVs are genetic reserves of HCVs.
Among the accessory proteins of SARS-CoV, ORF8 was considered important in human adaptation, as SARS-CoV-related bat viruses were isolated, but coded divergent ORF8 proteins.
This deletion divides the ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is perceived as an adaptive mutation that promotes host change.
Recombination sites have also been identified in nsp9, in most nsp10 and in some nsp14.
Similarly, it has been shown that the MERS-CoV epidemic has experienced episodes of recombination between different lines, which occurred in dromedaries in Saudi Arabia.
While an ORF4 could be observed in bat and camel viruses associated with HCV-229E, alpha-CoV of alpaca has a simple nucleotide insertion, generating a shift in the reading frame.
Finally, the evolution of the new HCoV is also stimulated by the selective pressure exerted in their reservoir hosts.
Asymptomatic cases or moderate symptoms were detected when bats were infected with CoVs, indicating mutual adaptation between CoVs and bats.
It seemed that bats had adapted well to the CoV from an anatomical and physiological point of view.
For example, abnormalities in the activation of pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the disease triggered by CoVs.
In addition, the high level of oxygen reactive derivatives (RODs) generated by the high metabolic activity of bats could both suppress CoV replication and affect "rereading" by exoribonuclease, which would create selective pressure and result in highly pathogenic viral strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic CoV strains could also evolve by recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for host adaptation.
Thus, it is no coincidence that three new HCoVs have appeared in the last two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic or cause moderate symptoms in reservoir hosts such as bats and camels.
They replicate solidly without causing a strong immune response from the host.
This is where the secrets of observation of asymptomatic carriers reside and what causes cases of severe infection in humans.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to hyperactivation of the immune response and cytokinic shock; the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung lesions.
On the other hand, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was decoupled from CoV replication.
The same strategy for dissociating the immune response could have beneficial effects in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, the administration of type I interferon at least in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection should be beneficial.
In addition, activation of the NLRP3 inflammasoma is poor in bats.
Following this reasoning, inhibition of NLRP3 with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
While a beta-CoV of bats sharing 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV has been discovered, there is also a coV of bats sharing 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Pangolin beta-CoV remarkably similar to SARS-CoV-2 has been discovered, indicating that pangolin may be one of the intermediate hosts or that pangolin beta-CoV may contribute to the genetic fragments of the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
CoVs have returned to the ramp fire because of the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV has been in existence for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transport and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the premises.
They are very present in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control the MERS, as was done in the wild animal markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop recurrent outbreaks of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV in camels, combined with other infection control measures.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could emerge and cause epidemics.
Several zoonotic coVs circulate in nature.
In particular, bat CoVs, whose zoonotic potential is very high.
The cultivation of wild animal consumption in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary human-animal contact.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a long time.
They remain in their own natural reservoirs until there is an opportunity for contagion.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is needed to better understand the ecology of the CoVs and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of animals to humans and future epidemics.
In conclusion, the most effective way for humans to prevent viral zoonoses is to keep away from the ecological niches of the natural zoonoses reservoirs.
First, if bats transmit a parental SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it would be interesting to observe under which circumstances bats and pangolins could share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, how humans come into contact with bats should be determined.
Thirdly, if a third mammal plays the role of a true intermediate host, it remains to be clarified how it interacts with the different species, including men, bats and pangolins.
Whether it is bat, pangolin or other mammal, SARS-CoV-2 or quasi-identified parent viruses observed in their natural hosts should be identified.
Respiratory diseases such as flu or cold can be contracted, for example, by omitting to wash your hands before touching your eyes, nose or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes).
The primary medical goal of hand washing is to eliminate pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that may cause disease) and chemicals that may be harmful or cause disease.
Handwashing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhoea; reducing respiratory infections;
as well as the reduction of the infant mortality rate during home deliveries.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates associated with respiratory diseases and diarrhoea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioural changes, such as soap washing.
Pneumonia, one of the leading ARIs, is the leading cause of mortality among children under five years of age, accounting for nearly 1.8 million victims per year.
Together, diarrhea and pneumonia cause the deaths of nearly 3.5 million children each year.
Hand washing also protects against impetigo, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
Minor deleterious effect, frequent washing of the hands can damage the skin by causing skin dryness.
A Danish study in 2012 found that excessive hand washing could lead to eczema or dermatitis in the hands, characterized by scaly skin and itching, and especially frequent in health workers.
Too frequent hand washing is also considered to be one of the symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).
Deparasitating twice a year, combined with daily washing of the hands with soap and daily brushing of the teeth with a fluorinated toothpaste, is at the heart of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce barriers to solution and increase solubility.
Water alone is not an effective cleanser for the skin as lipids and proteins, which are soil organic substances, are difficult to soluble in water.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, may contain bacteria from previous uses.
To date, there is no evidence to suggest that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants makes it possible to target antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
Therefore, even if antibiotic resistant strains are not the result of antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as announced.
In addition to the surfactant and skin protector, the most complex formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) used to regulate pH, benzoic acid, having an antimicrobial function, and other protective agents (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).A rigorous analysis by the University of Oregon School of Public Health indicated that ordinary soaps were as effective as antibacterial soaps for individuals and containing triclosan, to prevent disease and eliminate bacteria from the hands.
Hot water used to wash your hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria multiply much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, lukewarm and soapy water is more effective than cold and soapy water to eliminate natural oils that carry dirt and bacteria.
But contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have revealed that the use of lukewarm water does not help to reduce microbial load on the hands.
A disinfectant or hand antiseptic is a non-aqueous hand hygiene product.
Most are formulated with isopropyl alcohol or ethanol in combination with a thickening agent such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) to obtain a gel, or a moisturizer such as glycerin to obtain a liquid or foam for greater ease of use and reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
Adding diluted hydrogen peroxide strengthens antimicrobial activity. Hand disinfectants containing at least 60-95% alcohol effectively eliminate germs.
Hydroalcoholic solutions kill bacteria, multi-resistant bacteria (SARM and ERV), tuberculosis and certain viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis), as well as fungi.
Hydroalcoholic solutions are almost entirely ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) viruses, the main cause of contagious gastroenteritis.A sufficient amount of disinfectant for the hands or hydroalcoholic solution must be used to properly wet or cover both hands.
The increased use of these products is due to their ease of use and their rapid elimination activity of microorganisms; however, they should not replace adequate hand washing unless you have water and soap at hand.
Frequent use of hydroalcoholic solutions may result in skin drying if the formula is not reinforced by emollients and/or moisturizing agents of the skin.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, hydroalcoholic solutions containing emollients caused significantly less irritation and dry skin than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact hives or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives in hydro-alcoholic solutions are rare.
Despite their effectiveness, non-aqueous products do not remove organic matter from the hands, but only disinfect them.
It is for this reason that hand disinfectants are not as effective as soap and water to prevent the spread of many pathogens, as they remain on the hands.
The efficacy of non-alcoholic hand disinfectants is highly dependent on the ingredients and formula, and has always been significantly lower than that of alcohol and alcohol-based disinfectants.
More recently, formulae that use benzalkonium chloride exhibited a sustained and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, whose efficacy is diminished after repeated use, probably due to progressive cutaneous adverse reactions.
Ash or earth can be more effective than water alone, but less effective than soap.
Moreover, if soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, it may increase the spread of disease rather than curb it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant because, in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends ash or sand as an alternative to soap when soap is not available.
Wet your hands with warm or cold running water.
Current water is recommended due to the risk of contamination of stagnant water points, while water temperature does not appear to make any difference).
Moisten a generous amount of soap on the hands by rubbing them against each other, not forgetting the back of the hands, between the fingers and under the nails.
Soap removes the germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap than with water alone.
Rub for at least 20 seconds.
The action of rubbing creates friction, which helps to remove the germs from the skin, and rub longer removes more germs.
Rinse thoroughly with running water.
Rinsing in a stagnant pool of water can result in hand recontamination.
Dry with a clean towel or in the open air.
Wet and wet hands re-emerge more easily.The most often forgotten areas are the thumb, wrist, spaces between the fingers and the bottom of the nails.
Artificial nails and flaky nail polish can host microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotion is often recommended to avoid dry hands; skin dryness promotes skin lesions that may increase the risk of infection transmission.
There are many economic alternatives to wash your hands when tap water and/or soap are not available.For example, water from a suspended and drilled can or gourd and/or use ash if needed in developing countries.In situations where water supply is limited (as in schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to save water, such as "tippy-taps" and other economic options.
A tippy-tap is a simple technology that uses a hanging pitcher with a rope, and a pedal to pour a small amount of water on the hands and a soap loaf.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but the best way to dry your hands in public toilets is to debate.
More and more research suggests that paper towels are much more hygienic than electric hand dryers that are often found in toilets.
After washing and drying hot-air hand dryers, it was found that the total number of bacteria increased by an average of 194 per cent on the pulp of the fingers and 254 per cent on the palms.
Drying with air-jet hand dryers resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria on the finger pulp by 42% and on the palms by 15%.
After drying the hands, the following variations in bacterial counts were observed:
There are many manufacturers of different hand dryers, and hand dryers have been compared to drying using paper towels.
Handwashing with disinfectant wipes is an alternative solution during movement, in the absence of soap and water.
Hydroalcohol solutions must contain at least 60% alcohol.
There are electronic devices that emit reminders when hospital staff forget to wash their hands.
Medical hand washing should last at least 15 seconds, using a generous amount of soap and water or gel to foam and rub each part of the hands.
The hands must be rubbed against each other by passing between the fingers.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to close the faucet (and open the exit door if necessary).
The goal of hand washing in health structures is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("germs") and prevent their transmission.
A relevant analysis was conducted by Whitby et al.
after exposure to blood/organic fluid;
before an aseptic gesture; and
All jewellery must be removed.
As part of this procedure, it is necessary to wash your hands and forearms to the elbow, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
When rinsing, water on the forearms should not flow to the hands.
In order to reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for your hands before and after caring for a sick person.
Regarding the control of Staphylococci infections in hospitals, it was found that the main benefits of hand washing were obtained during the first 20% of the washing, and that there were very few additional benefits to increasing the frequency of hand washing beyond 35%.
Further research is needed to find out which interventions are most effective in different health structures.
For example, in most rural Africa, it is rare to find taps to wash your hands near private or public toilets, despite the existence of economic options to build hand washing stations.
However, low hand washing rates may also be due to stubborn habits, rather than a lack of soap or water.
Once the minimum standards are reached, schools can move from one to the final three stars.
The construction of hand washing stations can be part of the hand hygiene promotion campaigns that are carried out to reduce illness and infant mortality.
The World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness campaign that aims to encourage behavioural change.Following the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF encouraged the adoption of an emoji illustrating handwashing.
However, one review suggests that the promotion of soap hand washing is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
At that time, most people still believed that infections were due to the fetid odors called miasms.
For example, in Germany, posters illustrating "good hand washing techniques" were placed next to sinks in public toilets and in the toilets of office buildings and airports.
The term "washing your hands" refers to a person's refusal to assume responsibility or to be an accomplice to something.
In addition, those who are allowed to wash their hands after having such thoughts are less inclined to engage in other compensatory "purification" measures, such as volunteerism.
Similarly, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam require that their hands be washed before and after each meal.

It should also be noted that artificial selection can contribute to involuntary changes in the genomes of viruses, which most likely follow the pressures exerted during selection, in particular by the host's immune system.
Examples include the loss of complete ORF4 in the prototype strain HCV-229E due to the deletion of two nucleotides.
While an ORF4 could be observed in bat and camel viruses associated with HCV-229E, alpha-CoV of alpaca has a simple nucleotide insertion, generating a shift in the reading frame.
Finally, the evolution of the new HCoV is also stimulated by the selective pressure exerted in their reservoir hosts.
Asymptomatic cases or moderate symptoms were detected when bats were infected with CoVs, indicating mutual adaptation between CoVs and bats.
It seemed that bats had adapted well to the CoV from an anatomical and physiological point of view.
For example, abnormalities in the activation of pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the disease triggered by CoVs.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in bats is suppressed by the positive regulation of the receptor inhibiting natural killer cells NKG2/CD94 and by the low rate of expression of the molecules of the major Class I histocompatibility complex.
In addition, the high level of oxygen reactive derivatives (RODs) generated by the high metabolic activity of bats could both suppress CoV replication and affect "rereading" by exoribonuclease, which would create selective pressure and result in highly pathogenic viral strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic CoV strains could also evolve by recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for host adaptation.
Thus, it is no coincidence that three new HCoVs have appeared in the last two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic or cause moderate symptoms in reservoir hosts such as bats and camels.
They replicate solidly without causing a strong immune response from the host.
This is where the secrets of observation of asymptomatic carriers reside and what causes cases of severe infection in humans.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to hyperactivation of the immune response and cytokinic shock; the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung lesions.
On the other hand, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was decoupled from CoV replication.
The same strategy for dissociating the immune response could have beneficial effects in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
The response to interferon is particularly strong in bats.
Thus, the administration of type I interferon at least in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection should be beneficial.
In addition, activation of the NLRP3 inflammasoma is poor in bats.
Following this reasoning, inhibition of NLRP3 with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
SARS-CoV-2 emerged following the general pattern by which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV emerged.
While a beta-CoV of bats sharing 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV has been discovered, there is also a coV of bats sharing 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
While civettes and other animals on the market have been found to carry viruses identical to SARS-CoV, no immediate intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 has been identified.
Pangolin beta-CoV remarkably similar to SARS-CoV-2 has been discovered, indicating that pangolin may be one of the intermediate hosts or that pangolin beta-CoV may contribute to the genetic fragments of the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was designed by man, either voluntarily or accidentally.
CoVs have returned to the ramp fire because of the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
The study of CoV in bats and other animals significantly altered our perception of the role of zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs in the transmission of HCV to humans.
Numerous evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 come from bats and are transmitted to humans by intermediate hosts.
Since SARS-CoV infection is caused by contact between humans and cevettes in the marketplace, the closure of the fresh product markets and the slaughter of cevettes in the market could have effectively ended the SARS epidemic.
According to the same reasoning, pangolins should be removed from the fresh product markets to avoid the transmission of zoonoses, given the discovery of numerous beta-CoV lines of pangolins closely related to SARS-CoV-2
However, the question of whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans by pangolins and other mammals and, if so, how this transmission occurs will remain to be determined in the studies to follow.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV has been in existence for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transport and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the premises.
They are very present in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control the MERS, as was done in the wild animal markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop recurrent outbreaks of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV in camels, combined with other infection control measures.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could emerge and cause epidemics.
Several zoonotic coVs circulate in nature.
In particular, bat CoVs, whose zoonotic potential is very high.
Opportunities for these zoonotic CoVs to evolve and recombine, leading to the emergence of new more transmissible and/or deadly CoVs in humans in the future.
The cultivation of wild animal consumption in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary human-animal contact.
In the face of the devastation caused by SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better preparedness and response plan should be put in place.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a long time.
They remain in their own natural reservoirs until there is an opportunity for contagion.
Although bats have many positive characteristics for the spread of viruses, the likelihood of humans being in contact with bats and other wildlife can be minimized if people are sensitized to the need to stay away.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is needed to better understand the ecology of the CoVs and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of animals to humans and future epidemics.
In conclusion, the most effective way for humans to prevent viral zoonoses is to keep away from the ecological niches of the natural zoonoses reservoirs.
Not all secrets of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 are yet known.
First, if bats transmit a parental SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it would be interesting to observe under which circumstances bats and pangolins could share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, how humans come into contact with bats should be determined.
Thirdly, if a third mammal plays the role of a true intermediate host, it remains to be clarified how it interacts with the different species, including men, bats and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammals, especially domestic animals, are likely to contract SARS-CoV-2, both experimental monitoring and contamination should be performed.
Whether it is bat, pangolin or other mammal, SARS-CoV-2 or quasi-identified parent viruses observed in their natural hosts should be identified.
Future research in this area will shed light on the evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 in animals and will have a significant impact on the prevention and control of VOCID-19 in humans.
An update of the diagnostic criteria for "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases" of COVID-19 is required
On February 6, 2020, our team released a Quick Recommendation Directive for the diagnosis and treatment of the new 2019 Coronavirus infection (2019-nCoV) and this directive described our experience and provided references to fight this pandemic globally.
However, the 2019 Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) is recent, our knowledge and knowledge progress gradually based on the results of ongoing studies and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
In this letter, we responded to a comment regarding our guidelines and provided the most recent diagnostic criteria for a "suspected case" and a "confirmed case" according to the latest diagnostic and treatment guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh version) published by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) caused an epidemic that now officially bears the name of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus was named severe acute coronavirus 2 respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, the WHO described COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick recommendation that was published online on Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
It has attracted much attention since its publication.
However, please note that VOCID-19 is a new disease, our knowledge and knowledge progress slowly based on the results of ongoing studies and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
For example, the diagnostic and treatment guidelines for VOCID-19 issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) were published in a total of seven editions between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, some of which were substantially modified.
As our directive received a comment from Zhou et al., they submitted a simple evaluation proposal based on their clinical experience.
Their work has provided new evidence for our directive and is also a valuable reference for this global pandemic.
We approve of their important work and thank them.
However, their work must also be updated in accordance with the latest guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of VOCID-19 (test seventh version) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), confirmation of a suspected case must associate one of the characteristics elements of the epidemiological history with two elements of clinical manifestations to constitute a complete analysis, or must correspond to three elements of clinical manifestations in the absence of clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) a history of travel or residence in the city of Wuhan and in neighbouring areas or in other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) a history of contact with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with a positive test of nucleic acids); (3) a history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms in the city of Wuhan or nearby areas or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (4) a history of contact with a cluster of confirmed cases (≥ 2 cases with fever and/or respiratory symptoms occurring within 2 weeks in a reduced area such as home, office, school class, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) imaging with the characteristics of a COPID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell count indicating normal, decreased or reduced lymphocyte count from the onset of symptoms.
The diagnosis of the confirmed case should be based on the suspected case with any of the following pathological or serological evidence: (1) positive real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) sequence of the entire viral genome with strong homogeneity with new known coronaviruses; (3) positive serological test for SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibody; or modification of the specific IgG antibody of SARS-CoV-2 passing from negative to positive or titre increase ≥ 4 times in the recovery phase compared to the acute phase.
We can see that the real-time PCR test of nucleic acids in the respiratory tract or in blood samples was added in the second edition (18 January 2020) and in the third edition (22 January 2020).
Pathogenic blood sample screening was added to the fourth edition (27 January 2020) and fifth edition (8 February 2020) and serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These changes are based on the ongoing work of researchers to find an optimal nuclear acid detection kit for rapid diagnosis, as well as respiratory tract samples including blood sampling, with increased availability of different specimens, and contributed to the addition of the positive result of the specific antibody in the confirmed criteria.
In addition, more and more evidence reminds us of caution with regard to atypical symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.
Therefore, the graphic representation of Zhou et al. should be updated as they classify people with no clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The evaluation system should also be checked in clinical practice and in future studies.
In conclusion, we hope for more direct evidence and ask readers to provide their comments.
With regard to the diagnosis of "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases", we suggest that they follow and follow the most recent guidelines in their country.
Our team will also update our directive in due course to offer its help.
Bangladesh Announces Five New Deaths Related to COVID-19, A Daily Record
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new COVID-19-related deaths in a single day.
The country thus records a record of virus mortality in a single day.
Yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Surveillance and Research (IEDCR) reported that the number of registered infected persons included 114 active cases and 33 cured persons, who remained confined at home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
The closure of public transport began on 26 March and was scheduled to end on Saturday, 4 April.
The transport of essential goods (medical supplies, fuel and food) was still permitted.
By March 19, these three people had already recovered.
On Thursday, the total number of cases of infection with SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus exceeded one million worldwide, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
Countries around the world have announced stricter measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, extended the city's confinement until May 1.
The Parliament of Portugal voted to extend the national state of emergency by 15 days; the vote was adopted with 215 votes in favour, ten abstentions and one against.
Zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses
Epidemics of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) reversed the trend to reveal how devastating and potentially life-threatening an infection with HCV could be.
Most HCoVs come from bats where they are not pathogenic.
The intermediate reservoir hosts of some HCoV are also known.
Identification of animal hosts has direct implications for the prevention of human diseases.
The study of CoV-host interactions in animals could also provide a better understanding of CoV in humans.
Depending on protein sequence differences, CoVs are classified into four genera (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV). The Beta-CoV genera contain the majority of HCVs and are divided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents play the role of genetic source for the majority of alpha-CoV and beta-CoV, while birds are the main reservoir of gamma-CoV and delta-CoV.
To date, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) are known.
Among them, the HCoV-229E and the HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoV.
The remaining five beta-CoVs include HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
Tracing the zoonotic origins of HCoV provides a framework for understanding the natural history, driving forces and restrictive factors of crossing the species barrier.
It may also guide or facilitate the search for the host(s) reservoir, intermediate and amplifier of SARS-CoV-2, with important implications for the prevention of future contagions.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
In recent decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
The first strain of HCV-229E was isolated in the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, and then adapted to grow in WI-38 pulmonary cell lines.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E had symptoms of classical cold, including headache, sneezing, malaise and sore throat, with fever and cough observed in 10% to 20% of cases.
Both the HCoV-229E and the HCoV-OC43 are present all over the world and seem to be transmitted mainly in winter, in temperate climate countries.
Stores in Australia reduce limit quantities of toilet paper per purchase
On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australian stores Woolworths and Coles reduced their restrictions on buying toilet paper to two and one package per purchase in all stores nationwide, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also introduced a package limit.
These limits have been displayed in the form of messages to the boxes and on the Facebook pages of the channels.
Buyers apparently collected reserves for fear of COVID-19 and the need to confine themselves.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also restricted purchases of toilet paper for home delivery to one package per order.
These measures followed the previous restriction of four packages per purchase introduced by Woolworths and Coles on 4 and 5 March, respectively.
Coles, in his press release of March 8, said that with the restriction of four packages in force, "many stores are still out of stock within an hour of delivery," and called the request "unprecedented," while ALDI, in a Facebook publication on Tuesday, called it "unexpected."
Sales rose "strongly" last week, according to a Woolworths spokesperson.
Costco store in Canberra also restricted the authorized quantity to two packages last week.
In order to further reduce the shortage, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased the frequency of delivery, Woolworths ordered an additional stock, while ALDI provided earlier stocks for a planned promotion on Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, Executive Director of the Australian Association of Retailers, said that retailers are trying to increase stocks, but that local council restrictions on truck delivery schedules make it difficult.
It anticipates an increase in production costs, while suppliers try to meet demand, and fewer promotions.
Tuesday, ALDI announced that after the early release of stocks, some stores are unable to honor Wednesday's promotion.
In an article published on News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, an expert in the distribution sector at Queensland University of Technology, explained that stores replenish stocks every night.
He pointed out that toilet paper is a bulky item, resulting in small stocks that, once exhausted, leave large spaces empty in rays, reinforcing the impression of a shortage.
"Colles and Woolworths consider [that] if the rays are full, if products such as toilet paper rolls and disinfectants can be [purchased] and are available in large quantities, this will likely reduce panic," Russell Zimmerman told ABC News.
The manufacturer of recycled toilet paper Who Gives a Crap said last Wednesday that they were out of stock.
Kimberly-Clark, who manufactures Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper who manufactures Sorbent paper, pointed out that they work 24/7 to maintain supply, according to News.com.au.
Domain.com, a real estate site, indicated that some real estate sellers offered free toilet paper to the first bidder at an auction in Melbourne, while fewer auction sales were organized because buyers were on leave during the long weekend of the Labour Day.
The Thursday edition of NT News, a newspaper printed in Darwin, included an eight-page insert to be cut and used as toilet paper.
The stores were initially reluctant to impose restrictions, according to a March 3 report by ABC Australia in which they announced that they did not plan to introduce purchasing restrictions.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products were also in high demand, including masks, disinfectants, dry products, hand hygiene products and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, it was observed Sunday night that the British online supermarket Ocado limited the purchases of Andres toilet paper to two packs of 12 rolls.
World Health Organization Qualifies COVID-19 as a Pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) described the current outbreak of COVID-19 (the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2) as a pandemic.
Although the word "pandemic" refers only to the extent of the disease's spread, not to the danger of specific cases, WHO indicated the need to push governments into action:
"All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries detect, test, treat, isolate, locate and mobilize their populations as part of the response," said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO's Director General.
"We are deeply concerned not only about the alarming levels of spread and severity, but also about the alarming levels of inaction."
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States, the pandemic is "unprecedented."
He stated, in CNN's February remarks, that "apart from the flu, no other respiratory viruses have been observed from its onset to its continued worldwide spread."
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view, stating that "we have never witnessed a pandemic caused by a coronavirus."
What he added: "and we have never witnessed a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time."
The new pandemic is a response to the WHO decision in January to declare the epidemic an international public health emergency.
The director of the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases in the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said about the epidemic: "To make things short, the situation will get worse."
On Thursday, Associated Press announced that there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is an epidemic of coronavirus disease in progress since 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome of coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The epidemic was detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared an international public health emergency on January 30, 2020 and recognized as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 were reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
Nearly 364,000 people are cured.
The lethality rate is estimated at 4 per cent in China, while in the rest of the world it varies from 13.04 per cent in Algeria to 0.08 per cent in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time between exposure and onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but may range from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. Recommended preventive measures include washing your hands, covering your mouth to cough, staying away from other people, as well as monitoring and confining people suspected of being infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by introducing restrictions on movement, quarantines, curfews, workplace risk controls and closures.
The pandemic has led to serious global socio-economic disruptions, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, as well as widespread shortages aggravated by panic shopping.
Schools and universities have closed nationally or locally in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4 per cent of the world's student population.
False information on the virus has been circulating on the Internet, and incidents of xenophobia and discrimination have occurred against Chinese, other people of Asian origin and appearance from the East and South-East, as well as against other people from regions with many cases of the virus.
Due to reduced travel and closures in heavy industry, there has been a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei Province) reported an unknown caseload of pneumonia on December 31, 2019, and an investigation was initiated in early January 2020.
Most of the cases were related to the Huanan seafood wholesale market and so it is thought that the virus would be zoonotic in origin.
The virus that caused the epidemic is called SARS-CoV-2, a recently discovered and closely related virus to bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV. Subsequently, it was discovered that the first known person who had had symptoms had become ill on December 1, 2019, and this person had no obvious connection to the subsequent home of the fresh product market.
Of the first outbreak reported in December 2019, two thirds were found to be related to the market.
On March 13, 2020, an unverified report from the South China Morning Post suggested that the first case could go back to November 17, 2019, in a 55-year-old from Hubei Province. On February 26, 2020, WHO reported that, as new cases appeared to be decreasing in China but suddenly increasing in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had exceeded the number of new cases in China for the first time.
There may be a strong underestimation of cases, particularly among those with mild symptoms.
On 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported among young people, those aged 19 and under representing 2.4 per cent of the world's cases. The Chief Scientific Adviser of the United Kingdom, Patrick Vallance, estimated that 60 per cent of the British population needed to be infected before they could achieve effective collective immunity.
The cases refer to the number of people tested at COVID-19 and confirmed to be positive according to official protocols.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3 per cent of its population, and many countries had had as their official policies not to test those who had only mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 revealed that in China, until January 23, 86% of undetected VOCID-19 infections were estimated, and that these unregistered infections were the source of 79% of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of infections in Italy was much higher than reported cases.
The first estimates of the basic reproduction rate (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 are cured.
For those who do not recover, the time between the onset of symptoms and death is between 6 and 41 days, the most common being 14 days.
As at 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths had been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, as of 5 February, approximately 80% of deaths occurred in the 60-year-old age group, and 75% were suffering from pre-existing health problems such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Official counts of deaths related to the VOCID-19 pandemic generally refer to deceased individuals who have been tested positive for VOCID according to official protocols.
The number of actual victims of COVID-19 could be much higher, since it may not include untested deceased persons - e.g. at home, in retirement homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy show that the figures of overmortality during the pandemic are 4-5 times higher than the official count of COVID deaths.
A spokesperson for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States (CDC) recognized "We know that [the number of deaths announced] is underestimated," a statement confirmed by anecdotal reports from the U.S. Underassessment. Such underestimation often occurs in pandemics, such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu epidemic. The first confirmed death occurred in Wuhan on January 9, 2020.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on 14 February.
On 28 February, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths per country had been recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
On 13 March, more than 40 countries and territories reported deaths on all continents except Antarctica, and several indicators are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These figures vary by region and over time, and are influenced by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, therapeutic options, the time since the onset of the epidemic, as well as demographic characteristics such as age, gender, and especially health. The case-death ratio represents the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed over a given period.
According to statistics from Johns-Hopkins University, the global case-death ratio is 6.0% (97 039/1 617 204) as at 10 April 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, estimates of the case-death ratio decreased from 17.3% (for those with symptoms that occurred between 1 and 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms that occurred after 1 February 2020).The other indicators are the rate of lethality (fatality rate), which represents the percentage of people diagnosed who succumb to disease, and the rate of infection (infection rate), which represents the percentage of infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who succumb to disease.
These statistics are not limited in time and follow a specific population of contamination at the end of the disease.
Several scientists have tried to calculate these figures for specific populations.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine of the University of Oxford estimates that the overall infection rate for the pandemic is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The highest value of this range is consistent with the results of the first randomized tests for COVID-19 in Germany, and a statistical study analysing the impact of the tests on estimates of lethality.
WHO maintains that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and final duration of the epidemic are uncertain and may vary by region.
Maciej Boni of the state university of Pennsylvania said: "Without control, generally infectious epidemics stabilize and then begin to regress when the disease comes to lack of available hosts.
But it is almost impossible to make any relevant forecasts at this time."
Chinese Government Chief Medical Advisor Zhong Nanshan said that "this could be completed by June" if all countries succeed in mobilizing to follow WHO recommendations on measures to halt the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 "will continue to circulate, potentially for a year or two."
According to an Imperial College study conducted by Neil Ferguson, physical distance and other measures will be required "until a vaccine is available (possibly 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said: "I think it is unlikely that this coronavirus—because it is transmitted very easily—will disappear completely" and that it "could turn into seasonal disease, likely to reappear every year."
The virulence of this return would depend on collective immunity and the extent of the mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are sometimes rather non-specific and infected people can be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Common symptoms include fatigue, production of respiratory secretions (mucosities), loss of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, haemoptysis, diarrhoea, or cyanosis. WHO states that approximately one in six people is seriously ill and has breathing difficulties.
The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identifies emergency symptoms such as breathing difficulty, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficult awakenings, and face or lips; immediate medical care is recommended if these symptoms are present. Subsequent disease development may lead to severe pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, septicaemia, septic shock, and death.
Some of the infected individuals may be asymptomatic, with no clinical symptoms, but with test results that confirm the infection, then the researchers issued recommendations that people who had close contact with confirmed infected individuals should be closely monitored and examined to rule out the risk of infection.
Chinese assessments of the asymptomatic ratio range from a few to 44%.
The usual incubation period (the time between contamination and the onset of symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; it is more often than five days. A good example of uncertainty, the estimate of the proportion of people carrying COVID-19 who lost smell was initially 30% before falling to 15%.
Some information on how the disease spreads remains to be determined.
The disease is supposed to be transmitted mainly during close contact and by fine droplets produced by coughing, sneezing, or talking; this close contact corresponds to a radius of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have shown that coughing without protection can project droplets at a distance of 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some suggested that the virus could also be transmitted by thin droplets that would remain in the air over longer periods, which could be projected by talking. Respiratory droplets can also be projected when expiring, including by talking, although the virus is generally not airborne.
Postillons can land in the mouth or nose of other people next door or even be inhaled into the lungs.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may cause respiratory secretions that are sprayed and therefore cause air spread.
It can also spread when someone touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, before touching his eyes, nose, or mouth.
If some fear that it may pass through the stools, this risk is considered to be low.
The Chinese government has ruled out the possibility of a feco-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is more contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, however the spread may be possible before the symptoms appear and at advanced stages of the disease.
People have been tested positive for the disease up to three days before symptoms occur suggesting that transmission is possible prior to the development of significant symptoms.
Only a few reports of laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic cases exist, but asymptomatic transmission has been detected by some countries during contact surveys.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that if it is not yet known exactly how easily the disease spreads, one person usually contaminates two to three others. The virus survives hours or days on the surfaces.
Specifically, the virus was detected after three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel 304, after one day on cardboard, and after four hours on copper.
This, however, depends on humidity and temperature. Domestic animals and other animals have been tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, however the UK authorities recommend washing their hands after touching animals, as after having been in contact with other surfaces that infected people may have affected.
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, initially isolated in three people with pneumonia related to the outbreak of acute respiratory disease of Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus exist in related coronaviruses in nature. Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is closely linked to the initial SARS-CoV.
We think he'd be of zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis revealed that coronavirus belongs genetically to the genus Betacoronavirus, to the subgenus Sarbecovirus (line B) associated with two strains of bats.
It is identical to 96% of the entire genome of another bat coronavirus sample (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only one amino acid of difference in some parts of genome sequences between pangolins and human viruses.
Comparison of the genome as a whole has revealed to date a maximum of 92% common genetic material between pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove that pangolin is the intermediate host.
Virus infection may be provisionally diagnosed based on symptoms, but final confirmation is done by reverse transcription of the polymerase chain reaction (RTR-PCR) of infected secretions or scanners.
A study comparing PCR and scanner to Wuhan suggested that the scanner is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less accurate, as many of its imaging features coincide with other pneumonias and pathological processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that "the scanner should not be used for screening or as a first-intention test to diagnose COVID-19."
WHO published several RNA test protocols for SARS-CoV-2, with a first release on 17 January.
The test uses reverse real-time polymerase chain reaction transcription (RTR-PCR).
The test can be performed on breath or blood samples.
The results are usually available in a few hours or days.
Generally this test is performed on a rhinopharynx sample but a throat sample can also be used. Several laboratories and companies are currently developing serological tests, which detect antibodies.
On 6 April 2020, none of them proved reliable enough to be approved for general use.
In the United States, a serological test developed by Cellex was approved for emergency use by certified laboratories only.
The characteristic imaging elements on x-rays and tomography (scanner) of people with symptoms include asymmetric peripheral depoli glass opacities and a lack of pleural effusion.
The Italian Society of Radiology is currently establishing an international online database of confirmed case imaging results.
Due to the overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, PCR-confirmed imaging is limited in accuracy to detect COVID-19.
An important study in China compared the results of chest scanners to PCR and demonstrated that while imaging is less accurate for infection, it is faster and more sensitive, advocating its inclusion as a screening tool in epidemic areas.
Convolutional neural networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed to detect characteristics of the virus in imaging on both x-rays and scanners.
Strategies to prevent the transmission of the disease include having overall good personal hygiene, washing your hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or sneezing in a handkerchief and then throwing the handkerchief directly into a garbage bag.
It was recommended that those who had already been contaminated wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical separation measures have also been recommended to prevent transmission, and many governments have banned or advised against all non-essential movements to or from countries and sectors affected by the epidemic.
Nevertheless, the virus has reached the stage of community transmission in vast areas of the planet.
This means that the virus spreads to communities, and some members of these communities do not know where or how they were contaminated. Health care professionals who care for someone who may be infected are advised to take the usual precautions as well as contact precautions, and wear protective glasses. Searching for contacts is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and prevent future transmissions.
The use of mobile phone location data by governments in this regard has raised privacy concerns, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations publishing a press release calling for limits to such surveillance.
Various mobile applications have been launched or proposed on the basis of volunteering, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record a user's presence near other mobile phones.
Users then receive a message if they have been in close contact with someone who has been tested positive at COVID-19. False ideas are currently circulating on how to prevent infection; for example, rinsing your nose and gargling with mouthwash is not effective.
There is no vaccine for VOCID-19, but many organizations are currently trying to develop one.
It is advisable to wash your hands to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands often with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after they have been in the toilet or when their hands are visibly dirty; before eating; and after they have blushed, coughed, or sneezed.
It is because outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which breaks its protective envelope.
The CDC also recommended the use of a disinfectant for alcohol-based hands containing at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not readily accessible.
WHO advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces may be decontaminated in several ways (in one minute of exposure to disinfectant for a stainless steel surface), including 62–71 % ethanol, 50–100 % isopropanol, 0.1 % sodium hypochlorite, 0.5 % hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2–7.5 % iodized povidone.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if a case of COVID is suspected or confirmed in an establishment such as an office building or a crèche, all parts such as offices, toilets, common rooms, as well as common electronic equipment such as tablets, touchscreens, keyboards, remote controls, and vending machines used by sick people be disinfected.
Health organizations advise people to cover their mouth and nose with their folded elbow or handkerchief when they cough or sneeze, and to throw away all handkerchief immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who would be infected, as wearing a mask may limit the volume and distance travelled by the projected postillons by speaking, sneezing, and coughing.
WHO has issued instructions explaining where and when to use the masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at Leeds University, "Wearing a mask can reduce the propensity of people to touch their faces, which is an important source of infection in the absence of good hand hygiene."The use of masks has also been recommended to those who care for a person potentially affected by the disease.
WHO has recommended the wearing of masks to healthy people only if they face a significant risk, for example if they care for a patient with COVID-19, even if they recognize that wearing the mask can help people not to touch their faces.
Several countries have begun to encourage their populations to use masks.
In the United States, the CDC recommends the wearing of non-medical tissue masks. China specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks for healthy people, especially in the case of proximity (1 metre (3 feet) or less) with other people.
Hong Kong recommends wearing a surgical mask in public transport or crowded places.
In Thailand, health authorities encourage people to make facial masks at home and clean them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned public outings without a mask or other means of covering his nose and mouth.
On 16 March, Vietnam imposed the wearing of the mask on everyone in public places, so that everyone protects himself and others.
The Austrian government has ordered that anyone entering a supermarket wear a mask.
Israel asked all its residents to wear a mask in public.
Taiwan, which has produced 10 million masks a day since mid-March, imposed the wearing of the mask on passengers of long distance trains and buses on April 1.
Panama has made it mandatory to wear a mask for any exit, while recommending the manufacture of a handcrafted mask to those who cannot buy it.
Masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distance (also called physical distance) includes measures to control infections to slow down the spread of the disease by decreasing contacts between people.
Methods include quarantines, travel restrictions and closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres and shopping centres.
Social distance methods can be applied by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowds, saluting oneself without contact and keeping physical distance from others.
Many governments are now ordering or recommending social distancing in areas affected by the epidemic.
The maximum size of gatherings recommended by U.S. government and health agencies was rapidly reduced from 250 people (if there is no known presence of COVID-19 in the region) to 50 people, and later to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people. Older adults and those with underlying health problems such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension or a weakened immune system were at increased risk of serious illness and complications, and were invited by the CDC to stay at home as much as possible in the areas affected by the epidemic. By the end of March 2020, WHO and other health agencies began to replace the term "social distance" with "physical distance" to clarify the objective of reducing physical contact by preserving social ties, whether virtually or by keeping a distance.
The use of the term "social distance" suggested that total social isolation should be used instead of encouraging people to maintain contact with others through other means. Some authorities have issued guidelines on sexual health to be followed during the pandemic.
They include the recommendation to have sex only with a person with whom you live, who does not have the virus, or who does not have the symptoms.
Home isolation has been recommended for those diagnosed with positive VOCID-19 and those who think they are infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper isolation. Many governments have imposed or recommended individual quarantine for entire populations living in affected areas.
The strictest individual quarantine instructions were given to people in the most at-risk groups.
Persons who have been exposed to a disease with COVID-19 and those who have recently travelled to a country or region where transmission is very important were invited to quarantine for 14 days from the time they were last exposed.
The strategies for controlling an epidemic are containment or suppression, and mitigation.
The containment is implemented during the early stages of the epidemic and aims to monitor and isolate infected persons, as well as to introduce other infection control and vaccination measures to prevent the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to prevent the spread of the disease, efforts are directed towards the mitigation phase: steps are being taken to slow the spread of the disease and mitigate its effects on the health care system and society.
Deterioration and mitigation measures may be taken at the same time.
Removal requires more extreme measures, in order to inflate the pandemic by reducing the number of basic reproductions to less than 1. Part of the management of an infectious disease epidemic is to try to mitigate the epidemic peak: this is called flattening the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of overburdening health services and saves time for vaccine and treatment development.
Among the non-pharmaceutical interventions that can manage the epidemic are personal prevention measures, such as hand hygiene, masking and individual quarantine; public social distance measures such as closure of schools and religious offices; a public effort to encourage acceptance of and participation in such interventions; and environmental actions such as surface cleaning. More drastic measures to control the epidemic have been taken in China since the severity of the epidemic has become apparent, such as quarantine of entire cities and a strict travel ban.
Other countries have also adopted a variety of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduced localized mass screening and quarantine, and issued alerts on the movement of infected persons.
Singapore provided financial support to those infected who became quarantined, and imposed heavy fines on those who did not.
Taiwan has increased the production of masks and sanctioned the seizure of medical supplies. Simulations for Britain and the United States show that mitigation (the slowdown but not the elimination of the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (the reversal of the epidemic) face significant challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies can reduce health care demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but cannot prevent hundreds of thousands of deaths, and health care systems are submerged.
Removal may be preferred, but should be continued for as long as the virus circulates in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if it happens first), because otherwise, transmission rebounds rapidly when the measures are relaxed.
Long-term intervention to eliminate the pandemic has a social and economic cost.
There are no approved antiviral treatments for VOCID-19, but development efforts are under way, including existing treatment tests.
Taking non-prescription medicines against cold or drinking, as well as rest, can help relieve symptoms.
Depending on severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous infusions and respiratory assistance may be required.
The use of steroids can worsen the results.
Several compounds that have already been approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are currently being studied for the treatment of VOCID-19.
WHO stated that some "traditional and artisanal remedies" may soften symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
Increased capacity and adaptation of health care for the needs of patients with COVID-19 is described by WHO as a fundamental response to the epidemic.
ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have issued guidelines to hospitals and primary health care services for the redeployment of resources at different levels, including by devoting laboratory services to VOCID-19 testing, cancelling non-urgent interventions where possible, separating and isolating patients tested positive for VOCID-19, and strengthening intensive care capacity through staff training and increasing the number of ventilators and beds available.
There are various theories regarding the place of origin of the very first case (called patient zero).
The first known case of the new coronavirus could go back to December 1, 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
In one month, the number of cases of coronavirus in Hubei gradually increased.
They are usually linked to the wholesale market of Huanan seafood, which also sold live animals. According to one theory, the virus would come from one of these animals; in other words, it would have a zoonotic origin. A outbreak of pneumonia of unknown cause was observed on December 26 and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian at the hospital of Hubei province, who informed the CDC of Wuhan Jianghan on December 27.
On December 30, a group of doctors from Wuhan Central Hospital notified their colleagues of a "SARS-like coronavirus".
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were reprimanded by the police for spreading false rumors, and another, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by his superiors for giving the alert.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission then issued a public notice on 31 December and informed WHO.
There were enough cases of unknown pneumonia reported to the Wuhan health authorities to initiate an investigation in early January. In the early stages of the epidemic, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, aided by Chinese New Year migrations and the fact that Wuhan is a transport hub and a major railway connecting point.
On January 20, China reported nearly 140 new cases in one day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Subsequent official data show that 6,174 people had already developed symptoms on January 20, 2020. On March 26, the United States surpassed China and Italy by displaying the largest number of confirmed cases in the world. On April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases were reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people died and more than 364,000 healed.
About 200 countries and territories have had at least one case.
Because of the pandemic in Europe, many Schengen countries have restricted movement and introduced border controls.
National responses included containment measures such as quarantines (also known as orders to stay at home, shelter on site or confinement) and curfews. As of 2 April, nearly 300 million people, or about 90 per cent of the population, are subjected to a form of confinement in the United States, over 50 million people are confined to the Philippines, about 59 million in South Africa and 1.3 billion in India.
On 26 March, 1.7 billion people around the world experienced a form of confinement, with a figure of 2.6 billion two days later — about one third of the world's population.
The origin of the first confirmed case of COVID-19 was dated to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report suggests that the very first case would date back to November 17.
Dr. Zhang Jixian observed an outbreak of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause on 26 December, of which she informed the CDC of Wuhan Jianghan on 27 December.
Initial genetic tests of patient samples on December 27, 2019 indicated the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
A public notice was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on 31 December.
WHO was informed on the same day.
The doctors in Wuhan received a warning for "propagating rumors" about the epidemic.
The National Health Commission of China initially claimed that there was no "obvious evidence" of human transmission.
At the end of January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign, later described by the Secretary General of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping as a "people's war" to stem the spread of the virus.
In what has been described as "the greatest quarantine in human history," a health cord was announced on January 23 to stop travel to and from Wuhan, which was extended to 15 cities in Hubei, affecting about 57 million people in total.
The use of private vehicles has been banned in the city.
Chinese New Year celebrations (January 25) were cancelled in many places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan, which was completed within 10 days.
Another hospital was later built: Leishenshan, to treat additional patients.
In addition to the new hospitals, China converted 14 other facilities in Wuhan, such as convention and stadium centres, into temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the government introduced new measures to stem the outbreak of COVID-19, including issuing health declarations for travellers and extending Spring Day leave.
The country's universities and schools have also been closed.
The Hong Kong and Macao regions have introduced several measures, particularly with regard to schools and universities.
Remote working measures have been introduced in several Chinese regions.
Travel restrictions were adopted in Hubei and beyond.
Public transport has been modified and museums in China have been temporarily closed.
The control of population displacement has been applied in many cities, and it has been estimated that about 760 million people (over half of the population) have experienced some form of displacement restriction. After the epidemic entered the global phase in March, the Chinese authorities have taken strict measures to prevent the virus from being "imported" from other countries.
For example, Beijing imposed a 14-day quarantine for all international travellers entering the city. By 23 March, in mainland China, only one case had been transmitted within the country in the previous five days, in this case via a traveller returning to Canton from Istanbul.
On March 24, 2020, Prime Minister Li Keqiang said that the spread of cases transmitted within the country was largely blocked, and that the epidemic was controlled in China.
On the same day, travel restrictions were relaxed in Hubei, apart from Wuhan, two months after the beginning of the confinement. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced on March 26, 2020 that entry for holders of a visa or residence permit would be suspended from March 28, without specifying when this policy was to end.

The schedules of the airlines were also reached and therefore modified. South Korea introduced what was considered the largest and best organized program in the world to test the population with the virus, and isolate all infected persons as well as track and quarantine people who have been in contact with them.
The screening methods included mandatory individual reporting of symptoms by international newcomers via a mobile application, virus detection drives delivering the results the next day, and increased testing capacity to allow for the testing of nearly 20,000 people each day.
South Korea's program is seen as a success in controlling the epidemic, although it has not quarantined entire cities. South Korea's society was initially divided about President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.

The UK's response to the virus first appeared to be one of the most flexible among the affected countries, and until 18 March 2020, the UK government did not impose any form of social distancing or mass quarantine on its citizens.
As a result, the government was criticized for its manifest lack of responsiveness and liveliness in response to public concerns.

Despite this, the United States took time to start testing, which obscured the true extent of the epidemic at that time.
The tests were affected by defective screening kits produced by the federal government in February, the lack of federal approval for non-governmental testing kits (universities, companies and hospitals) until the end of February, and restrictive criteria for being eligible for a test until the beginning of March (mandatory doctor's order thereafter).

WHO praised the efforts of the Chinese authorities to manage and contain the epidemic.
WHO noted the contrast between the 2002-2004 SARS epidemic, where Chinese authorities had been accused of concealment that had hindered prevention and containment efforts, and the current crisis where the central government "provided regular reports to avoid panic on the eve of the Lunar New Year".
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to enforce a travel ban on Wuhan, WHO representative Gauden Galea pointed out that although it was not "certainly a WHO recommendation", it was nevertheless a "very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic where it is most concentrated" and he spoke of an "unprecedented fact in the history of public health." On 30 January, following confirmation of an inter-human transmission outside China and the increase in the number of cases in other countries, WHO stated that the epidemic was an international public health emergency (USPPI), the sixth USPPI since the measure was invoked in the 2009 influenza A pandemic.
WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom stated that USPPI was due to the "risk of global spread, especially for low- and middle-income countries without robust health systems.
In response to travel restrictions, Tedros stated: "There is no reason why measures should interfere unnecessarily with international travel and trade" and "WHO does not recommend restricting trade and travel".
On 5 February, WHO called on the international community to contribute $675 million to financing strategic preparedness in low-income countries, citing the urgency of supporting those countries that "do not have the necessary systems to detect people who have contracted the virus, even if it is about to appear".
Tedros then stated that we were "as strong as our weakest link" and urged the international community to "invest today or pay more tomorrow." On February 11, WHO established in a press conference that the disease was called COVID-19.
On the same day, Tedros stated that UN Secretary-General António Guterres had agreed to integrate the "force of the entire United Nations system into the response".
A United Nations crisis management team has been activated to coordinate the overall United Nations response, which WHO believes will enable them to "focus on the health response while other agencies will be able to bring their expertise to manage the broader social, economic and developmental implications of the epidemic".
On 14 February, a joint WHO-led mission team was activated in China to send international and WHO experts to China to support national management and to assess "the severity and transmission of disease" by organizing workshops and meetings with key national institutions and to conduct field visits to assess "the impact of response activities at the provincial and county levels, including in urban and rural areas." On 25 February, WHO stated that "the world should do more to prepare for a possible coronavirus pandemic", indicating that although it is too early to speak of a pandemic, each country should nevertheless enter "in the preparatory phase".
In response to the development of the epidemic in Iran, WHO sent a joint mission team on site to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO representatives stated that the global threat assessment for coronavirus had gone from "high" to "very high", its highest level of alert and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, Executive Director of the WHO Health Emergency Management Program, warned in a statement: "This is a return to reality for every government on the planet: wake up.
This virus may be on its way and you need to stand by," adding that the right response measures could help the world avoid "the worst."
Ryan then indicated that the current data did not allow public health officials to announce a global pandemic, stating that such a statement would mean that "we absolutely accept that every human on the planet is exposed to this virus."
On 11 March, WHO stated that the coronavirus epidemic could be described as a pandemic.
The Director General said that WHO was "extremely concerned about both the alarming levels of spread and severity and the alarming levels of inaction." WHO faced significant criticism of its inadequate pandemic management, including the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
This negative reaction was supported by a petition urging WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom to resign, signed by 733,000 people on April 6.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts emphasized respect for the rights of each individual during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The experts stressed that every individual had the right to health, including persons with disabilities, belonging to minorities, the elderly, internally displaced persons, the homeless, those living in extreme poverty, detainees, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups in need of government support.
International governmental organizations are dealing with the economic and social impacts of the crisis in COVID-19.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has launched a platform that provides timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in different countries of the world, as well as views and advice.

The Chinese government was criticized by the United States, the British cabinet minister Michael Gove and the son of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, Eduardo Bolsonaro, for managing the pandemic, which began in the Chinese province of Hubei.
Several provincial administrators of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC) were relieved of their duties as a result of their quarantine management in Central China, a sign of discontent with the response of politicians to the epidemic in these regions.
Some commentators believe that this action was intended to protect the Secretary General of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping from popular anger over the coronavirus epidemic.
Some senior Chinese officials, e.g. Zhao Lijian, rejected the first idea that the coronavirus epidemic would have started in Wuhan in favor of conspiracy theories arguing that COVID-19 would hold its origins from the United States or Italy.
Donald Trump's US administration called the "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus" coronavirus, saying that in China "censorship has overfed a virus that has become a global pandemic," which was then taxed by some opponents and intended to "return attention from its administration's inability to contain the disease."
The Daily Beast obtained a telegram from the U.S. government outlining a seemingly National Security Council communication ploy, the strategy of which is as follows: "Everything comes from China.
We are asked to try to communicate this message in all possible ways, including at press conferences and television appearances."Press outlets such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg said China's efforts to send aid to countries affected by the virus were part of a propaganda drive to gain global influence.
EU foreign policy leader Josep Borrell warned that there was "a geopolitical component involving a struggle for influence through rhetoric and "gender policy".
Borrell also said that "China aggressively insists that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner."
China also called on the United States to lift its sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while a priori sending aid to the latter two countries.
The 100,000 masks given by Jack Ma to Cuba were blocked by US sanctions on April 3.
The US authorities have also been accused of diverting aid to other nations to their own country.
Other mask-related conflicts have also been reported among other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, as well as the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey seized hundreds of respirators destined for Spain.
At the beginning of March, the Italian government criticized the European Union's lack of solidarity with Italy, which was affected by the coronavirus.
Maurizio Massari, Italian ambassador to the EU, said that "only China had responded bilaterally.
This is certainly not a good sign for European solidarity."
On 22 March, after a telephone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin prepared the Russian army to send military doctors, special disinfection vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa cited an anonymous "high-placed political source" which indicated that 80 percent of Russian aid was "less or less useful to Italy".
The source accused Russia of embarking on an offensive of "geo-political and diplomatic" charm.
The President of Lombardy, Attilio Fontana, and the Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio denied the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo aircraft to the United States for medical assistance.
The Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov stated that "by offering his help to his American colleagues, [Poutine] assumes that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and equipment gain speed, they will be able to make the same if necessary."
The magnitude of NATO's "Defender 2020" military exercise planned in Germany, Poland and the Baltic countries, NATO's greatest manoeuvre since the end of the cold war, will be reduced.
The Secretary General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament Kate Hudson criticized Exercise Defender 2020: "In the current public health crisis, it is endangering not only the lives of American troops and many participating European countries, but also the lives of the inhabitants of the countries in which they operate."The Iranian government has been heavily affected by the virus, with about 20 members of parliament infected, as well as 15 other old or current political figures.
Iran's President Hassan Rohani wrote an open letter to world leaders asking for help on March 14, 2020, stating that his country was struggling to fight the epidemic because of lack of access to international markets as a result of the United States sanctions against Iran. The epidemic prompted calls for the United States to adopt social policies common to other rich countries, including a universal health care system, a universal childcare programme, paid parental leave and higher levels of public health funding.
Political analysts expect that this will negatively affect Donald Trump's chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have deteriorated due to the pandemic.
South Korea criticized Japan's "ambigious and passive quarantine efforts" after Japan announced that anyone arriving from South Korea would be quarantined on government-designated sites for two weeks.
South Korean society was initially divided about President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions calling for Moon's indictment of the government's mismanagement of the epidemic or, on the contrary, commending its response. The pandemic has allowed countries to adopt emergency legislation in response.
Some commentators expressed concern that this could enable Governments to strengthen their power.
In Hungary, the parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule by decree until further notice, to suspend parliament and elections and to punish anyone accused of disseminating false information about the virus and the management of the crisis by the government.
The Coronavirus epidemic has been accused of several cases of supply disruptions, resulting from a worldwide increase in the use of equipment to combat the epidemic, panic purchases and a disruption in the operation of factories and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Agency issued warnings about shortages of drugs and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and supplier disruption.
Several communities have also faced panic purchases that have led to the disappearance of basic necessities, such as food, toilet paper and water bottles, rays, resulting in shortages.
The technology sector, in particular, has warned of delays in the shipment of electronic products.
According to WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased by 100.
This demand led to a price increase of up to twenty times the normal price and also led to delays in the provision of medical devices for a period of four to six months.
This has also led to a shortage of personal protective equipment worldwide and WHO warns that this will endanger health professionals.
In Australia, the pandemic has provided a new opportunity for the Daigos to sell Australian products in China.
The activity created a shortage of infant milk in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of cases of COVID-19 in Northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the high demand for food products that followed, these two areas were spared by severe food shortages.
The measures taken by China and Italy against the illegal storage and trade of essential products have been a real success, thus avoiding the serious food shortages that had been foreseen in Europe and North America.
Thanks to its large agricultural production, Northern Italy did not notice a significant decrease, but prices could increase according to industry representatives.
The food shelves were only temporarily empty, even in the city of Wuhan, while members of the Chinese government unlocked pig reserves to ensure sufficient livelihood for the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy so that food producers store reserves for such emergencies.
Negative effects on the world economy were felt in China: according to a media report of 16 March, the Chinese economy was severely affected in the first two months of 2020 due to government measures to limit the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell by 20.5 per cent.
As mainland China is an important economic and manufacturing centre, the viral epidemic has been identified as a major destabilizing threat to the world economy.
Agathe Demarais of the Economist Intelligence Unit predicted that markets would remain unstable until a clearer image emerges on potential outcomes.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the epidemic on global growth could exceed those of the 2002-2004 SARS epidemic.
The estimate of an expert from the University of Washington in Saint-Louis reported an impact of more than $300 billion on the global logistics chain that could last up to two years.

Central banks react faster than they did in the 2008 financial collapse.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors due to travel bans, the closure of public space, including tourist attractions, and government recommendations against travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines cancelled flights due to lower demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, while the British regional airline Flybe went bankrupt.
The impact on the cruise sector has reached a level never seen before.
Several railway stations and ferry ports have also been closed.
The epidemic coincided with Chunyun, a major tourist season associated with Chinese New Year.
A number of events involving large crowds have been cancelled by national and regional governments, including the annual New Year's festivities, and private companies have also independently closed their shops and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many events related to the Lunar New Year have been cancelled and many tourist attractions have been closed to avoid mass gatherings, including the Forbidden City of Beijing and traditional temple fairs.
In 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities and regions, the authorities extended the New Year's holiday to 10 February, requiring most workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These regions accounted for 80 per cent of the country's GDP and 90 per cent of exports.
Hong Kong has moved to its highest level of response to infectious diseases and has declared an emergency situation, closing schools until March and cancelling New Year's festivities. The distribution sector has been impacted globally, with reductions in shop opening hours or temporary closures.
Visits to traders in Europe and Latin America fell by 40%.
In North America and the Middle East, traders saw a 50-60 per cent decrease.
This also resulted in a drop of 33-43% in pedestrian traffic in shopping centres in March compared to February.
Trade centre operators around the world have imposed additional measures, such as increased cleaning frequencies, the installation of thermal scanners to control customer temperature and the cancellation of events. According to an estimate by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession caused by the pandemic could leave between 14 and 22 million more people in extreme poverty in Latin America compared to a pandemic-free situation.
In January and February 2020, during the peak of the Wuhan epidemic, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
In China, a large part of the nearly 300 million rural migrant workers found themselves stranded in internal provinces or stuck in Hubei Province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied to the government for help.
The Coronavirus epidemic could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32%, according to estimates by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Confinement in India has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (received a daily wage) unemployed. The Angus Reid Institute survey found that 44% of Canadian households had experienced some type of unemployment. Nearly 900,000 workers have lost their jobs in Spain since the confinement imposed on mid-March 2020.
In the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for a temporary unemployment benefit and 1 million British workers applied for universal credit. Nearly half a million German companies had their employees switched to a partial activity scheme subsidized by the government called Kurzarbeit.
The German part-time work compensation scheme was adopted by France and Great Britain.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors have been deeply affected by the pandemic, impacting the functioning of organizations as well as individuals, both waged and independent, at the global level.
Arts and culture organizations have attempted to maintain their mission (often funded by the State) to provide access to cultural heritage to the community, ensure the safety of their employees and the public, and support artists to the extent possible.
In March 2020, museums, libraries, theatres and other cultural institutions were closed throughout the world and to varying degrees until further notice and their exhibitions, events and performances were cancelled or postponed.
In response, intensive efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms, another recent and accelerated consequence of the disease, the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technological conferences and fashion shows.
The film industry also experienced an interruption. The Vatican announced that the celebrations of Holy Week in Rome, which took place during the last week of the Christian penitence period of Lent, had been cancelled.
Many dioceses have recommended that older Christians stay at home rather than attend Sunday Mass; some churches broadcast their religious services on radio, online and live or on television, while others propose to practice their worship as a "drive-in".
Like the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome, which closed its churches and chapels and St Peter's Square, which was emptied of all its Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also cancelled their services and limited public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.
The Iranian Minister of Health announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in the areas affected by the epidemic and the holy places were subsequently closed, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims as well as its inhabitants to the sacred sites of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the largest disruption of the world sporting calendar since the Second World War.
The most important sporting events were either cancelled or postponed, including the UEFA Champions League 2019-20, the 2019-20 England Football Championship, the UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019-20 NBA season and the 2019-20 NHL season.
The outbreak disrupted the organization of the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were originally scheduled to begin at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event would be "replanned beyond 2020, but no later than summer 2021." Casinos and other gambling facilities around the world closed and live poker tournaments were either postponed or cancelled.
This has prompted many players to register online, and many online gaming sites have seen a significant increase in their number of new entries. The world of the show has also been affected, with several music groups having suspended or cancelled their concert tours.
Many major theatres, such as Broadway, have also interrupted all their performances.
Some artists have sought ways to continue to create and share their work on the Internet in place of traditional live performances, such as live and online concerts or online "festivals" created for artists to produce, broadcast and promote their works.
Online, many Internet memes on the theme of coronavirus have spread because many prefer humor and distraction in the face of uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia and racism against people of Chinese and East Asian origin, and against people from sensitive areas in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Incidents related to fear, suspicion and hostility have been observed in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports from February (while the majority of cases were still limited to China) described racist sentiments expressed in different groups around the world that the Chinese deserved the virus or received justifiable punishment.
Some African countries have also seen an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
Support was provided to the Chinese, whether online or offline, and to the inhabitants of the areas affected by the virus.
Following the spread of the epidemic to new sensitive countries, Italians, who lived in the first European country to experience a serious outbreak of COVID-19, could also face suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens from countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed petitions to ban Chinese from entering their country in order to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan raged on Twitter.
Chinese and other Asians living in the United Kingdom and the United States reported an increase in levels of racist insults, as well as attacks.
U.S. President Donald Trump faced criticism for calling the coronavirus "Chinese virus", a term considered by his detractors to be racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, protesters attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreign evacuees between Wuhan and Novi Sanzhary.
Students from North-East India, who share a border with China, and study in large Indian cities, are said to have been harassed in connection with the coronavirus epidemic.
The president of the Western Bengal unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party Dilip Ghosh said that the Chinese had destroyed nature and "that's why God took his revenge on them".
The remarks were subsequently condemned by the Chinese consulate in Kolkata, which called them "false." In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese inhabitants were fuelled by the pandemic, with foreigners being described as "foreign waste" that should be "eliminated".
Many pay-per-view newspapers have removed them for all or part of their coverage on the coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have made their scientific articles available in connection with the open-access epidemic.
Some scientists have chosen to share their results quickly on pre-publication servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory testing for 2019 Coronavirus Respiratory Disease (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods of virus detection and antibody detection produced in response to infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the RNA of the coronavirus.
This analysis is specifically designed to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA only.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used for both population diagnosis and monitoring.
Antibody tests reveal how many people have contracted the disease, including people whose symptoms were too mild to be reported or asymptomatic people.
An exact mortality rate of the disease and the level of collective immunity among the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Due to limited screening, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population in March 2020.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3 per cent of its population, and there were significant differences in the number of tests conducted in each country.
This variability is likely to significantly affect reported lethality rates, which are likely to be significantly overestimated in some countries.
Using reverse transcription followed by a real-time chain polymerization reaction (RTR-PCR), the test can be performed on respiratory samples obtained using various methods, including the nasopharyngeal swab or the expectoration sample.
The results are usually available within a few hours to 2 days.
The RT-PCR test performed from pharyngeal swabs is only reliable during the first week of the disease.
Subsequently, the virus may disappear from the throat while it continues to multiply in the lungs.
In infected people tested in the second week, a sample can also be taken from the deep respiratory tract by aspiration catheter, or a spitting (expectation) can be used.
One of the first PCR tests was developed by Charité in Berlin in January 2020 using reverse transcription followed by a real-time polymerization reaction (RTR-PCR), and was the basis of 250,000 kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom had also developed a test by January 23, 2020.South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a PCR-based clinical-quality SARS-CoV-2 detection kit (PowerChek Coronavirus) on January 28, 2020.
It detects the "E" gene shared by all beta-coronaviruses, and the SARS-CoV-2 specific RdRp gene.In China, the BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency authorization from the Chinese National Medical Products Administration for a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit.In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distribute their real-time RT-PCR diagnostic devices for the new 2019 Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) to public health laboratories through the International Reagent Resource.
Among the old versions of the test kits, a genetic test out of three obtained inconclusive results due to defective reagents, as well as a bottleneck of testing at Atlanta CDC. As a result, an average of less than 100 samples per day were successfully treated throughout February 2020.
Tests using two components were not considered reliable until February 28, 2020, and it was only at that time that federal and local laboratories were authorized to begin testing.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency use authorization.The U.S. commercial laboratories began screening in early March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the availability of national-scale tests for VOCID-19 based on RT-PCR.
Quest Diagnostics also distributed national VOCID-19 tests on March 9, 2020.
No quantitative limitations have been announced. Sample collection and processing must be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the VOCID-19 test was developed and produced by the National Research Centre for Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Surveillance Service. On March 12, 2020, it was announced that Mayo Clinic had developed a test for the detection of infection with COVID-19.On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA authorization for a test that could be performed in large quantities in 3.5 hours, allowing a device to perform approximately 4,128 tests in 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA granted an Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for a test on Abbott's m2000 system. The FDA had previously granted a similar authorisation to Holologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received an FDA U.S.A. for a test that took approximately 45 minutes.
The FDA approved a test that uses isothermal amplification technology for nucleic acids instead of PCR.
Since it does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles, this method can provide positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these devices in the United States, and Abbott plans to step up manufacturing to provide 50,000 tests per day.A test using a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the nucleocapside protein (N protein) of the new coronavirus is being developed in Taiwan, hoping that it can provide results in 15 to 20 minutes, such as a rapid flu test.
A literature study of March 2020 concluded that "lung radiographs have low diagnostic value in early stages, while the results of TDM [tomadensitometry] can be conclusive even before the onset of symptoms."
Typical symptoms visible on TDM include multi-lobarian depoli glass opacities with peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution.
A subpleural predominance, a "crazy pavement" and a consolidation develop as the disease evolves.
A study comparing CRP to TDM in Wuhan, at the point of origin of the current pandemic, suggested that TDM is significantly more sensitive than CRP, although less accurate, several of its imaging results coincide with other pneumonias and diseases.
In March 2020, the U.S. College of Radiology recommends that "MDT be not used for screening or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19."In March 2020, the CDC recommends CRP for initial screening.
Antibody production, including IgM and IgG, is part of the immune response to infection.
These can be used to detect infection in people from approximately 7 days after the onset of symptoms, to determine immunity and in the context of population surveillance.Tests can be performed in central laboratories (CLT) or by a patient's bedside test (point-of-care testing, PoCT).
The automated high-speed systems of many clinical laboratories are able to perform these analyses, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For CLT, only one peripheral blood sample is generally used, although serial samples can be used to follow the immune response.
For PoCT, only one blood sample is usually taken by skin puncture.
Unlike PCR methods, no extraction steps are required prior to the analysis.On March 26, 2020, the FDA appointed 29 entities that have duly informed the Agency and can, therefore, now distribute their antibody testing.
At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European authorizations for their test kits, capable of detecting IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The screening capacity is several hundred samples in a few hours, which is much faster than the viral RNA PCR test.
Antibodies are usually detectable 14 days after the onset of infection.In early April, the United Kingdom found that none of the antibody test kits purchased by the country were effective enough to be used.
Hong Kong has put in place a plan whereby suspicious cases can stay at home, "emergency services will provide the patient with a sample tube," patients spit inside, return it and receive the test result later.The British NHS announced that it is conducting a pilot project to test suspicious cases at home, eliminating the risk that one patient will infect others by going to a hospital or the need to disinfect an ambulance when used.As part of the COVID-19 test drive for suspected cases, a health care professional takes a sample by taking appropriate precautions.
The "drive" centres allowed South Korea to carry out one of the fastest and most comprehensive screenings in the world.In Germany, the National Association of Compulsory Health Insurance Physicians stated on March 2 that it had the capacity to conduct some 12,000 tests per day in outpatient settings, and that 10,700 patients had been tested during the previous week.
The costs are covered by the health insurance when the test is prescribed by a doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
As of March 19, drive-tests were available in several major cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests performed in Germany was unknown, as only positive results are reported.
A first laboratory study revealed that at the 12/2020 calendar week, a total of at least 483,295 samples were tested up to and including the 12/2020 week, and that 33,491 samples (6.9%) achieved a positive result for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers from Technion and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method of analysis of samples of 64 patients at the same time, grouping the samples together and conducting the screening only if the combined sample proves positive.In Wuhan, an improvised emergency detection laboratory of 2,000 square metres called "Huo-Yan" (in Chinese: . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Thanks to its 5-day construction supervised by Wang Jian, the founder of BGI, the modelling revealed that the cases in Hubei province would have been 47% higher and that the cost of quarantine would have doubled without this screening capacity.
Wuhan's laboratory was quickly followed by Huo-Yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, in a total of 12 Chinese cities.
As of March 4, 2020, the total daily capacity was 50,000 tests per day.Free multiplexed models developed by Origami Assays were published to test up to 1,122 samples of patients for VOCID-19 using only 93 tests. These balanced models can be performed in small laboratories without liquid manipulator robots.
In March, shortages and insufficient quantities of reagents became a bottleneck for mass screening in the EU, the United Kingdom and the United States.
This situation has prompted some authors to examine protocols for sample preparation that involve heating samples to 98°C (208°F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes to continue testing.On March 31, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates was now the country testing most of its per capita population for Coronavirus, and was in the process of intensifying screening to reach the majority of the population.
These results were obtained through a combination of the ability to conduct drive tests and the purchase of a high-speed population-wide laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (based on their "Huo-Yan" emergency detection laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory is capable of conducting tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory of this ability to be operational outside China.
Different test formulas targeting different parts of the genetic profile of coronavirus have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted the German formula for the production of kits sent to low-income countries that do not have the resources to develop their own kits.
The German formula was published on January 17, 2020. The protocol developed by the Centers for Disease Control in the United States was only published on January 28, delaying the availability of testing in the United States. China and the United States had problems with the reliability of test kits at the beginning of the epidemic, and these countries, as well as Australia, were unable to provide enough kits to meet the demand and testing recommendations of health professionals.
On the other hand, experts indicate that the high availability of tests in South Korea has helped reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
The screening capacity, largely in private-sector laboratories, has been strengthened over several years by the South Korean government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization recommended the intensification of screening programmes as the best way to slow down the advance of the VOCID-19 pandemic.The high demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus caused hundreds of thousands of tests to be delayed in private laboratories in the United States, and the supply of sewage and chemical reagents was exhausted.
In March 2020, China reported problems related to the reliability of its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC had "defects."The government then removed bureaucratic barriers that impeded private testing.Spain purchased test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results were unreliable.
The company explained that the erroneous results could be related to the inability to collect samples or use the kits correctly.
The Spanish Ministry stated that it will remove the kits that have given erroneous results, and replace them with another test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80 % of the test kits purchased in China by the Czech Republic provided false results. Slovakia has purchased 1.2 million test kits from China that proved to be defective.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested throwing them into the Danube. Ates Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said that the test kits that Turkey bought in China had a "high error rate" and that it did not "use them". The UK bought 3.5 million test kits in China, but announced in early April 2020 that they were unusable.
Screening, followed by 40 of those who achieved positive results and tracing of individuals who had been in contact with SARS-CoV-2 carriers, yielded positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vò, the site of the first death linked to COVID-19 in Italy, conducted two series of tests with the entire population of about 3,400 people, at about ten days apart.
Nearly half of those who achieved a positive result had no symptoms, and all cases were quarantined.
With the restriction of commuting, this measure has completely eliminated new infections.
Thanks to aggressive contact tracing, travel restrictions, screening and quarantine, Singapore's 2020 coronavirus pandemic has grown much faster than in other developed countries, but without extreme restrictions such as forced closure of restaurants and retail establishments.
Many events were cancelled, and Singapore began advising residents to stay at home on March 28, but schools reopened on the scheduled date at the end of the holiday on March 23.
Several other countries also managed the pandemic through aggressive contact tracing, travel restrictions, screening and quarantine, but with less aggressive confinements, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries with the highest number of tests, compared to the number of deaths, have much lower lethality rates, probably because these countries are better able to detect people with only mild symptoms or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries without analytical capacity whose national laboratories have only limited experience with COVID-19 send their first five positive samples and ten negative samples of COVID-19 to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmatory testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are located in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the column "Positive in % of tests" depends on the national screening policy.
A country that tests only those admitted to the hospital will have a positive value in % of tests higher than a country that tests all citizens, whether or not they have symptoms, the other factors being the same.
Handwashing, also called hand hygiene, is the cleaning of hands to remove dirt, grease, microorganisms or other undesirable substances.
The systematic washing of hands with soap at some "key times" of the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted by oro-fecal means.
Respiratory diseases such as flu or cold can be contracted, for example, by omitting to wash your hands before touching your eyes, nose or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes).
It is important to wash your hands with soap at five key times of the day: before and after defecation, after cleaning a baby's buttocks or changing diapers, before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
If you do not have water or soap under your hand, you can wash your hands with ashes. The World Health Organization recommends that you wash your hands:
before, during and after the preparation of meals;
before and after taking care of a sick person;
after changing the diapers of a baby or cleaning a child who went to the toilet;
after it has blushed or coughed/sneezed;
after touching an animal, feed or waste of animal origin;
Medical hand hygiene refers to health practices related to medical procedures.
Wash your hands before taking medication or providing medical care may prevent or reduce the spread of disease.
The primary medical goal of hand washing is to eliminate pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that may cause disease) and chemicals that may be harmful or cause disease.
This practice is particularly important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but also for the general public.
Handwashing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhoea; reducing respiratory infections;
as well as the reduction of the infant mortality rate during home deliveries.
According to a 2013 study, improved hand hygiene practices could lead to a slight improvement in the growth of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates associated with respiratory diseases and diarrhoea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioural changes, such as soap washing.
This simple practice can reduce the mortality rate associated with these diseases by almost 50%.
The introduction of actions to promote handwashing could reduce episodes of diarrhea by about a third, a figure comparable to that obtained by supplying drinking water to low-income regions.
Washing hands with soap reduces diarrhoea by 48 per cent and is the most effective and least expensive way to prevent diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections (ARIs), which must be done automatically in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the leading ARIs, is the leading cause of mortality among children under five years of age, accounting for nearly 1.8 million victims per year.
Together, diarrhea and pneumonia cause the deaths of nearly 3.5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, taking the habit of washing your hands with soap before eating and after going to the toilet can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, and reduce deaths due to diarrhoea by almost half and deaths due to acute respiratory infections by one quarter.
Handwashing is generally associated with other health measures in the water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programmes.
Hand washing also protects against impetigo, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
Minor deleterious effect, frequent washing of the hands can damage the skin by causing skin dryness.
A Danish study in 2012 found that excessive hand washing could lead to eczema or dermatitis in the hands, characterized by scaly skin and itching, and especially frequent in health workers.
Too frequent hand washing is also considered to be one of the symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).
It is important to wash your hands with soap at five key times of the day to reduce the oro-fecal transmission of diseases: before and after using the toilets (drilling, defecation), after cleaning a baby's buttocks (or changing its diapers), before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
It is also necessary to wash your hands properly to prevent the transmission of diseases, especially before and after treating a cut or wound, after sneezing, coughing or getting wet, after touching animal waste or handling animals and after touching garbage.
In many countries, the rate of soap hand cleaning is low.
According to a study conducted in 2015 in 54 countries dealing with hand hygiene, an average of 38.7% of households washed their hands with soap. A study conducted in 2014 showed that it was in Saudi Arabia that the rate was the highest (97%), the United States was in the middle of the table (77%) and China was the lowest (23%). Today, there are several methods to change behaviours and democratize the use of soap for hand washing at key times of the day. Among other things, in developing countries, it is possible to propose to schoolchildren to wash their hands in groups at specific times of the day so that children can make this habit.
For example, the Philippine Ministry of Education has implemented a "Primary Health Care Program" to promote children's health and education.
Deparasitating twice a year, combined with daily washing of the hands with soap and daily brushing of the teeth with a fluorinated toothpaste, is at the heart of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
To better remove microorganisms present on the skin, soaps or detergents should be added to the water.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce barriers to solution and increase solubility.
Water alone is not an effective cleanser for the skin as lipids and proteins, which are soil organic substances, are difficult to soluble in water.
Adequate water flow, however, facilitates cleaning.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, may contain bacteria from previous uses.
A small number of studies on the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap concluded that the transfer was unlikely because the bacteria are rinsed with foam.
The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicates, however, that "automatic liquid soap dispensers are preferable".
Antibacterial soaps have been strongly recommended to people who are concerned about their health.
To date, there is no evidence to suggest that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants makes it possible to target antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which many strains of organisms resist.
Therefore, even if antibiotic resistant strains are not the result of antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as announced.
In addition to the surfactant and skin protector, the most complex formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) used to regulate pH, benzoic acid, having an antimicrobial function, and other protective agents (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).A rigorous analysis by the University of Oregon School of Public Health indicated that ordinary soaps were as effective as antibacterial soaps for individuals and containing triclosan, to prevent disease and eliminate bacteria from the hands.
Hot water used to wash your hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria multiply much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, lukewarm and soapy water is more effective than cold and soapy water to eliminate natural oils that carry dirt and bacteria.
But contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have revealed that the use of lukewarm water does not help to reduce microbial load on the hands.
A disinfectant or hand antiseptic is a non-aqueous hand hygiene product.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, non-alcoholic hand hygiene products (commonly referred to as hydroalcoholic solutions, hand antiseptic solutions or hand disinfectants) began to become popular.
Most are formulated with isopropyl alcohol or ethanol in combination with a thickening agent such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) to obtain a gel, or a moisturizer such as glycerin to obtain a liquid or foam for greater ease of use and reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
Adding diluted hydrogen peroxide strengthens antimicrobial activity. Hand disinfectants containing at least 60-95% alcohol effectively eliminate germs.
Hydroalcoholic solutions kill bacteria, multi-resistant bacteria (SARM and ERV), tuberculosis and certain viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis), as well as fungi.
Hydroalcoholic solutions containing 70% alcohol eliminate 99.97% (3.5-log reduction equivalent to 35 decibels) of hand bacteria 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.99% (4.5-log reduction) of hand bacteria 1 minute after application Hand disinfectants are more effective against bacteria and less effective against certain viruses.
Hydroalcoholic solutions are almost entirely ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) viruses, the main cause of contagious gastroenteritis.A sufficient amount of disinfectant for the hands or hydroalcoholic solution must be used to properly wet or cover both hands.
The palm and back of both hands and the interstices between fingers and nails should be faced for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or dry gel.
The tips of the fingers should also be cleaned by rubbing them, palm against palm.The American Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing rather than using hydroalcoholic solutions, especially when the hands are visibly dirty.
The increased use of these products is due to their ease of use and their rapid elimination activity of microorganisms; however, they should not replace adequate hand washing unless you have water and soap at hand.
Frequent use of hydroalcoholic solutions may result in skin drying if the formula is not reinforced by emollients and/or moisturizing agents of the skin.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, hydroalcoholic solutions containing emollients caused significantly less irritation and dry skin than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact hives or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives in hydro-alcoholic solutions are rare.
The fact that hydroalcoholic solutions are less likely to cause irritating contact dermatitis has made them more attractive than washing hands with water and soap.
Despite their effectiveness, non-aqueous products do not remove organic matter from the hands, but only disinfect them.
It is for this reason that hand disinfectants are not as effective as soap and water to prevent the spread of many pathogens, as they remain on the hands.
The efficacy of non-alcoholic hand disinfectants is highly dependent on the ingredients and formula, and has always been significantly lower than that of alcohol and alcohol-based disinfectants.
More recently, formulae that use benzalkonium chloride exhibited a sustained and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, whose efficacy is diminished after repeated use, probably due to progressive cutaneous adverse reactions.
In low-income populations, many people do not have the means to buy soap, but rather use ash or land.
Ash or earth can be more effective than water alone, but less effective than soap.
Moreover, if soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, it may increase the spread of disease rather than curb it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant because, in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends ash or sand as an alternative to soap when soap is not available.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that you wash your hands properly to prevent disease transmission by following the following steps:
Wet your hands with warm or cold running water.
Current water is recommended due to the risk of contamination of stagnant water points, while water temperature does not appear to make any difference).
Moisten a generous amount of soap on the hands by rubbing them against each other, not forgetting the back of the hands, between the fingers and under the nails.
Soap removes the germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap than with water alone.
Rub for at least 20 seconds.
The action of rubbing creates friction, which helps to remove the germs from the skin, and rub longer removes more germs.
Rinse thoroughly with running water.
Rinsing in a stagnant pool of water can result in hand recontamination.
Dry with a clean towel or in the open air.
Wet and wet hands re-emerge more easily.The most often forgotten areas are the thumb, wrist, spaces between the fingers and the bottom of the nails.
Artificial nails and flaky nail polish can host microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotion is often recommended to avoid dry hands; skin dryness promotes skin lesions that may increase the risk of infection transmission.
There are many economic alternatives to wash your hands when tap water and/or soap are not available.For example, water from a suspended and drilled can or gourd and/or use ash if needed in developing countries.In situations where water supply is limited (as in schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to save water, such as "tippy-taps" and other economic options.
A tippy-tap is a simple technology that uses a hanging pitcher with a rope, and a pedal to pour a small amount of water on the hands and a soap loaf.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but the best way to dry your hands in public toilets is to debate.
More and more research suggests that paper towels are much more hygienic than electric hand dryers that are often found in toilets.
In 2008, a study funded by the paper-cleaning industry, the European Tissue Symposium, was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, to compare the hygiene levels offered by paper towels, hot-air hand dryers and more modern air-jet hand dryers.
After washing and drying hot-air hand dryers, it was found that the total number of bacteria increased by an average of 194 per cent on the pulp of the fingers and 254 per cent on the palms.
Drying with air-jet hand dryers resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria on the finger pulp by 42% and on the palms by 15%.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria was reduced by an average of 76% on the pulp of the fingers and up to 77% on the palms.Scientists also conducted tests to determine whether there was a potential for cross-contamination with other toilet users and the toilet environment depending on each drying method.
The air-jet hand dryer, which blows air out of the appliance at announced speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is capable of expelling microorganisms from the hands and the appliance and possibly contaminating other toilet users as well as the toilet environment within a perimeter of up to 2 meters.
The use of a hot air hand dryer allows micro-organisms to be diffused at a maximum distance of 0.25 metres from the hand dryer.
Paper towels revealed that there was no significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt, different hand drying methods were evaluated.
After drying the hands, the following variations in bacterial counts were observed:
There are many manufacturers of different hand dryers, and hand dryers have been compared to drying using paper towels.
Handwashing with disinfectant wipes is an alternative solution during movement, in the absence of soap and water.
Hydroalcohol solutions must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Handwashing in the medical environment became mandatory long after Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing diseases in the hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that emit reminders when hospital staff forget to wash their hands.
One study found that their use led to a decrease in infection rates.
Medical hand washing should last at least 15 seconds, using a generous amount of soap and water or gel to foam and rub each part of the hands.
The hands must be rubbed against each other by passing between the fingers.
In case of residues under the nails, it is possible to use a hair brush to remove them.
Since the germs present in the water are likely to remain on the hands, it is important to rinse well and wipe with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to close the faucet (and open the exit door if necessary).
This avoids retabling your hands when contacting surfaces.
The goal of hand washing in health structures is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("germs") and prevent their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the lack of hand cleaning remains unacceptable in most medical facilities, with a large number of doctors and nurses regularly forgetting to wash their hands before touching their patients, which promotes the transmission of microorganisms.
According to one study, proper hand-washing and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of catheter-related blood infections by 66%. The World Health Organization has published a brochure describing the standard procedure for washing and rubbing its hands in the field of health.
The draft guidelines on hand hygiene prepared by the Organization can also be consulted on the website for comments from Internet users.
A relevant analysis was conducted by Whitby et al.
Devices available in trade can measure and certify hand hygiene if compliance is proven.
The World Health Organization defines "Five indications" for hand hygiene:
after exposure to blood/organic fluid;
before an aseptic gesture; and
after having had contact with the patient. Adding antiseptic chemicals to the soap (soap "medicinal" or "antimicrobial") gives the hand washing agent an action of germ destruction.
It is desirable to remove these germs before performing a surgical operation or in environments where antibiotic resistant organisms are very common. To rub your hands for surgery, it is necessary to have a faucet that can be opened and closed without touching it with your hands, a chlorhexidine or iodine-based washing product, sterile towels to dry your hands after washing them, a sterile brush to rub and another sterile instrument to clean under your nails.
All jewellery must be removed.
As part of this procedure, it is necessary to wash your hands and forearms to the elbow, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
It is not necessary to rub your hands for 10 minutes.
When rinsing, water on the forearms should not flow to the hands.
Once your hands are washed, dry your hands with sterile linen and put on a surgical coat.
In order to reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for your hands before and after caring for a sick person.
Regarding the control of Staphylococci infections in hospitals, it was found that the main benefits of hand washing were obtained during the first 20% of the washing, and that there were very few additional benefits to increasing the frequency of hand washing beyond 35%.
Comparing handwashing with an ordinary soap with an antibacterial soap, the rate of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted to food is more than three times higher. Similarly, comparing handwashing with an alcohol-based solution and handwashing with an antibacterial soap for an average duration of 30 seconds each, the former reduces bacterial contamination by 26% compared to the latter.
But soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based products in reducing influenza A virus (H1N1) and difficult Clostridium spores on the hands. In order to improve hand hygiene in health care facilities, it is possible, among other things, to train staff in hand washing, to make more alcohol-based products available to them, and to send written and verbal reminders to them.
Further research is needed to find out which interventions are most effective in different health structures.
In developing countries, soap-washing is seen as a cost-effective and essential tool for maintaining health and even feeding properly.
However, due to the lack of reliable water points, soap or hand washing facilities at home, at school and in the workplace, it is difficult to achieve universal habits of hand hygiene.
For example, in most rural Africa, it is rare to find taps to wash your hands near private or public toilets, despite the existence of economic options to build hand washing stations.
However, low hand washing rates may also be due to stubborn habits, rather than a lack of soap or water.
Promoting and raising awareness of soap-washing can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of soap-washing and lead to long-term behavioural change in the population.
In order for this to be successful, follow-up and evaluation activities are needed.
A systematic review of 70 studies revealed that local approaches are effective in increasing the rate of hand washing in low- and middle-income countries, and that social marketing campaigns are less effective. With regard to the promotion of hand washing in schools, one can cite the example of the UNICEF "Three-Star Approach" which encourages schools to take simple and inexpensive measures to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, while respecting other hygiene rules.
Once the minimum standards are reached, schools can move from one to the final three stars.
The construction of hand washing stations can be part of the hand hygiene promotion campaigns that are carried out to reduce illness and infant mortality.
The World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness campaign that aims to encourage behavioural change.Following the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF encouraged the adoption of an emoji illustrating handwashing.
Few studies have examined the overall cost-effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries in relation to the number of healthy years of life earned (i.e. avoided DALY).
However, one review suggests that the promotion of soap hand washing is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of handwashing for human health, especially for people in vulnerable situations such as mothers who had just given birth or soldiers injured in hospitals, was first identified in the mid-19th century by two hand hygiene pioneers: Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the British "founder of modern nursing".
At that time, most people still believed that infections were due to the fetid odors called miasms.
In the 1980s, food-borne epidemics and nosocomial infections led the American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively promote hand hygiene as an essential means of preventing the spread of infections.
The emergence of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 have led to increased awareness in many countries about the need to wash your hands with soap to protect yourself from these infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, posters illustrating "good hand washing techniques" were placed next to sinks in public toilets and in the toilets of office buildings and airports.
The term "washing your hands" refers to a person's refusal to assume responsibility or to be an accomplice to something.
It came from a Bible verse by Matthew in which Pontius Pilate washes his hands of the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but this expression has spread widely in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth undertakes to wash her hands compulsively in an attempt to clean up an imaginary stain, a symbol of her bad conscience with regard to the crimes she has committed and which she has incited her husband to commit.
It was also found that some people, after remembering or considering having committed unethical acts, tend to wash their hands more often than others and to give more value to hand washing devices.
In addition, those who are allowed to wash their hands after having such thoughts are less inclined to engage in other compensatory "purification" measures, such as volunteerism.
Some religions prescribe the washing of hands for both hygienic and symbolic purposes. The symbolic washing of the hands, which consists of using water and not soap to wash their hands, is part of the ritual washing of the hands highlighted in many religions, including Baha'is and Hinduism, immersion (teilah) and ritual ablution of the hands (Netilat Yadayim) in Judaism, the washbasin in Christianity and the wudhu in Islam. Religions also prescribe the washing of the hands for hygienic purposes, especially after certain actions.
According to Hinduism, Judaism and Islam, it is mandatory to wash your hands after going to the toilet.
Similarly, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam require that their hands be washed before and after each meal.
Risk Controls for VOCID-19 in the Workplace
Risk controls for VOCID-19 in the workplace mean the implementation of occupational health and safety methodologies for risk control for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Adequate workplace risk controls vary across workplaces and tasks, based on a risk assessment of sources of exposure, the severity of the disease in the community, and individual risk factors for workers who may be vulnerable to infection with COVID-19.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in the United States, jobs with lower risk of exposure have minimal professional contact with the public and other employees. In this case, only basic prevention measures against infection are recommended, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are ill, the respiratory label, and maintaining routine cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Jobs at risk of medium exposure include those requiring frequent or close contact with people without suspected or known COVID-19 but who may be infected due to ongoing community transmission or international travel.
This includes workers in contact with the general public, particularly in schools, high-density working environments and certain large-volume retail environments.
Risk controls in this group, in addition to basic measures to prevent infection, include ventilation using highly effective air filters, hygienic windows and the provision of personal protective equipment in case of encounters with a person with COVID-19.
OSHA considers health and funeral workers exposed to persons with a suspected or known COVID-19 as having a high risk of exposure, to be at very high risk if they perform procedures producing aerosols or samples or manipulations of persons with a suspected or known COVID-19.
The appropriate risk controls for these workers include technical controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and task-appropriate personal protective equipment.
COVID-19 epidemics can have several effects on the workplace.
Workers may be absent because they have fallen ill, have to take care of others or fear possible exposure.
Commercial models may change, both with respect to goods requested and the means to acquire them (including shopping outside peak hours or using delivery or drive services).
Finally, the shipment of items from geographical areas severely affected by COVID-19 may be discontinued. A plan for the preparation and response to infectious diseases may be used as a guide for protective measures.
The plans take into account the levels of risk associated with different workplaces and tasks, including sources of exposure, risk factors related to the family and community context, and individual risk factors of workers such as advanced age or chronic diseases.
They also outline the controls necessary to deal with these risks and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of the epidemics.
Infectious disease preparedness and response plans may be the subject of national or regional recommendations.
The objectives of responding to an epidemic include reducing transmission among staff, protecting people at higher risk of medical complications, maintaining business operations and reducing adverse effects on other entities in their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community where the company is located influences the responses applied.
The hierarchy of risk controls provides an overall framework for occupational health and safety in order to group risk controls in an efficient manner.
Where the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are technical controls, followed by administrative controls and finally personal protective equipment.
Technical checks involve isolating employees from work-related risks without having to rely on workers' behaviour and may be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative controls refer to changes in policies or procedures at work that require action by the worker or the employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than technical and administrative controls, but can help prevent certain exposures.
All types of PPE must be selected according to the worker's risk, appropriately adapted to the needs (e.g., respiratory masks), properly and systematically worn, regularly inspected, maintained and replaced as needed, and properly removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of to avoid contamination.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in the United States, jobs at lower risk of exposure have minimal professional contact with the public and other employees.
The basic prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent and thorough hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are ill, the respiratory label, including covering their mouths and noses for coughing and sneezing, providing handkerchiefs and garbage, preparing for teleworking or timed work, deterring workers from using the tools and equipment of others, and maintaining routine cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
The rapid identification and isolation of potentially infectious persons is a crucial step in protecting workers, clients, visitors and others in a workplace.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States recommend that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory disease stay at home until they no longer have fever, fever signs or any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without using fever or other drugs that affect symptoms. They also recommend that they apply flexible sick leave policies, allow employees to stay at home to take care of a sick family member and inform employees of these policies.
According to OSHA, jobs at medium risk of exposure include those requiring frequent or close contact, less than six feet (1.8 m), of people without suspected or known COVID-19, but who may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to ongoing community transmission around the company's headquarters or because the person recently made an international trip to a region with widespread transmission of COVID-19.
This includes workers in contact with the general public, notably in schools, high-density working environments and certain high-volume retail environments. Technical controls for this group and those at higher risk include the installation of high-efficiency air filters, increased ventilation rates, the installation of physical barriers such as transparent plastic sanitary windows and the installation of a drive window for customer service. Administrative controls for this group and those at higher risk include the development of emergency communication plans to stay at home, replacement of in-person meetings with virtual communications, the setting up of staggered working hours, the interruption of non-essential travel to areas with active COVID-19 epidemics, the development of emergency communication plans, including a forum to respond to workers' concerns, the provision of information and training on COVID-19 risk factors, and protective behaviours, the training of workers who need any kind of protection from the environment, or the use of equipment, the provision of personal protective equipment, the provision of personal protective equipment, the provision of personal protective equipment and the use of

Workers in this risk group rarely need to use respiratory masks.
If a person falls ill on board an aircraft, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include the following measures: separating the patient from others by a distance of 6 feet, appointing a member of the crew to take care of the patient and offering a protective mask to the patient or asking him to cover his mouth and nose using handkerchiefs when he coughs or sneezes.
The cabin crew shall wear disposable medical gloves when handling a sick passenger or touching organic liquids or potentially contaminated surfaces and, if possible, additional personal protective equipment if the sick passenger has fever, persistent cough or breathing difficulties.
Gloves and other disposable items shall be disposed of in a bag intended for hazardous biological waste and contaminated surfaces shall be cleaned and disinfected thereafter. For commercial navigation, including cruise ships and other passenger vessels, risk controls shall include the postponement of travel in case of illness and self-insulation and immediate information from the on-board medical centre if a fever or other symptoms develop once on board.
Ideally, medical follow-up should take place in the isolated person's cabin. For schools and childcare facilities, the CDC recommends a short-term closure for cleaning and disinfection if an infected person has visited a school building, regardless of community spread.
In the case of minimal to moderate community transmission, social distance strategies can be implemented, such as the cancellation of educational outings, assemblies and other important gatherings such as physical education or choir classes or canteen meals, by increasing the space between offices, by staggering the hours of arrival and departure, by reducing non-essential visitors and by using a separate infirmary for children with influenza symptoms.
In the event of significant transmission in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, an extension of school holidays can be considered. For law enforcement personnel performing routine daily activities, the immediate health risk is considered to be low by the CDC.
Police officers who must contact persons with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 must follow the same guidelines as ambulance personnel, including the wearing of adequate personal protective equipment.
In case of close contact during arrest, workers must clean and disinfect their equipment and service belt before re-use using a household detergent wipe or spray and follow standard procedures for the containment and disposal of used PPE as well as for the containment and washing of clothing.
OSHA regards certain health and funeral workers as belonging to categories with high or very high risk of exposure.
High-risk exposure jobs include health care, support, laboratory and medical transportation workers who are exposed to patients with suspected or known VOCID-19.
They become workers at very high risk of exposure if they perform procedures producing aerosols or samples or manipulations of patients with suspected or known COVID-19.
Aerosol-producing procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental examinations and procedures, or invasive sampling.
High-risk exposure funeral jobs include workers involved in the preparation of bodies of persons with suspected or known VOCID-19 at the time of death; they move to a very high risk of exposure if they perform an autopsy. Additional technical controls of these risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with suspected or known VOCID-19, including during aerosol production procedures.
Specialised negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in certain health and funeral settings.
Samples should be handled using level 3 biological safety precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends separating patients entering separate waiting rooms based on the suspicion of COVID-19. In addition to other PPE, OSHA recommends respiratory masks for people working less than 6 feet of patients with a suspected or known SARS-CoV-2 infection and for those performing aerosol-producing procedures.
In the United States, N95 filter respiratory masks approved by NIOSH or higher should be used in the context of a complete and written respiratory protection program that includes adaptation, training and medical examinations.
Other types of respiratory masks can provide better protection and comfort for the worker. WHO does not recommend combinations because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than transmitted by organic fluids.
WHO recommends the wearing of a surgical mask only by screening staff at the point of entry.
For those who collect respiratory samples, take care of or transport patients COVID-19 in the absence of aerosol-producing procedures, WHO recommends a surgical mask, protective glasses or a facial screen, a blouse and gloves.
In the event of a procedure producing aerosols, the surgical mask is replaced by a breathing mask N95 or FFP2.
Since the global supply of PPE is insufficient, WHO recommends limiting the need for PPE through telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, limiting access to a premises occupied by a COVID-19 patient to persons directly involved in its care, using the PPE required for the specific task only, continuing use of the same respiratory mask without removing it for the treatment of several patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordination of the supply chain of PPE and deterring the use of masks for asymptomatic individuals.

SUBJECT: [Covid-19] Lighten the burden and prepare for the future
DATE/SENDING TIME: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
LICENCE: CC0: No rights reserved
We are in an exceptional situation this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is a clear demonstration of our global human interconnection and our responsibilities to each other.
Its challenges are unprecedented, but we know that our best response is based on the kind of empathy, cooperation and community-building at the global level that is at the heart of this organization.
The camaraderie and benevolence that we have observed among all our colleagues in e-mails, calls and instant conversations are a remarkable testimony of the incredible human beings with whom we have the chance to work.
I couldn't be more grateful and proud of all of you among my colleagues.
Last week, someone told me of their gratitude for our work.
This person reminded me how important it is for the world to be able to consult Wikipedia at the present time, and the strong symbol of the fact that this essential resource remains online and accessible to all.
This is possible thanks to your work, whether you maintain the operational sites, ensure the payment of our colleagues or the safety of our communities.
The world needs the information provided by Wikipedia, now more than ever.
This is a time when not only what we do, but also how we do it, will have a significant impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and the role you play in it, we will make significant adjustments to the way we work together from next week.
Adjustments to our work and time schedules
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the C-team met last night to discuss our approach and schedule in the coming days and months.
During this conversation, we considered what we thought would be an appropriate response to the situation we are facing and how best to ensure the sustainability of the organization during this period.
Above all, we wanted to eliminate stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to step back, don't worry.
To all staff, contractors and contractors:
our goal of daily working time will be about 4 hours a day, 20 hours a week until further notice.
We do not declare a holiday: if you are able to ensure more normal working hours, you can be useful to the mission.
However, the world is unpredictable right now, and if you need to take care of your loved ones, shop or consult a doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We're not monitoring your hours.
If you're sick, don't work.
This should go without saying, but we say it.
No sick leave or paid leave is required: simply notify your supervisor and help your team review schedules and time schedules to ensure that the main areas of work are covered.
(If you are diagnosed positive with COVID-19, please advise Bryan from the T&amp;C Ops department that T&amp;C will help you and ensure that your situation receives the necessary attention from management.)
The hourly staff will be fully paid.
We have already announced this, and we reiterate our commitment to honour our responsibilities to our subcontractors and colleagues on schedule.
Everyone will be remunerated on the basis of their usual working hours under normal conditions.
This applies if you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a means of evacuating their stress related to the world around us.
What we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially in times like this.
Once again, the goal is to preserve you.
We simply ask you to contact your superior, so that we know what to expect and can make the necessary arrangements.
Some tasks are considered essential.
There are some things we must continue to do.
The SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Security and Fundraising teams (among others) are doing essential work that may require reinforcement.
We will initiate a process with all departments to assess current objectives and focus on supporting core tasks for our mission.
There is enough work for each of us, we will simply focus on the most essential projects.
Slowing down now won't hurt later.
We do not intend to "work twice as hard to make up for lost time" when the pandemic passes.
We will not ask you to work overtime to meet now unrealistic deadlines.
We recognize that circumstances have changed, and we will strive to establish new objectives and timelines where appropriate.
What about the APA (Annual Planning)?
In order to adapt to our new reality and to the objectives of daily working time, we plan to adjust the schedule for the delivery of our Annual Plan 2020-2021.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan, which provides more time to prepare a budget to allow employees to focus on essential work, take care of themselves and their loved ones while adapting to those who need or want to see their work schedule reduced in the coming weeks.
This extension of deadlines significantly reduces the workload and pressure of current planning across the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Council next week and inform delegates and teams of the next steps upon confirmation.
Thank you to the APP team for your leadership in this regard.
Location, exhibition and cleaning of the office
Last week, we learned that one of our colleagues based in San Francisco may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, as a matter of extreme caution, we used an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces of the San Francisco office.
They used a hospital-grade antiviral solution to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the entrance hall and elevator cages leading to our floor.
The building uses its own due diligence protocol, which uses products that ensure the safety of its tenants.
We are confident that the office will be well prepared when we decide to return.
Our Washington DC office is located in a WeWork premises, which shared with us and all Washington DC based staff its COVID-19 protocol.
Since last week, our Washington DC office has adopted a completely remote configuration according to San Francisco's advice.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we also discussed the idea of renting a building in Brooklyn.
These discussions are continuing but could be postponed.
Some of our colleagues work remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues who are used to distance work are aware that adaptation can be difficult and wanted to offer you some advice:
Reduce the duration of meetings to a maximum of one or two hours.
If longer meetings are required, consider allocating them over several days.
Clearly define the meeting, have an agenda and send the documentation in advance.
Make videos the standard, using tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to encourage collaboration and live exchanges.
Have a coordinator to facilitate each meeting, someone to monitor the instant conversation and the list of speakers, and someone to help take notes (or take collective notes).
Send an e-mail to technical support if you need a comfortable helmet.
Use your wellness refund for snacks.
Join channel #remoties on Slack to talk with your colleagues about work distribution
The HR Operations team is studying webinars-based ergonomic guidelines to support the increased distribution of work within the Foundation.
Last week, we asked all beneficiaries of the Community grant to cancel public events funded by Wikimedia, such as edit-a-thons, until the WHO announced the end of the pandemic.
We have explained to them that we understand that our cancellation requests and other restrictions could make it impossible to carry out their agreed-upon grant activities and that no one would be penalized if these objectives were delayed or changed.
Next week we will publish additional directives on Wikimania and other thematic and regional community conferences.
The general feeling of the international community seems to be both of sadness at the upheaval and of relief at the clarity and possibility of focusing on its own communities, Wikimedia and others.
As for the future, the CRT is working to create a page on Meta-Wiki to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and continue to communicate with them.
Staying in touch despite problems related to COVID-19
We will send an invitation on your calendars for an extraordinary staff meeting next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We will take advantage of this time to share other updates, answer your questions and spend time together.
This situation concerns us all and we are here to help you in any way.
By then, you can always find the information contained in this email, as well as all other essential information related to the VOCID-19, on Office Wiki.
The CRT will update these pages and gather all information in the same place.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with staff members residing in countries that are currently severely affected.
If you have any questions about travel, events, significant workflow or coverage difficulties, or if you need help with anything else, feel free to prevent and work with the CRT.
We are here to support you and provide liaison if necessary.
For any confidential or sensitive questions, please send an e-mail to Bryan Judan, Director of International Global Operations HR.
None of these changes should be seen as abandoning our work and obligations.
On the contrary, it is a question of recognizing that at present our work and our obligations will probably have to adapt in an unprecedented way.
These are the steps we consider necessary to support each other and to be able to continue our work, to provide our movement with the help it needs, and to offer the world the service on which everyone can rely.
Our planned work will be here waiting for us when the time comes.
For now, it is time to help each other and prepare for the important work that will come in weeks and perhaps months to come.
We need each and every one of you to achieve this, which is why you must preserve yourself and take care of your families in order to be able to give the best of yourself when the time comes.
Finally, please: wash your hands and don't touch your face!

b'Angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme (ACE2) is an enzyme linked to the external face (cellular membranes) of the cells of the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney and intestines.
ACE2 against the activity of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and increasing the Ang (1-7) which makes it a promising drug target in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ACE2 is also the point of entry into the cells of some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
The angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme is a metalloenzyme containing zinc on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains an M2 domain of N-terminal peptidase and a C-terminal amino acid transporting collectrine domain.
ACE2 is a type I single-pass membrane protein, the enzyme active domain of which is exposed to the surface of lung cells and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is cleaved from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme called sheddase; the resulting soluble protein is released into the blood stream and finally excreted in the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is connected to the cell membrane mainly of type II lung alveolar cells, enterocytes of the small intestine, arterial and venous endothelial cells, and arterial cells of the smooth muscles of most organs.
The expression of mRNA of ACE2 is also present in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus and brain stem.
The primary function of ACE2 is to compensate for ACE.
ACE cleaves angiotensin I hormone to vasoconstrictive angiotensin II.
ACE2 in turn cleaves phenylamine amino acid at carboxyle end of angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and angiotensin vasodilator hydrolysis (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 may also cleave several other peptides including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apeline, neurotensin, dynorphin A, and ghreline.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane circulation of the neutral amino acid carrier SLC6A19 and is involved in Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 is the main entry point into the cells of some coronaviruses, including HCOV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
Specifically, the binding of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 spicule S1 protein to the enzyme domain of ACE2 to the cell surface results in both endocytosis and translocation of both the virus and enzyme into the endosomes within the cells.
This entry process also requires the initiation of the S protein by host serine protein TMPRSS2, the inhibition of the latter is currently being investigated as a potential treatment. This leads some to believe that reducing the levels of ACE2 in cells can contribute to the fight against infection.
However, several professional companies and regulatory bodies recommended that standard treatment be continued using both ACE inhibitor and ARB.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012 showed that "the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant reduction of 34% in the risk of pneumonia compared to control subjects."
In addition, "the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who had a higher risk of pneumonia, especially stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were less conclusive than for the overall risk of pneumonia."
The human recombinant angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme (rhACE2) is perceived as an innovative treatment for severe lung lesions and appears to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pigs with acute respiratory distress syndrome induced by lipopolysaccharide.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the duration of action is 30 minutes in addition to the duration of effect (duration) of 24 hours.
Several findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for people who are intolerant to conventional renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors or for diseases with high angiotensin II circulation. RhACE2 by infusion has been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
COVID-19 applications are mobile applications designed to facilitate the tracing of contacts in the context of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the identification of people ("contacts") likely to come into contact with an infected individual.
Various applications have been developed or proposed, with official government support in certain territories and jurisdictions.
Several infrastructures have been developed for the design of contact tracing applications.
These systems, in particular those based on the geographic location of application users, raise privacy issues.
There are other less intrusive options, including the use of Bluetooth signals to record a user's proximity to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced the direct integration into their Android and iOS operating systems of a functionality to support these Bluetooth applications.
The Chinese government, in association with Alipay, has deployed an application in China that allows citizens to check whether they have been in contact with people carrying VOCID-19.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities. Singapore, for its part, has opted for an application called TraceTogether.
Developed by a local computer community, it has been provided as an open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia has launched "StopKorona!", a Bluetooth application that tracks exposure to potentially infected people and communicates quickly with health authorities.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was awaiting approval by the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government stated that the contact tracing application was at an advanced stage of development and could be deployed in the coming weeks. A similar application is planned in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand are considering applying the TraceTogether model in Singapore and on the basis of the BlueTrace protocol. Russia wishes to introduce a geo-detection application for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and residing in Moscow to ensure that they do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, professor of safety engineering at the University of Cambridge, referred to a number of possible practical problems related to the use of application-based systems, including false positives and lack of potential effectiveness if only a small part of the population uses the application.
In response to concerns about the spread of false or harmful "coronavirus" applications, Apple only allows "official" or generally trustworthy organizations to add Coronavirus-related applications to the App Store.
Google and Amazon applied similar restrictions.
Privacy activists have expressed concerns about the implications of coronavirus applications for mass surveillance, in particular the possible dismantling of the surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic once the threat is removed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for the limitation of this type of surveillance.
These organizations have set out eight conditions to be met in government projects:
monitoring should be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
the extensions of control and surveillance should include termination clauses;
the use of data should be limited to the objectives of combating COVID-19;
data security and anonymity should be demonstrably protected;
digital surveillance should ensure that there is no exacerbation of discrimination and marginalization;
any sharing of data with third parties should be defined in the law;
protection against abuse and remedies should be provided for citizens in the event of abuse;
the "significant participation" of all "stakeholders concerned" would be mandatory, in particular that of public health experts and marginalized groups. Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF) in Germany have also published checklists.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to address the problem of the persistence of surveillance by removing the tracking mechanism of the operating system of their devices as soon as it is no longer necessary.
Some countries have used a network geolocation system instead of applications, eliminating both the need to download an application and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network tracing has been approved.
Network solutions with access to raw geolocation data present significant potential privacy issues.
However, not all systems based on central servers need access to personal location data; several systems have been created to use central servers only for intercommunication, which allows privacy to be respected (see section below).
In South Korea, a non-application-based system was used for tracing contacts.
Instead of using a dedicated application, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and card transactions, which they then associated with in order to send SMS warnings to potentially infected people.
In addition to the use of this information to alert potential contacts, the Government has also made localization information publicly available, which was permitted as a result of the profound changes to the laws protecting the confidentiality of information following the outbreak of MERS that affected that country.
This information is available to the public through several applications and websites. Countries such as Germany have considered the use of centralized privacy systems.
Details had not yet been provided on 6 April 2020.
The tracing of privacy contacts is a well-established concept, supported by a large volume of research data as early as 2013. On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy solutions, including using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to record a user's proximity to other mobile phones.
However, the PEPP-PT project is a coordination effort that combines centralized and decentralized approaches and does not constitute a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include Decentralized Privacy-Preservation Proximity Tracing (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, formerly called Contact Event Numbers, CEN), Privacy Sensitive Protocols and Mechanisms for Mobile Contact Tracing (PACT), among others.
These protocols ensure that identifiable personal data never leaves the device and that all correspondence is made on the device.
The MIT Media Lab's Privacy Group is currently developing SafePaths, a platform for the use of privacy techniques when collecting and using location or contact data to monitor the spread of COVID-19.
This technique is based on the results of the White Paper "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" published in March 2020. Enigma MPC's SafeTrace platform, a company developing privacy technologies originally founded at MIT Media Lab, is another similar effort.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to enable users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and authorities, without compromising their confidentiality.
On 5 April 2020, the TCN International Coalition was founded by groups based on a common approach and essentially equivalent protocols, in order to reduce fragmentation and ensure global interoperability of tracing and alerting applications, an essential factor in their adoption by a broad public.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced the publication of the source code of the BlueTrace protocol used by its official application.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, which control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative to trace contacts, stating that it would preserve privacy and combine Bluetooth Low Energy technology and a privacy cryptography.
They also published the specifications of the basic technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be deployed in three phases:
deployment of tools to allow governments to create official privacy-friendly coronavirus tracking applications
Direct integration of this feature into iOS and Android. Google and Apple plan to address the issues of adoption of the solution and persistence of surveillance by initially distributing the system through updates of the operating system and subsequently removing it in the same way once the threat is removed.
Repositioning of a drug (also known as reorientation, reprofiling, reassignment or change of therapeutic indication of a drug) refers to the conversion of a drug approved for a disease or for a medical condition other than that for which it was originally developed.
It is a scientific research axis currently being studied to develop safe and effective treatments against COVID-19.
Other research areas include the development of a VOCID-19 vaccine and plasma transfusion of convalescent individuals. SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 therapeutic target proteins, each with several ligand binding sites.
Analysis of these binding sites provides the realistic project to develop an effective antiviral drug against the proteins of COVID-19.
Among the most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are papain-type protease, RNA polymerase RNA dependent, helicase, protein S, and ADP ribose phosphatase.
Hussein A A, et al. studied several candidate compounds that they then optimized and analyzed to determine their structural similarity with the most similar approved drugs to accelerate the development of a potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug in their preclinical study to be recommended in the design of a clinical study.
Chloroquine is an antimalarial medicine also used against certain autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs studied in the Solidarity clinical trial.
The Governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, announced that the New York State chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine trials would begin on March 24th. On March 28th, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under an Emergency U.S. (U.S.) Use Authorization.
Treatment has not been approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is authorized under the EUA only as an experimental treatment for emergency use in hospitalized patients but cannot be treated in a clinical trial.
The CDC stated that "the use, dosage or duration of administration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-COV-2 infection" is not yet established.
Physicians indicated using this medication "when there is no other option".
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Larger studies are underway at Duke University and Oxford University.
The NYU Langone Medical School conducts a safety and effectiveness test for the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen indicated that favipiravir was "clearly effective".
35 patients in Shenzhen were tested negative within an average of 4 days while the duration of the disease was 11 days in the 45 patients who did not receive the disease.
In a study in Wuhan in 240 pneumonia patients, half received favipiravir and the other half received Humifenovir.
The Italian Medicines Agency has reminded the public that the existing evidence in favour of the medicinal product is thin and preliminary.
On 2 April, Germany announced that it would buy the drug in Japan for its reserves and that it would use the army to deliver the drug to university hospitals where the drug would be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has opened up opportunities for the Trump administration to acquire the drug. The drug can be less effective in serious cases of disease where the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or those trying to procreate.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of antivirals lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that "no benefit was observed".
These drugs were designed to inhibit HIV replication by binding to protease.
A team of researchers from the University of Colorado is trying to modify these drugs to find a compound that would link with SARS-CoV-2 protease. There is criticism in the scientific community about the use of resources for repositioning drugs specifically developed for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the International Solidarity trial.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus and Marburg viral infections. Gilead Sciences later discovered that remdesivir had antiviral activity in vitro against several phyloviruses, pneumoviruses, paramyxoviruses and coronaviruses.
One problem with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more severe disease and transmission.
Some early studies prior to the trial suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier against resistance. Several clinical trials are underway, including two conducted by University Hospitals in Cleveland; one involving people with moderate pathology; and the other involving those with more severe forms.
There are three ongoing clinical trials on intravenous vitamin C for people who are hospitalized and seriously ill with COVID-19; two controlled against placebo (China and Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).
New York State started trials on azithromycin antibiotic on March 24, 2020.
The Japanese National Centre for Health and Global Medicine (NCGM) is planning a clinical trial of Teijin alvesco (ciclesonide), an inhalation corticosteroid used for asthma, for the treatment of pre-symptomatic patients infected with the new coronavirus.
A form of angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme, a phase II trial is underway with 200 patients to be recruited from the severe cases hospitalized in Denmark, Germany and Austria to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and pulmonary complications in patients with moderate symptoms of COVID-19.
The study called COLCORONA recruits 6,000 adults 40 years of age and older who have been diagnosed positive with COVID-19 and have moderate symptoms that do not require hospitalization.
Pregnant or lactating women or women who do not have an effective method of contraception are not eligible.
Several anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, which encourages the Italian Medicines Agency to publish guidelines on its use.
A multicentre study of 300 patients studying the use of sodium enoxaparin in preventive and therapeutic dosages was announced in Italy on April 14.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, a large number of researchers have focused on repositioning approved antiviral drugs that have been developed for previous outbreaks such as the MERS, SARS and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Umifenovir: Humifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Some antibiotics have been identified as potentially repositionable as COPID-19 treatments:
tocilizumab (anti-receptor-IL-6): approved by China.
Trials are also underway in Italy and China. See Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
A VOCID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has passed the clinical tests, many attempts at development are underway.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that no vaccine was expected against SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing the disease, for at least 18 months.
In April, five vaccine candidates were undergoing Phase I safety studies.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major epidemic was declared worldwide in 2020, generating significant investments and research to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop potential SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.
Defined in April, the requirements of the CEPI initiative for the development of a vaccine are speed, manufacturing capacity, large-scale deployment and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were conducting research and development projects in early 2020 with the aim of creating an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The main platform targets for Phase I security studies include:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologicals, type 5 adenoviral vector)
As the CEPI scientists stated in April, 115 vaccine candidates in total are in the early stages of development, of which 78 (79 according to the Milken Institute) have been confirmed as active and 37 others announced, but with little public information available (presumed in planning or design).
A Phase I-II trial conducts preliminary safety and immunogenicity tests, is usually randomized, controlled against placebo and performed in several centers while determining more accurate effective doses.
Phase III trials usually involve more participants, including a control group, and test the effectiveness of the vaccine in preventing the disease, while monitoring adverse reactions at the optimal dose.
Of the 79 active development vaccine candidates (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 were not yet in the human person assessment phase (always in "preclinical" research).
Around January 24, 2020, the University of Queensland announced that it was studying the potential of a molecular clamp vaccine that would genetically alter viral proteins to stimulate an immune reaction.

in the development and manufacture of a vaccine.
Partners also announced preclinical testing projects and a Phase I clinical trial by July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that they were working on 11 isolates and that even in accelerated procedures, it would take about a year and a half to two years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, reported developing a coronavirus-like particle through partial funding from Canadian health research institutes.
The vaccine candidate is being researched in the laboratory, with human testing scheduled for July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, the Guardian announced that US President Donald Trump had offered CureVac "strong sums of money to benefit from exclusive access to the VOCID-19 vaccine," which prompted the German government's protest.
On March 17, 2020, US pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with German company BioNTech for the joint development of a mRNA vaccine.
The BNT162 mRNA vaccine candidate is currently in the preclinical phase with the start of clinical trials expected in April 2020.
On 17 March 2020 in Italy, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that it would have preclinical test results in April 2020 and that the human test of its final vaccine candidate could start in the fall.
In France, on March 19, 2020, the Coalition for Innovations in Epidemic Preparedness (CEPI) announced an investment of US$ 4.9 million in a consortium to seek a vaccine against COVID-19 including the Institut Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, bringing the total investment of the CEPI in the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 to US$ 29 million.
The other investment partners of CEPI for the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford and the University of Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health authorities announced that scientists had begun animal testing of six different vaccine candidates.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on March 20, 2020 that they are developing a self-amplifying RNA vaccine against COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days after the sequence was sent by China.
At the end of March, the Canadian government announced funding of $275 million for 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including several vaccine candidates at Canadian companies and universities such as Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.
At about the same time, the Canadian government announced the allocation of $192 million C for the development of a VOCID-19 vaccine with plans to establish a national "vaccine bank" containing several new vaccines that can be used if other coronary virus outbreaks occur.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh Medical School indicated that they tested PittCoVac, a potential vaccine against VOCID-19 in mice, stating that "subunits of micro-needle-administered SARS-CoV-2 S1 vaccines triggered a significant response of antigen-specific antibodies [in mice] observed 2 weeks after immunization."
In Canada, on April 16, 2020, the pharmacy school at the University of Waterloo announced the design of a DNA-based vaccine candidate in the potential form of a nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be designed to replicate in human bacteria to produce virus-like harmless particles that could stimulate the production of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 virus by the immune system.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry and three universities pooled their resources to access IBM supercomputers, combined with cloud-hosted computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterogeneous effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they can offer benefits beyond the disease they prevent.
Another randomized trial in Australia plans to include 4,170 health professionals.
Developing vaccines may not be safe or effective.
Initial research to assess the efficacy of a vaccine using animal models specific to VOCID-19, such as transgenic ACE-2 mice, other laboratory animals, non-human primates, indicates a need for implementation of level 3 biosecurity containment measures for the handling of live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and SRM have been tested on non-human animal models.
In 2020, there is no curative or protective SARS vaccine that has demonstrated both its safety and efficacy in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs to treat SARS was a priority for governments and health agencies around the world.There is no proven vaccine against the MERS.
When the MERS spread, it was thought that existing SARS research could serve as a model for developing vaccines and drugs against MERS-CoV infection.
In March 2020, only one MERS vaccine (based on DNA) had completed Phase I clinical trials in humans and three were ongoing; all vaccines were viral, two adenoviral (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media publications have released a conspiracy theory that the virus that caused COVID-19 was known and that a vaccine was already available.
Patents cited by various social media publications refer to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other coronavirus strains such as SARS coronavirus.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by Coronavirus 2 associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea, sore throat, loss of taste and abdominal pain.
The time between exposure and onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but may range from two to fourteen days.
While the majority of cases cause moderate symptoms, some develop into viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
On 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases were reported worldwide in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered. The virus spreads mainly during proximity contact, often by droplets produced by coughing, sneezing or talking.
Since these droplets are produced upon expiration, they usually fall to the ground or to surfaces rather than represent an infectious risk over long distances.
People can also be infected by touching a contaminated surface, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is the most contagious in the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although contagion is possible before the onset of symptoms and during subsequent stages of the disease. The standard test method uses reverse real-time polymerase chain reaction transcription (RTR-PCR).
The use of masks is recommended for those who think they are infected with the virus and for their caregivers.
Recommendations on wearing masks by the general public vary, with some authorities not recommending their use, others recommending their use, and others imposing their use.
There is currently no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for VOCID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries in the six WHO regions.
People infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or develop flu symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty walking and a blue face or lips; in the presence of these symptoms, it is advisable to consult a doctor immediately.
Less frequently, upper respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, nasal discharge or sore throat may be observed.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea have been observed in varying proportions.
Some cases in China initially presented only chest pressure and palpitations.
In some patients, the disease can cause pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and death.
That's what we call the incubation period.
The incubation period of VOCID-19 is usually five to six days, but may be up to 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of infection. Reports indicate that not all infected people will develop symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers in transmission is not yet fully known, however preliminary evidence suggests that they could contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of infected people who do not have symptoms is currently unknown and is being studied. Korean Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (KCDC) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during hospitalization.
The Chinese National Health Commission began to include asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on 1 April; of the 166 infections found today, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of the test.
Both expectoration and saliva can carry significant viral loads.
Speaking loudly frees up more droplets than speaking normally.
A study in Singapore found that coughing without protection can project droplets at a distance of 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is generally not transported by air, the National Academy of Sciences suggested that bioaerosol transmission could be possible and that air collectors positioned in the corridor outside the patient chambers produced positive samples to viral RNA.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may disperse respiratory secretions and therefore cause air spread.
Although there are concerns about spread by stools, this risk is perceived as low. The virus is the most contagious when people have symptoms; although the spread may be possible before the onset of symptoms, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that if it is not yet known exactly how easily the disease spreads, one person usually contaminates two to three others. The virus survives hours or days on the surfaces.
Specifically, the virus was detected after one day on cardboard, three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and after four hours on 99% copper.
However, this varies according to humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergents are also effective if used properly; soap products degrade the protective lipid layer of the virus, which deactivates it and eliminates it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant) are less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken on average two days after the start of hospitalization.
In five out of six patients, the first sample revealed the highest viral load, while in the sixth patient the highest viral load was on the second day tested.
Coronavirus 2 associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new coronavirus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome, initially isolated in three people with pneumonia related to the outbreak of acute respiratory disease of Wuhan.
All characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in coronaviruses related to nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which breaks its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is a close relative of the original SARS-CoV.
Lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 because the virus accesses host cells through the angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme (ACE2) which is the most abundant in the type II alveolar cells of the lungs.
The virus uses a specific surface glycoprotein called spicule (peplomer) to bind to ACE 2 and enter the host cell.
Acute heart damage has been reported in 12% of patients admitted to Wuhan Hospital, China, and is more common when the disease is more severe.
Cardiovascular symptoms are high due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression, however acute myocardial lesions may also be related to ACE 2 receptors in the heart.
ACE 2 receptors are strongly expressed in the heart and in the cardiac functions involved.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolic disease (25%) was observed in patients in an intensive care unit with infections with COVID-19 and may be associated with an adverse prognosis. Autopsies of individuals who died from COVID-19 showed diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and inflammatory infiltrates containing lymphocytes in the lung.
Although SARS-COV-2 exhibits tropism for respiratory epithelial cells expressing ACE-2, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, GM-CSF secretory T cells were associated with the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes secreting IL6 and severe lung disease in patients with COVID-19.
Lymphocyte infiltrates were also reported at the autopsy.
WHO has published several test protocols for the disease.
The standard test method uses reverse real-time polymerase chain reaction transcription (RTR-PCR).
The test is usually performed on respiratory samples obtained by rhinopharyngeal sampling; however, nasal sampling or expectoration may also be used.
The results are usually available in a few hours, or even up to two days.
Blood tests can also be used, however they require two blood samples taken at two weeks apart and the results are of little immediate value.
Chinese scientists have been able to isolate a strain of the coronavirus and have published the genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world have been able to develop independent chain polymerization reaction tests (PCR) to detect virus infection.
On April 4, 2020, antibody tests (which could detect active infections and a person's previous infection) were under development, but not yet widely used.
The Chinese experience of the test revealed a precision of only 60-70%.
The FDA in the United States approved the first test as close as possible to the patient on March 21, 2020 to be used at the end of this month. Diagnosis guidelines published by the Zhongnan Hospital at Wuhan University suggest methods for detecting infections based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
Multi-lobarian depoli glass opacities with peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution are typical symptoms visible at the onset of infection.
Pleural dominance, crazy paving (interlobular septal thickening with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation may occur with disease progression.
Few data are available on microscopic lesions and the pathophysiology of VOCID-19.
The main pathological findings at autopsy are:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary oedema
Four types of viral pneumonia severity may be observed:
moderate pneumonia: pulmonary oedema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, extensive atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration and formation of multinuclear giant cells
severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudates.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
Healing pneumonia: organization of exudates in alveolar cavities and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIVC); leuco-erythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, frequently washing your hands with water and soap for at least 20 seconds, good breathing hygiene and avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends that you cover your mouth and nose with a handkerchief when coughing or sneezing and use the inside of the elbow in the absence of a handkerchief.
Correct hygiene of the hands after coughing or sneezing is recommended.
The CDC recommended that the face be covered with fabric in public places, in order to limit transmission in case of asymptomatic individuals. Social distance strategies are aimed at reducing the contact of people infected with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, reducing travel and cancelling large groups of people.
The distance guidelines also include respect for a minimum distance of 6 feet (1.8 m) between people.
There is no drug known to be effective in preventing VOCID-19. Since a vaccine is not expected before 2021 at the earliest, a key element in the management of VOCID-19 is to try to reduce the epidemic peak, which is also called "flatten the curve".
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after having been in the toilet or when their hands are visibly dirty; before eating; and after having blushed, coughed, or sneezed.
It also recommends the use of a disinfectant solution for alcohol-based hands containing at least 60% alcohol, but only if water and soap are not available. For areas where disinfectants for commercial hands are not available, WHO proposes two formulas for local production.
In these formulae, antimicrobial activity is derived from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol, it is not "an antiseptic active substance for the hands".
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
People are treated with supportive care that may include water treatment, oxygen therapy, and support for other vital organs affected.
The CDC recommends that people suspected of carrying the virus wear a simple facial mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to treat respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being analysed.
Personal hygiene, a healthy lifestyle and diet were recommended to promote immunity.
Supportive treatments may be useful for those with moderate symptoms at the early stage of infection. WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have issued recommendations for the care of inpatients for VOCID-19.
Reinvigorating physicians and pneumologists in the United States gathered therapeutic recommendations from several agencies in a free resource, the IBCC.
In April 2020, there was no specific treatment for COVID-19.
With respect to symptoms, some health professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) rather than ibuprofen in the first line.
Precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in conditions of care when performing procedures can generate aerosols, such as intubation or manual ventilation.
For health care professionals who care for people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends placing the person in an isolation room adapted to air infection (AIR) in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions and air transmission precautions. The CDC highlights the guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
The recommended equipment is: PPE blouse, respiratory or facial mask, eye protection and medical gloves. If available, respiratory masks (face masks) are preferred.
The N95 respiratory masks are approved under industrial conditions, but the FDA has authorized the use of these masks under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect aerial particles such as dust, but their effectiveness against specific biological agents is not guaranteed for unspecified uses.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends using facial protection screens, or as a last resort, handcrafted masks.
The majority of cases of VOCID-19 are not severe enough to require mechanical ventilation or other alternatives, but a certain percentage of cases are.
The type of respiratory assistance for people with COPID-19-related respiratory failure is actively studied for inpatients. There is evidence that intubation can be avoided by using a high-speed nasal cannula or positive double-level respiratory pressure.
It is not known whether one or both of them generate the same benefits for people in a critical state.
Some physicians prefer to stick to invasive mechanical ventilation when available because this technique limits the diffusion of aerosol particles compared to a high-speed nasal cannula. Serious cases are more common in older adults (those over 60 years of age, and especially those over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds per person, limiting the ability of the care system to treat a sudden spike in the number of cases of COVID-19 that are serious enough to require hospitalization.
A study in China showed that 5% of cases were admitted to intensive care, 2.3% needed respiratory assistance and 1.4% died.
In China, approximately 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 are finally admitted to intensive care.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex with the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ADDS) during COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes more difficult.
Ventilation devices providing pressure control modes and high PEEP are required to optimize oxygen delivery and minimize the risk of lung injury associated with ventilation and pneumothorax.
High PEEP may not be available on older ventilation appliances.
The search for potential treatments started in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are being tested in clinical trials.
The remixer seems to be the most promising.
Although new drugs may not be developed before 2021, several drugs in the course of testing are already approved in other indications and tests are already advanced.
An antiviral medicine can be tried in people with severe illness.
WHO recommended that volunteers participate in trials on the efficacy and safety of potential treatments. The FDA granted temporary plasma authorization to convalescent individuals as experimental treatment in cases where the person's life is seriously or immediately threatened.
He was not subjected to the necessary clinical trials to demonstrate his safety and efficacy for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application to manage the epidemic.
Users are asked to enter their name and an identifier.
The application is able to detect "close contacts" using surveillance data and therefore detect a potential risk of infection.
Each user can also control the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the application does not only recommend auto-quarantine, it also alerts local health authorities. The analysis of massive data from mobile phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone location and artificial intelligence are used to locate infected people and people with whom they have been in contact in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to locate mobile phone data of people suspected of having the coronavirus.
The aim of the measure was to ensure that quarantine was respected and to protect persons who may have been in contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared aggregated phone location data with the German federal government agency, the Robert Koch Institute, in order to analyse and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia has deployed facial recognition technology to detect people who do not respect quarantine.
In Italy, Regional Health Minister Giulio Gallera said he was informed by mobile operators that "40% of people continue to travel".
The German government conducted a 48-hour hackathon weekend with more than 42,000 participants.
Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid called on the world to find creative solutions to prevent the spread of coronavirus.
People may suffer from quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, "increased social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic recession are a perfect cocktail to harm people's mental health and well-being."
The disease may develop moderately with little or no symptoms, similar to other common respiratory diseases such as cold.
Moderate cases usually recover within two weeks, while severe or critical cases require three to six weeks.
Pregnant women may have a higher risk of severe infection with COVID-19 based on similar virus data, such as SARS and MERS, however there is a lack of data for COVID-19. In some cases, COVID-19 may affect the lungs and cause pneumonia.
In the most severely affected cases, COVID-19 can progress rapidly to an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) causing respiratory failure, septic shock or multivisceral failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, coagulation disorders, and cardiac, renal and hepatic lesions.
Coagulation disorders, in particular an increase in prothrombin time, have been reported in 6% of cases hospitalized with COVID-19, with renal impairment in 4% of patients in this group.
Approximately 20 to 30% of people with VOCID-19 have a high rate of liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the average time between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, five of which were hospitalized.
However, patients transferred to intensive care had an average duration of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In a study of early cases, the mean duration between onset of symptoms and death was 14 days, with a total range of six to 41 days.
In a study by the Chinese National Health Commission (NHC), men had a mortality rate of 2.8% while women had a mortality rate of 1.7%.
Histopathological examinations of postmortem lung samples present diffuse alveolar damage with fibromyxoid cell exudates in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes have been observed in pneumocytes.
The image of the lung resembles an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the Chinese National Health Commission, heart damage due to high troponin levels or cardiac arrest was observed.
According to March data from the United States, 89 per cent of hospitalized individuals had pre-existing conditions, and the availability of medical resources and socio-economic conditions in a region may also have an impact on mortality.
Estimates of the mortality rate of the disease vary due to these regional differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
The undercounting of moderate cases can lead to over-valuation of mortality rates.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of previously contracted cases may indicate that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to develop severe symptoms of COVID-19 and were 2.4 times more likely to go into intensive care or die than non-smokers, and concerns were also raised about the long-term sequelae of the disease.
Hospital administration in Hong Kong has seen a 20 to 30 per cent drop in respiratory capacity in some people who are cured of the disease, and lung scanners suggest organic lesions.
This can also lead to an intensive post-care syndrome after healing.
By March 2020, it was unknown whether a previous infection had effective long-term immunity in people cured of the disease.
Immunity is considered probable, based on the behaviour of other coronaviruses, but cases of individuals cured of COVID-19 followed by positive coronavirus tests at a later date have been reported.
These cases are considered to be an aggravation of a latent infection rather than a reinfection.
The virus is thought to be natural and of animal origin, by spreading the infection.
The actual origin of the virus is unknown, but in December 2019 the spread of the infection was almost exclusively led by a man-to-man transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of VOCID-19 published in January 2020 in The Lancet revealed that the earliest date of onset of symptoms dates back to December 1, 2019.
Official WHO publications indicated the first onset of symptoms on December 8, 2019.
Several measures are generally used to assess mortality.
These figures vary regionally and over time, and are influenced by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, therapeutic options, the time since the onset of the epidemic, as well as demographic characteristics such as age, gender and health status.
At the end of 2019, WHO assigned emergency disease codes CIM-10 U07.1 for laboratory-confirmed deaths of SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 for deaths of cases of COVID-19 diagnosed from a clinical or epidemiological point of view without laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The death/case ratio reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a given time interval.
According to statistics from Johns-Hopkins University, the global death/case ratio is 6.9% (153 822/2 240 191) as at 17 April 2020.
This number varies by region. Other measures include the lethality rate (CFR) which reflects the percentage of diagnosed individuals who die from the disease and the infectious lethality rate (IRF) which reflects the percentage of infected people (diagnosed or not) who die from a disease.
These statistics are not limited in time and follow a specific population of contamination at the end of the disease.
Although not all infected people develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies may indicate the number of people who have been infected.
In the epicentre of the epidemic in Italy, in Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600 inhabitants, 80 of them (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease has spread through festivals, and to young people, generating a relatively low mortality rate, and not all deaths related to COVID-19 may have been officially classified as such.
In addition, the German health system has not been overwhelmed.
In the Netherlands, approximately 3% of people may have antibodies, according to an assessment of blood donors.
69 deaths (0.004% of the population) were confirmed as related to COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and the mortality rate are different in men and women.
Mortality is higher in humans in studies in China and Italy.
The risk is highest among 50-year-old men, with the difference between men and women disappearing only at the age of 90.
In China, the death rate was 2.8% for men and 1.7% for women.
The specific reasons for this gender difference are unknown, but genetics and behavioural factors may be part of it.
Immunological differences by sex, lower prevalence of smoking in women and development in men of comorbidities such as lower age hypertension than in women may have contributed to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of infected individuals were men and 72% of people who died from COVID-19 were men.
In April 2020, the U.S. government did not collect data related to the type of infection with COVID-19.
Studies have shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
A higher percentage of health personnel, especially nurses, are women and are at increased risk of being exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of the disease would be "COVID-19".
WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO means corona, VI means virus and D means disease, 19 being the first identification of the epidemic: 31 December 2019.
This name has been chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (e.g. China), an animal species or a group of people, in accordance with international nomenclature recommendations to prevent stigmatization. The virus causing COVID-19 is called coronavirus 2 related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses "VOID-19 virus" and "VOID-19 virus" in its public communication.
The disease and virus are both commonly referred to as "coronavirus".
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were often referred to as "coronavirus" and "coronavirus of Wuhan".
In January 2020, WHO recommended the use of provisional 2019-nCov disease names and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease for virus and disease, in accordance with the 2015 Directive against the use of sites in disease and virus names.
Official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were published on 11 February 2020.
Given the capacity limitations of standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers print care equipment such as swabs and respirator parts.
For example, when an Italian hospital needed an emergency respirator valve and the supplier could not supply it in a timely manner, a local start-up designed and printed the required 100 valves in one night.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, false information and disinformation emerged about the origin, extent, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease and quickly spread online.
It seems that man is able to spread the disease to some other animals.
Studies have not been able to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No medication or vaccine is approved to treat the disease.
International research on vaccines and drugs against COVID-19 is currently being conducted by government organizations, academic groups and industrial researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the "SOLIDARITY test" to assess the therapeutic effects of four existing antiviral compounds with the most promising efficacy.
There is no vaccine available, but several agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is being used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 both use the ACE 2 receptor to penetrate human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are being investigated.
First, researchers are trying to create an entire virus vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, is intended to induce a rapid immune response of the human body in the event of a new infection with COVID-19.
A second strategy, subunit-based vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this research focuses on the spiked S protein that helps the virus infiltrate the ACE 2 enzyme receptor.
A third strategy is that of vaccines based on nucleic acids (DNA or RNA vaccination, a new technique for creating vaccination).
Experimental vaccines from all of these strategies should be tested in terms of safety and effectiveness. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains an inoffensive genetic code copied on the virus that causes the disease. Antibody-dependent activation has been suggested as a potential challenge in developing a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, but it is controversial.
In April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials are underway.
Seven trials evaluated already approved treatments for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Reconverted antiviral drugs constitute the majority of Chinese research, with nine Phase III clinical trials on resuscitating it in several countries whose reports are expected at the end of April.
A dynamic clinical development analysis of vaccine and drug candidates for VOCID-19 was also in place in April 2020. Several existing antiviral drugs are evaluated in the treatment of VOCID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir associated with interferon beta.
Provisional data suggest the effectiveness of remdesivir in March 2020.
Clinical improvements have been observed in patients treated with remdesivir for compassionate use.
Phase III clinical trials are ongoing in the United States, China and Italy. Chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, some require an independent analysis of the research.
The Chinese and Korean health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Virology Institute, although recommending a daily dose of one gram, indicates that twice that dose is highly dangerous and could be fatal.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine under an emergency use authorization at the discretion of physicians treating patients with COVID-19. The 7th edition of the Chinese directives also includes interferon, ribavirin or Humifenovir against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are required to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended for continuation of an in vivo study after demonstrating a low concentration inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that the initial spicule protein initiated with transmembrane serine 2 protease (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 via interaction with the ACE 2 receptor.
Studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have major limitations that have prevented the medical community from adopting these treatments without further studies. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokinic shock may be a complication at later stages of severe COPID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have cytokinic shock-resistant properties. Tocilizumab was included in the treatment guidelines by the Chinese National Health Commission after a small study was conducted.
It is currently in the course of a non-randomized phase 2 test at the national level in Italy after showing positive results in people with a severe form of the disease.
Associated with a serum ferritin blood test to identify cytokinic shock, it must counteract such developments that are suspected to cause the death of some affected persons.
The interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA on the basis of retrospective case studies for the treatment of refractory cytokine refractory syndrome to steroids induced by a different cause, CAR T cell treatment, in 2017.
To date, there is no randomized, controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
The transfer of concentrated and purified antibodies produced by immune systems from people who have cured VOCID-19 to people who need it is being studied as a non-vaccination method of passive immunization.
This strategy has been tested for SARS with little conclusive results.
Viral neutralization is the expected mode of action by which passive antibody-based treatment can generate a defence against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms such as antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibiotic treatment, e.g. using monoclonal antibodies manufactured, are being developed.
The production of serum of convalescent people, consisting of the liquid part of the blood of cured patients and containing specific antibodies against this virus, could be increased for faster deployment.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, who then contracted COVID-19 and died of it after drawing attention to the spread of the virus.
