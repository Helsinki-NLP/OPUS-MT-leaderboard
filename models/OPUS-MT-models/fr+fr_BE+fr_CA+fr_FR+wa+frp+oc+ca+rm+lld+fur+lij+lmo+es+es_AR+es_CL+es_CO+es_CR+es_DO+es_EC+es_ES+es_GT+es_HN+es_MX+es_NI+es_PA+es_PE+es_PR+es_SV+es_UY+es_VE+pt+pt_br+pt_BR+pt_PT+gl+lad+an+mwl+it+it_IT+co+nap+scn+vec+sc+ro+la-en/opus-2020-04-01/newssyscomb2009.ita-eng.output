The triumph of right-wing populists in Austria: in total they have 29%
The visible weakening of both existing parties in the great coalition and this marked strengthening of the right-wing populist parties led, according to the first provisional results, to the early parliamentary elections in Austria on Sunday.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), in which the position of current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously wavering, has suffered particularly strong losses.
On the contrary, the electoral leader of the Union for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the deputy prefect of Kärnten Jörg Haider, is preparing for a triumphal return to national politics.
According to the provisional results, the country's strongest party remains the socio-democratic party (SPÖ) with 29.8% of the votes, compared to the last elections in 2006, but loses 5.5%.
Even worse for ÖVP, which loses by 25.6% almost 9% of the votes.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in the Austrian post-war history and above all the literally catastrophic result of the popular, which provoked early elections.
Even at the beginning of July, when the ÖVP abandoned the coalition, the popular had a considerable advantage in preference to SPÖ.
But the voters evidently punished them because they had the government sunk.
Already in the first reactions to the results there were speculations about the possible resignation of the party president, Deputy Chancellor Wilhelm Monterer.
The observers believe that this could happen on Monday during the extraordinary convening of the party's leadership.
This development should perhaps facilitate the path towards the ever more likely exit from the election result, i.e. towards the renewal of the SPÖ and ÖVP coalition.
With regard to the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - the Liberals (FPÖ) gained 18% in advance and the BZÖ 11% in votes - but the socio-democratics revealed at the same time the concern of another 1999, when the populists agreed with the populars to the collective government, (then the FPÖ was still united, in 2005 it separated from the BZÖ) that it was even the cause of sanctions by the Euopean Union.
On this evolution Haider obviously plays, which has already stated that he is ready to cooperate with any party and assumes a return to Vienna in national politics.
The Green Party has also managed to join Parliament, but it has fallen slightly, down between the Austrian political parties from third to fifth.
No other party has clearly exceeded the 4% threshold and has not entered Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can cool down
If the problem could not be solved with the Czech scientists who were accused of the illegal collection of beetles in India, according to the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, a certain cooling of the Czech-Indian relations would occur.
The Minister mentioned this in New York after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If it were not to be resolved, then there would be some cooling," he noted after the meeting which took place on Czech initiative.
Mukherjee after the negotiations said that executive power can hardly interfere in legal matters.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was acquitted by the charge and punished by a fine, the central government can negotiate with the local government in Dardjeeling, which falls under its jurisdiction.
"Your problem could be solved," the Minister said.
According to Mukherjee, it would be better, for Emil Kučera sentenced to three years in prison, to resort to a higher instance.
Then he can ask for bail and wait for the sentence to be released.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that, his partner expressed himself in the same way during the negotiations.
"Recommends the appeal to the Major Court then it will be possible to obtain grace," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way in which the Czech side can get into this is to provide the convicted with "competent legal support", the Indian Minister said.
At the same time, he said that such support is already being given by the Indian side.
"We have the greatest interest in maintaining the best relations that have been going on with India for many years.
The Indians also admit this," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he said to ČTK, in front of his partner he stressed that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really consider the imprisonment and accusation of these Czech scientists to be a profound error," he said.
The minister avoided answering the question whether he had obtained a promise from the Indian side to deal with the matter.
"I've got a lot of promises," he just said.
A Czech judge in the battle for the seabed
It approaches the electronic map on the wall on which Australia and adjacent marine areas are drawn.
But he is not interested in the continent but at a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to ‘ Australia and together with it the adjacent seabed.
The area is at the same time as the continent itself, says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of a team of 33 OSN Division workers for ocean issues and maritime rights.
His boss, Czech Division Director Lawyer Václav Mikulka, is following his exhibit and occasionally adds something.
It dominates the desire to work and enthusiasm.
The seabed still hides a little-known world rich in natural resources.
It is possible to find oil, metal minerals and other minerals, but also living organisms unknown so far that carry within themselves the key to the discovery of cancer medicine.
The largest bottom of the mainland
Coastal states have begun to pay attention to submarine territory.
According to the OSN Convention, they take advantage of the laws on which they made an agreement in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
This is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often extends up to several hundred kilometres from the coast of the state in question.
According to the Convention, this has an exclusive right over all the resources of the continental shelf.
"In short, for a continental shelf, we mean that part of the seabed and its subsoil, which is a natural extension of the continent under the sea.
The so-called exclusive economic zone extends beyond the territorial sea often over 200 nautical miles," explains Mikulka.
The request for which the country submits to the Commission for the definition of the size of the continental shelf must be accompanied by a very broad technical and scientific documentation based on many expensive surveys and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparation.
"One of our tasks is to provide the Commission with legal and technical-professional assistance.
The committee has so far dealt with five requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only the last three nominees have been successful," adds Mikulka.
The recent success of Australia, which has greatly expanded its marine possessions, has recorded a global echo.
But also New Zealand has gained us - the surface of the seabed, which was assigned to it by the commission last week, of about 1.6 square kilometers so more or less six times larger than the state itself.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in research.
The profit, which will grow in the future from the seabed, as promised will be inestimable.
Other states will also gradually submit their requests.
They can do so for ten years since the Montego Bay Convention has been ratified.
Where the continental shelf ends, the area of the bottom of the ocean that the convention has declared a common heritage of humanity begins."
No one here has an exclusive position.
The right of extraction in this area is granted by this international institution established by the Convention.
"But the Marine Foundation is not Klondike," says Director Mikulka, exaggerating, "with the fact that its individual parties are legally demarcated and their contractually established regime."
Czechs in the Pacific
A part of the seabed today also belongs to the Czech Republic.
If it divides it with other states of the former Soviet bloc within the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
This acquired in 1991 according to the convention, as well as investors from a few other states, the status of so-called "pioneer investor".
It has the right to extract in the ClarionClipperton area in the extended Pacific Ocean between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area explored by the investor and little larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is smashed, it's an almost underwater replica of Tatry.
"It is possible to extract from the total area of 75 000 square kilometers.
The area is a deposit rich in polymetallic agglomerations containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," explains another Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan.
A worker from the Macedonia division Rober Sandev brings with him a find to show it.
It looks like a small potato or with a bit of fantasy, a legendary scheme, as in the legend of the awakening of the Golem.
German special units were present at the liberation of the hostages
The Egyptian government had requested help from Germany for the release of the hostages – the experts then arrived.
When the situation became critical, the special units were ready, but they did not intervene.
On the circumstances of the release of the 11 European hostages kidnapped, more and more detailed information comes to us.
The German special units participated in the rescue operation mentioned by the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
In addition to the army specialists, the GSG9 units, the Federal Air Police, the Federal Criminal Office and the logistics experts of the technical institution were present on the spot.
As the spokesman for the ministries said on Monday evening, German units did not intervene because the kidnappers, given the danger of force intervention, released the hostages fleeing.
The Egyptian government accepted the aid offered by the Germans, to join as assistance directly on the spot.
"We didn't make it by luck," says a spokesman for the interior ministry.
Aggressors kidnapped on September 19 in southern Egypt a group of travelers: 5 Germans, 5 Italians, a Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian companions.
After the kidnapping in a desert area in southern Egypt, the hostages were deported to the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers to the end remained secret as well as the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
The freed in the meantime have arrived in good condition in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the freed hostages are under the protection of the German embassy.
He didn't explain himself about the details of the release.
There was no information in Berlin until they returned to Germany.
According to the newspaper "Bild" the 5 vacationers and the special units should depart in flight with an Airbus of the military aircraft and arrive on Tuesday in Germany.
American representative chamber rejects the rescue package.
The first chamber of the American Congress has just failed the $700 billion bailout package for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones fell down.
With 206 voices around 227 the US representative house rejected the government's bailout package for the financial markets.
Despite the appeals of American President George W. Bush and leading politicians of both parties, there had not been a majority for the programme, with which the chaos of the financial markets should have been stemmed.
In a dramatic action the supporters have desperately tried, to persuade critics from the heavy package of $700 billion.
Barney Frank, one of the negotiating leaders, encouraged the consensus MPs, even though the plan was unpopular.
8. It is difficult to have gratitude to avoid something, which has not yet arrived..
While the vote was in progress, the Dow Jones fell more than 6% or 600 points.
The reason for the investors' concerns was that the state rescue package could have failed.
It resumed before the end of the vote and then, after the announcement of the bankruptcy, collapsed again.
Experts now expect further serious turbulence on the international financial markets.
In order to ensure that the programme enters into force, it must have the benefit of both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate.
Promoters record increasing numbers of bookings
It seems that it will be a good winter for German tour operators:
According to one study, the turnover on travel bookings for the next few months compared to the previous year has clearly increased - for the winter season even more than 30%.
Despite weak conjuncture views the desire to travel by Germans according to an investigation remains firm.
On reservations for the winter season the travel agencies recorded an increase in turnover of 31 % compared to the same period of the previous year, as the German association for tourism DRV announced in Berlin on Monday.
According to the survey of the GfK market research institute there are increased reservation quotas even for the autumn months.
So the surplus of travel agencies for October compared to 2007 would be around 11%, the DRV reported.
Presumed for these results are the figures of the GfK, which monthly analyzes the booking data of 1200 German travel agencies and develops statistical projections for the entire market.
Also included would be travel reservations made until the end of August 2008.
Due to the low price of the dollar, requested in particular would be travel to the United States, the DRV reported.
Here the increase of reservations would amount to about a third.
They would also be particularly popular destinations in Germany, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as in Germany.
Especially all inclusive travel has a high rating, explained DRV President Klaus Laepple.
Considering the rising costs for energy and food, the costs in this case would be "better calculable for customers than for a individually organized holiday".
Consumers could save money through, among others, discounts for reservations made in advance or offers with everything included, Laepple explained.
Even the summer months would have recorded excellent booking figures, so much so that compared to the year before there would again have been a surplus of turnover - even if according to a further study the number of Germans who took a trip, in comparison to the year before has dropped.
My first time at the Oktoberfest
Hits by Ballermann, one-litre bottled beer and vip in Dirndln scratched.
A debut at Wiesn
Susanne Kronzucker and I actually don't have much in common.
She is blonde, television moderator and wears a custom-made Dirndl.
I have dark hair, I'm a student and my dress is second-hand.
But one thing is common: just 3 minutes at the Wiesn, the photographers already throw themselves at us and take pictures until they fill the memory of the cameras – very flattering, and this on my first visit to the Wiesn.
That's how you make friends.
The two-dollar Dirndl seems to achieve its purpose.
As a Wiesn tourist and actually residing north of the white sausage equator, the sense of well-being in the costume/dress to date is still within bounds.
And instead, once you've arrived at Theresienwiese, it's nothing serious.
Almost everyone wears Dirndl or leather pants; no one looks disgusted or embarrassed – all perfectly normal.
Only my Dirndl's apron collects strange looks at the chocolate banana stand.
A monastic points out to me that I would tie the apron wrongly: "On the left you are free, on the center you are virgin, on the right you are busy, behind the widow."
I blow my bow from the back to the left.
All right," he says and laughs.
Others make less wasteful of subtle flirting techniques and wear sober felt hats, on which it heads "To drunk to get dressed!" and stretch the bare back against an uninvited one.
The boy with exhibitionist inclinations is called Bob, comes from England and he also visits the Oktoberfest for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous", with a "oooooo."
This tells me, after he got rid of his bottle of beer from a liter earlier.
Right next to one of these hydrants, which everyone thinks is a pattumera.
Bob is one of these notorious "Wildbiesler".
Others are not lucky enough to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At about 8 o'clock in the evening the health workers walk in the piazza of the feast, who must take care of the poor beons.
The nurses appear every time in a pack – always 4 at a time drag a stretcher covered with tents into a tent.
This works as with most Wiesn visitors: you go empty, you come back full.
Whoever lies under the curtain in this alcohol-in-the-blood coffin, you can't see.
"Des sind die, wos goarnimmer packn," one of the health workers yells at me and disappears into the coffin.
Victims of an incident identified by the police
A 63-year-old woman who died in the hospital after being hit by a vehicle while walking in Essex was identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the accident on Friday afternoon on Shenfield Road in the city.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital, Romford, but died shortly afterwards.
After the accident a 51-year-old man was arrested on the charge of reckless driving.
He was released on bail.
Turkey is widening diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey tried to join the European Union, the European powers were anxious to penetrate deep into the Turkish hinterland.
On the eastern part of the Bosphorus, perhaps 20 steps in Asia, is one of the most beautiful relics of this failed imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha train station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in neo-renaissance style.
This is at least what the tour guides tell you.
The building stands between the end of the platforms with a tower on each of its corners looking to the world like some German provincial municipalities.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building is slightly decaying.
But once inside the ticket office from the ceiling at a time, there is no doubt about the size of the enterprise of what was the westernmost passage.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a retard to the imperial game, wanted to realize its ambitions to dominate the Middle East through this railroad running in Damascus, Baghdad and beyond in what is now Saudi Arabia.
But Germany's imperial ambitions sank during World War I.
His railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
Its isolation from the surrounding region, generated by the icy borders of the cold war, has passed
British and dominant forces marched out of Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
And there was bad news for Hyderpasha station as well.
In 1917 a ammunition train exploded destroying its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then he has been slowly disbanding, largely overtaken by history.
But today, this railway outlet for Anatolia and all the points to the east, serve - at least symbolically - to highlight Turkey's increasingly large diplomatic horizons.
The ruling party of Justice and Development - the AKP - has created an entire new foreign policy for the country.
Its isolation from its surrounding regions, generated by the icy borders of the cold war, has passed.
Now there is a new policy of commitment.
Significantly, the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
To estimate the parameters of this new foreign policy, I boarded the sleeping car for the Turkish capital Ankara, to visit one of the leading foreign policy experts of the AKP, Turkish deputy Suat Kinikioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a run to stilts along the tracks that produced the cadences from the ancient world of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital - proposed as a new city for a secular state intended to turn away from its Ottoman past.
But the AKP with its well-known Islamic roots represents an exemplary shift in Turkish consensus.
He suggested some suspects in the West, more notably in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the headquarters of the AKP, an ultra-modern structure of stone and steel - built ad hoc - in a developing suburb, surrounded by medium-built malls and power pastry shops, where managers in full business - both men and women - meet to make early morning contracts.
Suat Kinikioglu could be a centre-right politician from almost any other political party in Europe.
Complete, tie, I'm sure he also had a Blackberry.
"The purpose of the foreign policy party now is to reintegrate Turkey with its closest neighbours.
The cold war was an anomaly," she tells me.
Turkey has been cut off from its hinterland.
Today you have to look east and west at the same time.
It wasn't the case with one or the other.
They must be both.
"But surely at some point, "I ask, "will Turkey be forced to decide?"
"Turkey," he says, "doesn't want where to face that choice."
Then he points out a point that almost everyone I have spoken to here has recited in memory: the links of not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus, and all around the Black Sea, are of benefit to Europe and the United States as they are to Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be, Europe as a whole can metaphorically travel those railway lines east through Asia and the Middle East.
Again at Hydarpasha station, after another night in white, I think of those two German gentlemen Herr Ritter and Herr Conu who had looked at this building built 100 years ago.
How surprised they would be to find that Europe's Middle East ambitions can now be largely in the hands of Turkey.
And while I wait at the ferry terminal that brings me back through the Bosphorus, I remember that those days Turkey was always called "the sick man of Europe".
Then at least there seemed to be no doubt as to which continent to advance on this fascinating country.
Remember: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: as musical director of Guildford since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (necrology, September 11) had in charge of the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and choir.
As a member of his music scheme for the municipality, the following year he founded his wonderful youth choir, Proteus.
They were supposed to be under-21/under the age of 21, but at the time that Proteus sang his final in 1979, many of us were more than twenty - we simply refused to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological being-mutable) represented the good will of the choir and the ability to face everything that the music presented to do, both madrigal and Messiaen, without accompaniment or with the whole orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often amazing, always exciting, and it was all because of the inspiration of that man and enthusiasm for the music that remained absolutely constant throughout the years.
How often we were told by Tod to "let music speak for itself."
He said: "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all there in the music.
So sing it!"
His technique in the use of the wand was absolutely clear and precise, although never dictatorial nor flowered.
Whatever the musical standard was, it made it more and more elevated.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If you were to appoint a knight, an orchestra director would have been Vernon Handley.
I knew him very well during the two decades he led the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Over the past 40 years and over I have covered more than 100 of his concerts and I can honestly say that I have never disagreed with one of them - and many times inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of greatness and personal modesty.
He hated conductors who, in his words, simply "walked around the world one or two well-known battle horses".
There's gonna be so many of us missing.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary by William Woodruff (September 25) states that "in 1946 he resumed his economic history at Oxford and in 1950 he became a researcher at Houblon-Norman... while studying for a degree in science, a degree in letters and a PhD".
This follows from Woodruff's note in Beyond Nab End, but is not correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a university professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, at which time he completed a PhD thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J. D. Chambers, and later published in 1958 as The British Rubber Industry.
He spent 1950-51 in the U.S. as a researcher in Houblon-Norman, and the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham permanently for Illinois.
Because Woodruff chose to cover this part of his career, you don't know.

"Raising the exhibition of José Vicente Resino "Flamenco y vida", because his photographs in black and white, in documentary style, are extraordinary.
They have drawn my attention to the simplicity and strength they transmit, while treating the protagonists with particular respect.
An exhibition that conveys a lot of feeling.
Resino manages to capture magical moments."
Second assault on Honda supersales
In November, Honda will start marketing the second generation of the Jazz model.
If the previous model was already equipped with a large habitability, this new minivan has an even wider interior space.
In addition, a refined mechanics is needed, which increases driving comfort and saves fuel.
Evolution against revolution.
This is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Jazz has a line very similar to that of the previous model, the changes in this monovolume are numerous.
Among others, it is worth noting an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
However, before proceeding to analyze the new model, it is useful to note that this new Jazz arrives six years after entering the first generation market.
Therefore, a first observation is that Honda has renewed this model in shorter times than those used by other producers.
Although the Jazz model in Europe is less well known than in other markets, it remains a unique phenomenon in terms of sales.
This is exactly the case in Japan, where Jazz was the most sold car in 2002 and also during this 2008.
Just in Japan, almost a million Jazz units have been sold since the launch.
The second market was that of the Old Continent, with about half a million units in six years.
Despite these numbers, Honda believes that the new Jazz will increase sales in the segment.
Thus, if in 2007 the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 units of this model, for 2009 the estimates are around 100,000 cars, assuming a 17% increase in sales in the European market.
As far as the Spanish market is concerned, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 Jazz units since 2002, accounting for 6.7% of Honda's total sales in Spain.
As far as the new generation is concerned, those responsible for the Spanish branch expect to sell around 2,000 Jazz units over a year.
Just the arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to reduce sales in Spain to a good extent.
In fact, the company's managers expect to arrive at the end of the year with a total of 22,000 units sold, 4,000 less than in 2007, with a decrease of 16%.
Despite the increase in sales, Honda has increased its market share in Spain to 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
In addition, Japanese society expects to reach 2% in 2010.
In order to do this, Honda trusts another new model to arrive.
It's Insight, a compact five-door hybrid - 4.37 meters long - of which Japanese society hopes to sell about 200,000 units a year around the world.
For the markets and according to estimates made by the Japanese producer, 50% of Insight's sales will take place in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be divided between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of the Insight is planned for the first months of the year, immediately after the company presentation in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz has grown in all its parts.
Its length reaches 3.90 meters (five centimetres more), the width is 1.69 meters (two centimetres more) and the total is 2.50 meters, with an increase of five centimetres.
The height, however, remained unchanged at 1.52 meters.
Along with the increase in size, the interior is also enlarged.
This advantage derives on the one hand from the insertion of a new platform, and on the other from the introduction of the fuel tank in a central position, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz model.
In addition, the trunk capacity – equipped with double background – rises to 399 liters, or 19 liters more the capacity of the first generation.
It should be noted that these are the measurements of the 1.4 engine version, and that the capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2 trunk is 379 litres.
Other improvements - in addition to external elements, such as rear leds or the possibility of mounting the panoramic glass - concern an improvement in accessibility to the rear seats.
The doors that allow access to the rear positions, in fact, open with an angle of 80 degrees, compared to 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
In addition, the engines in this second generation of jazz are also new.
At the time of marketing, this small model will be proposed in models with petrol engine of 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both mechanics include i-VTEC technology that allows to lower consumption, produce less carbon dioxide emissions, optimize the mechanics and at the same time keeps the engine torque high in all its phases.
The 1.2 litre model allows you to enjoy a power of 90 cv to 6,000 spins with a maximum torque of 114 Nm. to 4,900 spins.
The propulsion – which in the previous Jazz reached 78 horses – uses 5.3 liters of fuel and produces CO2 emissions of about 125 grams.
Compared to the previous propulsion, which in the first generation model used 83 horses, now 100 are available.
Jazz 1.4 to 100 horses achieves a combination of 5.4 liters of fuel and 128 grams of CO2 emitted.
The "pea car" to avoid collisions
In the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan has been inspired this time by nature, and in particular by bees.
Japanese society has created a robot that, taking for example the flight of bees, knows how to avoid accidents.
It is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, the first step towards collision prevention technologies.
The engineers of the Advanced Technical Center of Nissan Motor Co. developed this small robot in collaboration with the Center for Scientific and Technological Research of the prestigious University of Tokyo in Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Director General of Public Relations for Technology and Research and the Development of Brand Management, BR23C is an extension of the Security Shield to four areas produced by Nissan.
This robot is intended to improve the ability to prevent collisions in the home manufacturer's vehicles.
During the flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space which is very similar to the Nissan's safety shield.
But the most important thing is the composite eyes of the bees, able to see in all directions with an angle greater than 300 degrees, and which allow the insect to fly without interruption in its personal space.
To recreate this visual feature, engineers have developed what they have defined as a Laser Range Finder.
This mechanism identifies obstacles in front of the BR23C for a radius within two metres and with a maximum width of 180 degrees, calculates the distance from the object and sends a signal to a microprocessor on board that immediately prevents collision.
"At the moment that it detects an obstacle, the small robot imitates the movements of a bee and immediately changes direction by turning on the wheels at the right or greater angle to avoid collision.
The most obvious difference with any assisted system is that the escape maneuver is totally instinctive.
"If not, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and chief engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot deviate upwards or downwards, nor even diagonally; it can move only in two dimensions and in the direction in which it can rotate its wheels and not exploit infinite directions and ways as bees do.
For this reason, Nissan used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot can avoid collisions.
"This device just needs to process the information every few seconds, and act on the basis of this data.
It does not require the storage of information or the intuitive logic of the maneuvers predicted, so it can work without interruptions and with only a couple dozen KB of memory.
This may surprise you, but we're not talking about gigabytes of memory, not even megabytes."
It is the first step towards the development of new technologies for the instantaneous prevention of collisions, a technology that Nissan hopes will be standard in cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and more durable than the lithium ion type.
Another potential future application of this technology could be the integration of units with a GPS satellite navigation system to bring the driver to the destination avoiding the obstacles present in the route.
Trema before applying for a loan
We must recognize that the United States Treasury Department, as well as having a lot of capital to intervene, is certainly not devoid of ingenuity.
Faced with the crisis and in order to prevent Americans from engaging with loan garbage in dubious insolvency banks, they have created a fun and instructive game for network users: "Bad Credit Hotel".
In other words, the Bad Credit Hotel... or trouble.
The gloomy aspect of this arrangement and, in particular, of its receptionist serves to induce thinking not one, but two or even three times before applying for a loan.
And, above all, where to do it, which is probably the primary objective.
Certainly the information that the game provides is useful, but it is not very detailed.
It's more a page for teenagers than a site for the broad public.
What happens if you complete the game?
Well, there's a dream room inside the hotel.
It's always something, because buying a better house doesn't even talk...
Morgan Stanley opens his capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the signing of an agreement with the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first bank in Japan, which will invest nine billion dollars in a share equal to 21% participation in the Company, news received following a sharp decline in its shares in the Stock Exchange.
A week after the draft of a provisional agreement, the two banks explained that the MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's equity at an individual cost of $25.25, or a sum of $3 billion.
The price established is 19% lower than the book value of the securities at 31 August.
The MUFG will also invest six billion dollars in the purchase of convertible securities at a conversion price of 31.25 dollars, ensuring a return of 10%.
Morgan Stanley stated that the global transaction would be carried out on the basis of an average price of $29 per share, which is less than its current rate of 28%.
By 1700, however, Morgan Stanley was down from 6.79% to $23.07.
"This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to bank holding company," explained John Mack, general manager of the American group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which should allow her to differentiate her actions by passing them under the control of the Federal Reserve.
Its alliance with the MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces Wall Street's largest names to adopt a much more cautious attitude than previously assumed.
The modalities defined on Monday also show that in the last few days the agreement has been modified: last Monday, Morgan had simply announced the sale of 20% of its shares to the Japanese colossus for a sum of $8.5 billion.
"A week ago, in Tokyo, Toshihide Mizuno , executive director of the MUFG, explained: "We thought our share would be exclusively made up of ordinary shares.
But given the current state of the world economy and the market, we have chosen to minimize risks and protect ourselves."
On the basis of the weighted average price, MUFG will obtain Morgan Stanley securities at a price below their book value of 7%.
And the transaction would result in an investment of at least 20% of equity on a diluted basis."
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert in one year half of its preferential securities into ordinary shares if, during a given period, the latter were traded more than 50% below the fixed conversion price, or approximately $47.
Morgan Stanley ensures that the capital provided by the MUFG would allow her to seize investment opportunities, strengthen her budget and increase her liquidity.
A spokesman for the group, however, refused to provide clarification on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After the investment of the MUFG, Morgan Stanley should therefore set a Tier One solvency coefficient of around 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan stated that it had "clearly" eased its budget from the end of August.
The last few weeks have put the group to the test, which has seen the value of its shares halved while the cost of risk insurance has been hit by a surge.
This cost was reflowing on Monday, however, at a high level, around 12%.
Last week the Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" among the large investment banks of Wall Street after the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the detection of Merrill Lynch, announced that it had raised $15 billion, partly at Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa in Quito this Monday.
Founding the republic on a socialism right in the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
On Sunday, following the example of colleagues and friends, it was the latter who gave voice to the draft of a new Constitution.
Mission accomplished since, according to the official results, 64% of voters voted "yes" in the referendum, on a basis of votes equal to 80%.
According to these results, the "no" was 28%, while 7% of the votes were null and 0.7% white cards.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, it should get half the votes, plus one.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the exit of the electoral seats and an estimate of a non-governmental organization had announced an overwhelming victory of the "yes", placing it between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had, moreover, claimed in the night between Sunday and Monday the victory of his draft Constitution.
The "Constitution triumphed gloriously", he had assured, congratulating the Ecuadorians within the governorate of Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
As always, Chávez and Morales congratulated Rafael Correa, as did his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The election, which took place calmly according to the electoral observation mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), was based on a text of 444 points aimed at consolidating the "new socialism" defended by the president.
This draft Constitution enshrines the power of the state over the economy, reserving to it the "planning of development" of a country that lives essentially from the oil extraction carried out by large foreign companies and consequently from their currency.
Designed by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also gives greater power to the Head of State, who can be elected for two consecutive terms of four years, to have the opportunity to dissolve the assembly.
Correa has already announced its intention to take advantage of this amendment and to re-apply for a new term in February 2009.
The Constitution also states the free provision of health and education services, which the President has begun to promote in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
It also prohibits the presence of foreign troops, a provision that will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for American anti-drug operations.
The 19 hostages released in Chad
An Egyptian commando launched the assault on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight escorts kidnapped ten days ago.
I'm in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions held captive in the desert for ten days were brought back on Monday afternoon, healthy and safe, in the Egyptian capital.
In the morning, they had been freed in Chad by an Egyptian commando.
Apparently in shape, the hostages arrived at the military base of Almaza, near Cairo International Airport, around 15:30, on board a special plane.
On board a helicopter, they were transferred immediately, without being able to give any interviews to the press, to the Maadi hospital, a residential suburb of Cairo, for analysis.
They enjoy "good health" and no ransom has been paid "to the kidnappers", said Egyptian Minister of Tourism Zoheir Garanna on the runway.
Raptured on 19 September during a 4x4 safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat, bordering Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages had been looted from one hiding place to another by 35 unknown kidnappers.
The group consisted of 11 tourists – five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian – and 8 Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the Aegyptous, the safari organizing agency.
An Egyptian security officer said that 30 members of the special forces, aboard two helicopters, had launched the attack during the night, just before dawn.
"There were gunshots, half of the kidnappers were killed, while the others fled," said the official who requested to maintain anonymity.
He explained that 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "lampo" unit were sent to Sudan, where they would have been supported by German and Italian commandos.
The Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini stressed, from Belgrade, the importance of the role of secret agents and Italian special forces.
We have to admit that if we achieved this result it was thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of the men of our secret services, the special forces," he said, without adding any more details.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
The day before, the Sudanese patrol force claimed to have intercepted a 4x4 vehicle on which the kidnappers were on board and killed six of them, including the Chadian leader of the kidnappers, and to have captured two of them.
According to the army, the kidnappers would be linked to an organization of rebels in Darfur, the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLA_U), immediately denied by the latter.
Letter- The silent majority of culture
On the front page there is a debate on the financing of culture on which the current election campaign focuses.
Good.
But part of our cultural life is always in the shade.
Who will decide to denounce the poor sums granted to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historic places that are starving?
What politician will dare to remind the federal government that it is neglecting monuments and heritage buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we don't have real laws that actually preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government pays three and a half million euros for the restoration of Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley alone?
With our American neighbours, it is the Constitution that affirms that the protection of heritage is part of national culture and that the same heritage must be protected by every citizen, every political authority and every government department, and all this by mutual agreement.
In Quebec, at the Federation of Historical Societies of Quebec, there are at least 40,000 volunteers who, grouped in 211 societies for the preservation of historical, genealogical, archives and heritage assets, preserve, with four money, private archives and archaeological sites.
It is they who often defend our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when real estate entrepreneurs and decision-making bodies attack with their bulldozers our forgotten remains and cemeteries.
When will the right space be reserved for history and heritage?
Benelux governments nationalize part of Fortis bank
The Benelux states are helping the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis, which was in difficulty for the first time in Europe because of the American credit market crisis, through partial nationalisation: the three nations will provide EUR 11.2 billion to the financial institution - insurance with interests also in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands agreed at the highest level on the weekend, including the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commissioner for Competition.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the context of the difficulties in which the international financial market has been under discussion for more than a year is that of Fortis Bank, and from a certain point of view the decisions taken in this regard can be a precedent.
According to the decision taken on Sunday night all three states will hold almost half (49%) of the bank's share in the country.
The bank will almost certainly sell some of its interests, including first of all the assets, especially insurance, of the Dutch ABN Amro acquired a year ago.
Last week Fortis' actions had started with a vertical collapse, serious signs of the institution's crisis were then presented in the second half of the week.
Analysts, however, agree that the bank, with 85,000 employees, is too large to allow it to go bankrupt.
Bank shares fell by almost 12% on Friday, the lowest point for 14 years.
Since January the value of the shares has decreased by more than two thirds.
Considering the current stock prices the entire capital value of the group is around EUR 14 billion, but according to the bank's managers this value is not real.
The business summit blames the collapse of Fortis shares on the uncertainties of the extra-European market due to the US plan's acceptance of $700 billion.
Monday the title slowly resumed to rise.
On Friday Filip Dierckx was appointed the new managing director of the bank.
The financial institution has also sought private buyers but so far no one has presented themselves with a worthy offer.
The Belgian Government had previously assured that investors should not be afraid of losing their money.
Among the bank's clients there was no panic, the branches were not attacked.
In Hungary Fortis owns autonomous branches and has also purchased leasing companies.
The fox in the henhouse
In America life and health insurers, based on people's medical purchasing data, often refuse to enter into an insurance contract.
Privacy experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There is a privacy program whereby the use of drug prescription data depends in any case on the approval of the person concerned.
This program must be in independent hands, otherwise it is like entrusting the chicken to the fox" - writes the Washington Post citing Richard Dick the author of the program to follow the prescriptions of medicines.
Insurance companies shall make the insurance fee and the amount due in case of health claims of the prospective customer and if they consider the risk to be too high they shall not make the insurance conditional.
A long time ago, the client had to undergo a medical visit and the contract was concluded only after the examination had been completed.
Dick 10 years ago invented a much cheaper procedure: according to the customer's identification code you can easily have information from the pharmacies about which medicines you have purchased in the last year and a half and from this the program emerges from which diseases you suffer and in what health conditions you are in.
For example, if you regularly buy large amounts of cholesterol reducers, this means that the level of fat in your blood is in practice unreasonably high and is classified in the highest risk category.
On the market there are various versions of the program, some also determine the risk multiplier, so the insurer in addition to paper work does not remain much, even if there are small difficulties.
On the other hand, some medicines can be used for several purposes, e.g. some compounds can be used against migraine or heat flushes, but they are also effective against depression.
The latter, from the insurance point of view - commercial, applies as a factor of increase risk, the first two are not.
For the request and processing of data they have formed separate societies and these, before obtaining from the pharmacies the necessary information, ask for the approval of the patient.
Now the authorities are forcing them to do so even though they have not so far imposed fines for negligence.
Some firms have also recently processed the results of laboratory tests and linked them to the medical intake data in order to provide a more accurate picture of the patient's state of health.
More and more companies have access to data and parallel control of use will be increasingly difficult.
There is a separate law on privacy but its validity extends only to health services and insurance.
In front of Congress there is a bill that gives the authorities control powers to companies specialized in data service.
Richard Dick admits that it is not enough: for this reason he has developed a program that links the other data with the approval expressed by the person concerned.
Another issue is that the person concerned cannot so much deny approval because otherwise insurers do not enter into the contract.
So in the end the chickens are entrusted to the mercy of the fox.
Global Marsilla Menu
European Union and India double trade
Since the European Union and India are trading partners above all each other, the agenda for the ninth summit meeting was also dominated by this issue, in addition to all the other global problems.
Today there will be a Franco-Indian summit which will deal primarily with cooperation on atomic energy.
The European Union recognises the fact that India is becoming a great democratic power that should be given more voice in international affairs, but member countries have not yet been able to decide whether or not to support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
So he did not insist on this issue in yesterday's ninth summit in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as President-in-Office of the Union, José Manuel Barroso, Chairman of the Committee and Javier Solana, High Representative for Foreign Affairs, received the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they found the agreement to double in five years, that is to say increase up to 100 billion euros, trade.
Considering that between 2000 and 2007 the exchange of goods rose from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not a too ambitious target.
As a result, 26 bilateral civil flight agreements have been legally unified, so air traffic can also start in the future.
India would like to sign the free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the deal.
The aim is to balance because while the EU is India's first trading partner, New Delhi is only ninth among the EU's partners.
The summit devoted attention to global issues.
To the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan and to terrorism, the latter condemned in all its forms on both sides, and called for the convening of a UN conference.
They called for the conclusion of the Doha Round of trade, although both sides played a role in the failure of this.
The EU has confirmed that the energy and climate programme is continuing, i.e. it would like to reduce emissions of harmful substances by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agrees on this, as well as on the need to conclude a global pact at the climate conference scheduled for next year and to reduce greenhouse gas production by 50% by 2050.
They also want to curb the rise in food prices and have supported the convening of an international meeting to examine the financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister will go today to the French capital, where a bilateral meeting is preparing to sign a treaty on the peaceful use of atomic energy.
In Paris, it is hoped that French companies will receive a €20 billion contract to build Indian nuclear reactors.
According to information from our press agency, the deal would last 15 years.
In Frankfurt more than 300 Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
There will be over three hundred Italian publishers present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international event for the exchange of rights.
The International Book Fair of Frankfurt awaits for this edition more than 7 thousand exhibitors from 101 different countries that will occupy the 171,790 square meters of the Fair with more than 403 thousand titles on display and with Turkey as guest of honor.
He will be the Under-Secretary to the Ministry for Heritage and Cultural Activities Francesco Maria Giro to represent the Italian Government at the inauguration ceremony of the Italian Pavilion: in fact Italy will be present institutionally with a Punto Italia - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
The press meeting will follow at Room Struktur in the Buchmesse 5.0 pavilion: this will be the occasion to present figures, trends and perspectives on the state of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the weight of foreign author's books on the total Italian production, and in particular on that for adults and young people, decreases progressively.
Found Steve Fossett's plane the billionaire missing a year ago
The wreck of Steve Fossett's plane, the billionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007, was found flying in the Nevada desert.
The debris was found on a high plateau at 3000 metres above sea level, in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammoth Lakes, on the California-Nevada border.
Within the aircraft, however, there were no human remains.
The Sheriff of Madeira County, John Anderson, escaped the remaining doubts: "The plane was located, we sent a team, and now we have confirmation that this is exactly what Steve Fossett was flying on the day he disappeared," he said at a press conference.
The sheriff has therefore specified that no human remains have been found either in the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old billionaire was reported dead in February.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Office (Ntsb) reported that a few hours after the wreck was sighted a team of investigators was sent, who then identified the device: it is the Bellanca 8kcab, dispersed since September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fossett's personal belongings had been found by a couple near their Mammoth Lakes home.
These are two documents named Fossett, both issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, cash and a sweatshirt.
Fossett's research had been discontinued a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had won a place in history thanks to a long series of primates.
In 2002, at the sixth attempt, he had become the first man to complete the world tour on an aerostatic balloon: two weeks of solo flight.
Three years later, he flew around the world without a stopover.
Among his many records, even that of flying at 15,445 meters high, above the Andes, but with a copilot.
Glk, the publicity you don't expect.
A Suv out of the schemes with an original design and well defined by decided lines, large surfaces and clean corners.
In short, Glk is the last one born among the "compact" offroads of the star house with which Mercedes-Benz tried to give a venta di novelties in this sector.
Just because of its content outside the traditional canons, it will be unexpected and not conventional also the communication that will accompany the launch of the Suv Glk, available at the Mercedes-Benz showrooms from October 17.
Thus the advertising battle that will accompany the debut of the new car will start an unprecedented mode of communication also through an adventurous 3D poster campaign, used for the first time in Italy by a automotive brand.
A project of maxi-affissions, articulated in three different phases, that will dominate the central street of the Milanese shopping, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision and thanks to special glasses distributed near Corso Como it will be possible to see the new Suv in almost real size and in three-dimensional format.
In fact, when you look at the image, you will get the impression that the car exits the manifesto.
Subsequently, through the use of the innovative Ellumina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated in different times in all its details, and then recommended in a single image.
Undoubtedly Mercedes with this advertisement is trying to introduce something new into the stereotypical field of automotive communication.
Will you be able with this formula to stifle the interest of future buyers?
That's who the Italian hooligans are.
From the Trivenet, they risk the Daspo.
But who are those 150-200 boys and girls of whom all Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia" that has been following the Azzurra National for years and that until now, for the truth, had never created excessive problems.
He'd never clashed with fans.
The extraction of the group is on the right.
The promoters are from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
To these in Sofia have been added groups (a few units, in fact) from Campania and Apulia.
They have tricolor flags where the towns of origin of the militants appear: Saturday night they were removed to be unidentified.
They are inspired by English fans.
In Bulgaria they found a typhose of real Nazis, Levski's.
Figc had made 144 tickets available to Italian fans for the game: all names, therefore easily controllable.
And the Viminale had checked them all: among those who left for Sofia there was no one with a Daspo in progress, no one who had been inhibited from attending a stadium.
Four blue fans, who had a history of stage crimes, had in fact been refused the ticket and prevented the transfer.
Now Viminale waits to read the acts that will arrive from the Bulgarian police then will take action: in this case, it is possible to give Daspo for at least five years to fans who have been arrested or to those who have been identified in the disorders.
An international Daspo that prevents you from attending not only the Italian stadiums but all over Europe.
Our hooligans, in other words, will no longer set foot in a stadium.
Luckily.
But now there is fear-emulation: that to those little more than one hundred and fifty, others are added.
"We must immediately put this fire out and not legitimize those who behave in this way," they say from Viminale.
So, "well-opened eyes especially in view of the National game of Wednesday in Lecce".
In Puglia in fact there is a small nucleus of supporters of Ultras Italia.
Tomorrow the Observatory meets, Tuesday the Casms that can count also on a section of the Aise, that is the secret services, that deals precisely with the problems from the stage.
"The Duce-Duce choirs and arm stretched out during Mameli's hymn? In Bulgaria it is not a crime...".
This is the thought (expressed in a very unhappy way) of Domenico Mazzilli, who has been director of the Viminale Observatory for a few weeks (he took the place that was first of Francesco Tagliente and then of Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli had previously been a guest of Trieste where there is a core of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to deny the Duke but certainly the behavior of those 150-200 fans was shameful.
"I do not do the sociologist - adds the number 1 of the Observatory - the crimes must be attributed in the country in which the fact takes place.
Until now this group had remained in line, now we will see what has happened and we will evaluate for the future.
But let's also talk about Mameli's hymn whistles: even those are not offenses, but if you'll allow me, they are not education..."
