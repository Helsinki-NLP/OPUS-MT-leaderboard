Republican strategy to hinder Obama's re-election
The Republican leaders justified their policy because of the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Centre considers the latter a myth and claims that electoral fraud is less frequent in the United States than the number of people who die from the fall of lightning.
In fact, Republican lawyers have found no more than 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In this regard, these measures will in part undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike in Canada, American states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
And in the same vein, a majority of American governments enacted new laws from 2009, which made the registration or voting process difficult.
This phenomenon has spread since the November 2010 elections, which saw an increase of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states were introduced in 2011.
New electoral laws require voters to present an identity document with a photograph, as well as proof of American citizenship.
On the other hand, these laws reduce early voting periods, invalidate the right to register as an elector on the day of scrutiny and withdraw their right to vote for citizens with criminal records.
Before the 2006 elections, no American state required voters to submit a photo ID.
The state of Indiana was the first to demand it.
The United States Supreme Court confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of Indiana's law.
For this reason, the republican authorities hastened to extend this practice to other states.
In recent years these authorities have supported bills in 34 states to force voters to submit a photo ID.
It is important to bear in mind that, contrary to what is happening in Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity card, such as the Social Security card.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, that is, 21 million people of voting age, do not have any photo ID issued by a government agency in their state.
On the other hand, five million new voters in 2012 lack an identity card with these characteristics.
But, often, obtaining the required identity document costs more than $100.
Thus, the new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.
In fact, 25 per cent of African Americans, 15 per cent of people earning less than $35,000 a year, 18 per cent of citizens over 65 years of age and 20 per cent of voters between 18 and 29 years of age do not have a photo ID.
And there's more.
In many states students, voters who most vote for Democratic candidates, cannot use the photo ID issued by their institution.
On the other hand, the same states authorize members of fishing or hunting clubs who often vote for Republican parties to use the documents issued by such clubs.
Before 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first state to submit such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove that they are American citizens.
These measures clearly seek to limit the Spanish vote.
It seems that two out of three Hispanic voters support the Democratic Party.
On the other hand, Republican legislators in 2011 supported certain laws that abolished voter registration on the same day of scrutiny in eight states.
In addition, they limited the right of individuals and groups to create a support service for voters who wished to register.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, in the 2004 general elections, voter registration campaigns contributed to the registration of about 10 million citizens.
Measures taken since 2009 resulted in the registration rate of new voters falling in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators passed laws in five other states that favored the reduction of the voting period in advance.
For example, in the 2008 elections in Florida, 33% of the voters who voted in advance were African Americans, while the latter represented only 13% of the state's voters.
In the case of Hispanics, exactly the same was true.
They represent only 11% of the electorate, which is equivalent to 24% of the citizens who vote in advance.
However, whites, representing 76 per cent of the electorate, represent only 46 per cent of the citizens who vote in advance.
Of course, Democratic legislators and their supporters have strongly opposed the adoption of laws restricting the registration of voters.
In this regard, Democratic governors have blocked several bills.
The United States Department of Public Prosecutions intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
In part, damage could be limited.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states passed the law requiring the submission of a photo identification document.
However, it is undeniable that the new rules adopted will complicate the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been voted for, as it is clear that they are intended to influence the results of 2012 in key states.
A report by the Brennan Center of 2011 shows that the states that have adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes needed in the electoral college to obtain the presidency.
It is too early to state with certainty whether these legislative changes at the electoral system level will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential elections.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In this sense, the measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Prostate Cancer Detection: Do you take the test or don't do it?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes has erroneous results, with false negative results or even false positive results, after which it is decided to perform useless medical interventions.
It is more than enough reason to make men, who are already reluctant in themselves, question whether or not detection tests should be carried out.
Doing the test or not?
We've asked for advice from two specialists.
Studies in the United States found a high rate of infection among sample groups, making it difficult to interpret such data and make firm recommendations.
For its part, the European study showed a certain difference in mortality between patients who had been screened and those who did not.
The study, with a follow-up at 12 years of age, also showed that there are between 30 and 40% chances of metastasis if the screening test has not been performed.
I recommend, therefore, the test from the age of 50, or from the age of 40 if your father has suffered prostate cancer.
Men of African American origin have a higher risk index.
The key is to make a good decision after cancer has been detected.
There are aggressive cancers and other cancers that are indolent.
It is really necessary to get the patient to understand the degree of risk of his cancer. He must be offered all possible options and not necessarily treat prostate cancers that do not affect life in the long term, in which case he must choose to actively monitor the disease.
Today, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer are not treated, since cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a risk to their lives.
Instead, we suggest active surveillance of the disease and, if it progresses, we offer you treatment.
We are increasingly identifying precise criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated.
I recommend that you take the test in any case.
But it is important that you talk to your doctor to determine whether or not the test should be done.
Movember has created, in collaboration with the International Society of Urology, a tool to evaluate the pros and cons of the PSA test.

Preventing the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miraculous recipe for preventing cancer.
Despite the progress of research, the adoption of healthy lifestyles remains the best way to reduce the risk of disease.
We estimate that if everyone ate well and moved well enough, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
"If no one smoked, that rate would rise to at least 50%," says André Beaulieu, spokesperson for the Canadian Cancer Society.
Instead, we estimate that about 10% of cancers are hereditary.
Many others remain totally inexplicable.
For the Canadian Society Against Cancer, the fight against smoking remains a priority despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Tobacco is associated with 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for other types of cancers.
It greatly harms people's health.
"Today, there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," said spokesperson André Beaulieu.
A hopeful fact: 10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying of cancer is reduced to half.
Weight
Fat and obesity also favor the appearance of the disease, according to CSC.
They increase the risks of breast, colon and rectum cancer, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
"Research shows that the regular practice of physical activity throughout life protects against breast cancer," they add.
Feeding
The body also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In large quantities, they increase the risk of colorectal cancer.
Charcuterie products should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat for smoking, drying or salting may lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"They can damage the body's cells and lead to cancer development," they explain.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin complexes and cancer.
However, for the time being his investigations are not conclusive.
According to SCC, studies of vitamin E are contradictory.
While in one of them there was a decrease in the risks of prostate cancer, in another, what was observed was, rather, an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not been clearly determined.
On the other hand, M. Beaulieu insists on the importance of talking about each other's concerns and family history with his or her doctor.
"Doing the screening test doesn't cause cancer."
The Higgs boson in detail
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson generated a great shock last summer, and rightly so.
It is believed, indeed, that this boson is part of the mechanism responsible for the mass of all that exists in the universe, nothing more and nothing less.
And what is more, it is the particle whose existence predicted the standard model: our best or "less evil" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter, which has not yet been empirically observed.
But for physicists it's not entirely clear that it's Higgs.
We certainly know that there is a new particle and that it looks a lot like the Higgs boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, new data unveiled this week at an important physics congress held in Kyoto seem to confirm that it is, although more data is still missing to be completely safe.
Anyway, we assume that it's Higgs, because the chances of getting wrong don't seem very good, so we'll see what it's about.
There is, in this great world, a widespread and inescapable law that implies that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
There's no way to break that rule and don't try too hard, because it'll end up hurting itself.
Although particle physics is a very complex world, it has been shown that there is also a law of these characteristics: Pauli's principle of exclusion, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state"; a "state" consisting, roughly speaking, of some of its characteristics.
The physicists classify the particles into two categories.
On the one hand we meet the good citizens called fermions, who wisely obey Pauli's beginning.
And on the other hand there are the bosons, a dirty panda of anarchists who have no respect for anything, or at least not for this principle, which means that they can be found in the same place at the same time.
According to the website The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley Laboratories which, by the way, is extraordinary, the bosons are divided into two groups: the mesons, which we will not talk about here, and the "particles of force", by which the great forces of nature are propagated and with which the boson of Higgs would somehow be related.
These bosons, it might be underlined here, are not the exotic bugs we could believe.
In fact, if you can read this chronicle, it is thanks to an extraordinarily banal boson: the photon or the "particle of light" that acts as "messenger" of electromagnetic force.
Indeed, when a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it "disorders" the electromagnetic field in that precise environment; a bit like when we throw a stone at a pond.
In this "disorder" an electromagnetic wave (from light, infrared, ultraviolet, etc.) is born, and this wave is nothing but a photon; that is, one of the bosons "bearers of force".
More stable field
The same happens with the Higgs boson, with the difference that it is another field, the Higgs field, which needs to be "disordered" for this boson to appear.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field. To activate it it takes to reach extremely high energies, a little as if it were an ice pond in which only a thick rock could slide through the surface.
That's why it takes a huge particle accelerator like the CERN (the big Hadron Collider is a 27 km ring of circumference!) to reach such energy levels.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is a new tool that explains the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, not all particles or materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do, but others do not: a piece of paper, for example, will never remain stuck to the door of a refrigerator.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do have a mass, while the rest (like the photon, by the way), do not have it.
Now, what can you "contribute" to all these investigations, Mrs Plamondon asks.
For science, this serves to verify the validity of the standard model (MS), and also allows physicists to scrutinize the differences between observations and MS predictions.
For their part, many earnestly desire that they be found, since the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" that spans certain holes in the model.
This, we have to say, still has huge shortcomings, as it does not propose any explanation regarding gravity (ups!) or dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the matter of the Universe (another ups!).
But we have not found such differences in the CERN so far.
Implications
The impact of such investigations on our day-to-day lives is difficult to predict, but we do not believe that we are wrong to say that it will have none.
For you to see: in the early 1960s, laser pioneers in laboratories did not suspect at all the revolution that their work would provoke.
They glimpsed scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, as physicist Willard Boyle, who worked in the Bell labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who developed the first continuous laser (the first were pulsed) in 1962, at first the laser was rather considered a "laboratory device".
Imagine...
In addition, applications can also come from all the instruments surrounding the research.
For example, Willard Boyle himself developed a light picker in 1969 in the course of his research into optics.
Although it was not at all his original intention, this catcher now serves as an "eye" for all digital devices in the world, which earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
That doesn't mean, of course, that LHC activities necessarily want to transform our lives, but you never know...
Palliative care, the best way to die...
In his Commission to Die in Dignity, Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate must be resumed soon as a bill is prepared.
Now, within that essential domain, there is still much to be done.
Le Devoir tried to see him closely.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer he was destroying had given him a two - year break.
"They had given me five years of life, but I've already had seven years," he says, passing through, lying in his bed at the Victor-Gadbois palliative care center in Beloeil, to which he arrived the day before.
"But it's always a shock, we can't be prepared for this," he continues.
The disease has wreaked havoc on him: a huge weakness that prevents him from going to the bathroom alone and even eating alone.
Sitting in front of an appetizing lunch, he accepts resigned to help him eat.
Valiant, he even smiles, talks to strangers who devote attention to him, bring him medicine and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My biggest wish is to have my diarrhea cured, it's humiliating," she confesses.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for that evil.
"In the course of our lives we learn that a man pees standing," says Pierre Brodeur, psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois center.
Returning to your childhood, for certain people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
"That depends on the person's ability to accept that regression," he says.
Because, according to the opinion of most people working in palliative care, the great moments take place in the very heart of that regression.
All patients entering the Victor-Gadbois palliative care center have cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
In this state, the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer offer "curative" care.
Mrs. A.'s greatest fear, 89, is to die "conscious and drowned."
But the disease has made your children discover.
"I have good children," he adds.
"I don't have any more desires left in this life," she says, before accepting a mask to help her breathe.
And he expects, in the next few days, a last visit from his son who lives in Italy.
Victor-Gadbois offers, with a group of volunteers, body care and food aid.
They are palliative care given to them when nothing else can be done.
To help make your death more comfortable.
In Quebec we have a palliative care bed for every 11,700 inhabitants.
It's very little, because we know that we'll all end up dying someday.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the center.
Whether at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
The dying person is offered mouthwash with brandy or Pepsi, according to demand.
Diabetics are no longer controlled by their sugar levels.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served a beer to Mr. X, who died in the course of the night.
This morning, your son ran out of beer at the dead man's feet.
"We help both patients and their loved ones," says Nathalie Savard, director of care.
At the Victor-Gadbois center the days pass without ever being the same.
Next to a 94-year-old man who savors his last family reunion in the courtyard, well placed among his pillows while everyone drinks to his health, a 36-year-old dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and two children, after trying everything to survive.
"Since six months ago, there have always been three to five beds occupied by people under 45 suffering from cancer," says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of the patients admitted to the Victor-Gadboisappendant Center come from their home and 47% from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
Seventy-seven per cent of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care designed to alleviate suffering when a patient reaches the terminal phase of their life, either at home, in the hospital or in a care centre.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois Center and the home palliative care society in Greater Montreal, specialize almost exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is precisely this great relative lack of health care in Quebec that causes many doctors specialized in palliative care to fear the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto signed by eminences of palliative care, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has been circulating to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec's health care system is not competent enough to ensure that anyone is entitled to quality palliative care before euthanasia is accepted.
"Recently," she says, "I've seen a patient spend 14 days in the ER suffering great pains without doing what was necessary to relieve her.
I'm afraid patients want to die just because they don't get the right care."
And at the same time, many oncologists persist with their patients until the last day, despite the worst forecasts.
Hélène Richard's survival hopes were already low when he left an exhausting chemotherapy treatment.
"When I told my oncologist that I wanted to stop the treatment, she told me that I was very sorry that I wanted to stop fighting," she says.
"However, she had told me that there was nothing else to do!"
There is no almighty care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients who request death thank their caregivers who have not responded to their demands once their pain has been alleviated thanks to a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not all-powerful in terms of pain treatment.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at Grand Montréal's home, patients do not respond to pain treatment in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors usually resort to palliative sedation, which serves to sleep the patient until the time of his or her death, either sporadically or permanently.
We can't pretend that we don't understand that part of the suffering.
Increasingly, the unrelieved disease will have the possibility of having that palliative sedation.
The sick who are not relieved all say the same: "I want to die".
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want euthanasia," but "I want them to relieve me."
This report has been made possible through a journalism grant from the Canadian health research institutes.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials of the road network, businessmen of the BTP, fund-raisers of political parties and specialists of the Italian mafia count, day after day, what they know of a formidable "system", of which are part the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafias.
A "industry" that came out too expensive for Quebec taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000.
"It's curious how the system is sprayed once we've hunted the big media," ironically Jacques Duchesneau, Quebec MP and former Chief of the Montreal Police.
He led the outbreak of the scandal in 2011, which was possible thanks to an in-depth investigation into the misappropriations linked to road contracts in Quebec, which the then Liberal Prime Minister, Jean Charest, had only consented to delay.
The "Duchesneau report" established a direct link between industry, clandestine party financing and corruption among officials.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, only the Ministry of Transport would have saved a billion dollars in contracts," containing some of its instincts to keep a proportional share.
The Charbonneau Commission "has already dropped two mayors", he adds, while hoping to "demonstrate the existing stratagems behind individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, created in 2011, also applies with its team of government interveners, researchers and analysts.
This unit operates in addition to the "Marteau Squadron" police officers, who, since 2009, have made Montreal's "masonry cartel" moderate when it comes to inflating contracts.
In recent weeks, the unit has made a serial record of allegations of fraud and corruption against municipal officials such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a city on the outskirts.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his position as Mayor of Laval, Quebec's third city.
It is suspected that repeated bribes have been pocketed for public contracts.
Engineers from the Montreal road network and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambimo, have been formally charged.
The latter has caused shock by explaining to the commission the mechanics of the "system" of obtaining public contracts.
He himself paid for three years 3% of the value of contracts obtained in Montreal to an intermediary linked to the mafia who transferred the money to Union Montréal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
M. Zambimo distributed money to right and wrong during the 2000s, giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially the ruling liberals.
He also admitted having organized a collection of illegal funds for the former Deputy Prime Minister, Nathalie Normandeau.
Inflation of the cost of sewage contracts
In Montreal, the corruption "system" worked effectively.
Gilles Surprising, a former public works engineer, explained this perfectly to the commission: in ten years he received gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and bribes from construction companies for a total of $736,000, all in exchange for sewage contracts whose costs he incurred.
Other road network officials have admitted that they received money for inflating invoices between 30 and 40 per cent for false extras.
In addition, an organizer of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused M. Tremblay of having deliberately turned a blind eye to a parallel budget and filled his coffers with dirty money.
Following these revelations, M. Tremblay resigned in early November and led to a huge crisis in Montreal.
Chantal Rouleau was one of Montreal's first elected policies that sounded the alarm.
As mayor of the Rivière-des-Prairies district, in the east of the island, she has been opposed since 2010 to the sale of a municipal land acquired for $5 million and resold for 1.6 million to developers in full property boom.
70% of the money in the election campaigns was dirty money.
From the investigation that will eventually be carried out, she assures that she pulls "from a thread to be able to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop the gangrene and fish the culprits".
And he adds that the process is "painful, but positive."
We're cleaning up the wounds but it would take a clean investigation unit in Montreal and be very alert so that dubious practices don't repeat themselves.
How to clean up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, states that "the officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but is concerned above all about the role of the ''politicals elected to the knowledge of the strategist''.
Estimating by 70% the proportion of dirty money that was spent on financing electoral campaigns in Quebec, ironically: "I have been told that this is nothing but a pale reflection of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to parties to $100, but that will not change the donation, according to him, "while election expenses are not strictly limited, there will be dirty money in politics."
It calls for a complete review of the system of public procurement and party financing: "We cannot fall any lower; going to the bottom of things, courageously, will allow us to rebuild the house with stronger foundations, with more controls and laws."
If this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, M. Duchesneau invites those who would laugh to look in the mirror.
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season has acquired a new entity with the PSG.
How would you explain that advance?
It could be explained by an individual awareness, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Big players have arrived.
Advance from day to day by his side.
The technical staff has also contributed a lot.
And those elements push me every day to raise the level of my game.
In a game, that's easier.
Everything goes very fast in football.
But I don't take it easy.
From my beginnings in the pre-training center of INF Clairefontaine to my passage through Saint-Etienne, I have always made strides.
You will benefit from the competition recruited by Carlo Ancelotti.
This summer's recruits are used to playing very high-level matches.
They know that every training is crucial.
That makes a player like me want to fight and give it all away.
On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a great deal about my position.
It's backed up by deputies like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man who needed the team?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect for all technicians.
Today, there is no one like in League 1 and he is among the best European coaches.
He has a great experience and has won numerous titles with the best clubs.
He's worked with big players.
I think he'll take other titles in Paris.
In January I had a very comforting conversation with him.
I just got out of a series of injuries.
The confidence you have in me also explains my good performance.
What do you think about the PSG in the first part of the season?
In League 1, Lyon has taken away our position as leader.
But we're still in the ambush.
One of our biggest goals is the Champions League: we have qualified for the eighth in style.
What is the club's goal in this competition?
Let's try to get as far away as we can.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we have a lot to say in front of many very good European teams.
We want, to begin, to finish the first of our league in front of the Oporto so that we can receive the eighth round of the final.
Can the PSG become a big European club in the short term?
He's already got the budget...
To become a great European club, Paris has to win titles and be there in the long term.
Today, that's not the case.
At the economic level, the PSG is committed to its means of making this project a reality.
Not winning the cup in League 1, as in the last season, would it be a big failure?
Of course, it would be a great disappointment.
This year we will invest all our efforts in taking that title of champions.
We haven't gotten far in the last season.
In May we were disappointed, as we had the best conditions to finish first.
We had a strong season.
We're done with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points we should have been champions...
But another team, the Montpellier, had a much better season.
This year I think he'll be the good one.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux fight for the title, I think we have the weapons to take it.
Do you think the media expect more from the PSG?
It's normal that they expect a lot from us if we think about what's been invested in the players we have.
We've totally accepted it.
After we won 4-0 at home to Troyes, who still find things to blame us for is a little frustrating.
We wonder what else people expect.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to start a game project.
A team is built in time.
In the Champions League we have shown that we can respond and be present.
Look at Manchester City, which, after two seasons, has failed to qualify for eighth-finals, and they have also invested a lot!
In view of the amounts invested, we would imagine you with 15 points of advantage to the day.
That would be neglecting our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not well the previous season, have been "pulsed" by this new PSG.
That shows that League 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we can say with a smile that, despite all the difficulties, we have ended up taking the trophy.
The PSG seems entirely dependent on the successes of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
Let's just say we have a Zlatandependence.
That means that Ibrahimovic is very competent and that he puts many goals.
He's here to prove he's the star of League 1.
And he's proven on every team he's ever been through that he's a great player, a world star.
In the group we respect the man and the player.
And he also respects the men he has around him.
What you've done is truly exceptional.
That pushes others to increase their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows us all to progress.
How did you experience the 2012 Euro Cup with the French team?
It was a disappointment.
I was very excited to take part in this Euro Cup.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from accumulating gambling time.
I saw things there and I went out reinforced.
Today I manage to play good games in the selection.
That's what I expected from my baptism with the blues.
We learned the lesson of what happened in Ukraine and to this we must have exemplary behavior today.
What vision do you have of Didier Deschamps's first month at the head of the blues?
He's getting results.
They are well placed in the classification group for the World Cup.
The selector is rigorous, close to the players and inspires to win.
As was the case with Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make comparisons.
Blanc achieved his goal of classifying us for the Euro Cup.
I hope Didier Deschamps takes the selection to Brazil.
Did the tie (1-1) of October 16 in Spain serve to lay the groundwork?
That game gave us confidence.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before that shock in Spain, I had not experienced a similar game in my entire career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
Contrary to current monetary exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and processing charges between the parties.
Moreover, as often happens in technologies, the political vision is palpable: the conviction that the current monetary system, composed of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency convertible to dollars, euros, etc. and a secure exchange protocol like BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files equal to the same.
Some 200,000 transactions have been recorded through 15,000 network computers.
And about a thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as a form of payment.
Bitcoin's contribution, after reaching the top of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to 2 dollars five months later, before today's return to around 10 dollars (the quotes are censored on bitcoincharts.com page).
It is nothing impressive if we compare it with global changes in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) took an interest in it in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
In it, bitcoin was described as "the most successful virtual currency", "which competes with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to conventional currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other systems with virtual coin types such as "credits", used to advance in a video game and that can be earned playing or can be purchased (and even occasionally exchanged).
The Facebook social network also developed this type of system.
But in every exchange a central authority controls and deals with changes.
With bitcoin, all network nodes are both book depositors, verifiers, coin issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does that network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually made between two e-mail addresses in the form of e-mail.
A user can choose a different address for each payment, thus guaranteeing anonymity.
A set of information linked to this transaction is signed electronically through a double-key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that bitcoins changes consist of the public account book, which is disseminated throughout the network.
The key milestone is to write that new transaction in that book.
This goes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge thrown at the computers and the winner, a sort of provisional central banker, will have the privilege of adding that complementary line.
This is a phase of file cutting, that is, transformation of a large file into a shorter and more unique numerical footprint.
Computers "take" the new transaction and add a number before "streaking" the set.
The goal is to find the number that offers a particular footprint (zeroer at first).
Once that number is found, the other nodes easily verify that it is the good one.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the set chain of the other transactions; any modification would change the footprint.
If, in order to commit a fraud, one user would want to pay twice with the same money very quickly (in less than ten minutes), the network would only accept as valid one of the two transactions; the other would be orphaned, as both have different footprints.
The computer that solves the challenge takes 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this reward is divided into two regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible to one hundred millionth, leaving a wide margin.
The difficulty of this challenge is also revealed in each increase in computing power.
The life of the network already has its ups and downs.
Websites that offer services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins have been stolen in storage.
"The failure used does not affect the same protocol," says Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a real-money payment company that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also takes into account the possibilities of money laundering thanks to this anonymous service.
But cash has the same flaw.
Weighty actors like Wikipedia reject payments of this kind.
Others, such as the Wordpress platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, of the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the book of accounting and showed that about 80% of bitcoins do not circulate.
In November, the "giant discounts" were launched.
"They changed $30,000," says Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, who turns bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, author of a pedagogical book on this coin, believes quite in the potential of this technology as well as in the transaction network.
Your system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a mobile payment without contact, but uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, so they come out cheaper.
The carrier also manages his identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system is easy to start up in shops, which do not have to install new terminals or software.
They simply provide an address that a phone can "photograph and recognize," says Pierre Noizat, who claims to have thousands of users.
There is a general movement of revision of hierarchical systems by more horizontal systems.
"It will take some time for Bitcoin to impose itself, but in 2013 there could be a change," he predicts.
Moreover, in its report, the ECB envisages revaluing the various risks, which are now considered high, if this currency succeeds.
We're out of Afghanistan.
And then?
French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans are due to leave by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain possession of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future, without expecting anything from us.
We have punished above all the Afghan peasants, whom we have considered terrorists.
And to ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, plus the wounded and the maimed.
The Taliban have foreign extremists and former chief refugees in Pakistan, but often also peasants who reject the presence of the foreign army, as in Soviet times.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even if Jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks or Tajiks join their causes.
Tolerated, sometimes even helped by local insurgents, these will no longer be so when Westerners become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the base of Nijrab, which I observed from the top of the hills planted with almond trees thanks to the French credits, was done in order.
Truck and tank convoys returned to Kabul without any attack, monitored by helicopters.
There will be no Taliban influx into Kabul from the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed since their irresistible advance between 1994 and 1996.
Kabul was then empty and the country wrapped in fire and blood because of the struggles between different factions.
His takeover of the country had been perceived as a sort of liberation, the return to security.
The Afghans have paid the price of the obscurantism of their peasants surpassed by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation is not better today.
The old mujahidins, the current government and the current Taliban share the desire to keep women in a lower position.
The main personalities of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become speculators, making use of government land to resell them as solar for refugees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from huge U.S. subcontracting contracts.
They are discredited; most of them have not fought.
People, as I have heard in the countryside, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have been able to take advantage of American generosity: the capital flight is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
They have lived the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan and have appreciated its advantages.
With around 65 per cent of its population under the age of 25, Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, a fifth of the total population.
In cities, state schools are full of both girls and boys.
It will be necessary to give work to those young people who will not want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of certain leaders.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, is eager for mobile phones. Television and its Turkish leaflets presenting a modern world have great admirers all over the country.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities who want to run the country be considered legitimate?
The former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already concerned with rebuilding the provincial militias, which will flee from central power.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains, with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from some decentralization in the image of Western nations. However, the United States has wanted to transform it into a centralized state, with strong presidential power, removing the post of Prime Minister that existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, particularly on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country had been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and even earlier.
No industry has re-established its services, no reservoirs have been fixed, and important irrigation systems have been repaired.
Everything is imported and nothing is produced except fruits and vegetables.
Priority is given to private initiative.
In a country ruined after 30 years of war, government control would have been necessary.
The rumor spread that Afghanistan possessed immense mineral wealth.
And that only increased the feeling that the Westerners were there to seize them.
Without energy to extract iron or copper minerals from the land and without means of transport to export them through the mountains, there is no mining operation.
The Chinese have already almost abandoned the copper mines of Mes Aynak, leaving international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) to excavate the immense Buddhist site and remain there as the most important employers in the province.
Afghanistan and Pakistan, heavily dependent on imports and exports, will also need to restore their normal relations.
The French troops left on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls' schools, children's schools, a department of French at university, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, health and agricultural fields and support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in order to try "to win hearts and spirits" and to carry out the impossible task of making aid and offensive actions coincide, a service of "civil and military actions" of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), suppressed in 2012, brought and brought through a small French NGO numerous collective interest and agricultural rehabilitation actions in dozens of mountain localities.
These works, greedy to get local labor, have been able to help contain the insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, sun protection and increased cultivation areas.
What will we leave as a souvenir after two million euros of military spending?
A rather modest budget will contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, which are very harsh in those valleys often more than 2,000 metres high.
The Embassy received dozens of written demands with small agricultural proposals made by local communities in the province of Kapisa.
In order for them to be freed from the insurrection carried out by foreign groups, something that the farmers have told me they want, it would be necessary to maintain a small civilian aid, well controlled and to reach them directly.
A Constitution with Forceps in Egypt
It's a new double or nothing from President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is more divided than ever as to the constitutional declaration, which temporarily grants it full powers, he decided to play the whole for the whole.
It caught everyone by surprise on Wednesday, when it announced that the Constituent Assembly would vote on its final text the following day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State had given the Assembly two more months to complete its work.
And for almost two years Egypt has been using an interim text, several times modified, which weakens institutional stability and leads to judicial confusion.
This new initiative has only increased the fracture in the country.
For his opponents, the president perseveres in his "autocratic delusion" and continues "treasoning his word" and "pissing the law."
On the part of its supporters, it is ensured that this is a step to speed up the institutional and political crisis and accelerate the transition process.
A referendum should be held in the next 15 days.
A very short period of time that forces the Brothers to renounce their draft to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the president, it is also a way to regain popular and democratic legitimacy while the controversial one is wreaking havoc throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote for him, as he stated in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Considering that this appeal has been voted on very quickly, it contains an ultimatum for the Egyptian people: "or I vote for my text or maintain full powers", powers that are supposed to come to an end with the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in this strange environment in which 85 members of this Constituent Assembly, a majority Islamist, voted yesterday.
Most liberals did not attend the call.
By mid-November, just before the constitutional declaration, they had closed the door because they felt they could not assert their views.
Representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society did the same.
In order for the necessary quorum to be achieved, yesterday morning 11 persons, alternate members, were added in a hurry.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brothers.
As could be expected, the articles voted were unanimously adopted.
The commentators are also grateful for the fact that one of the few discrepancies of the day has been expressed practically at the time of prayer, so many members of the committee came to think that the Constituent's clock was wrong.
The text, which was still being voted on yesterday afternoon, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, which is the object of all eyes, remains at last identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, which stipulated that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of law".
The Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a fundamental demand, hoped that "principles" could be replaced by "rules", which would have allowed for stricter application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is a guarantee of their goodwill and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
Liberals call it hypocrisy and consider it to be nothing but an advertising scam.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They refer in particular to article 220, which confers on Al-Azhar University an advisory role, in particular for anyone who has to confirm its conformity with the laws of Sharia.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, it is disturbing because "the people called to pronounce themselves are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
Here we glimpse the premises of a theocracy."
The fears of liberals are further increased by the fact that the next rector of that university would be much less moderate than the current one.
"For now, there is no concrete religious implication.
With this Constitution we are within the framework of marital status.
Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text are not ulemas but university students, some of whom are trained in the French system," explains Alexis Blouet, who prepares a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges that there may be some ambiguity about article 220, as the terms used imitate the religious vocabulary.
"We refer in particular to the term iqh [Islamic jurisprudence, ndlr].
And the question that might arise in the future would be to what extent are the civil judges competent to rule above all this."
Beyond its religious character, the text voted on yesterday received many criticisms concerning the extended powers conferred on the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood will argue that there are few in comparison to those they were during the previous regime.
Another conflicting point: the powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the revision of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a national defence council.
Nor shall the prosecution of civilians in military courts be prohibited, as called for by human rights associations.
They also expressed their concerns about the text, which they considered to be liberticidal.
The crime of blasphemy is maintained and, from now on, insults are prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially that of the press.
In addition, no article emphasizes the protection of women, underlines Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive thing has been the prohibition of torture under article 36.
The word did not appear in the previous Constitution.
Although the Egyptian president was due to be on television last night, demonstrations are scheduled for this noon.
The supporters of the Head of State protested on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for the holy land, the navel of the world and a sea of brine
The Promised Land combines the majesty of Bible truths with modern comfort and pristine nature.
"AIF" identified the five most important reasons why Israel should be visited.
Reverence in the Holy Land
It is worth visiting the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that anyone who enters this "baptismal pile" will receive divine grace.
And Galilee, the place of Jesus' miracles: the conversion of water into wine at the wedding, walking on the waters, the calming of the storm and the crowded nets.
In this very place, Jesus appeared before his disciples after the resurrection.
But the greatest number of holy places are in Jerusalem.
The believers walk here the Viacrucis or the Way of the Cross of Jesus (in Latin "Vía Dolorosa").
It begins in the Fortress of Antonio, the Pretoria, where the trial was carried out, and continues through the streets of the Old City, goes to the Holy Sepulchre on Mount Golgotha, the place of the crucifixion, the Stone of the Anointing and the place of burial of Jesus.
In this very place there is also the symbolic Christian Ombble of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem, built in the place where, according to a Christian legend, there was a tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem there is also the most sacred place for the Jews, the Wall of Lamentations; the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in the year 70 AD.
As is tradition, people of different religions leave notes here with their desires, which will then come true.
Perform a vertical journey
The ruins of the Masada Fortress were what remained of a secret refuge against the enemies, which Herod the Great had built in the year 25 BC for his family.
They are located in the mountain cliffs at a height of 450 m above sea level.
And getting there by their own means, can only those who dedicate themselves to climbing.
The others can reach this historic summit on the funicular.
And in the north of the country at an altitude of 1600-2040 m is the famous ski resort Hermón, where in the winter months there is a great influx of tourists.
To there, bus services are offered from the foot of the hill.
The total length of the ski slopes is 45 km.
According to an ancient legend, pagan gods were supposedly inhabited on the top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
In this country there are about 300 museums.
On a single trip you won't be able to visit them all.
But it's worth visiting at least five of them, the most interesting.
Among them is the Israel Museum, located near the Knesset (Israeli Parliament).
In it are preserved the ancient Manuscripts of the Dead Sea or Qumran Rolls, discovered in the caves of the Judean desert, and about 500,000 archaeological and anthropological pieces.
It is worth visiting the Museum of Art in Tel Aviv.
In his exhibition of paintings he has paintings by impressionists and expressionists such as Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall or Picasso.
In Acre you can visit the Al Basha Bath Museum, which are some rooms of ancient Turkish baths with model figures of visitors and bathers of that time.
In Cesarea it is worth going through the exclusive private museum Ralli, where you can admire the sculptures of Rodin and Dalí.
There are no tour guides or souvenir shops there.
The entrance is free, and categorically no donations are accepted.
The fifth, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, shows one of the most dramatic pages in history.
The most tragic section is the Children's Memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter it and find yourself in absolute darkness.
The stars shine.
And the names of Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they lost their lives sound.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Health
The three main tourist areas of Israel are on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of them there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphin parks and oceanographic museums.
It is curious that in the Red Sea they are bathed even in the winter months, as the water temperature does not fall from 21 degrees and the air is heated to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and there they bathe all year round.
By the way, this sea, the most extraordinary in the world, is at the lowest point on the planet: at 417 m below sea level.
The blue waters there are a brine that easily sustain even those who do not know how to swim.
The surrounding landscapes are truly beautiful.
People come here to spend treatment courses with salt water, brine and healing clays and to strengthen their health in cases of dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and to put in order their broken nerves.
Touching the mysteries of antiquity
They are preserved in the ancient part of Tel Aviv, the Jaffa citadel, on the Mediterranean coast.
It passed through the famous maritime route linking Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it was here that Noah built his ark and Perseus rescued the beautiful Andromeda with whom, in this very place, he lived a long and happy life.
Tourists love to walk through the narrow streets that bear the names of the signs of the Zodiac.
They say if you touch the walls on the street of your "same" symbol, fortune will be favorable to you.
In Jaffa you can find couples of newlyweds who come from all over Israel, and even from other countries to be photographed.
And in Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can walk through the Roman theater, "take" the fortress of the Crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
The theatre, carefully restored, is now used for night concerts and opera shows.
Tourists remember
If you travel to Israel, don't worry if your English leaves much to be desired: in this country about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
The money for this trip is not recommended to carry it in euros, but in dollars, which can be easily changed to shekels (currently $1-3,8 shekels).
Urban transport consists mainly of buses, but in Jerusalem there is a fast tram and in Haifa there is the only metro line in the country, which consists of six stations and connects the Lower City with the Upper City.
Actually, it's from an underground funicular.
Travelling on any type of public transport costs 6 shekels and for this price you can travel by transhipment for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated on Saturdays.
From Friday night to Saturday sunset, markets and shops close and public transport interrupts their work.
But Sunday morning begins a new work week.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels only kosher food is served, which excludes pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes in which milk and meat are combined.
There is a wide selection of dishes based on beef and lamb, soups and desserts prepared with coconut milk, the traditional Hebrew cream called hummus, a wide variety of sauces, Falafel, which are balls of ground chickpea, fruits and vegetables.
There are no street dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
On the other hand, there are many well-fed cats who "walk to their liking" in an impressive way.
At night you can see them sleeping even on the roofs of parked cars.
The snorers love the crowded places and do not reject the sweets.
Car rental, depending on the brand, will cost from $37 (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) per day.
Besides insurance, it goes out for $15 a day.
And the rent of a bicycle will come for 15 shekels a day.
Museum entrances cost an average of 30 shekels.
Israel in figures
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
The majority of those who came to visit the country and rest were citizens of the USA, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and Ukraine.
The Promised Land, from January to October 2012, was visited by 118,8 thousand Ukrainian tourists, a figure that surpasses 51 per cent at the same rate in 2010, before the cancellation of the visa regime on 9 February 2011.
"The great and powerful" will take you to Moscow: immigrants save for language
As deputies and human rights defenders discuss the consequences of the mandatory examination law, timulators who trade in "false" certificates have already appeared in the country.
Every year, 13 million immigrant workers arrive in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities in Russia.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asian countries: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to help their families who have stayed at home.
Since 1 December a law comes into force, according to which every working immigrant must carry out an examination to check his or her knowledge of the Russian language.
For the time being, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service delivery sector, community service institutions, domestic services and retail trade.
However, over time, as promised by the Federal Immigration Service, examinations will be made mandatory for all immigrants.
Moreover, it will not be enough to give the examination of the language, but also of Russian history and of the fundamentals of the legislation.
Knowledge of the language must be confirmed even in order to receive and renew the work permit.
The citizens of countries where Russian is the official language are exceptions.
Persons who obtained their education and diplomas prior to the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 will not be subject to this law.
Usefulness, fatality and defence of rights
The network of examination centres will operate under the auspices of the Russian Language Institute Pushkin, the University of Friendship of Peoples, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian higher education institutions.
Immigrants will be able to take the test in all cities, right now in Russia more than 160 such centers are open.
The initiative on the introduction of the examination was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and the Federal Immigration Service.
But rights defenders, long before the law came into force, often managed to ask this question to the press: And what will this actually bring?
What changes will the compulsory knowledge of the language bring, both for Russians and for immigrants themselves?
First, the representatives of the Immigration Service respond, which will reduce the number of people suffering from "labour slavery".
Many people today talk about defending the rights of working immigrants, explains Victor Sebelev, head of the Russian Federal Immigration Service in Tajikistan.
The defence of their rights must be initiated before their departure.
Only an organized selection system will solve the problem of immigrant workers in 90% of cases.
Problems are experienced by immigrants without a profession, education, those who do not know the language or pass the medical check-up.
Without understanding the language, Sebelev says, the future immigrant will be condemned to find unscrupulous people who, on the pretext of helping, put a "paid trip" to a creepy and narrow cove, where he and dozens of others like him are consumed for months without food or documents, working from 12 to 14 hours a day.
We received countless complaints from our immigrants.
"In their homeland they promise one thing, but when they arrive they are deceived, they are deprived of their passports, they do not pay the promised wages," confirms the Chief of the Labour Immigration Directorate of the Tajikistan Immigration Service, Tolib Sharipov.
Don't be mad, little boss!
However, in the meantime, many citizens of Central Asian republics who wish to work in Russia recognize that they do not only know the language of the country to which they intend to go, but also that they write with difficulty in their own language.
Of course, this is not so much their fault but their own misfortune: there are few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajiks who can afford to receive normal primary education.
This is because their families even have nothing to feed the children, not to mention already dressing them, wearing them and buying them what they need for school.
When they reach adolescence, these boys venture to work at the first chance.
It's hard, if you don't know the language, they recognize it.
"One feels humiliated and inferior."
However, with regard to the language law, rights defenders pointed to an important point.
The exams will be conducted only for those immigrants whose status is legal.
If they do not have that status, there will be no examination and therefore no official work.
Meanwhile, most immigrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or forbidden passage to strangers"
Many visitors claim that receiving official status in our country is not so easy.
The cause lies in the bureaucratic obstacles and difficulties of the language itself.
In addition, legalization costs money: from twelve thousand to sixteen thousand rubles.
However, a false inscription can be made quickly and for only one thousand five hundred rubles.
The employees of the Russian police know that we usually carry false documents, we are not registered and cases of extortion appear.
"We are asked for a hundred or two hundred roubles for cigarettes or tea," Tajik citizen Umed Hushkadamov told reporters.
"Come on, don't be cheap, buy a painting"
On the first day of the entry into force of the Language Act, it was revealed that not only immigration registration documents can be false.
Several "false" language certificates have already been seized by officials of the Federal Immigration Service.
The falsified documents had been printed on standard color printers.
Of course, they came to the hands of the new owners not as a gift: each immigrant, wanting to facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is two and a half times more expensive than the official examination procedure, which will cost the immigrant worker three thousand rubles.
The main task for the near future is to protect the system from corruption so that "diplomas" cannot be bought, government officials and rights defenders converge.
So far, the authorities can promise immigrant workers that they would not have been able to pass the exam the first time they had been able to study the basic language course.
In addition, immigrants who do not speak Russian will be offered jobs that do not require active communication with people.
Ministry of the Interior does not take drastic measures against illegal arms trade
The percentage of crimes committed with registered weapons is quite small
The Ministry of the Interior proposes to apply the law more rigidly in relation to owners of weapons for civilian use.
This is the government's reaction to the recent incidents: Squeezing shots during wedding celebrations where luckily there were no victims, and the massacre initiated by Moscow lawyer Dimitri Vinográdov, in which Squeezing seven people lost their lives.
The police want to prohibit the use and possession of traumatic weapons in public places and raise the minimum age for obtaining a licence to carry weapons from 18 years to 21 years.
This idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that reforms to the law on possession of weapons will be brought to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is happy with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to counter this problem by applying the "hard-handed policy".
An open letter has appeared on the network, whose authors, representatives of various social organizations of shooters, demand that such measures of "sensical certainty" be abandoned.
The percentage of reported acts of vandalism with the use of weapons is minimal, according to the BBC news service in Russia, criminal lawyer Vasily Lésnikov.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, 142 firearms offences were committed during the six months of 2012 registered in internal organs, compared to a total of 1,168 crimes registered for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that stricter legislation in the civilian weapons sector will not be an inconvenience for the offender to go to the black market.
Now, according to his words, in Moscow you can find any weapon at low price.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior states that the situation of the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The black arms market is supplied through several channels.
The main channels are years, says retired Colonel Víctor Baranets, who for ten years worked in the Ministry of Education and the High General Staff.
Screenshot of the website that accepts weapons orders
The first, "army or military patrol," that is, the weapons that were stolen during the military actions in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by the Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves," says Baranets.
The following type of "black weapon" is stolen by criminals and security forces representatives.
Baranets explains that this includes stolen weapons from police warehouses and those stolen directly by law enforcement officials.
Illegal weapons come for sale from military arsenals.
In many military arsenals there were often explosions.
"There are proven versions that some fires were premeditated to cover the fault," says an ex-military.
According to Baranets, weapons manufacturers also put their sand granite.
"They have now proliferated private weapons factories that are not competitive in the international market and distribute roped weapons to the black market, including that of Moscow," says the expert.
One more source of the black market is smuggling.
A lot of guns and machine guns come from poor countries like Kyrgyzstan.
"There they have their own production, sometimes artisanal, and a mafia has been formed that has organized the flow of weapons," explains the former military.
Where do the guns come from?
Experts have calculated the approximate share of each of these sources of supply of illegal weapons to the black market.
A report on this topic was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Public Management Planning.
The specialists analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminological bibliography and public access data on portals whose theme revolves around weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to the investigators, come from the armed forces and the security forces.
Half of the black market weapons have arrived there "because of officials whose work is related to weapons," the report says.
According to researchers, 17 per cent of weapons come from places where armed conflicts occur, 14 per cent of cases are stolen during weapons production and 5 per cent are "illegal archaeology".
The dependent of one of the weapons stores, who asked for his last name not to be mentioned, says that the weapons found by illegal excavators have not been bought by anyone for a long time because they are too old.
More often, he says, suppliers go to military warehouses when they need a match.
Through some ensign, the supplier buys a unit, for example a TT gun.
They remove it from the register and pass it over the fence.
"This one takes the gun to the city and sells it to 900 euros per unit with two shippers," he tells us
"But, of course, the police are aware of all matters, so periodically, when the crime discovery plan has to be complied with, they shop for evidence from illegal arms dealers," the addict adds.
"Like in a luxury boutique"
The seller and buyer are often found through acquaintances.
"I visited websites and blogs until a guy who proposed that I go to the "Begovaya" platform, where there would be a man who would take me to a "skinny" where we could negotiate.
Of the price of the gun, I found out only there."
Military commentator Viktor Baranets
"To get a gun I need a friend who has contacts," says the shop clerk. "I have a friend like that, but I don't trust him much."
In the markets there are sellers, but there also has to be, let's say "from Mr. Ivanovih, who asked him to tell him that his daughter had dropped a tooth."
I can even get a couple of steel knobs through a trusted person.
He also supplies them only to me because he knows I'm not going to rat him out.
Newbies look for weapons in different ways.
Ex-military Viktor Baranets was tested as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he was about to publish an article on this subject.
The schemes, according to his words, have not changed.
He was handed a photo album where there was no "everything".
"I felt like I was in a luxury boutique," recalls the military.
The buyer, according to Baranets's words, is not offered a cat for hare: everything there is can be tasted.
I, as a potential customer, not only buy; we go with the seller to the forest, where we put a target.
"They give me the opportunity to shoot and when I make sure the gun fires well, we start negotiating," the expert describes the procedure.
Sofa shop
Web search engines lead to sites and groups of "Vkontakte", where you are offered to buy weapons "for different purposes".
No document or personal encounters are required for this.
"It's enough to have a certain amount of money," they write in the title of the advertisement "Buying a gun or a machine gun."
There users make their orders and ask questions.
And they sell to minors?
"Without permission, of course," asks the user "Iván" (preserved spelling).
"I buy TT. Moscow gun," Laconically asks your question "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictitious websites and captures at two hands those who wish to buy firearms.
And people go, like hungry fish to the bait, and then, to extract coal in Siberia
military commentator and ex-military Viktor Baranets
I have heard of these systems: usually, the website is registered out of the reach of Russian laws.
People make orders.
The buyer makes the payment through an ATM.
"In response, they send you a photo and instructions to let you know where the weapon is hidden," says the NGO's press secretary "The Right to Arms", Dmitri Kislov.
Viktor Baranets claims that if you order online, you run out of gun and put him in jail.
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictitious websites and captures at two hands those who wish to buy firearms.
"And people go, like hungry fish to bait, and then, to extract coal in Siberia," he says.
Makarov for $100
In the purchase of illegal firearms, according to experts, one can be spent from $100 to $900.
According to Dmitri Kislov of the NGO "The Right to Arms", a Makarov gun can be purchased for $100-300.
We'll have to wait a month and a half.
It's sent from the military warehouses by middle-ranking chiefs.
According to official statistics of the Ministry, the total number of such crimes in Russia was reduced by 7 per cent compared with January-October 2011, representing 22,900, and the number of identified cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8 per cent.
Employees of fast food restaurants and supermarkets in the U.S. are on strike.
Up to a quarter of American teens find their first jobs as cashiers at "McDonald's"
In recent days, a wave of protests has begun in the United States against the low wages paid at Walmart Corporation supermarkets and restaurants in popular fast food chains, such as "McDonald's", "Burger King", "Taco Bell", "Wendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken".
For now no one dares to assert whether or not this wave will reach the nine points, or whether it is destined to lose strength and soften itself in its early stages.
Protest actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing NGOs.
In addition to the increase in the modest wages received by Walmart workers and those of the fast food system, the aim of the organizers of the protests is the creation of workers' unions in these companies.
For now, this sector of the economy has hardly been occupied by the trade union movement.
Forty-six cents a year?
The actions began last week, after Thanksgiving, the so-called "Black Friday." That day, in the United States, the orgy of sale that captured millions of inhabitants, which was sometimes accompanied by confrontations, was co-occurring in the United States.
On that day, workers from the Walmart Corporation, which employs 2.2 million people in the world, left their jobs and formed pickets of protest alongside the unions and left-wing activists in the corporation's stores, whose products are directed at people of modest and moderate incomes.
Walmart sells everything from diapers, hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products in their stores are on average between 8% and 27% cheaper than those in larger supermarkets.
That's why many Walmart's low-paid workers buy only at work.
The availability and assortment of products have made Walmart one of the largest corporations in America.
According to two critics, Walmart can afford to sell products at very low prices, partly because it pays little to its workers.
The latter also complain about poor working conditions, such as lack of lifts or hand scanners.
This "Black Friday" the participants of the demonstration demanded an increase in wages and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation increased from $30 to $100 per month.
For a typical Walmart worker, who receives $9.5 an hour, this expense is excessive, they said.
Scientists at the University of California in Berkeley argue that if Walmart increases the average salary to $12 per hour, this will cost the corporation $3.2 billion.
This is about 1.1% more than it spends on wages now.
If Walmart places the wage increase on the shoulders of consumers, every visit to the store will cost them only 46 cents more.
In one year they will spend the ridiculous amount of $12.39 more than they spend now.
Walmart's supporters are satisfied that the protest took place only in nine states and that it did not cause any loss to the corporation.
The "Black Friday" lasted in its stores from 8 p.m. on Thursday until midnight the following day and, during that time, Walmart sold about 5000 items per second.
In total, their cash registers carried out the "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.
The company's representative, Dan Fogelman, stated in an interview with the left-wing website Huffington Post, that they left their "less than five" Walmart employees job and that the protest had been nothing more than "another PR trick," organized by the workers' union.
"Free box!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where the targets were not precisely the Walmart department stores (which in this progressive city do not appreciate them, and so for now there are none), but the "McDonald's" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says he sells billions of portions, and then they don't even grant you sick leave and they don't pay you for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, New York City City Council Member
Currently, according to federal and New York law, the minimum wage is $7.25 per hour.
Fast food restaurants are increasing it over time, but only slightly, and on average, ordinary workers receive $8.90 per hour in New York City.
No one earns less than them in this city.
How it's possible to survive in New York with that money, for me it's incomprehensible.
There was a time when almost a quarter of American teenagers went through the McDonald's and worked there, behind the counters, part-time after school, although they still lived with their parents.
Few people saw this as the main source of income or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now, I constantly stumble into some interviews with McDonald's workers who complain that they have to live off this salary, and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, in a Wall Street Journal forum there is a comment whose author points out that it is irresponsible to have children if he does not know what to eat with them.
Participants in the protests, which began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday morning at McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and fast-food cooks start paying at least $15 per hour, i.e. that their current minimum wage be doubled.
They also demanded that workers' unions be set up in the fast food sector.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from preventing this right and punishing the activists of the trade union movement with arrogance and dismissals.
On the other hand, administration rarely makes life easier for them.
But, for objective reasons, it is easy for unions to cover the fast food sector.
One of the main issues is the excessive turnover of staff.
Disagreements
Noisy protests took place that same day in other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The completion of the action took place in the middle of the McDonald's meeting near Times Square, in which several local democrat politicians participated, in particular the City Council member Jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald's says he is selling billions of portions, and then he doesn't even give you a hospital or pay you for your honest work."
The protesters received the support of other prominent New York Democrats, for example the Mayor of the city candidate Bill de Blasio, who said that "we must support workers in the fast food sector to achieve fair wages and the economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves."
As described in the New York Times, this has been the largest manifestation of this type in American fast food history.
But in it only a few hundred people participated, even not all of them were employees of the fast food service, in which tens of thousands of people from New York worked.
It is not yet clear whether this will serve as a spark for mass movement.
"For now, cheating on the brain isn't that easy."
The theme of augmented reality, so popular among modern technology enthusiasts, is recently perceived with normality mainly through the prism of special glasses.
At the beginning of the summer, at its annual conference Google demonstrated a moving model and later, in November, it was known that Microsoft had also filed an application to claim the corresponding patent.
However, a conversation with the head of the 3D interactive technology group at the Microsoft lab in Cambridge, Izadi Sharamom, revealed that for the company's scientists, glasses already belonged to a past stage.
They are attracted to the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with bare hands and creating open virtual spaces.
- Please, in general terms, what is the subject of your research group's study?
- We are dedicated to the person-computer interaction, but we also try to broaden the limits of this interaction.
For now humanity in its great mass has been trapped in the stage of work with the pixels of the flat screen, sometimes touching it with the finger.
But we want to look 5-10 years ahead and guess the cardinal changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors represent a step forward and today no Xbox is sold without Kinect, as everyone is interested in gesture control.
- What else does the future hold for us?
- Although Kinect has brought interaction to the physical level, much of it still happens on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The introduction of information has improved (the system receives more data), and the output is not yet very good.
We're trying to change this, we're working on truly three-dimensional visualization systems, based on different technologies, including design.
The world must be freed from computing to ours, to the physicist, to make it more tangible.
For this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user, but also the space that surrounds him.
Then we can complete the real world with virtual objects in a more comfortable way.
First of all, fuck those stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
A very popular detail, but don't you think they overestimate it?
- Of course it cannot be considered a panacea, it remains to solve the question of privacy, since it is not always wanted that others learn about our actions and intentions.
In fact, all types of computer interaction are good, but each in its own field.
For example, for the control of devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not loose movements, but shorter ones.
In addition, the gestures were captured not by the camera of the device, but by a bracelet that recorded the movement of the bones and muscles.
For now it is very large, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But, in general, the future is for a combined type of control, e.g. gesture + voice.
- How's that?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass you this can of soda?
You'll talk and show it at the same time.
- I usually just talk.
- Oh, that's gonna be very hard to recognize.
- I mean, do you want to force users to adapt to what the machine can or cannot do right now?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual rapprochement.
I think that in the near future we will have to work mainly on the design of new types of sensors that can accurately determine the reactions of the person.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, as they provide good resolution in depth, which is very important.
- If we talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what complaints do you have about modern cameras?
Do they lack resolution, depth or anything else?
- In principle, the current generation is what can be the beginning of our work with three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at the speed of 1000 fps.
But the question is not in the megapixels, but in the quality of the matrix and in depth.
From this last point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us; this gives more work to algorithm designers.
That is, we have to remember not only the resolution in the X and Y axes, but also in Z.
Speed is also important, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic and the current 30 fps are truly scarce, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our laboratory in Redmond, made a contact sensor with adjustable processing delay of 1 to 100 ms and it should be mentioned that the modern sensors produced in series are closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands to what extent this affects man-machine interaction.
It would be very useful to me for my work an equivalent of such a device, but it does not require contact so that the frames per second are more.
- And there's no need to increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect now has three "chambers", one of which is in fact the infrared transmitter and the second the receiver of the reflected signal.
But the third camera is actually a simple sensor of the visible pitcher.
This is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially, more cameras could solve the problem...
Or, on the contrary, increase it and increase the required amount of calculations.
It would be good to create a flexible Kinect analog, play with the location curvature of the cameras and see how this would help determine the three-dimensional position.
- As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, has not presented its glasses to the public.
Don't you think that, from the point of view of daily use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the most visible platforms?
- Of course, spending all the time holding a smartphone up in your hands, it's not very comfortable, but I think: the best option would be an augmented reality "transmutable" when, based on a cloud platform, you could move from glasses to the smartphone,
Glasses are very personal devices, in that is your strength (private things only you will be able to see them), but also your weakness: an augmented reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only for Tony Stark of the film "Iron Man", but also for any mere mortal.
There is a problem in this idea that critics often point out: there is no tactile answer!
Hands don't feel anything!
What answers does your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my lectures I often say that augmented reality is the seventh burst in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth good could be the addition of tactile sensations.
Meanwhile, one of the most interesting tricks is the use of the second hand as a support for the image.
Record the touch perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are truly aimed at bringing tangibility to these "images in the air." For example, the interference of several ultrasonic rays directed at a specific point where the finger is located gives a feeling similar to that one feels if someone was blowing it in the fingertips, but that feeling is still very weak.
There are also wrist bracelets that influence the nerve endings of the fingers, this is also a promising direction.
- Have you tried to fool the brain?
Make him think he feels what it looks like he should feel the moment he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried yet.
Here we hide another challenge with which we will have to fight for a long time, how to make a person physically located in a very small space believe that it goes to an open space, almost endless. We are also working on the idea of racing tapes (not like those of gyms), mobile platforms, as well as that of giant balloons.
For now, cheating on the brain is not so easy, we still have to work for many years.
That's what makes the work with virtual reality attractive to researchers, that many things are in a state of total conception.
Subjective personal taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "Vanguardism of St. Petersburg", dedicated to the citizens in front, to the avant-garde of art and culture.
In this list of the best there are brilliant figures of the art and scene of Saint Petersburg, whose achievements reach beyond the city: they often find recognition in Europe without Russia even knowing them.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city meets Kirill Miller, a bearded man dressed in red from above, who can be found near the Russian Museum, near the Summer Garden or at fashion meetings and openings.
Kirill Miller's paintings always attract crowds, wherever they show up.
Kirill Miller is one of those purely socio-philosophers of St. Petersburg, creators of new mythology.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant representative of St. Petersburg's avant-garde in the late 80s - early 90s.
In addition, he is an urban man, whose appearance on the streets of the city awakens in the smiling inhabitants and raises everyone's mood.
Recently, he took in his hands an organ and became the organist of St. Petersburg, as he has matured to make such a difficult role, for his bohemian existence, his philosophy and his image.
Kirill, why are you going around town dressed in red and not yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose the red color because I am a fashion designer and I dedicate myself to appearance and image.
In this world, red is a commitment between the artist, the creators of images and society.
Although in society, anything that is not a bit grey arouses aggressiveness and agitation of ungood properties.
But my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation.
The whole history of my provocative actions is an invitation to debate.
- When did you realize you were supposed to be an artist?
- In an exhibition at the Nevsky Palace of Culture, where my works were exhibited.
I realized that was my way.
Then the wave of old unofficial artists had ended, and the new ones, free like me, were still misunderstood.
I became friends with artists of the new wave, with the later ones exposed in Gaza and Nevskiy, which led to "Pushkinskaya-10", and the new wave is over.
I got into the theater for the clothes, the music of all genres, but not the lyrics.
For me it was important to meet at the cultural center of St. Petersburg, where the best creative minds were to be gathered.
In 1995, I occupied a territory in Pushkinskaya-10 and there, while there were no reforms, there was a musical artistic club, a bohemian club, the house of Bohemian Saint Petersburg.
Many were born there: Noms, Tequila Jazz, I remember how Schnur brought the project to "The Van Gogh Ear".
Schnur and his friends sang light songs under phonograms, wore tight pants, among them was currently the fashion composer Igor Vdovin.
When the band started playing live, it became Leningrad.
Trachtenberg was an animator of many programs before the times of Hali-galivskih.
We gave Trachtenberg and it was the beginning of his great career; basic education and training received it from us.
Gallery "D 137", the "Club Griboyedov", are the remains of the Art Clinic.
There went our employees and regular customers.
I'm a hero of the last century, when culture meant something.
In 2000, the survey was made in the press, the prize was "The People of Our City".
In the nomination "Artist of the Year" I was elected, so ended my culmination.
In these new times it is not comfortable to work; I am a man who likes the truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In our times it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are separated. One can be popular but very little worship.
- There's something recognizable about your work.
- Many of my paintings are hits, in them the actuality and the occurrence is clearly expressed.
I'm going to make a scheduled exhibition, "The Russian Museum in clowns."
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be sociable, but now being so is painful and terrifying.
But in clowns, everything gets bogged down and tragedy is eliminated.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the salvation of the world through a totalitarian and compulsory change of clothes.
Now one is being followed by clothing, orienting himself on the outside, but not on the inside of the person.
And maybe that person doesn't even have to give a hand, but spit in his face.
And the deception will be eliminated when you change clothes.
We recently saw you in the role of urban organillera.
Who better than me to be!
- Well, maybe commercial art can be beautiful?
- Now commercial art must be scrupulous, sweet, tactful.
We are witnessing the disintegration of cultures.
People used to group in herds, bohemians wanted one thing, simplons wanted another.
Now everyone has been divided into microcommunities, it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar ticket for everyone to like.
Now you have to think about who you want to like.
Now, every cult hero has his 100 fans.
- And to hear Stas Mikhailov come for thousands!
- They're going to see the abandoned ones, that's where the sex-social sphere works.
And to a cultural event there are 300 people, 10,000 will never come. As a result, less management, less money, everything fades.
I have my fans, the most important thing is not to fool them, not to spoil what you've achieved.
When he was young he made such paintings that a collector had them hung on the wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings, with which people usually end.
Now they often confuse concepts.
They say spiritual culture, consumption culture.
There is no culture in consumption, that's another story.
I am a man of yesterday's culture, I grew up under the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused money just to paint pictures.
I am in favour of this culture.
- Kirill, what's wrong with St. Petersburg?
- Good culture experts.
There is one concept: official of culture.
But not all of them can devote themselves to culture.
When kings were the right all was otherwise, kings might not understand culture very well, but they knew that it was necessary to keep the right experts.
In Moscow there are now very good consultants.
We have people in St. Petersburg who may well be experts, but they are closed, because we need experts at a higher level who properly evaluate these and make their way.
The subjective personal taste is now flourishing.
The same Erarta, but the difference is that they honestly say that not all modern art is accepted, there are some artists who have to look for other museums.
- What's St. Petersburg to you?
- Saint Petersburg is not a cultural capital. Moscow has much more culture, there is ground there.
But it's hard for art to grow on our stones.
We need cultural ground and now we have more writers than readers, this is wrong.
There are a lot of curious people in Europe who go to exhibitions and concerts.
In our case, this class is tiny.
We have to make art fashionable, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project will be implemented with a Saint Petersburg grant.
Give birth in space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
Spaceship caravans with humans on board leave in search of a spare planet.
To preserve humanity, the main question is asked: How to continue the species in conditions of pregnancy or on the same replacement planet?
I think there's little to choose from.
In fact, only two are true planets that can be colonized, at least hypothetically.
"These are Venus and Mars," says the head researcher of the State Astronomical Institute, Sternberg P.K. (IAES), Vladimir Surdin.
But if the conditions on Mars are better for life, on the surface of Venus the temperature is 500 degrees.
You can only live at high altitudes or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
We began to address reproductive problems in the space with the flora.
Half a century ago, plant experiments were carried out.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit did not differ at all from terrestrial varieties.
Then came the breeding of insects in the orbit, small flies of the fruit, the drosophiles.
In 1979 quail eggs were sent to the space to check how the embryo develops under conditions of pregnancy.
We get a normal chick as a result.
But then the trouble begins.
"The problem is that this chick has to find support, it has to stand on its own feet and start moving," explains Vladimir Sychev, director of the laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IPBM) of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
When they found no support, the chicks turned randomly.
And after 10 hours in newborns there was a total atrophy of instincts.
The chicks did not react to light or sound.
And the misfortune was that after four days they just died.
"And twice we got the chicks born, but then we left it because it was impossible to work there with them," says Vladimir Sychev about the failure of the experiment with chicks in space.
The last time a biological "miniarch" flew into orbit was 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, in the biosatellite "Bion" only species of the same sex will travel.
There was an experiment with rats, which were sent into space already with fetuses.
In principle, nothing supernatural was found.
"This was precisely in the biosatellites, but this was a unique experiment, and studies like this should be carried out," says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the space rats had offspring.
However, the problem of reproduction directly in space has not yet been addressed.
It's a tough challenge.
Animals, by losing their usual habitat, simply cannot realize their sexual instinct.
Man, however, unlike small animals, can in principle.
Homo sapiens has abstract reasoning and is able to create an adequate emotional background.
Similar experiments are not conducted for ethical reasons.
But women have been traveling in space for 50 years now.
Tereshkova's greatest risk.
And the most precious thing that humanity has is the female organism.
Our seagull flying, and no one on Earth could say, if it's after a flight into space.
You may or may not have a baby after this flight.
"After all, no one has answered this question," says aerospace veteran Vakhtang Vachnadze.
In June 1964, only after a year of flight to space, the first cosmonaut woman, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The girl's father, Andrian Nikolayev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second cosmonaut woman, Svetlana Savitskaya, who was twice in orbit and even worked in open space, had a son.
However, the risk persists.
We are few, astronauts are counted to whom after long flights everything has worked out well, and a healthy generation is growing.
"And if you can say more, it is dangerous even on orbital flights," sums up the cosmonaut pilot, hero of the Soviet Union, hero of Russia, Valery Polyakov.
However, humanity must look for some new ways in biotechnology, in radiological protection, in the creation of artificial gravity.
The hydrolaboratory of the Centre for the preparation of cosmonauts is a mandatory stage in the preparation for flight.
Under conditions of zero buoyancy, cosmonauts practice their work skills in space.
Water simulates pregnancy.
If for an adult water is a comfortable environment, although still hostile, for a newborn child it is its birth element.
Small amphibian-men seem to confirm that life on earth arose from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is about 9 months inside his mother in the amniotic fluid, as it will be easier for him to get used to the water later.
In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth to the time of the first bath only 2 weeks pass.
"This is too little to forget," says Marina Aksenova, a newborn swim monitor.
In short, if pregnancy is a more natural state for a newborn, for women it is necessary to gravitation, the force of gravity.
In pregnancy, the abdominal and pelvis muscles are very rapidly decrepit, the ability to expel the fetus is reduced.
Well, we omitted that, relying on the action of stimulants for delivery.
You can, of course, give birth in a special camera, this one will push you.
"And then what?", Valeri Polyakov asks himself this original question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without the feeling of gravity, the body does not generate the skeleton or the muscle system.
A newborn in orbit is impossible to wear in a special suit for training, like adults.
He will simply be deprived of what is vital to him.
"And this experiment that we are going to do together, allowing the birth of a child in a strange environment, will result in bringing to Earth a disabled person, a totally inadequate person," said the head of the bioethics committee of the Institute of Biomedical Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.
For now, the birth of children in space is a theoretical issue.
However, in time this will be a reality, when human beings on their ships head to a distant planet that will be home to their children born in space.
Head of NKÚ: The inspection of the "švarc" system has not met the guilty politician
In the area of public procurement, the Czech Republic has good inspectors and quality legislation, although its implementation is poor.
This is what Miloslav Kala, vice president of the Office of Supreme Control (NKÚ) says in an interview for Aktuálně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect", but its application must be correct. "This, in my opinion, is what we lack", thus describes the current situation.
The joint controls of the Czech and German inspectors also come to similar conclusions.
As an example of an incorrect practice, he mentions Petr Nečas' attitude towards the system of being autonomous only on paper, which is known as the "švarc" system.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS (Civic Democratic Party) would not bother entrepreneurs with inspectors. So, is it prohibited or allowed?
"The law must be regulated in some way and if it prohibits something, in that case, neither the president of the government can prevent the performance of the office that has the obligation to carry out such controls nor impose obligations," Kala notes.
At the meeting of the Monitoring Committee at the Congress of Deputies, you spoke about the common project between the Czech and German teams, in which the legislation on public tenders in both countries was compared.
What exactly is it?
It is a parallel control that we began to carry out some two years ago.
In a simplified way: European legislation regulates how public tenders should be organised, this is followed by the legislation in force in each country and then by the practice itself.
We have united everything and, although the control has not yet been completed, we have obtained very interesting differences. Generally, our country's legislation is "stressier and more complete", however, concrete praxis in some parameters is better in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to incorporate ever stricter rules, but that it is necessary to focus on the application of the law itself.
What can this project actually bring? What do you think are the conclusions?
It is precisely this kind of common control that could help us to stop investing in law-making, reducing and improving boundaries, even if this does not have such a positive impact.
The economy of savings means getting an appropriate thing at a reasonable price (which does not always mean that the price is the lowest) to avoid enrichment and, in the long run, criminal actions.
But not because we're reducing the bidding limit means we're going to get it.
Perhaps because the system is saturated with so much "papeleo" that those who want to look for flaws in the system will be able to do so more easily than if the limits were kept as high as they are now.
You talk about the problems of our country with the transfer of legislation regulating the practice of public tenders.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is it an office similar to our NKU or is it organized in another way?
As for offices, such as the NKU, there acts the Bundesrechnungshof (Federal Court of Auditors), with an organization similar to ours, with a school as well, the only thing is that in its case it is structured in a somewhat different way, but in principle both offices evolve in parallel.
The powers are also to a certain extent analogous, however, while Germany has a federal organization, the courts of accounts are even at this level. In this respect it differs slightly from our system.
The Federal Court of Auditors (BRH) can only control federal money, what we call state funds here.
Public funds, which are administered by the regions and municipalities, there, in Germany, are controlled by the Federal Court of Auditors.
As for local legislation, is it simpler than ours?
In general, I would not like to make a comparison without specific data, but Germany remains a model in some respects, but it is not clear exactly what is best at.
Could it be better, for example, as regards the quality of inspectors?
That's for sure not, but, I repeat, I don't like to make such comparisons.
It must be said that even those countries that we are modeling must face a large number of problems.
If it wasn't, it wouldn't be a benefit to them to cooperate with our office, would it?
With regard to our country's legislation, what did the amendment of the law on public procurement mean to your Office?
Given that the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short, it has not yet been stated in the control proceedings.
Since we carry out ex-post controls, we need to have a certain delay.
For the time being, we see in the process of preparing future controls: we have started a new tool for "non-economic risk detection", through which we have passed almost 14,000 public tenders, which have been analysed. The changes will be perfectly reflected here, as the limits are changed, the conditions of some types of selection process are rectified and similar.
Do you consider the adoption of this law to be beneficial, or rather a tangle for the bureaucratic system?
I believe that this law is surely a step in the right direction and I hope so.
The problem that may arise is that the regulations are "hardened" and impossible to comply with.
Already with the previous regulations, the controlled persons were linked to the contractor (e.g. in the case of regional operational programmes of the regional council), and each law not respected in the area of public awards meant a violation of budgetary discipline.
Does it make sense, then, to harden the law like this?
I don't think so.
The system should exclude those who want to attack or take advantage of it and not punish those who make a formal decision, which has no impact on decision-making.
Such a system will only create greater bureaucratic pressure.
And how does it come out of this?
We'll see where this initiated path leads.
The Prime Minister has recently stated that the SDG would not bother entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called švarc system, with reference to being autonomous only on paper. What does this mean?
Is the švarc" system prohibited or allowed?
The law must be regulated in some way and, if it prohibits anything, then not even the Prime Minister of the Government can prevent the Office from acting which has an obligation to carry out such controls and to demand obligations.
You can say, "We change the law and allow it," but you can't say we're going to act like nothing.
In the law on public procurement, the rules are quite strict as to how to act formally, and that is how it should be to protect public competition.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic to exclude the candidate with the best offer for failing to meet the formal requirements.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct. This, in my opinion, is what we lack.
Roads have ice plates, although they are mostly transitable
In several places in the Czech Republic, roads have ice and snow plates.
Although most of the routes are trasable, caution should be exercised in some cases.
Karlovy Vary Region
Today morning the roads in the Karlovy Vary region were transitable, but they had ice and snow plates.
The temperature drops and will vary between five and ten degrees below zero. During the day the thermometers will rise slightly.
It has stopped snowing in the region and in the lowlands the snow layer is fine.
On the other hand, in the peaks of the Metal Mountains snow reaches almost 30 centimeters.
In some places visibility was still poor due to fog, according to information from the regional road operations control centre.
The R6 expressway and the first-class road in the region are now accessible without restrictions.
However, extreme caution is recommended, especially on some bridges whose surface may be frozen and slippery.
All second and third category roads, including mountain roads, are also trasable.
However, in some of them there are still stretches of ice and snowy remains.
There is a need for increased attention on the road, especially in the higher areas.
Region of Pardubice and Hradec Králové
On some roads in eastern Bohemia there is a danger of frost and in higher areas and in the mountains a snow layer may have formed on the tracks, reports the Roads and Highways Directorate on its pages.
Road operators warn drivers of the danger of ice sheets, especially in higher areas of the Pardubice region.
Ice cream can occur in the vicinity of Lanškrouna, Ústí nad Orlicí, Poličky, Svitav or Vysokého Mýta, and especially on the second and third category roads.
Roads I/43 and I/34 in Svitav have been treated chemically.
There is snow especially on the roads of the Krkonoše mountains to Orlické hourly.
There is a flat layer of snow in the highest areas of the roads in the municipalities of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In the area of eastern Bohemia, the sky will today be between clear and partially cloudy, without precipitation.
Temperatures will usually range between three below zero and a positive degree, a weak wind will blow.
Pilsen Region
Roads in the Pilsen region are transitable today in the morning, although caution must be exercised and time must be adapted.
In the early hours of the morning there will be frost, temperatures will range from three to nine degrees below zero.
After snowfall and subsequent temperature declines, some tracks may also be covered with ice.
In some places drivers will find themselves in fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is what emerges from the information provided by the regional road operations control centre.
The D5 motorway is transitable almost without restrictions, although extreme caution is recommended, especially on the track between the kilometre 80 and 131.
The surface of most of the first category roads is dry and ice-free.
In the area of the road of Pilsen and Tachov border with Germany there may be sections with ice plates.
The second and third lanes are wet, so in this case, there are also sections with ice plates.
Drivers should be more cautious, especially in the less transited routes in the Šumava area.
Olomouc region
Drivers heading to the highest areas of the Olomouc region will find themselves in partially discarded snow.
After the chemical treatment, there was still snow in the port of Červenohorské and on the track towards Videlský kříž.
Road operators took off the snow during the night; about three centimeters of snow were accumulated on the Šumper road, according to track administrators.
In the rest of the region, the majority of roads are tradable without restrictions.
"In the highest areas of the Šumper road, there are remains of snow.
Drivers in the port of Červenohorské will meet with half-waste snow in the direction of Jeseník", a road operator from Šumper to ČTK confirmed today.
On the ground and at night his colleagues also came to the Jesenicka and, after the chemical treatment, the slopes of the highest areas are now clear and wet.
On the Olomouc road the roads are trasable without restrictions, on the Šternberská road the drivers should drive with caution in the forest sections, where the roads are still wet.
Ústí nad Labem region and Liberec region
Road operators in northern Bohemia have reported on complications in different stages early in the morning.
Apart from some places where it has snowed or frozen, according to the police database the mountain road between Telnice and Kninice in the region of Ústí nad Labem is closed.
Temperatures are kept below zero, even in the lower areas, so ice and snow obviously remain on the road. Instead, in the lower areas, especially in the southeast of the Czech central massif, there are no problems and the roads are usually dry.
There have been no service complications at the moment.
Road operators have warned of the presence of ice in the vicinity of Štětí.
According to meteorologists, the conditions have been ideal during the night. During the day rain and snow are expected to melt and at night the sky will be clear and there will be ice.
From the general roads, unfavourable conditions have been announced on road I/13, on the border between the region of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec.
The road between Telnice and Kninice had to be cut off by the branches of the trees that had bowed on the track with the weight of snow.
Šimon Ornest: In our concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
It is said that in a little less than a month the end of the world will come, what do you think about it?
It's just one of so many other alarmist news that we like to hold onto.
The Tap Tap music group likes to make jokes about this and we like to say that we are the only music group in the world that manages to gather enough positive energy to postpone the end of the world or to avoid it.
In addition, in December you organize a truly original project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you explain this to our readers?
This is a state benefit that we have been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential that has the end of the Mayan calendar enunciated for December 21 at 11:10 in the morning.
The previous day, on December 20 at 9 p.m., we will organize 3 simultaneous concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end at approximately the same time as the Mayan calendar ends on Kiribati Island, in the Pacific Ocean, 12 hours ahead of our time zone.
Who came up with this idea?
Initially it was my idea, then we were forging the project all together with our designer Honza Augusta.
In addition to wanting to gather enough positive energy and avoid the end of the world, we also want to reflect, together with society, on the state in which we will leave the world to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar we have also created a unique collection of articles: boots, t-shirts, bags and original keys against the end of the world that can be purchased at www.e-tap.cz, another way to support us.
The Tap Tap group, along with other interpreters, also sang the so-called anthem against the end of the world, entitled "End of the world, cancelled".
Currently it is very popular on YouTube, will you be able to hear at the benefit concerts?
Of course, and it'll be just the last, well, as long as everything goes well and the world doesn't end...
All the performers will sing it at the same time in the three concerts.
The hymns will be linked simultaneously thanks to the special live broadcast on Czech Television.
Tomáš Hanák has written the lyrics of this song and plays the leading role of Jesus in the video clip, where he also sings Xindl X...
How did this collaboration come about?
We work together even with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, apart from organizing many charity events and concerts...
We make every effort to participate in this project.
It has been shown that most of them are interested and have fun working with us.
What will the money raised at concerts against the end of the world be used for?
To equipment for the educational center without barriers Studeo, which we have completed in its sixth consecutive year with the civil association Tap in Jedličkův ústav.
Students of Jedličkův ustav school regularly receive visits from teachers with whom they perform fun and interesting activities.
Students do not have sufficient financial means to pay teachers and we make an effort to make it possible.
As part of the completion of the works in Jedličkův ústav, there will be an independent building to which we will move with this project.
In each concert several groups and interpreters act.
What are the selection criteria?
We try to develop a programme that is attractive to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan Barra, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý will act.
For more detailed information, please visit www.kpks.cz.
Do you have any other similar "spectacular action" planned in the future?
In May we will perform for the first time at the festival Pražské jaro, so here we will surely prepare an attractive program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to play at the Bohemian National Hall in New York and myself, personally, taking advantage of the fact that we are in the United States, I would like to complete it with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your plans abroad are not exactly minimalist, so far you have acted for example in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group made up of persons with disabilities.
How is the logistics and organization of these trips?
It's not as hard as it can look at first sight.
There are five members in electric wheelchair, the chairs must travel in the luggage compartment and we also carry a lot of weight, the boxes with the instruments...
So far, however, we've managed well. ČSA and British Airways were perfectly prepared, which I'm still surprised about.
Even in Moscow, from where we recently returned, everything came out smoothly.
Thanks to the departures abroad you can compare the different attitudes of society towards the disabled and other aspects.
What have you found yourselves with so far?
In Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, everything works better than here; in Russia we have witnessed that, in the east, there is a long way to go.
Unlike Prague, Moscow is full of barriers, there it is still not common for a person to travel alone through the center of the city in an electric wheelchair.
Something as common as it is, for example, giving preference to someone in a wheelchair in an elevator, there it is not.
Fortunately, a civil association had been set up, which was striving to thematicize the problems of persons with disabilities.
In what areas should we take an example of more advanced countries?
There are many aspects in which we go behind...
But it is important to mention that the improvement and improvement of the situation always depends on the people to whom it directly affects.
In London and Madrid it is very normal for people with a serious disability to move on their own in public and can go to the service, to the museum, wherever...
But it is not very common for a large number of people with disabilities to participate actively in social life, in this respect, with The Tap Tap Tap!
A respectful or barrier-free society is one thing, but when the time comes for eminent athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers to emerge, it will start to change everything for real.
So far, these are isolated cases of people who have great willpower.
The Tap Tap group is currently very popular, but if we look at it a few years ago, what led you to form the group in 1998?
I entered as an educator in Jedličkův ustav, where I had many young people around me who wanted to dedicate themselves to something.
And since I am a musician, I play, among others, the saxophone, I founded an amateur group with a co-worker.
And over time, as our moderator LÁJA Angelovič says, we got a little out of hand (laughs).
However, popularity did not come until the last few years, or am I wrong?
It is true that it helped us a lot to connect with famous singers and also to work actively to promote the group.
We come to the conclusion that the work that is not seen, is as if it does not exist.
With the help of the European Union, we can also afford quality teachers, equipment, etc.
Did you intend to go that far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning I saw the potential there was, that something else can be done.
The show world is full of things that look like each other.
It is logical, in its own way, that everything new is welcomed with caution and takes a long time to accept.
There are few extraordinary things, but I dare say that The Tap Tap is one of them.
The impression of someone who sees us for the first time is clearly compassion, it's a natural reaction...
But compassion is totally superfluous because people with disabilities are not abandoned beings who suffer and from whom we should have compassion.
There are people who are able to live a full life and develop, on the condition, of course, that they have the necessary means.
I always say that if something goes well for people with disabilities, then it is not just a breakthrough for them, but for society as a whole.
Did it help the fact that you're a demanding boss, as many people describe you?
If we want to do quality work, we have to be rigorous in many respects and demand some discipline.
I think it's completely normal.
Some people come with a romantic vision and head in the clouds and when they find out they have to go two days to rehearse, go to the preparatory test and spend a lot of time traveling and in concerts, the initial euphoria quickly abandons them.
But that's how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and get something.
The Tap Tap Group currently has 20 members.
How many of them were already in early 1998?
Only one, there's Angelovič.
We're an open group, people come in and out, you can't help it.
Whoever has will and will will will always find the doors open
It will be the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 at 9 p.m.
It will take place in the Incheba Arena of Prague, in Fléda de Brno and in Plynojem in Ostrava and will participate 12 groups and other musicians of the Czech Republic
The three cities will connect at the end of the evening via videoconference to sing the song of the group The Tap Tap "End of the World, canceled"
The aim of the concert is to gather the necessary resources to finance multifunctional equipment of the educational centre without barriers STUDEO in Jedličkův ústav of Prague, whose cost amounts to 25 million Czech kroner.
The entrance to the concert costs 400 CZK and children up to 12 years have free entry in the early sale option in Bohemiaticket
Poland and the cosmos.
At last week's meeting of ministers of the European Space Agency countries, Poland was accepted as the twelfth member of ESA. It is the second ESA member country of the former Eastern European bloc, after the Czech Republic, which became a full member on 12 November 2008.
Poland started an intense collaboration with ESA in 1994 and in subsequent years participated in the agency's project commission.
However, Poland's path to the cosmos began much earlier.
Polish enthusiasts were already engaged in space flights before World War II, although their work was not always understood.
I remember, for example, A. Šternfeld's conference at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory, at which, on 6 December 1933, he presented his ideas on the pioneering study "Introduction to Cosmonautics".
The ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the assistants indifferent and, years later, Šternfeld recalled that Dr. Jan Gadomski had been the only one who had shown interest in his work.
In 1934 Šternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Prize for his "Introduction to Cosmonautics" in France.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966), mentioned earlier, later became a major driver of astronomy and cosmonautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and wrote a series of books dedicated to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a promoter of cosmonautics, was known all over the world and his contribution to science was rewarded when he named one of the craters of the hidden face of the moon.
Already in 1925 a Dresin was built in Poland that was to be supplied with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of the proposal is not known and the details of the project are not known.
It is not clear whether the rocket was to be used for the start of the drain or for its braking.
The information on this Dresina is limited to the collection in the press of the time.
From 1933 the Polish artillery began to dedicate itself to missiles.
The research was funded by Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and Prof. Gustawem Mokrzyckiegim.
From the stored material, it is evident that the investigation reached the stage of the practical tests.
However, with the arrival of German troops, the investigation was interrupted.
In 1937 the prototype of a photoelectric hunting missile designed by engineer Rohoziński appeared in the specialized press and the following year the study "Rakieta - torpedoe powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocki was published.
Both projects were intended for the military use of missile engines.
Shortly before the war, the Interim Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Nakowy) was responsible for all missile projects for military use and coordinated all work.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, it was interrupted by the beginning of the war.
Other studies devoted to cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Astronaut Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
The November 1954 issue of Problemy magazine refers for the first time to society with four very extensive articles dedicated to astronautics.
In one of them, Professor M. Subotowicze proposed the creation of a society that would be dedicated to cosmonautics.
At that time artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was obvious that cosmic research was a discipline with prospects for the future.
Since the beginning of 1956 the Polish Society of Astronautics (PTA) aspired to be part of the International Astronautics Federation (founded in 1951) and in the autumn of the same year the PTA became a full member.
The following year the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became the vice president of the International Astronautical Federation.
He held this position until his death in 1959.
Starting in 1956, the PTA participated significantly in the development of the RM probe rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which was a success and became the first Polish rocket in which scientific research was carried out.
The first type RM-1 was completed in 1957 and was released for the first time on October 10, 1958.
The rocket had an apogee of 1,800 meters, about 80 cm in length and did not reach 5 kg in weight.
Later, the RM-1A version was completed and in the summer of 1959 the two-stage aerial testing of the RM-2 rockets began in the Błędów desert.
The rocket measured 1.4 metres and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another type of rocket in development was to be the subject of a real scientific study. The RM-34 rocket was to have a peak of 14.5 km and its mission would be to control the high wind.
However, work was suspended in 1962.
The successor of the first RM rockets was the Meteor-1 rocket, which was built during 1962 and 1965.
It was designed as a two-stage rocket, with a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types were developed (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which differed from each other by the space available for scientific devices.
In the Meteor-1A rocket the available space for volume was 0.4 liters, in the Meteor-1B 0.34 liters and in the Meteor-1C 0.62 liters.
The peak peak in all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968 the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Air Institute, whose first air tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a useful weight of 10 kg to 60 km of height.
Subsequently, the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
It is also necessary to mention Poland's entry into the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the formation of the COSPAR National Committee two years later.
Within the framework of the Interkosmos programme, Poland joined the research of cosmic space on Soviet artificial satellites and, in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslav Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimír Remek.
The suspension of the law on social work is not the solution.
Last week the constitutional court suspended the law social labors.
The resolution sparked a heated discussion in society.
Of course, it will be interesting to examine the problem from a broader point of view.
Liberal economic systems in the EU, as in the globalised world, are based on the principle of greater economic competition and less regulation.
Therefore, this means that different economic forms and national economic systems are in permanent conflict with each other.
The cause lies in the principle of free trade and the free and unlimited movement of private capital, together with unbridled financial speculation.
The effect of large differences in labour costs (wages) creates economic tensions.
Under this concept it is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer, with the import of cheap goods, tries to shorten distances and to do so "provides a decrease" of the competitor's price with the aim of taking with most of the market and thus increasing its profit margin.
On a large scale it means, for most entrepreneurs, moving production abroad, buying there cheaper or disappearing. The result is high unemployment in those countries where the price of labour, compared to other economies, is higher.
Because private capital has no social responsibility and is therefore not responsible for the unemployment that this phenomenon generates, the social expenditure of the state necessarily increases.
All this leads to the total disinterest of entrepreneurs in paying taxes and in compensating for the economic and social damage they have caused in their quest for benefits.
The situation is so universally known that there is no need to present specific statistical data.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital create situations in certain economies in which the governments of those countries are forced to compete with the objective of artificially reducing the social level of the population itself and thus attracting foreign capital to the country.
In other words, Governments make private capital available to their own people without taking into account the social decline.
This is particularly evident in changes in existing laws.
The aim is to force the population to accept the dictate of private capital, especially as regards wages.
This is done, on the one hand, by means of the system of economic obligation in the case of long-term unemployment; on the other, by means of the restricted right of employees to work rights.
The result is growing poverty along with increasing differences between the poor and the rich.
For a number of years, there have been food delivery points in Germany for poor people who cannot keep up with their own work.
The number of people receiving this type of assistance is already up to one million.
In the context of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, there is a fairly frequent case: people employed with such a low wage that the state must pay the rest to reach the minimum necessary to survive.
A scandal of this kind related to the situation of auxiliary employees of the German federal parliament was made public.
The savings measures of almost every state in the south of the EU undoubtedly lead to the same situation. People, under pressure from an abysmal decline of their social level, are forced to emigrate as in the 19th century or to live with a bad wage at the edge of society, in the hope that one day they will arrive in the private investor capital country.
Is it necessary to wonder where it comes from?
In the case of other EU countries, then poverty goes from one country to another or never comes, as Chinese, Indians, Brazilians, Turks, Moroccans, Egyptians or Africans continue to work for a tiny part of a European wage.
This also affects all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media affirm to the satisfaction that the state should not bring capital to the economy, that leading the economy leads to its failure.
Private capital defends with nails and teeth the thesis that the state should not intervene in the economy by interfering in control.
It is then necessary to ask whether private capital does not influence political progress with its selfishness and, therefore, throughout the state.
In this case the answer is clearly affirmative.
The proof is the existence of lobbies, in practice very powerful and omnipresent, in all states.
The result is a desperate situation that manifests itself in the field of corruption, in mutual favours, in legislation that is practically reprehensible everywhere but is not punishable.
In Germany, the situation is as follows: the state ministries, in the absence of financial means, commission the drafting of bills to private legal enterprises, which are often linked to industry.
This type of bill is then passed in the Bundestag, the German parliament.
In this way, all power does not emanate from the people, as announced in the constitutions of Western democracies, but from the strong financial groups representing their own interests.
It is obvious that democracies with a liberal orientation quickly find themselves in a situation such as that described by Appiános in his work The crisis of the Roman Republic in the times of Caesar and Pompeii: "The state had been disintegrated for a long time and the administrations were dealing with it by force".
In exchange for bribes, favors obtained illegitimately and help to finance stones or swords.
Bribery and corruption spread without any hindrance, and people came to the polls with the vote beaten beforehand"... "there were no people of a character who aspired to a post in the administration, so once, because of this disorganization, the state was eight months without consuls"... "He began to speak seriously that the only remedy for such a serious situation was autocracy and that it was necessary to choose a strong man"... Although Appianos thought of Pompeii, Caesar came to power and turned democracy forever into autocracy.
The conclusion, just as in ancient times, is that the present society is based on disregarded preferences of individual benefit without taking into account common interests.
Private capital is essentially unable to understand and claim the benefits of society as a whole.
The result is the same as that of then, an unprecedented decline of the elite, without an effort being made to reform it in depth.
The causes of the rise of fascist and communist regimes must therefore be sought in the unbridled liberalization of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
With respect to the current situation, it is possible to consider the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of a liberal democracy, as a definite pause, pending the next coup.
The truly devastating fact is that the current elite completely ignores the losses of hundreds of thousands in lives, social and humanitarian catastrophes that we have witnessed, as well as crimes against humanity, as we know them in ancient and most recent history.
The suspension of the Public Procurement Act is not the solution; at least not in the long term.
Under pressure from economic competition, both at international level and within the EU, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek other ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution is through concrete socio-political reforms, which reinforce both the participation of state capital and the influence of citizens in government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: The laboratory of chaos.
"That nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could" Sting in his song Fragile and whose chorus reads "Let's do not forget how fragile we are" (let's not forget how fragile we are).
"If my children did not want wars, there would be no" Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, on his deathbed in 1849.
Following the latest waves of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, various reactions have emerged, as always.
One, on the Israeli side, argues in favour of the right to self-defence and collide Palestinians in the role of terrorists; the other supports Palestinians and claims racism by the state of Israel, genocide perpetrated against Palestinian Arabs and marks Israel as a terrorist state.
I do not want to focus on who is responsible for the massacres that are repeated regularly and who is the victim. After all, today's citizens of Israel, including the autonomous territories, were born within the current political situation and did not live the beginnings of violence.
My intention is to offer readers a look behind the curtain, a look to find out who is taking advantage of the tensions that have been dragging for 95 years (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small land surface of the Middle East.
Some of my considerations are based on historical facts, others on conclusions I have come to on the basis of my own understanding of the matter, on who or what group of people is the main driving force behind the events of modern history.
In the history of humanity, the history of power struggles is at the forefront.
At each time we can find a Great Alexander or a Napoleon.
But what is no longer so evident is whether it was always these characters who led their steps autonomously or whether behind their throne was someone who directed their actions towards a certain goal.
We must accept that we live in a time that concentrates the wealth of the world in the hands of a few individuals and that this concentration of money and the power that this implies, has not been reached in a single generation.
Among these astronomically rich families stands out one that could be considered the most prominent (if there is still someone behind, I don't know, but I don't discard it): the Rothschilds.
It's not very close to them.
Of course.
In the nineties of the 19th century they bought the first news agency (Reuters) to stop associating their name with very serious criminal acts. Power and wealth, or both, covered their backs, which for them always meant a strengthening.
They have important stakes in almost every central bank in the world and in those countries in which they are not represented, a war has been declared or is being prepared: before the attack on Afghanistan there were seven countries, after the attack on Iraq there were five, after overthrowing Gaddafi there were only four, but in the meantime Russia has subordinated the central bank to the Russian government.
Anyone who has tried to oppose this family has died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the state of the Rothschild Central Bank of America, began printing money during the Civil War and was killed in 1865 in the theatre.
JFK began printing money and wanted to suspend the federal reserve system (FED) and was killed in 1963; Congressman Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after wanting to sue the EDF for having triggered the great economic crisis of 1929.
Their desire for world power led them during the years 1859 - 1871 to draw up a plan with three world wars, designed by Mason Albert Pike, decorated with grade 33.
The first war was marked as an objective to eliminate the great monarchic states throughout Europe; the second wanted to eliminate colonial supremacy, especially in Britain, and the third was intended to reduce the population of the earth by half a million to one billion people (similar numbers of slaves for their well-being and luxury would suffice and not consume so many resources), in addition to the creation of a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than a preliminary draft for such a solution) and the definitive adoption of absolute powers.
The method by which the group of the richest families operates, together with the Rothschilds, follows the dynamics of crisis triggering and the subsequent offer of a solution (order ab cao - order from chaos).
These solutions are, however, wrong, and always lead to a worsening of the situation. Otherwise, it is enough to remember that the EDF was created so that a crisis such as that of 1907 could not be repeated.
So, after the success of the assassination of the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, Francisco Fernando, in Sarajevo and after the outbreak of World War I, tsarist Russia was destroyed by the beginning of the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended suddenly and unwarranted from the military and economic point of view, the capitulation of Germany (the wars to end Tsarist Russia were already unnecessary) and the subsequent dismemberment of the great power of Central Europe, the Austro-Hungarian empire.
To prepare the ground for World War II, they allowed the bankers and politicians to create, in a covert manner, a conflict situation following the enormous war reparations imposed on Germany, creating the optimal conditions for the radicalisation of the impoverished masses. Subsequently, they merely served the Germans with the Führer solution, which was strong enough and simple and pointed to the culprits, and then built a Czechoslovakia composed of several nationalities with a strong German minority that had to represent and represented so well the function of the fifth column, which caught the flame and caused the outbreak of war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds promoted the foundation of the Zionist movement, a branch that aspired to the formation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of ancient Judea with Jerusalem as capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour declaration mentioned above laid the groundwork for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine and began the first conflicts with the local Arab population.
Terrorist attacks were taking place on both sides.
The Second World War broke out: it is difficult to know whether Hitler pulled too much of the rope to which international bankers had attached at first or whether everything he did was part of a plan. However, the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps created the optimal conditions for acceptance of the Jewish state in world society.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, similarly to the way in which the war reparations imposed on Germany paved the way for World War II, with the proclamation of the state of Israel the focus was created for a third war.
If international bankers could start it, the Jewish nation, as in World War II, would become a frontline victim, now along with the Arab or, generally, Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is an immense laboratory, a welding and chaos machine, not only within the framework of its country, but also on an international scale. Let us take as an example how Israel's supporters and detractors are divided in a sharp way.
Who is guilty and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict? Where does injustice engender injustice in a spiral of endless violence, if at the beginning there was the greed of some individuals and their desire for world power?
At this point it is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their leaders, because, as is the case in our country, international bankers only present their candidates in the elections.
The current President of Israel B. Netanyahu is the typical example of a fascist politician, loyal to international bankers, who does everything possible to declare war on Iran and, considering that Iran is a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), would threaten to become a global conflict and, if we consider that Iran controls the Strait of Ormuz, where 20% of all world oil passes (the navigation corridor is only two miles wide), would lead to the destruction of the world economy.
In what light are now the words that David Rockefeller said in 1994: "All we need is a general crisis and people will agree to a new world order."
The new world order in his imagination is a world of lords and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the population serves a handful of people who are part of the well-accommodated financial aristocracy.
A world in which every new individual is implanted a chip at birth that controls his whole being.
"And it forces all, small and large, rich and poor, free and slave, to have a mark on the right hand or on the forehead, to be unable to buy or sell, unless they bear the name of this monster or the numbers of his name.
It is necessary to understand it: whoever has two fingers in front, add the numbers of this monster.
The number marks the person and this number is six hundred sixty-six."
Argo Movie: If it gets raw, call Hollywood
In November 1979 a group of Islamist students held the American embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomas as hostages.
His release was to be in exchange for the dethroned Shah Mohamed Réza Páhlevi, who after the revolution fled to the United States, a country that had sponsored his regime for decades.
For the American administration, the situation did not offer any positive prospects: to throw the Shah overboard could not afford it, since, if it did, it would jeopardize the confidence of its allies in other countries.
But the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution had led to the constitution of the theocratic regime, was not within their reach.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which later intensified even further with the failed attempt to release the hostages by force.
The imprisoned diplomats were released 444 days after the negotiating intervention of the Algerian government.
In the U.S., his fate caused a wave of solidarity and animosity against Iran.
Iran's failure contributed decisively to Jimmy Carter's defeat against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film "Argo" by director and actor Ben Affleck themes an episode of this story, which reaped a small success for America.
Shortly before occupying the embassy, six employees escaped from the building.
After a complicated journey, they ended up at the Canadian embassy's residence.
CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, for which it helped a covert story an extravagant point: they came out with Canadian passports, as members of the film team examining the location in the country for the shooting of a superproduction of science fiction.
Gender combination
The plan drawn up by the "exfiltration" expert Toni Mendez required Hollywood's collaboration.
For the lie to seem truthful, it was written about the film project in specialized magazines, press conferences were organized, the fictional production society even had a real office.
The details of the operation were kept secret for a long time, the film has been made from the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a unique combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a realistic political thriller; on the other, a so-called "caper movie", the story of an episode that went well, a deception (an example can be the Ocean's Eleven series).
The film combines moods. We find on the one hand well-documented sequences of Tehran. The credit sequence shows emblematic photographs of the epoch of events, which were similarly reflected in the film; there are not many differences in this regard.
On the other hand, typical Hollywood scenes a little lighter, marked by irony and a slight exaggeration.
And besides, scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions: men brought in to analyze the situation at the negotiating table, in the halls of the office, by phone...
Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career in an excellent way.
The actor, who had been mocked, has become a respectable director and his way of acting has ceased to be the target of ironic comments.
Argo is his third feature film, after "Farewell Little, Goodbye" (2007) and the thriller "The Town. City of Thieves" (2010).
At the same time, it is Affleck's first film in which the action does not take place in the city of Boston, where it was raised.
Also, the sensitivity of capturing the local atmosphere was a feature that placed the directors of old films above Hollywood standards.
And Affleck shows it in Argo, where Tehran "swings" in Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets, in the reconstruction of the true events. The introductory sequence of the taking of the embassy is impressive because of its synoptic capacity which, at the same time, conveys the emotion of disconcerting and of the lack of forecast that arises when, somewhere, history takes a step forward.
Affleck and his collaborators have a similar effect on the fictional scenes (the impostor team in Tehran's bazaar).
Too much action in too many places
The director had to accept the fact that an explained story does not offer much in the cinematic sense of the most intriguing scenes.
And he manages quite well. Sometimes he adds something to reality: here it doesn't all come out so elegantly (the scene where the crisis in Tehran airport is haunted, the diversion of a call to America and the unbridled search behind his track turn into madness).
The weakness of Argo is the miscontrol that arises from the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman have a very funny role as Hollywood collaborators, although their characters deserve more space and are not, much less, the only ones in this film.
For these reasons, Affleck's film loses a bit of dramatic trace, but it is a film that can be followed with a moderate interest, value its realization and the retro style of a thriller that evokes the 1970s.
But if it collapses, that'll be hard.
As an evocation of a real history and as proof of how exaggerated the notions of omnipresence and omniscience of secret services can be, it is enough.
Rules for the inflation of balloons, bananas and circuses
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which presents every year a survey of the most absurd banking fees, has now decided to announce the contest on "the most absurd regulation or ideas of the EU workshop".
"It occurred to us after the last event, the EU plans to approve a 40% share of women in leadership positions in large European companies," said Právo Patrik Nacher, the survey organiser.
For example, the recent decision of the European Court to unify insurance policies between men and women is one of the nouns nominated.
So far, women were benefiting from better prices in life insurance because they objectively represent a lower risk.
"Other incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be proposed by people until the end of this year."
The election will take place at the end of February 2013," Nacher said.
Among the EU's controversial regulations is, for example, the mandatory addition of biocomponents to fuel which, as a result, harms the environment; another ban is the use of lifetime mercury thermometers only because they contain a small amount of a dangerous substance or the dark guideline the size of chicken cages, which has contributed to the considerable increase in the price of eggs this year.
The factual ban on the use of the expression "butter butter" or the removal of the classic bulb from the shops has been criticized.
A quality banana must have a length of 14 centimeters.
The EU apparatus often makes such decisions under pressure from one or other commercial or industrial lobby, whose requests in Brussels are normally defended by some state or group of states (the Czech Republic, even with the threat of veto, claims the demands of its banks).
The interests of a lobby were behind the request, for example, that higher quality bananas should be at least 14 centimeters long in the EU and could not have "abnormal curves".
The European Commission defended itself by saying that this only seeks to harmonize national standards that have not been homogenised to date, which only complicate their marketing.
The rules referring to fruit and vegetables in the EU, despite the opposition of some states, have been softened on the basis that the existing directive involves a waste of food.
The candidate to win the survey could be last year's U.S. prescription that in inflatable balloons that are marketed it is mandatory to warn that children under the age of 8 are not allowed to inflate them without the supervision of an adult.
The U.S. referred here to an American study according to which, when it comes to toys, balloons are the leading cause of infantile death by asphyxiation.
A similar restriction on the use of blueberries by children up to the age of 14 is also in force.
Curious occurrences are born even in our country
Equally absurd is the regulation concerning European officials: anyone who has an official role in the EU cannot use the name Macedonia. To avoid hurting Greece's sensitivities, we must talk about FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
Bankovnípoplatky.com, in collaboration with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, nominated in the survey, among some absurd proposals mentioned above, the Union's prescription on the volume of food supplies in the territory of a Member State.
The EU determined the maximum volumes of food supplies that can be found in the territory of the Czech Republic on the same day as our entry into the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the volume established for canned mushrooms, which threatened it with a substantial fine.
The organizers of the survey were also interested in the occurrence of paying those countries that do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a grant for the application for grants.
Such ideas did not arise in Brussels but in Prague.
"We are at a disadvantage because we have no sea.
We ask the European Union for compensation," said the then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in the autumn of 2004.
He argued this with the fact that a lot of cereal was produced in our country and, as a result of so-called intervention purchases, the state had full warehouses and had to be exported.
According to Palas, since the Czech Republic is far from seaports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
In the end, the European Commission was ready to assist the Czech Republic and organized a public tender for the purchase of cereal from countries without access to the sea.
The grant to receive a grant was proposed to the municipalities by the Ministry for Local Development led by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU). Specifically, it is intended for the drafting of applications for grants from Brussels.
EU: Rare prescriptions are an exception
The Member States' guidelines are often the subject of criticism, the EU's regulatory efforts and, in addition, more effective operation and development throughout the Union deserve our recognition, according to several experts.
According to experts, the most serious problem is, for example, the collection of EU grants for projects which have nothing to do with deepening European integration, but which the Member States have achieved in the negotiations on budgets.
The Czechs are also affected by sensitive fibres, as are other countries of the Union, the fight for the right to the designation of origin of their traditional products, although our country has not always emerged victoriously from these struggles.
The Czechs, after six years of disputes with Germans and Austrians, successfully defended the designation of origin of Olomouc's requeson, but had to change the name to the national rum, whose tradition in our country dates back to the 19th century, and was renamed "tuzemák".
Only products made from sugar cane distillation can be called rum, but not those made from sugar beet.
In the official list of protected designations of origin of the EU, together with the feta and gorgonzola cheeses known all over the world, the Mazapán of the German city Lübeck or the ham of Parma, there are already for example the cookies of Karlovy Vary, the tent of Pohořelice and Třeboň and even the variety of hops of Žatec.
As EU protected maras, you can be proud of Pardubice gingerbread and the Hořice v Podkrkonoši boats.
People want me to save the republic, but I'm a fan, Okamura says.
Senator, how did it occur to you to run for president?
It's not about being a senator or president.
If everything was all right in our country, then I wouldn't be running for office.
But I can no longer bear to see how it has been stolen in the last twenty years in our country, how thieves go unpunished, taxes and retirement age increase.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
When I see something I don't like, I try to find a solution to change it.
And since I am 40 years old and my candidacy is independent, the only chance I have to change things is to introduce myself as a senator or president.
The Senate has already arrived, but shortly thereafter it has set out on its way to the presidency.
You're not turning your back on those people who voted for you?
I always said that my candidacy for the presidency depended on the results of the Senate elections.
I later specified that if I was elected senator, I would run for president.
But my goal is not the function; the function is the tool with which I can make my own ideas come true.
That's why I need the most influence and the strongest mandate possible.
The problem is not just that we are a nation that we criticize in the bar or in front of television, but that we trample on anyone who wants to start a change.
This is compounded by the media, which discredits you and confuses freedom of expression with the freedom to lie.
I am told that I have bribed journalists or that I have been an advisor to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your ideas.
It is presented to the presidential struggle with financial theses and criminal responsibilities of politicians and the declaration of property over twenty million.
To do so, it must change the law.
As president it does not have this competence and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve it?
As a citizen, I have been part of a lobbying group for the guidance profession to be recognized as self-employment, and we have done so.
The problem lies in politics: if someone comes up with a good proposal, whether from the right or the left, they are rejected on purpose and this affects the citizens.
As an independent candidate, I have greater potential to gain the support of all parliamentary groups.
Without boxing or party dogmas, I have the ability to choose something from each party that is better for our country and apply it.
Are you more of a right-wing or left-wing man?
From the Czech point of view, I have the impression that people consider me more left-handed.
It doesn't matter to me, either a little left or a little right.
What I care about is that we move on.
I don't care if someone's right or left, I want to join people.
I always openly support any good solution, regardless of whether the proposal comes from KSČM or the ODS and I will likewise be against bad ideas.
He's joking when you're told he's a populist.
But you're not proving it with what you're saying?
When you create a business plan for the company, you also have certain goals and ideals.
And you're trying to get close to them.
There will be those who call it populism, but all the proposals I speak of already work in the world or known experts speak of them.
But without Parliament's support, only slogans remain.
And with that he cannot survive in long-term politics.
Or do you think that if you address people and talk to them, you will, for example, get criminal and financial responsibility?
I don't have a choice.
Convince politicians, journalists and civil society and try to put them on my side to achieve it.
If elected president, there would be no problem in organizing a live television broadcast in which he would ask the leaders of parliamentary parties to legitimize criminal and financial responsibility for politicians, officials, judges and state prosecutors.
And eventually, they would have to communicate why they don't want to.
If there is a strong character pointing to the disputes, pressure can be put on the political scene.
Let us take the direct election of the president, which has been an achievement of public pressure.
At the same time I say I'm just an amateur, I'm not a genius or an intellectual.
For my opinions and ideals I try to seek allies.
I've just started in politics and I'm trying to get as much support as I can for my program.
I'm trying to get things going myself, but in case it doesn't go well, in six years' time I'll leave it and go back to the private sector.
Sounds a little like Okamura's going to save the Czech Republic.
I'm no savior.
I know I don't do anything with a person, so I've visited a number of well-known personalities, in case they might be encouraged to run for Senate.
I went to see Radim Jančura, but he refused because he had a lot of work to do.
For my part, I have at least supported investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who brought to light frauds with light heating oils.
I introduced myself on the basis that people are really dissatisfied, now I'm on the scale.
Sixty percent of the population did not go to the polls and, those who did, voted for the representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate we are two from the independent sector.
People chose the senate, so it will be complicated to make changes.
However, I will defend my own ideas, such as the direct election of mayors or governors.
Are you considering forming your own party?
I haven't considered it yet because I don't have time for it, to check out the untouchable past of each of the party's potential members, nor do I have money.
I don't even have money for the presidential campaign, in my transparent account there are only 20,000 crowns.
You don't have any money?
He's talking about property statements, what's yours like?
I estimate my private property at about 60 million.
In Prague I have a plot valued at 25 million, a flat valued at 10 million, another flat valued at 8 million, a collection of works of art worth 10 million, an Aston Martin of about 3.5 million and a Škoda Superb valued at one million, and in the account I have a couple of million.
By the way, I have an Aston Martin because it was my youthful dream. I always liked James Bond, who was driving this car, was gallant with women and, at the same time, fought against evils and injustices.
You drive an Aston Martin, your property is valued at 60 million and you don't have money for the campaign?
You say you want to change the republic but you don't want to put too much money on your part.
It's not very convincing.
I don't have $15 million for the campaign.
Do I have to be in debt?
I've already put 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors shows that there's not much interest in my program.
And I don't have the obligation to pay for the campaign with money in my pocket.
The campaign expenses essentially cover what I will receive as a senator's salary.
But I couldn't live with it. For example, I couldn't pay my son for English school, which costs 30,000 kroner a month.
If I just wanted to make money, then I wouldn't run as a candidate.
So you're still doing business so you can live?
Didn't you say before I was going to quit this activity?
This has nothing to do with a higher salary.
As I promised, I've partly quit my activities.
For example, the representative of my travel agency will become my substitute in spring.
People would want me to be the Samaritan to save the republic.
But I need to live on something, too.
How often do you earn monthly as an entrepreneur?
Between 200,000 and 400,000, which I keep winning.
If I was president, then I'd quit business.

The MVRDV architecture studio shows that true adventures are not only in the head - in the example of the library of Spijkenisse and the recently completed "mountain of books" - 2 photos
"I think the building is fun, it has a futuristic look, and finally there's something interesting to see," says Lisette Verhaig, a passerby passing through the street.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technician in a large company located near the library, points out: "In addition, the building is beautiful".
But I wonder why we need a library these days.
We all have Internet, tablets and e-books.
No one's going to be happy with those old-fashioned libraries, are they?
Spijkenisse, a city bedroom located at the gates of Rotterdam that hardly deserves a fleeting visit, bears the dubious honor of having risen with a record to forget.
The population of 80,000 has the lowest literacy rate in the Netherlands.
To counter this shameful situation, a few years ago it was decided to contribute in some way to the general culture and copy the seven fictitious bridges that appear on the euro banknotes in the form of decorated reinforced concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And that's how politicians decided that there was only one possibility to improve statistics: a library had to be built!
Winy Maas, of the Dutch architecture studio MVRDV, an entire master in the art of bar diagrams and responsible for fun buildings as well as cynics, took the theme with his usual serenity and attended the presentation of the contest in 2003 with five books under his arm and a smile on his face.
And as the jury looked around and shrugged his shoulders, Maas proceeded to stack the books by size forming a pyramid and concluded his brief speech with the following words: "Citizens esteemed:
Here you have it, my proposal for the Spijkenisse mountain of books, the so-called 'Boekenberg'."
Nine years later, the 30 million euro mountain rises in the planned place.
This is part of the revitalization project, which is completed with an underground car park, a supermarket, a post office and a couple of housing and townhouse buildings.
At the beginning of November the mountain of books was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
In this way, the small town lacking history, which to date had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian area and an incredibly ugly town hall behind whose white facade one would rather sense a central milk, now has a work of contemporary architecture.
But above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.
The long way to the book
The first impression is that it is a paradise of books under a cheese.
It is true that there is an elevator that transports us right to the center of this mountain massif, but the true lovers of space and reading do not use it, but prefer to merge with its topography at every step of its climb to the top.
The fully glazed interior is bright and easy to cover with the view, the covered brick floor and the elegant headlights unequivocally support the public condition of the library.
The urban environment is perfect.
When you look up you can see the park benches, the dogs and the boys and girls playing football.
And everywhere books, books and more books.
"Normally book shelves are arranged along the façade and a huge dark room is opened in the center, which is usually uncomfortable and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
What we have done is to put the classic spatial configuration up and get the reading area out of the interior to the outside.
The interior of the mountain is very well used: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the environmental education center and the maintenance room.
Special mention deserve the black shelves that assume the functions of wall covering, parapet and railing at the same time.
The sight, the touch and the smell are strange.
Even architects and civil engineers more a day shake their heads when they hear about this unknown material.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials," explains Joop Trouborst, head of the project in the city of Spijkenisse.
And that's how one day, on a Frisian farm, we ran into the right by-product from agriculture.
For many years now, in the greenhouses and in the fields of the Netherlands, a plastic fabric of small millimetres of thickness has been used as a basis for holding the roots of crops.
It is a cheap and efficient material.
This fine fabric lasts two seasons and then is discarded.
For the library, this fabric was first pressed in such quantities until it reached plates four centimeters thick.
With heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) changes color and becomes a dark, homogeneous and resistant material that smells like a new car mix and sports shoe.
After 105 steps you reach the top of the mountain.
At the end of this continuous road of almost 500 meters around the mountain awaits us the reward: from the cafeteria you not only have a fantastic view of the city, but you can also enjoy tasty Dutch croquettes and their ficus planted in huge pots.
These create a pleasant environment at the same time that maintain the appropriate atmospheric humidity for this mountain of literature.
Donations for a new soul
"Although it is hard to believe this because of its large glazed surfaces, this building is an exemplary project in terms of ecology," says Trouborst.
The necessary heating and cooling is obtained from geothermal energy.
Although the mountain of books is located under a huge pyramid of glass, even on sunny days the sun only shines for a few hours inside.
The huge wooden fences located across the glass facade serve to give shade and absorb most of the sun's rays.
This creates a comfortable indoor climate.
The rest is about automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the skeptical information technology worker, has already dared to set foot in the new library.
And Lisette Verhaig has also been there.
Similarly, traditional Chinese medicine teacher Cynthia Bogarde has visited the library. She describes the "Boekenberg" as the "late soul" of Spijkenisse.
The reason is that, on the occasion of the inauguration that took place a couple of weeks ago, all the inhabitants of the city were invited to donate a book from their private collection.
In this way it is intended to fill, for the moment, the optical gaps of a library that does not yet have its complete archive; it currently has 70,000 copies.
The concept has gone deep.
The shelves are full.
"There is nothing worse than an empty half-library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I believe that thanks to our initiative now all the inhabitants have a certain link with this building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of the library.
Even if it's just there to decorate.
In this way, the MVRDV study has achieved quite a success in that discipline queen that in the specialized slang is known as "creation of an identity".
The city of Spijkenisse has written a piece of the history of literature.
No matter how young and incultivated it may be.
Finally a starting point to shape your identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a more prominent role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert in US-Europe relations, this puts Berlin in a rather hairy diplomatic position.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany suggested that it would vote against the proposal to grant the Palestinian territories observer status to the United Nations.
However, Berlin finally abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, because of the special relationship between the country and Israel, Germany must be careful.
But at the same time I do not think that it supports the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical with Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained from establishing a flight ban zone.
This has finally been declared by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear stance when important international issues are at stake?
Yeah, that's right.
This is because it is now reorienting its foreign policy, moving away from a policy led, so to speak, by the United States and focusing on a German foreign policy.
And what makes things even more difficult is that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
Therefore, the Germans are at a crossroads.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but are not used to doing so.
I think they are still testing their role, but they have already started the way towards a "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy similar to countries such as France or Great Britain.
What does "normal" foreign policy mean from the German point of view?
It is a policy which, when it comes to national interests, is prepared to defend positions different from those of the United States or its European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy finds strong motivation in economic policy, i.e. in exports and in its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
German economic interests are to a certain extent different from those of other major powers, and for this reason Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the position taken with regard to the conflict in the Middle East and the UN vote?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf.
For this reason, he must be careful and not alienate himself from Arab public opinion or the Arab elites.
This is important, of course.
But I would not give it that much importance since it is not a totally unilateral relationship.
However, they do play a fundamental role in German considerations.
Has Germany undermined its relationship with the US by abstaining from voting on important decisions such as in the vote on Palestine?
I believe that in Europe, and even in the United States, the German position enjoys an enormous degree of understanding.
For this reason, I do not think there has been such a drastic break-up as in the case of Libya.
Perhaps Germany has managed to gain some respect for this.
After all, all this has done is to show that it is a country that they take seriously as an international actor and whose interests must be taken into account.
In Europe there are different views on the Palestinian initiative.
On the other hand, the US has been clearly in favour of a veto.
Is there a difference of opinion between the US and many European nations?
These disparities have always existed because of U.S. domestic policy.
I believe that the Obama administration is secretly showing a great understanding of the European position.
But, because of the political situation here, it is clear that the government cannot defend that position in public.
I believe that the real disparity of opinion does not in fact have the scale that is attributed to it.
If we look at the relationship between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, we see that Obama is not at all enthusiastic about the policy he is developing.
Is it difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of its main partners in the EU, on the other?
I think that's exactly what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there was a coherent and homogeneous European policy, but that is not the case.
Therefore, they do not have the possibility of being part of a higher entity, but must push things from their own position.
That is precisely what they are doing now with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will take a leading role in forcing Europe to adopt a European position.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, either simply because of its relationship with Israel.
This has always been a hairy subject.
But I believe that the Germans are clear that they must play the role of independent figure.
Does Germany see itself as an important international actor? Does Germany really want to take on a leading role?
Or is it still difficult for you to accept that leadership?
Germany has not yet become accustomed, it is always somewhat uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country continues to find it difficult to play a more important role.
If we look at the euro crisis, for example, we see that every time Germany positions itself as the main actor, certain anti-German sentiments are unleashed.
This is not easy for the Germans.
It is an old problem and no one wants to be surrounded by enemy countries.
Seen in this way, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must show a receptive attitude towards the different neighbours and opinions, and that is not easy.
The influence of the US on European policy is diminishing more and more, but the EU does not at the moment cover that gap, who is left then?
The Germans will have no choice but to take on a more prominent role.
Even if they don't like it, if it's unpleasant or if it makes them an even more unpopular people, it's life!

"Brand Protection" in China: When Puma and Armani Suddenly Become Chinese Brands
Armani is a well-known brand worldwide and Polo Ralph Lauren as well.
But what is Armani Polo?
Behind this name is a name officially registered in China but that has nothing to do with the original companies.
However, it enjoys protection as long as the real eponyms do not file a claim.
And even then it's not clear that they're going to be right.
"Foreigners find it increasingly difficult to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing's firm specializing in protection rights violations in the Far East.
Every week a new case comes to my table.
Imitators simply add a couple of letters to record their brands.
In this way, Gucci becomes Lu-Gucci and instead of Prada is registered Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copied in the same way, as has happened to the manufacturer of Puma sports goods.
Pattloch opens an archive where he keeps seats from Beijing's trademark office.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company applied to register the brand Zegna DF Puma, an artificial name that also used the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
That Chinese are world champions in copying and violating intellectual property rights is well known.
In large cities there are large warehouses of several plants dedicated exclusively to the sale of forgery.
However, Pattloch's cases are of a different nature. On behalf of his clients, he fights against the fact that the trademark office officially grants Chinese companies the right to take advantage of a name that is already registered elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Ming Pai" or accompanying brand.
The word has its origin in the Chinese term "Bang Dakuan",
which refers to women who have "fished" a rich man.
Chinese authorities do not feel guilty
"It's harmful to the business, you have to fight it," says Pattloch.
"The brand makes water, the monopolistic position disappears and the damage the image suffers is enormous."
The financial losses and procedural costs of the sectors concerned are millionaires, especially in the case of luxury flagship products.
According to data from the market analysis company CLSA, with a volume of 15 billion euros per year China is, in size, the third market of luxury goods and the one that grows at the most pace.
However, achieving the cancellation of registrations of dubious legality in the registration of trademarks is complicated and also involves a lot of money.
Processes can last up to nine years and the result is uncertain.
Pattloch talks about cases in which the court dismissed a claim because it had been so long that the name that was the subject of the claim had already become a "market reality".
"If the plaintiff is in bad luck, he may even have to pay the plagiarism money because the process has damaged his brand in China," Pattloch says.
Sometimes this is the law of the jungle.
Some of the best known cases have to do with graphic elements.
In 2009 Daimler-Benz lost a lawsuit against the manufacturer of construction machinery Sany, the company that has recently been absorbed by the German manufacturer of Putzmeister concrete pumps.
That's why today the Chinese can still use a very similar emblem to the Mercedes star.
Volvo's buyer, Geely, initially used a white and blue logo that largely reminded BMW; the case was settled in court and Geely had to modify it.
The Lacoste clothing manufacturer lost in China to imitations from Hong Kong and Singapore whose logo represented a crocodile looking in the opposite direction to the original.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty.
The CTMO brand office in Beijing recognizes that in 2010 they have had difficulties due to the shortage of equipment and staffing.
Last year, however, "the situation of work emergency returned to normal".
In this way, the number of unprocessed claims processes has been reduced by 22 per cent.
Almost 57,000 of these cases were resolved, 75 per cent more than the previous year.
However, 81,500 claims remain outstanding.
Fighting this costs a lot of money
As usual in China, the figures are surprising.
Last year CTMO registered more than 1.4 million trademark protection applications, almost one third more than in 2010.
It would be a new record and means that China leads the list of new registrations around the world for the tenth consecutive year, according to the trademark office.
This also appears to be the case with the number of valid logos, a figure of 5.5 million in total.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan would have been paid for rights.
In other words, this means that on average each registration costs 1,280 yuan or 160 euros.
Fighting this costs a lot of money, as demonstrated by the German family business Freudenberg.
For more than seven years the group has been fighting in court against a Chinese copycat.
While the Germans have managed to stop the illegal manufacture of imitation car parts,
the imitator has managed to secure Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
"We ourselves have caused this situation because in Germany the surnames are not protected," says Hanno Wentzler, President and CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO trademark office also dismissed the appeal of the muniques.
In the next two instances Freudenberg has been right, but the opposite side continues to fight today.
You have to be very careful.
The case has now reached the door of the High Court of Justice, where it remains pending.
Wentzler hopes to be able to resolve the issue favourably and commends the professionalism of the courts.
However, he also states that "the procedure is extremely expensive, both in terms of money and time."
It is difficult to estimate internal costs; the business file has had to review files up to a hundred years old in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg offered the opposite side a "six-figure sum in euros" with the aim of reaching a friendly agreement, but it was not successful.
"This shows how much we care," Wentzler says.
The dangers that lurk in the Far East threaten even to affect Europe,
In particular, whether imitators secure rights to unprotected trademarks there.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer tried to register in Germany the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather products.
The group had long since abandoned this commercial scope, but had managed to prevent registration.
"We have to be very careful," Wentzler says.
Both he and lawyer Pattloch recommend to German companies to be extremely prudent when doing business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark law, but what needs to be done is to "register also in China all that can be protected", as Wentzler points out.
Otherwise, the issue can be much more expensive than just a record.
In fact, if Freudenberg lost the last assault of his particular battle, then he would have to pay the opposing party license fees by his own name, as Wentzler explains.
That or the segment in question would drive us out of the market.
World AIDS Day: dancing, singing, helping
In Heidelberg rehearses the Imbongi choir and in Swaziland the AIDS orphans rejoice
The history of a link capable of exceeding much more than 8,733 kilometers away.
First you start with the dance: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, heel shoes and moccasins look for the compass on the parquet floor, and find it quickly.
One, two, three, four.
Only then do the voices of the singers (contalto, bass, tenor and soprano) slowly begin to rise up, trembling, numbing and following each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old director, threatens to get out of his boxes almost by trying to put order with his energetic and soft gestures.
It is Monday afternoon and in the music room of the Heidelberg Institute of Medical Psychology the choir Imbongi rehearses a new song.
The fifty singers, aged between 23 and 69, have also arrived from the human geneticist to the master of the house.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each voice of the choir has a different text and also in a barely known foreign language: Zulu, a language spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and some areas of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
According to an estimate by UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS Programme, worldwide, there are approximately 34 million people infected with the HIV virus.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
In Swaziland there are 245,000 AIDS orphans.
More than 40 per cent of the population is already HIV-positive.
The Voices for Africa association has found in Germany godparents for the 180 AIDS orphans of the people of Esitjeni.
Seventy of them attend high school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month you can sponsor a child.
This contribution will cover school tuition, uniform and guarantee you a hot meal a day at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means in zulu "narrator of stories" or "panegirista".
No one in this room can speak this Bantu language fluently, but singing does.
For ten years this choir has been rehearsing songs in this soft foreign language that sometimes manages to transport them to their place of origin: South Africa.
At 8,733 kilometers in straight line from Heidelberg, in the northeast of the kingdom of Swaziland, there is a village called Esitjeni that depends on the voices of this German choir.
Forty percent is infected.
About 2,000 people live there, some still in simple mud and straw huts, a large part of them are children.
More than 300 people no longer have parents because they have succumbed to AIDS.
Esitjeni is a small example of what affects Swaziland: the highest rate of AIDS infection and the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to Unicef.
The population does not see circumcision with good eyes, a practice that has been shown to halve the risk of contagion.
More than 40% of the inhabitants of Swaziland are carriers of the immunodeficiency virus, and dying with just over thirty years has become something common.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered this remote population, but what they saw above all were many children on the streets who lacked not only the protection of their parents, but the main thing: food, clothing and training.
Without a school degree, the possibilities in a poor country are more than limited.
At first it was only the particular commitment of a few that made it possible for a child to go to school and enjoy a hot meal a day. All this for a few euros.
However, a year later the choir founded the "Voices for Africa" association, which has since been professionally concerned with AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
Among the STDs of bacterial origin are syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
The most common viral STDs are AIDS, human papilloma virus, genital herpes or hepatitis.
Snails and sarcasm are found among parasite-borne STDs.
What are the main groups of people affected?
Syphilis and gonorrhea occur more frequently in men who have sex with other men.
The Robert Koch Institute is based on the basis that at least four out of five cases of syphilis registered in Germany originate in sexual contact between men.
In the case of heterosexual adults, the most common sexually transmitted diseases are chlamydia infections, trichomonas, human papillomavirus, candidiasis (fungal) and gonorrhea.
HIV infection among heterosexual adults in the country is relatively low; however, approximately 20 per cent of new HIV infections are registered in this group.
Among young people, chlamydia infections are much more common than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
In our country, the human papilloma virus is also added to the most common diseases among youth.
How has the number of infections evolved?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory reporting.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has doubled from 1,697 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been declining since 2007.
In 2011, approximately 2,700 cases were recorded.
This is one tenth less than in the previous year.
What symptoms indicate that this is a venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, discomfort with urination, flow, abdominal pain, as well as blisters or warts.
They often do not cause pain or other symptoms and therefore are not detected.
How can one protect himself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of contagion, but they do not offer 100 percent protection.
Some pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through infections of dirt and physical contact.
For this reason, experts recommend regular medical examinations, especially if a sexual partner is frequently changed.
If diagnosed early, most STDs can be cured and any late consequences can be avoided.
Through collaborations, donations and, last but not least, the fees the choir pays for its performances throughout Germany, they collect a lot of money.
"In total we have already sent some 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the Zodwa Dlamini village itself, a woman who is self-confident and has leadership skills manages the money sent from Germany.
He's making sure the orphans find a good place to stay, for example with one of the grandmothers.
The "gogogos", as it is called older women in Zulu, are the pillars of the people.
Some of them have up to 14 orphans in charge, offer them a roof to live in and ensure that children attend school every day on time and dressed in their uniforms.
Those who have no one remain under the protection of Khanyisile, a single woman who, like the two cooks who cook every day for more than 200 hungry children, receives a salary from the association.
In addition, "Voices of Africa" has launched a sewing school, built two hens and, in collaboration with the U.S. health organization PSI, has managed to have many of the people tested for HIV.
This is not an obvious thing, since, despite the obvious fact that this disease is present throughout the country, it is not usually spoken about openly.
A king with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
Something strange in a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his opulent and overcrowded lifestyle.
Poligamy instead of democracy.
This unofficially accepted way of life is largely responsible for the rapid spread that the HIV virus has experienced in recent decades.
But it is also due to the innumerable timers who travel the country from one side to another and take it where they go.
According to Annette Lennartz, "in any corner you can get condoms for free, but these are barely used.
It's another culture, here they only accept skin-to-skin contact."
To encourage cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels every two or three years through southern Africa singing songs that speak of melancholy, combative spirit, hope and confidence in the black race, songs that many at the southernmost end of the African continent still remember from the time of apartheid.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a black language; so much recognition not only brings with it an excellent atmosphere and lots of joy, but has also managed to tear out a couple of tears to some other angry border soldier.
The trip always takes you to Esitjeni, where the singers visit the sponsored children.
Although this small population hardly appears on the maps, in the valley of the river Ezulweni is well known.
"Come closer to Esitjeni, there the light shines," the locals say.
And after crossing the 8,733 kilometers straight back to Heidelberg to the rehearsal halls of Bergheimer Street filled with singers marking the way, one realizes that it is also possible to see its light shine from there.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice in Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence of the existence of ice in Mercury.
Probably the ice layer is up to 20 meters thick.
NASA, the American space agency, has provided evidence of the existence of ice in Mercury.
Despite being the closest planet to the sun, there is also ice water, as is apparent from three studies published on Thursday in the specialized magazine "Science".
The Messenger probe would have found evidence that a layer of ice has been formed in the area of the planet that is permanently in the shadow.
It seems that this one is at least 30 centimeters long and probably even up to 20 meters thick.
The water presumably comes from comets or, most likely, asteroids that in their day clashed against Mercury.
No one relates the finding of ice to the possibility of life on the planet, says Chief Investigator of the Messenger Probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature in Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help clarify how water and other components of life have arrived in other areas of the solar system.
In a completely unnoticed way for the inhabitants of planet Earth, probes, telescopes and small robots like the Phoenix are dedicated to exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time they send images to Earth: small windows to the immensity of space.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets that make up our solar system, besides the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which revolves around the sun just behind Neptune, according to the new definition of the term published by the International Astronomical Union in 2006 Ceres is no "planet".
This section of an infrared image taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" in which infinite generations of stars appear: the oldest stars are shown as blue dots, although the most difficult to recognize is the pink color of the "new born" stars.
This region of star formation, unromanticly named by W5 scientists, was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation of Casiopea, at a distance of 6,500 light years.
This tornado image of an extinct star was taken by NASA's Spitzer telescope.
The donut ring is composed of the material that the star spits out in its extinction process.
In the huge Trifid Nebula, 5,400 light years from Earth, new stars are formed from gas and dust.
NASA's Spitzer telescope took this photo of the Galactic Star Formation Zone.
The Pleyades, a group of stars also known as "The Seven Sisters", are a visible object to be seen in the night sky.
However, with the telescope you can better appreciate the colors.
The Helix Nebula appears as a huge red eye appears in this infrared image.
It is located 700 light years from the constellation of Aquarium.
Its similarity to an earthly continent has earned it the nickname of North America.
The combination of a normal photograph and an infrared image gives rise to a spectacular color.
This glittering star could be captured in all its splendor for the first time by the Spitzer telescope infrared detectors.
Saturn and its rings: how they originated remains one of the great unknowns of astronomy.
It's probably the remains of one of Saturn's moons that disappeared without a trace 4.5 billion years ago.

Depending on the tonalities, some images of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The image published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid Nebula located several thousand light years away in the constellation of Sagittarius.
The name Trifida comes from the Latin term "trifidus" (divided into three), since dark lines of dust divide the burning heart of this star formation zone into three lobes.
In the constellation of Ofiuk, astronomers were able to photograph the signs of a cosmic carambola: 400 million light years from Earth, the nuclei of two fusion galaxies are rocking each other to end up colliding irremediably.
This star formation was captured by the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Those who do not like technical abbreviations can refer to it under the nickname Southern Molinillo.
The picture of the Hubble space telescope shows a section of the Iris Nebula in the constellation of Cepheus.
The nebula located at 1,400 light years is composed of dust particles whose size is between ten and a hundred times smaller than that of the dust particles we can find in a house.
This image was created from optical images and X-rays made by different telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes located at 430 million light years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, served for a model moment for NASA's Hubble Space Telescope.
Scientists call the largest spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
In this nebula is the group of brightest young stars in our Milky Way.
This star-forming zone constantly produces new stars.
In this cloud of stars, associated with the Roset Nebula, new stars also emerge continuously; 5,000 light years from Earth.
In this galaxy so bright with a small black hole there's still no dust, just gas.
Researchers assume that it formed shortly after the big bang, when in the universe it could be found above all hydrogen.
Our window to the universe: the most important telescopes
It seems that the telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608, before Galileo Galilei used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have not stopped growing and the images they offer us have become ever deeper.
For 30 years, specifically from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope located at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest in the world.
His mirror, in the image, had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, the Large Binocular Telescope rises.
This allows you to observe the cosmos through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Gran Telescope Canarias located on the island of La Palma is huge - only the mirror has a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of South Africa's Southern African Large Telescope is segmented to save costs.
Despite this, it reaches a diameter of approximately eleven meters.
The drawback of this more economical construction is that the telescope has a fixed elevation angle, so its mobility is limited.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas also has a fixed elevation angle.
Its particularity is its enormous ability to collect light.
Despite having a comparatively smaller mirror diameter, this capacity is comparable to that of the largest mirror telescopes in the world.
With the help of the Arecibo radio telescope (Puerto Rico), researchers can explore the universe in search of extraterrestrial life signs.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Extraterrestrial Intelligence Search" (SETI) you can help anyone who owns a computer, providing processing capacity.
View of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) located in the Chilean Andes.
Here stands the Very Large Telescope, a telescope that honors its name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can also illuminate the medium infrared spectrum.
The ESO will also host the so-called E-ELT (European Extremely Large Telescope or Extremely Large European Telescope).
Its primary mirror will cover 42 meters and will consist of a total of 1,000 reflective elements.
Until 2018 it is not expected to be able to take images.
Until 2007 the two Keck telescopes located in the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
These have two mirrors, each with a diameter of 10 meters.
Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which alongside them explores the sky with the help of the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
In Mauna Kea it is planned to build a new telescope of enormous proportions and with a mirror diameter of thirty meters.
This is an image of what it would be like.
However, the most important information from the cosmos comes from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has sent images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets, especially those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that 1,235 planet candidates had been located since the start of its mission.
The image shows the last preparations prior to the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) telescope will not be launched into space on an Ariane 5 rocket until 2018.
The primary mirror of this space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the functions of this telescope will be to search for the light of the first stars and galaxies formed after the big bang.
Researchers start from the base that there is also ice in the south pole of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable evidence, as the Messenger probe revolves around the planet in an orbit much closer to the north pole.
For decades radar measurements have been pointing to the existence of ice in Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger probe (2004), the first orbiting Mercury, scientists are now certain that this is the case.

The tour of the mountain region of Talysh could be described as wild and romantic.
The minibus advances with great strept through the winding road that passes next to woody hills, rivers of great flow and the simple houses of local farmers.
Everything is green and juicy, one might even think it is in the Black Forest.
However, we are in the southernmost part of Azerbaijan; from here the border with Iran is only a few kilometres away.
Here live the "talyshi", a town of which you do not know much, apart from that they perfectly dominate the Persian and the Azeri and that they are very long-lived.
Our final destination is Lerik.
This small town boasts an architecture perhaps too massive designed in the Soviet era and which does not seem to fit entirely into such a picturesque mountain landscape.
European tourists are barely coming to this place, as the road from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is too heavy.
To travel the 323 kilometers that separate both urban centers, it takes eight hours because the road is one-way.
The amazing wealth enjoyed by the country by the oil of the Caspian Sea has not yet reached this remote region.
However, Pilate Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what it takes to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous in May for the celebration of the Eurovision Festival and next year we will celebrate the Festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Longevity Museum, perhaps the only one in the world.
Here is documented the life of eight dozen local talyshis who have exceeded 100 years of age. Fatulayeva points to a black and white image.
This is my grandfather, who lived 120 years.
A son of yours died at the age of 136
However, the museum's undisputed star is the shepherd of sheep Sirali Müslümov, who seems to have lived 168 years.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And if we take into account that the documented older man lived 122 years, it seems that Müslümov's age is quite suspicious.
"He was born in the region in 1805 and died in 1973," Fatulayeva explains.
The man was married three times and had 23 children. Apparently he still had time to conceive a daughter at the age of 136.
Was Sirali Müslümov wrong at his age in a couple of decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard of the age of this inhabitant of Central Asia.
"Some regions of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan also live very old people," says Scholz, "even in Sardinia there are many older men."
Due to the lack of documentation, it is impossible to provide scientific evidence about age, especially when no civil registration exists.
Every day glasses full of melted butter
It is a fact that, surprisingly often, inhabitants of the region around Lerik often reach a biblical age.
There are currently 20 people over 100 years of age.
Why do so many elderly people live here in the south?
The Azerbaijani tourist guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains that these are the special genes of the talyshis.
The director of the museum, Mrs. Fatulayeva, believes instead that the cause lies in food.
However, from a nutritional point of view, it does not seem logical that precisely the calorie-rich diet of talyshi, who worship meat, bread and especially dairy products and many of whom, in addition, drink a glass of melted butter daily, is so healthy.
Or perhaps it is the natural way of life that keeps young people? In Cengemiran, a small settlement not far from the city of Lerik lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At the age of 97 he is relatively young for what is stretched out by these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
Sitting on the floor, he untiringly moves a huge tub of butter.
Eight people live under a roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and daughter, both of whom became grandparents long ago.
They also play from one side to another two young children.
In the kitchen they prepare tea for guests, a tea served in typical glasses with abombada shape.
Mirzayeva's teeth are white and perfectly aligned and under the handkerchief hides two long braids of dark blond hair that her son discovers proudly.
I've always washed my hair with milk, so I've never fallen and kept its color.
"I've never used a shampoo, either," says Mirzayeva.
Pension is enough to live
He has always eaten only what he produced on his own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
I've never been shopping at a supermarket in my entire life.
Then she tells us about her husband, who was in the army.
The worst was the post-World War II era.
However, everything returned to its path when the "Dear Father," Heydar Aliyew, took control of the situation.
This kind of propaganda sounds weird in the mouth of an older woman.
In Azerbaijan, however, the cult of the nation's paternal figure, who runs his country as a dictator, knows no limits.
He remained in power until 2003, when the witness surrendered to his son Ilham.
At least the elderly in Azerbaijan do not know what poverty is.
Mirzayeva collects 230 manat (approximately the same amount in euros) as a monthly pension, an amount with which you can live well taking into account the situation here.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's canous son is right: "In our culture the elderly are highly respected."
They live in a great family, are loved, receive all the necessary care and are happy.
As if this wasn't reason enough to stay alive for many years...
The Constitution lacks the expression "Human Rights"
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Demonstrations that rival each other in Cairo reveal the tremendous division in which the country is plunged.
The future constitution, with the Shariah as its basis, is very controversial.
The Egyptian president did not spare in patheticism.
"We must overcome the transition.
And that happens is my responsibility, before the people and before God," he said on public television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, especially the Christian Coptics, Liberals, Illustrated Muslims and secularists.
All of them, unremedied so far in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a theocracy on the banks of the Nile by the grace of the powerful Muslim community.
As Mohammed Mursi explains, almost asking for forgiveness, he has had to temporarily nullify the powers of the Constitutional Court and extend its powers "in order to save the revolution".
However, neither the Egyptians nor the entire world know very well what this 61-year-old engineer with a doctorate degree awarded by the University of Southern California really wants to save.
Do you intend to deprive the judiciary of its power?
In fact, the 234 articles, whose approval has been forced by a constituent assembly composed of 100 predominantly Islamist members at a night meeting of 15 hours, are truly troubling.
As in previous constitutions, the draft also states that jurisprudence is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
What does "principles" mean, though?
This was and continues to be open to interpretation and it seems that the Islamists are going to take advantage of this vague formulation, as well as the margin of legal manoeuvre that it carries, to impose a stricter interpretation of sharia.
This is at least what a new article suggests: in all matters relating to sharia it is mandatory to consult Al-Ashar University, the most important Islamic institution in the country with great power in all Sunni Islamism.
It does not have to be so, but this may mean that the clergy would control the legislation, something that - in fact - would result in the incapacitation of the judiciary.
Much of the draft constitution is open to interpretation
What is also problematic is that it seeks to maintain military jurisdiction.
During Mubarak's dictatorship these courts served to exert harsh repression on the opposition.
Following the dictator's fall, up to 11,000 civilians were detained in military prisons.
As stated in the draft, the State must protect "the true essence of the Egyptian family" and "promote its morals and values".
This is such an imprecise formulation in legal terms that with the help of this article state institutions could even control the contents of cinematography and literature.
Clearly, this is nothing but censorship.
Indeed, no article explicitly establishes equality between men and women.
On the other hand, another forbids offending or slandering the Prophet Mohammed and his legacies.
It is not clear, however, what an offence is and how it is to be punished.
Just as dubious is the formulation that prohibits "offense to people"
Is it enough a president's cartoon or a joke about a lawyer?
Question of interpretation, like many other things in the draft that has been presented to Mursi for signature and that according to his words, "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians for submission to referendum.
"The revolution is back"
The opposition has been closing ranks for weeks in front of the superiority of the Islamists.
Ten thousand people gathered in an unusual harmony on Friday afternoon at Tahrir Square in Cairo and swore to make the Act fail before it could enter into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will end up winning," says Hamdin Sabbahi, who is third on the list for the presidential elections.
The Nobel Peace Prize winner and former Director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei, declared that the draft constitution should be "in the bucket of history's garbage."
Through Twitter he accused Mursi's followers of wanting to lead a "state coup against democracy."
"When I call the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," says opponent Jasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not yet been expiated," quoted in the Egyptian media as opposition politician Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced that they did not wish to supervise the referendum, so it would not be considered valid.
"The Qur'an is our constitution"
For its part, the well-organized Muslim community called for a counter-demonstration; in case not in Tahrir Square, but after a prayer on the other side of the Nile, at the University of Cairo.
Many women covered with a veil and supporters of the Salafists took part in it in the cry of: "The people demand the application of divine law".
They demanded that Mursi "clean up the country," while proclaiming: "The Koran is our constitution."
A struggle for the sovereignty of the symbolic Tahrir Square, where everything began, would have provoked a situation similar to that of a civil war.
It is clear that Mursi's supporters did not want to risk something like this.
The Muslim brothers stated that both those opposed to the draft constitution and its supporters would have expressed their views loud and clear.
Now would have been the time to let the people decide in the ballot box which direction the country should follow.
In this sense, it seems that the draft of the Islamists has guaranteed the majority.
"The expression 'Human Rights' doesn't even appear"
Hafez Abu Saeda is furious with this forced constitutional process that should have actually lasted until February and included all social forces.
This 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended Muslim brothers when they were held in prison or faced a trial during the Mubarak dictatorship.
Not because he shared his ideology, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
For this reason he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
"And now the expression `Human Rights' doesn't even appear in the new constitution," she laments in a conversation with the newspaper "Welt am Sonntag".
The extension of Mursi's powers to the three branches of the State led to this lawyer's resignation.
The measures taken are flagrant violations of the rules of the democratic game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, what the president has done is abolish it," Saeda laments.
However, democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels abandoned, also by the international community, which observes the ideological struggle that is taking place on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
This could turn against him.
A protestor in Tahrir Square warns: "You are conceiving a monster that you cannot control."
The Norwegian Rakfisk: the most smelly fish in the world?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe but in the world.
Is it possible that the country's success has any relation to its greed for an extremely smelly fish?
Take a series of excessively cured cheeses.
Put them in the middle of a mountain of wet, dirty football clothes.
Leave it there for a week.
You will then be able to smell the paralyzing aroma of the rakfisk, one of Norway's exquisite.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
The landscape is spectacular and that smell, always present, floats in the air.
Rakfisk is salt trout that is fermented in water for up to a year, depending on how smelly you prefer.
As it gets darker and colder, Norwegians flock to a festival held here in Fagernes, dedicated to this treat of the most, so to speak, captivating.
"It eats raw and then drinks an aquavit glass of a drink," says Havard Halvarsen, a city firefighter who is also what is known as the "Rakfisk General", who organizes the festival.
Everywhere we see people eating this fish that is stored in small cubes and drinking from a drink important quantities of the drink.
"Some people like aquavit more than rakfisk," says Havard.
The drink can kill the smell.
I try some bits.
If you can avoid passing it near the nose, it is not bad; it is not very different from a portion of sushi that has traveled a few kilometers by bus.
Rakfisk is a product that comes from a very different time, when poverty hit Norway and in which, before refrigeration took place, fish were stored during the fall immersed in water and salt in hermetic barrels.
Later, in the middle of winter, when it is already well fermented, it is taken out and, obviously with inactive senses due to alcohol, it is eaten.
Just a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, and emigrated mainly to the United States.
At present, the population is growing rapidly; more than 13 per cent are immigrants, attracted by the abundance of jobs, high wages and a complete system of social services.
A stream of people from Sweden, the old rival and even not much richer than Norway, comes to this country to work.
Rakfisk is considered to be something important, an essential, albeit rather foul, part of Norway's past.
It is among the most expensive dishes you can buy.
But, in fact, it's all expensive. A beer cane or a sandwich cost you the 10€ ($14) chiller each.
Norway doesn't usually appear on the international news agenda, and most Norwegians like it.
Here people are still reluctant to pronounce the name Anders Breivik, the extreme right-wing racist who shot and killed 77 people, including men, women and children.
Instead, they refer to the shooting as "the event of July 22."
It is very difficult for Norwegians to believe that in their peaceful country one of their own could commit such cruelty and murder.
After much of Norway's current wealth is the growth since the early 1970s of one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world.
"But oil isn't the only reason we're doing so well," says Anna, our waitress, as rakfisk trays pass and that, with her long blonde melena and her amazing blue eyes, represents the image of Norwegian well-being.
"We are, as you say, prudent people."
His English, like most people in this country, is impeccable.
"We don't like to brag, we don't like to brag."
Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution; everything, except a small percentage of the money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
While everyone was wasting money they didn't have during the years leading up to the financial crisis around the world, Norway kept the wallet tightly closed.
"As long as we can ski in winter and hiking in summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And eat rakfisk," he adds with a loose carcass.
I'm in the snow lining up to eat something; I've had enough rakfisk.
Now a moose burger is definitely something different and quite juicy to taste.
But at night, that smelly fish comes back.
The hotel where I stay is one of many places where a rakfisk dinner is held where diners vote for the best fish, or perhaps the one that most tests the nasal pits.
A TV has connected live with a presenter who wears a birdie and who is surrounded by rakfisk dishes.
Looks like the Eurovision contest.
"What are your scores for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
"Here's our score, Havard."
There's laughter and applause.
A man falls out of the chair, maybe beaten by the aquavit.
Or maybe it's the fumes of all that fish.
Mexico: Enrique Peña Nieto faces a hard start · Global Voices
As Mexico's incoming President, Enrique Peña Nieto, prepares to take office, BBC correspondent Will Grant analyses the challenges facing the new president and the different expectations of his people.
Traffic in Mexico City is especially bad today.
In a city that, in the best circumstances, is already congested, a steel fence has been installed since Monday that cuts several of the main roads that lead to the city and that is causing enormous chaos on the roads.
The aim, however, was not to prevent workers from reaching their place of work, but rather to prevent demonstrators from reaching parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new president, Enrique Peña Nieto, will receive the presidential band and assume the management of the nation.
It faces a complicated task.
Mexico has been achieving good economic results during the outgoing government of Felipe Calderón, but the country is plunged into a war against drug trafficking that has already claimed some 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government has a great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence," Peña Nieto explained earlier this week to US President Barack Obama at the Oval Office.
"I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve that goal."
Before being coded with the president of the United States, Mr. Peña's previous political experience was as governor of his home state, Mexico.
A very populated and rapidly growing state, which surrounds the capital; The opinions about the new leader are divided in this territory where he used to move.
A sincere man
In the bucolic city of Valle del Bravo, for example, you are reminded with affection.
Its residents attribute to it the merit of the growth of tourism in the place and of the construction of infrastructures.
To get to the city you can drive on one of Mr. Peña Nieto's new roads, which is an enormous improvement compared to the cracked and bumpy roads that were rehabilitated.
You can also see plaques with their name at the entrance to a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We trust that he can make a real and lasting change," says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernández, deputy of Mr Peña Nieto's party, the PRI.
"In particular, as far as security and economics are concerned, we look forward to the interesting and real change that our country needs so much."
After an uninterrupted period of 81 years in power, the PRI was unblocked by Vicente Fox in 2000.
MP Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there are many expectations within the party regarding Enrique Peña Nieto.
It also rejects the opinion that the opposition lacks the essence of the new president.
"He is a very sincere man, very committed and with an excellent vision of the country.
He is a fantastic stateman and, above all, he is a person who knows how to listen."
However, on the other side of the state that is not the impression that many people have about their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
Hidden under high highway sections is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems of the municipality are also hard and urban.
Earlier this year, the military was called upon to assist in the fight against drug gangs operating in neighbourhoods and violence against women is particularly serious.
In a desert plot, located next to a garbage dump, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been abandoned in the last two years alone.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr. Peña Nieto was the governor, a much higher rate than that of Ciudad Juárez, unfortunately famous for his violence and a place that is synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
Mr Peña Nieto's critics say, at best, that he did not know how to address the problem of femicide while in office.
The most critical accuses his administration of making a blind eye.
In a concrete house, typical of the deteriorated neighborhood, Irinea Buendía has to make efforts to contain tears while showing me pictures of her deceased daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the facts, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes that her partner murdered her.
"When I arrived at her house, it seemed like they had cleaned her body," recalls Mrs. Buendia.
"There were signs that she had been beaten and rigor mortis had already appeared."
While her mother tells the story, a photograph of Mariana looks from the walls, next to a cross in which a single word is read: Justice.
However, that's exactly what the family says he's been denied.
"The state authorities have treated me like I'm an old gossip, a rioter, a whiner.
What they want is for one simply to accept what they say and to shut up."
"But that can't be the case when there have been so many irregularities and so much negligence," he says.
The presidential band that President Peña Nieto will receive on Saturday will be accompanied by a huge responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crimes in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has promised to give them priority during his term of office.
"I hope it's the same kind of president that it was when I was governor," says PRI Olvera's deputy in Valle del Bravo.
However, that is precisely what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear most.
Bradley Manning did not report ill-treatment, according to prosecutors
Prosecutors try to address Bradley Manning's allegations of abuse during his prison stay
The trial focuses on Manning's period at Quantico Military Prison in Virginia
The defense wants the case dismissed on the grounds that Manning's incarceration was severe.
The army soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
Prosecutors tried to prove on Friday that Private Bradley Manning, accused of the greatest leak of confidential information in United States history, lost multiple opportunities to report the ill-treatment he now claims to have suffered while in military detention.
During the interrogation of Manning at a pre-trial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Prosecutor Commander Ashden Fein stated that the weekly visits of officers of the unit Manning received during nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, do not show any complaints about the treatment he received.
The interrogation, which took place during a hearing following the defence's request that the case be dismissed since his imprisonment had been harsh and had already entailed sufficient punishment, came one day after Manning had testified that he had thought of committing suicide while in detention.
The army intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while serving in Iraq.
Later, WikiLeaks posted the material on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of information.
At Friday's hearing, Fein reviewed with Manning the forms that the officers filled out after Manning's visits during his arrest at the military prison in Quantico, where he was imprisoned in maximum detention from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers would have asked Manning questions and noted his answers.
When Fein asked about the forms on Friday, Manning acknowledged that he had qualified the treatment given to him by the collators as "excellent" and the treatment received at the facilities in general as "very professional".
The forms do not show any complaints of ill-treatment, although the officers asked Manning directly about the treatment he received, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had expressed concern about some issues and that the visiting officers had spoken to him about those issues and had indicated that they would be dealt with, but that they did not record those issues in the register.
"They wrote 'no incidents' (after talking about problems) but this doesn't necessarily mean I wouldn't have mentioned any problems," Manning said.
The judge, Army Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why she had not reported the treatment she received during the January 2011 meeting with a board to review the suicide intentions she had expressed on a form months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during that meeting was to obtain the reduction of the "injury prevention" regime under which he was under.
The military said that they had placed him under that restrictive regime, which is below the level of surveillance for possible suicide, to ensure his protection and the safety of others.
"I wanted the staff to know that I was okay and (I wanted) to stop being under injury prevention... so I could enjoy what, from my point of view, is a better quality of life," Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for almost two months before being transferred to the military prison at the Navy base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he had considered suicide in Kuwait and once lost consciousness due to heat.
He said that the fact that he was not allowed to know what was happening to him or what was happening in the outside world was very distressing.
"My world was reduced only to Camp Arafjon, to that cage," Manning explained on Thursday.
"I thought I was gonna die in that cage."
Manning stated that, once transferred to Quantico, he spent most of the days in a small cell, at least for 21 hours and often for 23 hours, without company.
Manning said he was only allowed to have a mattress, blanket, slippers, some clothes and glasses.
He explained that he was trying to move all the time, since it was forbidden to sleep or even fall during the day.
Manning claimed that he always had a light coming from outside pointing to his eyes while sleeping.
He said if the cellists couldn't see his face when he turned around at night, they'd wake him up so he could turn around again.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal complaint in January 2011 regarding Manning's treatment.
Manning was transferred to Fort Leavenworth Military Prison in Kansas in April 2011.
On Friday, the judge asked Manning about an allegation he had made in his Thursday statement that, after being forced to sleep naked in his Quantico cell, he was forced during a morning count to stand naked in front of the jailers and other prisoners.
Manning had testified that he had never been given the opportunity to cover himself with the blanket during the count.
During the judge's interrogation on Friday, Manning said that he deduced from the order given to him by the jailer that he should drop the blanket he could have covered with, but acknowledged that no one had ordered him to drop it.
Manning testified on Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before because of an attempt to prove to an officer that he did not pose a danger to himself.
Manning stated that he had told the officer that he could have used the elastic of his underwear or his slippers to self-injure but that he had not.
Manning testified that that night his underwear, his slippers and his glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hoped that the judge would at least take into account the experiences he had spent while in prison and drastically reduce his sentence in case he was convicted on the war council, which was scheduled to begin early next year.
The defence stated that it plans to cause Manning to plead guilty to minor offences and to defend other charges considered too extreme.
The hearing is scheduled to resume this weekend and prosecutors are expected to argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon has argued that Manning was held in accordance with the rules of application to any detainee in maximum custody in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include cooperation with the enemy, unlawfully triggering the publication of information on the Internet, leaking information from the national defense and theft of property or public records.
If he is found guilty of all charges, he could face life imprisonment.
My Mexican-American identity crisis
He claims that many were forced to leave Mexico due to lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to criticize those who left; he says they remind Mexicans of those difficult times
Navarrette comments that the Mexican-Americans are trapped between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, he had barely come down the esplanade and reached the immigration processing area and was already completely confused.
Some posters indicated the way to two lines: one for "Mexicoans" and one for "Extrangers".
I stayed there for a few seconds without being sure where I was supposed to go.
As I grew up in Central California, my whole life I've been called Mexican.
It's ethnic tachygraphy, just as my Boston friends refer to themselves as "Irish" or my New York friends call themselves "Italians."
Later I decided on "Mexico-U.S.."
But this was Mexico.
And, in my grandfather's homeland, shorthanding or scripts were not necessary.
He was simply an American.
I speak Spanish. I speak Spanish well enough to handle myself during an interview in this language.
But I don't have the vocabulary level of a native and I can't get rid of my American accent.
So I took my U.S. passport and put myself in the foreigner's queue.
I thought about that time this week when Mexico's elected president, Enrique Peña Nieto, visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
On the agenda of the day, as always when the leaders of these two countries meet, there were: immigration, drugs and trade.
Peña Nieto was also looking forward to talking about the growth of the Mexican economy, one of the reasons why a Mexican is so likely to stay in Mexico at this time as to venture to go to the United States.
He wants to partner with the United States and Canada and create a European Union-style trade bloc in North America.
In addition, Peña Nieto promised to continue to fight drug cartels in Mexico, although he gave no details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never remember that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to give up half their territory at gunpoint.
But for Mexicans, who think for centuries, not in minutes, the elements that remind them are everywhere.
So, the moment a US official says anything that carries the slightest criticism to Mexico, you start hearing complaints, both in the press and among the Mexican elite, about how Americans are usurping the sovereignty of their neighbors.
And the sons of Moctezuma stand up for war.
And yet, for Mexico, the relationship that really poses a challenge is the one they have with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
Are we talking about grudge?
There's a lot.
In Mexico there are winners and losers, people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for whom it does not.
The only reason there are so many people of Mexican descent living in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that, somewhere in our family tree, there was one person, perhaps the father or mother or one of the grandparents, who was closed the door of opportunity in Mexico and had to march north.
And most of the time that person fit into a certain profile: dark skin, a low level of education, coming from a poor people, etc.
We are their descendants and loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And even though we may be living the American dream now, having gone to good schools and having had good jobs, we can never lose sight that what we are living is that, the American dream, and not the Mexican one.
Sometimes our identity may not be clear, but our loyalty is.
It's for the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many of the Mexicans belonging to the elite of the ruling class do not like us.
The feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look at us over the shoulder as if we were from an inferior category that is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough and our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
In their view, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have left.
And now we wouldn't find ourselves trapped behind this silk curtain, living well in the United States but still as lonely souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and came legally to the United States when I was a girl, reminds me that there is this spray between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans because the former know more solidly who they are and the latter this bothers them.
Although she is a citizen of the United States, she is considered part of the two countries.
Meanwhile, many Mexican-Americans I know feel that they are not part of either of us.
We love listening to the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You have the best of every country, but you're not rooted in any of them.
In Mexico they see us as Americans.
And in the United States we are considered Mexicans.
Now, to further complicate things, so I learned during my trip, some Mexican leaders and some intellectuals want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican-Americans to work as improvised Mexican ambassadors, representing their interests in the United States.
We would tell our fellow Americans how fantastic it is to visit that country and pressure the political leaders to strengthen their ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course.
That's not gonna happen.
There's too much grudge.
And with wage inequality, rampant corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure it's a fantastic country.
I'm afraid you're going to be left alone with this idea, folks.
It's fair.
If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, then they have to accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans are still resentful of how their family members were treated a lot less time ago.
Hmm.
Maybe we're more Mexicans than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could well be an unlikely basis for peace
Could there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed that seems to indicate that any hope is in vain.
In the midst of the futile and usual discussions over who first started, piles of buildings have been reduced to rubble; over 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed and, for the first time, missiles from Gaza have fallen near Tel Aviv, the Israeli metropolis, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But, despite the fact that Israelis and Palestinians seem to be anchored in their former conflict, everything around them in the Middle East is changing.
The Arab spring has left it all torn apart whether they like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis have been trapped in the regional uproar.
Perhaps this will make your struggle even more bloody than before.
However, there are reasons to believe that their lethal standstill situation could unravel.
A war that is neither lost nor won
At first glance, optimism now seems very difficult to justify.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on 21 November is maintained, this week's clashes have reinforced the hawks on both sides.
Hamas leaders, the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced Israelis to withdraw, despite the fact that Gaza has received a good beating.
And despite killing some of its leaders and putting the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza under pressure in one of the most miserable and populated corners of the planet, Israel has not been able to put an end to Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently ruled by its relentless rivals of Fatah, the most moderate Palestinian faction.
In addition, Hamas leaders might conclude that time plays in their favor.
Since Islamists have been gaining influence throughout the Arab world, Hamas has made rich and powerful friendships.
Turkey, a renaissance regional power that had previously been the closest Muslim ally to Israel, has embraced the cause of Hamas. Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic states in the Gulf, has also done so.
The exultant Hamas members say that the Islamic half moon is surrounding Israel, from Lebanon to the north, where the Hizbullah militia party dominates, passing through Syria, where rebels of an increasingly Islamist trend could overthrow Bashar Assad, until they reach Jordan, where Hamas allies are threatening the king.
Especially on the southern flank of Israel, the growth of the Muslim Brotherhood led by President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, unlike the most populous and fundamental of the Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the lay despot who ruled in Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, did not have much time for Hamas.
On the other hand, the Muslim Brothers are cousins of Hamas and their leaders depend more on popular opinion.
In future diplomatic actions, Hamas may emerge as a protagonist that cannot be excluded, not even Israel and the United States.
In the meantime, Israel's hard wing will draw the opposite conclusion.
As far as the military issue is concerned, they have put Hamas in place.
Israel's Iron Dome anti-missile system has proven its effectiveness and many of Hamas' missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis will sleep quieter... for a while.
With regard to diplomacy, the United States was stronger than ever; many European countries also blamed Hamas for initiating the last wave of violence.
Above all, Israel has prospered, especially under the rule of Benjamin Netanyahu, a prime minister who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets fired from Gaza have ended the lives of some 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has not had too many suicide bombers, partly because of the barrier that corrodes the West Bank, the main piece of an aspiring territory to become a state of Palestine, and it protects Jewish settlements that continue to increase despite the fact that, according to international law, they are illegal.
Mr Netanyahu, whose Likud party has joined an even tougher line led by Avigdor Lieberman in the run-up to the elections on 22 January, is in a good position.
Why pamper those Palestinian crooks by giving them a state of their own?
If they actually ruled in the West Bank, would they not fire rockets as their fellow countrymen in Gaza have done?
It's better to have them behind that wall and give them a good blow if they raise their heads.
The hard wing may be imposed, although the Arab spring could alter their calculations.
Although Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere do not have too much appreciation for Israel, their priority will be to address internal difficulties.
Israel's defence budget is greater than that of its four Arab neighbours together.
Starting a war with the superpower of the area will hardly help the new Arab governments to improve their economies.
That the pragmatic Mr. Morsi has worked with Barack Obama to get the ceasefire is a good omen and could mark the beginning of something.
Israelis should also think long-term.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving the Palestinians of their right to self-determination means creating a dustbin that will one day explode in the territories occupied by Israel, in the same way that this week a bus exploded in Tel Aviv.
The repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state and demography worsens the situation as the Arab population increases.
The bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to reject Hamas will pay an ever-increasing diplomatic toll.
Both sides need a push from people outside the conflict.
The solution continues to be one that preaches sensible people on both sides, most of the outside world and this newspaper: two states and Israel's transfer of territory for security reasons.
The hope, small in the short term, is that the ceasefire will give a little more impetus to the outsiders who are fighting for this cause.
Egypt, which must begin to curb the entry of weapons into Gaza, together with Turkey and Qatar, is in an unprecedented situation to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem.
Arabs outside the issue should also pressure Hamas and Fatah to unite.
That would contribute more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the imminent attempt to obtain a virtual status category in the UN.
Mr. Obama also has an important role to play in bringing Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term, he failed to present his own peace plan.
Again in the White House, he seems equally reluctant to devote his attention to him.
This attitude is a deplorable vision of the future.
A stable Middle East is of vital interest to the United States.
This implies a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine.
The Generic Tobacco Packaging Act comes into force in Australia
Warnings about the risks of smoking and parts of the body with diseases appear on green off boxes, which are the same for all tobacco brands
The Australian law on tobacco and generic packaging, a pioneer in the world, comes into force and replacing the logos and colours of the brands with a wrapper of an olive-green blackout, horrific images of parts of the body with diseases and representations of sick children and babies as children of smoking parents.
With the exception of the various images and health warnings, the only difference between the boxes, mandatory since Saturday, are the names of the brands, all of them printed in a small font type.
This is the strictest regime in the world for tobacco packaging.
The Australian federal government states that the goal is to deter young people from smoking by eliminating the traits that make this habit glamorous.
Trusts in studies that show that if a person has not started smoking before the age of 26, there is a 99% chance that he will never do so.
"You can see that children, even from a very early age, understand the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell through its brand," said Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that showed, for example, how girls related the logo of a crown to the idea of being a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and these changes will not affect the benefits of multinationals too much, other countries are considering similar measures.
The tobacco industry has exerted enormous pressure against the law.
Tobacco companies claimed that the law would promote the black tobacco market, where cigarettes would be cheaper and more accessible.
"The legislation will have serious involuntary consequences," said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco in Australia.
It will increase the amount of tobacco that counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will bring to sell on the streets of Australia.
Other people say that their business has benefited after the passing of the law.
Sandra Ha, of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, claimed that the demand for tins and silicone covers to cover the unpleasant images of the boxes had been fired almost two months ago, when British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a challenge to the law in the Supreme Court of Australia.
Ms. Ha stated that Zico had sold up to 6,000 units to wholesalers and was expecting more stocks.
"It's a good business for us."
According to experts, the possible obstacle is the popularity of social networks among the demographic sector to which the plan is directed.
Following a series of Australian laws that prohibit advertising on television and sponsorship of sports and force most sellers not to put cigarettes in sight, tobacco marketing has become online.
Australia has banned advertising on the Internet to local companies and websites, but cannot restrict it on foreign pages.
"If you sell tobacco and you only have this small window to promote your products, online space is the most compelling place to be," said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman noted an increase in reviews of brands from "foot citizens" posted on social media websites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
One wonders whether this is just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigars and has taken the trouble of making a video or whether any marketing company is behind it.
Australia's British American Tobacco indicated that the industry focuses more on what new regulation implies than on marketing.
Industry has even come to pay for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to refuse the new rules; these countries are asserting before the World Trade Organization that trade is being unfairly restricted, despite the fact that none of these countries has a significant volume of trade with Australia.
The WTO is likely to issue a resolution in mid-2013.
Plibersek stated that the government had held talks with other countries that are considering implementing similar tobacco packaging laws.
In 2001, Canada became the first country to introduce the mandatory inclusion of images in boxes.
They are currently compulsory in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
In Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India, tougher laws are being considered.
Many smokers in Australia are challenging.
"Photographs don't affect me.
I just don't listen to them."
"Take the cigarette and keep the package," says Victor El Hage as he buys a package with the image of a tumor in his mouth.
"To be honest, there's only one reason I'd stop smoking: for my daughter."
James Yu, manager of the King of the Pack pond in central Sydney, indicates that uniform boxes make it more difficult for him to place them on shelves.
"It usually took me an hour to draw up a delivery; now it takes me four," Yu says.
"The government should have totally banned tobacco and then, it's, okay, it's over and we close the store," he says as he raises his hands up.
In a constantly connected world, it's not so bad to get bored a bit
During Thanksgiving parties this year, unexpectedly I had to spend five hours at an airport because the plane we were flying suffered a mechanical problem and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
So I had a lot of time to think about boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Spending half a day at an airport waiting for a flight to arrive is quite boring, even if you have the means to be entertained, such as books, magazines or iPhones, without forgetting duty-free shops.
But more and more academics and child development experts praise the goodness of boredom.
According to them, it's okay for us and our children to get bored from time to time.
Aborting forces the brain to look for interesting options and may encourage creativity.
Since most of us are currently connected to this or that screen, we do not experience the benefits of boredom.
So, should we accept boredom in a good spirit?
Yeah.
And no.
But we'll talk about it later.
First, like many people, I assumed that, now that we have more time for leisure, boredom would be a relatively recent phenomenon.
But, as Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman History at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of the book "Boredom: A Lively History" ("The boredom, an animated story") published in 2011 by Yale University Press, says, this is not the case.
"In fact, the story of boredom is very extensive," he says.
On the walls of Pompeii there are Latin graffiti on boredom dating back to the 1st century AD.
We must also consider how we define boredom.
"The problem is that it has already been defined and discussed in a variety of ways," says John D. Eastwood, Professor of Psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After examining the published research and putting the idea before a discussion group of 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as the experience of "desire, but not being able, to participate in an activity that fills you".
He claims that the difference between boredom and apathy is that the person does not do something but wants to do it.
He points out that with apathy there is no desire to do anything.
The main experience of boredom, he says, is "the alteration of the attention process, associated with a low mood and a feeling that time is passing slowly."
The boredom may sound terribly similar to depression.
However, Professor Eastwood says that although they may be related, people who are bored tend to view the problem as a matter of the environment or the world, while people who are depressed consider the problem to be so.
Sometimes we think we're bored, when what happens to us is that we have trouble concentrating.
In his study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", published in the September issue of Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues referred to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape of a person reading the article in a magazine.
Some groups listened in the adjoining room to a full-volume television program that did not have any relationship, others listened to it with low volume, so it was barely perceptible, while the third group did not listen to the audio at any time.
The group that listened to the program with the low volume showed more boredom than the other two groups; it cost them to concentrate, but they were not sure why and attributed it to boredom.
"When you try to focus on a difficult or interesting task, the alteration of attention can lead to boredom," said Mark J. Fenske, Professor of Neuroscience at the University of Guelph, Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
"On the other hand, when you're doing something boring, like detecting defective parts in a manufacturing line, a music that distracts you can help you not get bored."
"In fact, we now know that moving or sneezing, actions that are often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can actually help combat it, as they make that person more physically alert."
"Research shows that those children who are allowed to move learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to remain still," says Professor Fenske.
We all know what it's like to get bored at some point: the delay of an airplane, a monotonous speaker, a particularly boring film.
But some people tend to get bored more than others.
To help measure this, some researchers developed in the 1980s a "trend to boredom" scale.
The scale includes issues such as "many of the things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous" and "there are so many things I'm interested in that I don't have time to do everything."
Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, says that, using such scales, researchers have discovered that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, and specifically need more external stimulation and more varied.
But, in general, teenagers are a kind of group that gets bored quite easily.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, carried out an experiment in which 400 adolescents and their parents were contacted seven to eight times a day through a search.
He found that 32 percent of teenagers said he was bored while in school or doing homework, while 23 percent said he was bored when he wasn't in school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know if the current boredom rates, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he said what he did know was that "adulthood is a time when boredom reaches its highest levels," largely because both children and adolescents are not given great control over what they want to do.
So, back to my question from the beginning: Is it good to get bored?
Sometimes it is not, because, taken to the extreme, it can cause us to expose ourselves to absurd physical risks, such as betting or falling into substance consumption as a method of combating it, as research shows.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers talk about the connection between boredom and creativity, according to Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying this issue for more than two decades.
"A boredom is the way the brain has to tell you that you should be doing something else," says Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at New York University.
But the brain doesn't always know what's most appropriate.
If you're bored and use that energy to play the guitar or cook, that will satisfy you.
But if you watch TV, it may satisfy you in the short term, but not in the long term.
"So, if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, he may not be bored anymore, but he will not have learned to entertain himself or to dose himself," says Professor Fenske.
And "that ability to dose applies to other situations," he says.
Your child not only learns to entertain himself, but learns to control himself better in other areas.
I don't think we really want to praise boredom.
But we shouldn't be too critical of him either.
Our aim should be, rather, to feel comfortable separated from the constant rumor of activities and technologies.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"In our view, we need to get bored more, but boredom is a desire too distressing and disturbing to relate it to something worth it," he says.
He points out that what people are really looking for is a way to disconnect and enjoy a dead time.
"In an environment where we are constantly overstimulated," he says, "it is difficult to find ways to focus our attention when the noise stops."
Colorado: No Instruction Book for New Marijuana Consumption Law · Global Voices
Anthony Orozco, a 19-year-old student at a community institute and footballer in southeastern Colorado, faces a criminal trial for something that will soon be legal throughout the state: possession of marijuana stones and a pipe that he used to smoke it.
Orozco says that one September day, he and some friends were driving around Lamar, on the plains near the Kansas border, when the police stopped them.
The police found marijuana in the car and a while later Orozco received a judicial summons for possession of drugs and related items (minor offences each involving a fine of US$ 100) informing him of the date of the trial.
"They treat us like criminals," Orozco says.
And they are?
In the weeks of uncertainty following the Colorado vote to legalize the possession of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the response in hundreds of smaller causes for drug possession depends less on the law than on the location.
Hundreds of misdemeanours for possession of marijuana are being overturned both here and in Washington State, where a similar measure was adopted.
Police departments have stopped filing charges against those over 21 years of age for small-scale possession, which will be legally passed after the law has entered into force in the coming weeks.
But the more conservative district prosecutors in Colorado have committed to moving forward with cases opened for possession of marijuana and are still quoting people.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains, are voting to prevent recently authorized marijuana stores from opening up in their communities.
"This is all changing so quickly that I don't know what's next," said Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in Aurora, just east of Denver.
Those in charge of regulations in the state of Washington are also turning the matter around.
And they continue to seek advice on establishing a system of licences for production, manufacture, distribution and sale, all of which before the deadline of 1 December 2013.
They say that, for better or worse, Colorado goes ahead of most states in regulating the use of marijuana, first for therapeutic purposes and now for recreational use.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so he'll be a good guide," says Brian E. Smith, spokesperson for the Washington State Alcohol Control Commission.
But Mr. Smith admits that any place or system can only make suggestions about what might work.
"There is no real precedent that serves as a model for us," he says.
Washington's law, known as I-502, comes into force on December 6, which also leaves a year during which it will swim between two waters, since the licensing system in that state will not yet exist, but possession will be legal.
In addition, there are some delicate mechanical issues that need to be resolved during this period, such as how to maintain a balance between the state's requirement to provide "adequate access" to authorised marijuana and its prohibition of cannabis businesses within 300 metres of schools, parks, playgrounds or children's centres.
"Nowhere will it be more difficult to locate an authorized cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area," says Ben Livingston, spokesperson for the Legal Cannabis Center, a recently created research group.
On 21 November, Oates, Aurora's chief of police, sent an e-mail to his police officers informing them that the city's prosecutor would stop bringing lawsuits for minor misdemeanours for possession of marijuana to people over the age of 21 and that the police would stop filing charges against those crimes "with immediate effect".
Police chief Oates said that they would enforce the regulations of the city that regulates marijuana cultivation for therapeutic purposes and that they would continue to pursue drug traffickers and drug dealers.
In Weld County, Northern Colorado, the district attorney, Ken Buck, represents a stricter view.
After the vote, he assured that his office would continue to pursue cases of possession of marijuana, mainly to pressure consumers and to decide to receive treatment.
Currently, 119 people face charges for possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, although many of them have other charges.
"Our office has an obligation to bring legal action against those faults that occurred at the time they were a crime," Mr. Buck said in a statement.
The response has been complicated even in places such as the rural county of Mesa, where voters rejected the marijuana legalization initiative.
Grand Junction police, the largest city in the county, no longer quotes adults for possession of small amounts.
Pete Hautzinger, district attorney for the county, supported this decision, but also decided not to dismiss any of the pending cases for possession.
"I don't think he's wasting his time in continuing to enforce the law until it changes," he said.
Despite the fact that 55 percent of voters supported the measure, it was never considered that taking marijuana consumption for recreational use within the government and the judicial system would be easy.
The contradictory reactions that emerge throughout the state show a marked ambivalence among officials regarding the great ecological experiment in this state.
"This is a cultural barrier with district prosecutors," says Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents the accused for possession of marijuana and who is a local spokesperson for the National Organization for the Reform of the Marihuana Law.
"It's been so long to bring people before the courts that, in fact, they still can't accept that it's legal," he said.
Being the first states to consider small amounts of marijuana in the same way as if it were alcohol, Colorado and Washington are preparing to become national testing cases for drug legalization.
While lawyers and state officials have a new legal sales border, they also look forward to receiving federal government information, which still provides for the consideration of the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal offences.
Defenders of the legalization of marijuana hope that the Department of Justice will give way.
Although there have been some notable arrests of marijuana patients and sellers for therapeutic purposes, the federal government has mostly allowed marijuana businesses to exist for these purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
"Although anti-drug agents are likely not to throw doors down to confiscate a small drug bag, they will likely be reluctant to allow state-regulated stores to operate for the sale of recreational marijuana, permitted under the new law," said Kevin A. Sabet, an ex-advisor of Obama's administration's drug policy.
Several cities in Colorado do not expect federal authorities to act.
Even before election day, some local governments passed moratoriums on any new marijuana store, even though it will be about a year before any of them can open.
Last week, the western city of Montrose adopted a six-month ban and is likely to pass it next week.
"We don't want to put ourselves in a situation where we authorize someone and then have a serious problem at the federal level," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
"Our community voted against this amendment.
We are studying in favour of what the community voted against voting in favour of what the state voted for."
Many questions arise in this regard.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was harassed until I left Oxford for being a Tory"
You don't attack the university by your point of view just now.
I don't remember a moment in my life when I haven't been dreaming of getting a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had been in what I assumed was the best place in the world to learn, a Greek symposium of the contemporary era that fostered the two pillars of civilization: free thought and tolerance.
However, two weeks after occupying my position at Worcester College in the late 1980s to take the History career, I had already packed my bags, which triggered the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and cried.
My friends were bewildered.
The Evening Standard stated that I had abandoned because I did not tolerate some college colleagues having sex in the next room.
Writer A.N. Wilson announced joking that I had left because I was forced to drink in broken cups.
The truth was less fun.
I ran away from there.
Yes, I did, because I had been subjected to systematic harassment and intimidation.
Not because of my extravagant name, or the fact that I came from a private school.
They harassed me for a single reason, which in the cradle of the alleged illustration was somewhat intolerant and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a prominent advisor to Margaret Thatcher and I supported the conservative party.
Maybe they're wondering what that's for now.
Well, several reports indicate that a new generation of right-wing students are suffering similar persecution.
The institutionalized and growing hatred of the students of the conservative party is such in Oxford that last week a group of them claimed the same level of equal rights as homosexuals, the disabled and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the JCR (group of graduate students) of Corpus Christi College claim that they are "often seriously separated, personally attacked and treated as unthankful people" by their political ideas.
They want to create a position on the equal opportunities committee of their college to make sure they can express their views freely.
Their situation was not favored by a recent BBC2 documentary called "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" about student politics and presenting the Tories as eccentric and neo-Nazi.
He showed post-graduate student Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Party Association (OUCA), in a Rolls-Royce, wearing a silver suit and a cane with a silver grip.
In other universities, conservative students say that they are treated as "Turkish heads" by introducing higher enrolment rates.
Luke Black, 20 years old and vice president of the Nottingham University Conservative Party Association, stated in a Sunday newspaper that "there is a growing tendency of leftists in universities.
People assume we're like the Bullingdon Club without even knowing each other."
Samuel Roberts, 21 years old and a history student at Corpus Christi who presented the motion for greater protection, says that this environment is "uncomfortable", while Stephanie Cherill, 19 years old and elected president of the OUCA, states that the attitude of members of the JCR towards the people who are from the centre right has worsened.
"This poses a threat to the intellectual debate environment, as well as to the well-being of members," he says.
During my first weeks at Oxford, I was more alone than one.
I entered college in September 1986, she was a terribly shy 18-year-old.
Hatred of the Conservative Party was at its highest point.
The previous year, the university had voted to deny Margaret Thatcher, a former student, a title "honoris causa" after cuts in funding for Higher Education.
The atmosphere would have shocked any Stalinist.
Already during the first days of the week of welcome to the new university students, when the new students met and met the professors, I received a sample of the bitterness that awaited me.
I discovered that the professors not only looked at the mockery of conservative college students, but also willingly participated in it.
The policy of mining strike, privatization and government opposition to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa reached the wood halls of the seminar.
The first I attended was to translate French texts from the 18th century into English and I was not prepared for what came next.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (already deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
Don't say one.
Pitt, a low man with a face that looked like a cupcake mass, knew well how to expel bad bile.
"Is it that the Thatcherists refuse to learn French or are they simply fools?" he asked.
The other college students laughed.
My eyes were burning from the tears I was trying to contain.
"I suggest you go to French classes in your spare time, as long as you're not too busy meeting people," Pitt grunted.
I went back to my room like a sorry soul.
That night I felt alone at dinner time in college; then I felt a slight pat on the back.
He was a second-year English student named James who presented himself as a member of the OUCA.
"I know who you are," he said kindly.
"I'm afraid that's how it goes.
They mess with anyone who's suspected of being Tory.
It's very complicated for me, but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it'll be even worse for you.
Many newly arrived Tories appear to be laborists."
Later, in a local pub, I tried cowardly to hide.
I insisted that I disagreed with everything Mrs Thatcher said.
That trick turned out to be useless.
A first-year student of Philosophy, Politics and Economics who, paradoxically, had studied in Eton, said: "You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You're contaminated."
Other students adopted that song.
I became the dirty pervert.
"How do the Tories have sex?" one asked.
"They beat each other up, don't they?"
I felt the same way that homosexuals should have felt before the liberal law of the 1960s.
Could you ever lead a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to stay with people who think like me only after dark?
Would I have to become a laborer and repress my natural tendencies?
The three years that awaited me presented themselves as a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only professor openly Tory was Norman Stone, Professor of Contemporary History for my college.
They hated him for being not only the Conservative party, but also thatcher's advisor on foreign policy and one of the people who wrote him his speeches.
I was barely there.
He hated the place because he considered it provincial and insignificant and because of his adherence to the Marxist-determinist vision of history.
In 1997 he accepted a chair at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You're not going to be happy here," he said.
I began to travel daily from Oxford to my parents' house in London, finding refuge in my family and friends with a more open metropolitan mentality.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
He didn't believe me.
When he studied there in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But if it's the best place in the world," he said with sadness.
"They would never do that, not there among my dear dream needles.
Even my communist friends always had an impeccable attitude."
His painful eyes began to cloud.
"Give him another chance.
I'm sure they did it just to joke.
I'd break my heart if you quit."
Tired of so many trips to London, my emotional resistance was deteriorating.
A friend of mine, who also supported the Conservative Party, had succumbed to pressure and renounced his creed.
The following week, during a seminar in which another professor of history had hinted, speaking totally seriously, that I was an "enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Red with shame on the inside, I admitted that my parents had "washed my brain" and called them "stupid old men."
The truce lasted a short time.
It was my father who put the last nail in the coffin of my university career in Oxford.
At that time my father wrote two weekly columns in Murdoch's press.
My door was locked.
I was in there huddled with fear, and after five minutes, my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I packed the bag and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
Maybe you call me weak crying.
But no 18-year-old person should be subjected to such a level of intimidation and hostility in an educational institution.
What is even more tragic is that it was Oxford, which has not only trained 14 prime ministers of the Conservative party, but is now hiding behind an undeserved reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentine: Master of Sewing", which was inaugurated this week in London, ABC talks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous Italian designer customers
Somerset House, former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
The designer has recognized him during the inauguration of "Valentine: Master of the Sewing", a retrospective apotheosic that brings together more than 130 high-sew dresses created by his "house" during the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the colophon of a story whose only protagonist is "il señor" Garavani, but which could not have been written without its distinguished clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the rare and distant world of nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until 3 March, there are plenty of private letters and photos with the signature of the most pomegranate of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, passing through Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margarita of England.
Valentino teaches these personal memories as trophies of his social ascent: from humble modesty of the city of Voghera, in northern Italy, to the idol of the international jet-set.
Being in love with royalty has nothing wrong.
"At least they don't turn off the glues of their pins on your magnificent carpet as some beautiful pop music celebrities do," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and we were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and entertains with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved being invited to his villa in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, intimate with forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
And yet, it's a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza also does not forget the charism of the modest.
Many years ago, after a parade in Piazza di Spagna, in Rome, we went to his apartment for dinner.
There were twenty of us, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of the floor, the decoration, the food, the music, in everything he saw and felt his spirit.
"Each of the guests made us feel important and loved," recalls the "top model", which began working with him during the Paris High Sewing Week in 1995.
"It never goes out of fashion because its designs are works of art," he says.
Alcurnia Parade
Garavani's life is not a story of obsessions, but of well-requited love.
He loves people with good education and better titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a glamorous 60-metre-long walkway that proposes a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and must parade through the walkway to contemplate a dream "heart" that features masterpieces of Valentino, such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristotle Onassis, the wardrobe that Monica Vitti used in "La Notte", or a wool and leather coat that belonged to Empress Farah Diba.
In this public of mannequins glitter names such as that of Sibilla of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosary of Bulgaria or Sofia of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the Modest, in 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "impossible to forget".
I remember it perfectly.
It was a trousers, a shirt, a vest "gillette" and a jacket from the Autumn-Winter 1971-1972 collection.
"It was a gift he gave me," says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's muses.
"I prefer him above others for his femininity, for his great love for women, because he enhances our beauty," adds the former Duchess of Feria.
I really like the colors you use, they have great light and are "donors" to the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and fashion prescriber Patricia della Giovanpaola d'Arenberg can also forget the first time she ever wore a Valentino.
When I was a teenager and lived in Italy, I dreamed of getting to be the age and the opportunity to wear one of her night suits...
The time finally arrived in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino dress for a party at my cousin's castle, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red suit, flying skirt, draped "corsage" and cleavage word of honor.
"It was a dream come true," says Rodrigo d'Arenberg's widow.
"Valentine is fashion-indifferent, her obsession is timeless," explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her modest party dresses with "the utmost care... because a dress is not only a dress, it is also the set of memories that carries".
The "king" of fashion
The grand finale of the Somerset House exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding costume at her wedding with Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (as the fashion designer calls his seamstresses) to make that ivory silk suit with pearl inlays, twelve different lace types and a four and a half meter tail.
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, the highest authority of the specialized press, this dress represents a milestone of the high sewing of the late 20th century, "the return of the clients of the high society".
Obnivated for years with the elite's "savoir-être", Valentino is now his best specimen.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest ranking distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Comandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, awarded with the Legion of Honor, Garavani accumulates as many honours as any of the husbands of her clients.
"I've always been aware of your refinement, your calmness, your pulsating and perfect appearance," D'Arenberg admits.
Last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a great friend of mine.
"I was impeccable, time doesn't pass for him."
If a princess says so...
The toughest trade in the world: Kawah Ijen's human mules
For four euros, Indonesian volcano carriers play life and health by carrying 70 kilos of sulphur through steep stone paths
There are people for whom their work is hell and another who literally works in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who make a living by extracting sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, it has to descend every day to the bottom of its crater, where the sulphurous gas that emanates from the bowels of the Earth is solidified when it comes into contact with the air.
After tearing up large sulphur rocks, which in total weigh about 70 kilos, carry them in two bamboo baskets that carry over their shoulders through steep stone paths.
It is only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to 2,386 meters of altitude, but the exhausted carriers take more than 40 minutes to ascend by turtle pass, keeping the balance and temptingly measuring their steps so as not to slip and fall down the cliff.
They know that any transplant could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who took off years ago because of the risks of Kawah Ijen.
Kawah Ijen miners earn 5 cents per kilo of sulphur they extract
Once up, they open up among tourists who photograph them as if they were circus monkeys and, tiringly carrying the heavy baskets, they walk three kilometers to the scale that a mining company has placed a little lower, at 1,850 meters high.
This is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has operated the volcano since 1960 and, never before, to its workers, to which it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents of euro) per kilo of sulphur.
It is then sold for Rs 10,000 (83 cents of euro) to the petrochemical industry, since this mineral is widespread in everyday life and is used to make matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to whiten sugar.
"As usual it is to carry 70 kilos, we take out about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) on each trip," explains Anto, who usually carries out three daily doors.
It takes three hours each and ends up grinding, but they allow you to gather 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems a misery for such an inhuman effort, it is three times what he would gain in the field.
"The newspaper of the miners is very high here, where the collection of coffee is paid at 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day and the average monthly wage is two million rupees (167 euros)", the carrier, who used to work as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali, explains.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and the slice was not as hard, but Anto has returned to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a weighty reason that, in Indonesia, is as strong as sulfur: "I married a young woman from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I brought her to Java to convert to Islam."
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes get irritated by toxic gases
At the age of 27, Anto has been playing his skin on the Kawah Ijen, whose sulphur has already begun to pass him a bill despite covering his face with a mask and special glasses.
He has asthma, he breathes with difficulty, he coughs constantly and his eyes get irritated by the toxic gases that fire the volcano.
It's the price you have to pay to get your dream.
"I will work two more years because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French," he promises in more than acceptable English.
Chastised by life, this nice and intelligent young man could be a tour guide, waiter or receptionist of a hotel, but instead he does the work of a mule.
Sharing an unclean wooden cabin with other carriers, it rises every day at two o'clock in the morning because the sulfur does not stop manning at night, when its characteristic yellow color becomes blue and shines in the middle of the darkness.
Defying the shadows, Anto descends to the crater lighting himself with a small flashlight attached to his helmet, which he himself has bought with his money.
About 400 carriers load the sulfur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater
Despite its small profits, the mining company has not mechanized the extraction of sulphur to save costs or provide any equipment to the carriers, who work on their own and to so much weight.
In fact, they don't even see part of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) per camera that, next to the entrance of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), the guards of this natural park charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This work is for the beasts and not for the people," says Madrusin, a 42-year-old carrier who has been in Kawah Ijen for three decades since leaving school.
Capable of lifting up to 110 kilos, he says he will endure working "all he can" because he needs the money to raise his three children, between 18 and 10 years old.
I won't retire, I'll die here because the volcano has been my whole life.
Although sulfur burns the throat and darkens the eyes when the wind changes suddenly and traps the miners in the thick columns that come out of the volcano, they are so hard that no one complains of suffering serious diseases... beyond, of course, their usual breathing problems, arthrosis, knee pains and sores on the shoulders, which have been malformed by the weight of the baskets.
Swinging the basket on his back, Unainik can only carry 50 kilos at the age of 53.
Every day, he and his companions start 15 tons of sulfur to the volcano, which three trucks transport to the Tamansari warehouse, 18 kilometers away by a path of goats between the weeds.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life," Unainik proclaims opening his mouth well, where he lacks several teeth.
Of his five children, the oldest, 30 years old, also works carrying sulphur.
Time passes, but misery perpetuates from generation to generation one of the hardest trades in the world: the one that makes the human mules of Kawah Ijen.
Singapore Seeks Babies to Save the Economy · Global Voices
Singaporeans blame career, stress and property costs and education for having no children.
"Singapore's population needs to grow."
I'm a patriotic husband, you're my patriotic wife, we do our civic duty and we create life!
It may seem unlikely that these verses are part of a mint pill ad, but despite that - or perhaps because of that - the video became viral on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The phrases are part of a rap that uses local references like "Let's put a bao (bollo) in the oven" to laugh at Singapore's birth rate.
The advertising company that made the video, BBH, holds the hope that with the ad they will manage to draw attention to the problem in a fun way.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to make people do "their national duty."
This is purely internet stuff, so we had to make it fun and funny.
It's the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world to reproduce ourselves, so we felt that this was a topic we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as throwing perfumes with pheromones or organizing speed-dating evenings.
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but they did not necessarily work.
So we think, why don't we do the most creative thing we can to solve this problem, which is to compose a rap?
1.2 children
The government of Singapore does not take it so lightly.
It spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for marriages and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all this has had little effect.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech state city in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
Singapore ' s birth rate, according to its national population division, currently stands at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was above 2 - known as the replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why don't Singaporeans have kids anymore?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage and Family Policy at the National Population Division, says it is due to "better education" and "a wider range of career opportunities".
"This has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond getting married and forming a family," he explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to increased singleness and delayed marriage and birth, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aims to dramatically increase immigration to cope with the decline in the population has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore there are websites where xenophobia abounds hardly disguised against many new immigrants, in particular the Chinese, who criticize for keeping wages low and not integrating.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why last year Singapore's ruling party experienced its worst election result since independence.
Since the elections there has been an attempt to correct the problem, with the highest fees and fees for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the fall in the birth rate has known effects on a nation's economic growth, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, Singapore's example is also having some unexpected consequences.
The government is trying not to build so many small houses.
For example, it has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The urban development authority has gone on to control the number of small apartments, known as "shoe box", that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a surface area of 46 square meters and have been very successful in sales.
However, there is concern that they can promote a single lifestyle and discourage developers who want to build large, family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, director general of the real estate company EL Developers, says his "shoe boxes" are sold much faster than the larger units.
They are more popular, in the sense that units run out of days, even weeks, faster than larger units.
This makes it much better for our cash flow.
However, it admits that the new rules give clearer guidance to developers, who were previously hampered if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project.
Too stressed.
Singapore is a state city.
While these new rules may be a step towards raising the national birth rate, speaking to Singaporeans working in the centre's financial district does not seem to have much effect.
"People are very stressed, homes are expensive and so is education, so many people are postponing it," says a young executive.
Other people may have children.
"But for me it's important to have my own money and time," says another young man of about 20 years old.
Men and women mention their careers, stress and the cost of property and education as the reasons that prevent them from having children.
So, as much as the government tries to push its citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies, Singaporeans have the last word.
The private off line is private on line
Privacy.
According to the Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy it is about the quality of private or "the sphere of private life that has the right to protect from any interference".
What's private for a 16-year-old?
How does this definition apply in your daily life and on social networks?
Do you understand the dangers to which you are exposed by ventilating situations on the Internet that you would surely not share offline?
The Newspaper interviewed five boys between the ages of 10 and 15, frequent users of the network.
In four of the cases, they associated the term with "something very mine", on a personal level, and "in the key and name of the user", when they applied it to social networks.
"My deepest secrets wouldn't upload them to a post," says Jorge, ten years old, when he tries to explain the meaning of private on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
"They're very secret secrets, my mom can meet them, but not everyone," she says.
In FB I upload beautiful images or games.
I am also entertaining myself with my acquaintances.
"I wouldn't share a picture that's not mine, or someone who's making a fool of themselves," he says.
The child acknowledges that it is wrong to publish obscene photographs of naked persons, crimes or to write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge claims to know the 35 friends he has on FB and his nine followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
The mother is included, she has the key to one of the accounts.
I opened Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I just upload them," he adds.
"Social networks are entertaining, I can talk to distant relatives or my friends quickly," she says.
He would not hesitate to answer that he would never accept an application from an unknown person.
I wouldn't even listen to someone recommend a stranger.
Joseph's 14-year-old case is different.
The teenager has open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, in the latter he admits not knowing 20 of the people added to his list of friends.
"It doesn't scare me, because we have something in common, music for example," he says.
According to the boy, no one has been hinted at or asked for the address of his home or his phone number.
"If I was pressured or demanded, I would simply take them out of my account," he admits.
Joseph became a follower of Ask, after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is not alien to the experiences of what is now known as cyberbullying.
A acquaintance of a friend of mine was being extorted on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who he was," he says.
The victim, according to Joseph, did not close the account.
"She just gave him privacy."
Then explains a series of steps to set up the account securely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
If I did, if I don't like it or if I want to.
"Although I know that's cyberbullying," he says.
Key questions
Marielos Porras, a teacher in English and a graduate in Education and Learning, believes that to guide children and adolescents, it must be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet emerged as a means to seek information, but with the appearance of these sites changed the rules of the game," he says.
Porras points out that academic Marc Prensky, a master's degree in Pedagogy from Yale University and author of the work Natives and Digital Immigrants, coined these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives are them, the children and young people who were born with technology.
"We are the digital immigrants we have to teach them, when we are still learning," he says.
He comments that the topic is complex, "because we are asking them to have a definite approach to what is appropriate or not to disseminate, publish or say to an age that maturity does not give for that."
"They are also selective when what matters most to them is being popular, having thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach privacy to children and adolescents is through questions that make them reflect.
"Tell them not to do it is no use," he adds.
Next, Porras lists some options: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or, would you like them to post a picture of you like the one you published from a friend?
You know what the others publish about you?
When you labeled party photos, did you ask other people for permission to label them?
And one more, do everyone need to know what you're doing every moment?
Another point is to make them see that they should act on line as they do off line.
They're the same rules.
"One out of the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, the same must be on social networks," he says.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary teacher and educational consultant, comments that it is essential for parents to read social media policies in a conscious manner.
By understanding each of the letters they have solid foundations for talking to their children about the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
"For example, age and what is allowed to be shared or published," he says.
According to Guardia, it is key to remind children of the lesson of "don't talk to strangers".
End Unasur Summit without making public the Lima Declaration
The Sixth Presidential Summit of the South American Union of Nations (Unasur) concluded today in Peru without the publication of the Lima Declaration, previously announced and theoretically signed by the seven attending presidents.
Efe repeatedly attempted to access the document signed at the Sixth Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but sources of Chancellery and Presidency pointed out at an early stage that they were going to hand it over after the closure, but then claimed that at some point it would be posted on the Peruvian Government's website.
When consulted by the text, they noted that the contents had been presented by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, during brief statements to the press.
Journalists ' access to Summit information was restricted at all times.
During the day, only the soundless video of the presidential assembly was broadcast in the press room with the message "private session, restricted audio".
The little information that circulated among the reporters was delivered by the press spokespersons of some of the Unasur governments attending the meeting, although not the Peruvian.
The only document released during the day was the list of attending presidents, which caused the discomfort of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media asking for more data.
Subsequently, the Peruvian Presidency sent an e-mail to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but this is about Humala's pronouncement, and not about the official document that closed the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the Third Summit of South America-Arab Countries (ASPA), and on that occasion, despite being insistently demanded by the press, also the so-called Lima Declaration that they had previously announced was not disseminated.
On the official ASPA website it can be corroborated that the document was published last Tuesday.
In both international events, the Peruvian authorities worked to ensure that transmission systems were in place for all journalists, but they limited the collection of information to the maximum extent possible.
The summit also concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a judgment of the Court of The Hague that resolves a border dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and of Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and ratified that they will respect the decision of the (CIJ), which begins Monday in The Hague to hear the arguments of both parties, in the process that Lima presented against Santiago.
"We will end and execute the judgment that defines the differences that we are leading to this international court today," Humala said, along with his Chilean pair.
"Chile has been, is and will continue to be a country that respects international law, the peaceful settlement of disputes, treaties and international tribunals," Piñera added, and waved with a handshake to Humala, along with the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation of the two presidents that they will submit to the ICJ occurred after Colombia denounced this week the Pact of Bogotá by which it had agreed to submit to the judgments of that international tribunal, after a decision on maritime boundaries with Nicaragua that it considered gravely wrong.
The summit was held with the inattentives of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011, after the dismissal of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was in charge of opening the discussions in the morning and closing the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The president read the final document in which he reported that 16 agreements were adopted and the lines of action were set for 31 projects between South American countries for a total of $17 billion in investments.
Among the agreements adopted he mentioned that the UNASUR countries will take "significant steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship for what we are expanding the residency agreements."
He reported that actions are being taken to improve "cooperation in the fight against citizen insecurity and transnational organized crime, actions to make medicines more accessible, access to the Internet at low prices in all parts of South America, and to address the risks of natural disasters jointly and efficiently".
With a Europe in crisis, "the economic consolidation (of Latin America) must not have a triumphalistic matrix but must serve to expand our productive matrix and to glimpse a better future for our peoples," Humala added.
"We have decided to favour a group of 31 flagship projects that will improve the connection of South American spaces, especially in rural and border areas... by uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits," the Peruvian President said in a message read.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five correspond to Peru, and are located on the transverse axes of their territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two point to a greater connection with Ecuador, although he did not give further details.
The outcome document also mentioned the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in that country will serve for its reinstatement into the Union of South American Nations", from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated, and good neighbourly relations, was another of the issues highlighted by the summit.
In this sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before starting his participation in the regional meeting he hoped to meet with his Nicaragua partner, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to deal respectfully with the maritime dispute after a ruling of the ICJ, questioned by Bogotá.
"Tomorrow (Saturday) you may have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
"We will review all these paths, they are not exclusive, even the treaty with Nicaragua will require a conversation with Nicaragua," he stressed.
"With President Ortega I hope to be able to tell him to handle this in the most civilized and respectful way possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega would meet on Saturday in Mexico where they plan to attend the inauguration of the new president of that country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Also, as part of the summit, the Defence Ministers of the bloc met in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, although the last country is suspended.
Peru has the pro tempore presidency of the regional bloc.
"South America must learn from Europe to integrate a citizenship": Rafael Correa
Ecuador's President, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which "South America, in this case, must learn from Europe".
Correa, who participated in the Sixth Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), held in Lima, told the state TV Peru that Europeans "killed themselves in World War II" and other conflicts, "but now they are practically a homeland".
He defended, in this regard, the plan to establish South American citizenship that is encouraged by the Unasur member countries.
"Free mobility of citizens and workers must be achieved by any South American country, as is already the case with the members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want to return us to the past," he warned.
The Ecuadorian president also expressed his support for the recomposition of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the premise of lowering the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those who have signed the San José pact on human rights.
Those who give chair never commit to anything and instead we South Americans sign it all.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under the funding of the United States," he said in reference to the political asylum given by Ecuador to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa stated that he is not sorry for this decision because he has not betrayed its principles, but has respected its "deep democratic and human rights values".
He added that, at the time, "there were well-founded suspicions that Assange was extradited to a third country and his process was not respected."
He also criticized Swedish justice for demanding that he be interrogated on his territory for an alleged sexual offence when "Swedish legislation itself allows this to be done through videoconferencing, which could be done from the Embassy of Ecuador in London".
Correa stated that there is a risk that Assange's physical and mental health will deteriorate.
"I haven't spoken to him since he's been in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that she had a small lung problem, nothing serious," said the Ecuadorian president.
What does exist is the danger that your physical and mental health will deteriorate by being locked in a small space without being able to exercise outdoors.
"That complicates the health of anyone," he added.
Correa pointed out that the asylum solution granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, through the granting of a safe passage to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities and stressed that there have been talks with London in search of a solution to the closure of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been permanent talks.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities because Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, is doing a number of procedures in different European bodies," he said.
And he said, "If Britain gives the safe conduct tomorrow, it's over."
And if Sweden, as its legislation perfectly permits and has done in other cases, questions Mr Assange at the Embassy of Ecuador in London or questions him via Skype tomorrow, this problem ends.
Correa took the opportunity to reaffirm himself as an advocate of freedom of the press and said that what he does not tolerate is "mediocrity, bad faith and lies, which distort freedom of expression."
"The greatest enemies of press freedom are not evil and perverse politicians but bad journalists based on profit, blackmail and extortion," he said.
In this regard, he welcomed the fact that it is no longer these journalists "either the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate Ecuador", and said that if re-elected "it will deepen in the revolution to continue the path and the right direction".
Correa also supported the decision to maintain Paraguay's veto in Unasur at least until its next elections, arguing that the body "must be firm and not tolerate the opportunism and the legal coup" because it actually "destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
The Ecuadorian president also considered "perfectly relevant" the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries after the ruling of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which benefited Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.
At the moment, that failure is not being complied with.
It is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to walk together.
They must be processed in a comprehensive manner to overcome them and move on.
He also trusted in a good conclusion of the dispute over maritime limits that they maintain in the same court Peru and Chile and felt that "it is right for Latin America to seek international bodies if the two countries undertake to accept judgment however hard it may be".
Referring to the eventuality of running for the next presidential election in Ecuador to seek a third consecutive term, he pointed out that he sees this possibility "with great optimism and joy, although it is sometimes quite hard".
Correa assured that if he loses the February 2013 elections, he will withdraw from public life.
Personally, I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unfair as Ecuador's, that socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
"My political movement believed that I was the one who guaranteed that probable victory, because we have to accept that responsibility," he said.
To win would be my last term in the presidency and that's where we got out of public life.
If we lose the same thing.
"It's a decision," he said.
Correa also referred to the new health treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just spoke to Venezuelan vice president Nicolás Maduro and he tells me that he traveled to a treatment that was already planned, routinely, that was expected to pass the campaign to return to Cuba.
"It doesn't mean a relapse in President Chávez's state of health," he said.
The Ecuadorian Head of State participated today in Lima at the Sixth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to sustain progress, equality and security.
AIDS deaths today are cause of late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed the test result: positive AIDS.
"It was like I dropped a bomb," he says when he remembered the timing of the announcement, that the doctor was trying to make "softer", without obvious success.
The boy hid it from his family.
She decided to take care of her illness alone and began to inquire about her; with such an effort that she already celebrated her birthday 43.
It is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the HIV Unit of the Civil Hospital of Guadalajara (HCG), to which it arrived in 1994 after several battles.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine in the early 90s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
Then even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye to him "because he had a cut."
So, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Now it is possible to survive this syndrome and do so with quality of life.
However, ignorant of their disease, many people still arrive when the virus has already caused damage, "exhausted" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the emergence of AIDS in the world, at least the first reported cases, "the great achievement at this time means that the survival of a patient who initiates treatment in a timely manner and the survival of the general population is exactly the same," said the head of the HCG HIV Unit, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, noting that this information was endorsed in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectologist and expert on HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a fatal sentence, but the years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of immune system impairment presented by patients at the start of the diagnosis, with better expectations for those who are not drug users: up to 30 years old with a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years old, when they report 500 CD4.
In simple words, this means that those who are diagnosed with HIV positive at 25 years of age, under these terms "as long as they remain in control will be able to live without problems up to 75 years of age," the interviewee explained.
To measure this progress, it should be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is on average 76 years.
While mortality has fallen significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying of AIDS fell from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that since the emergence of AIDS, 60 per cent of the patients in the national database have died.
Only in Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, and there are 187 deaths up to May of this year; however, it is ensured that there is universal access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
- Why are there still deaths?
- It seems to me that the problem is not access to treatment.
That's how I visualize it, that's how it happened in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years we have not had enough medication the problem is that patients arrive very advanced because they do not know their state of infection, that is, in late stages of the disease.
He gave a strong statement: "Nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have some opportunistic infection what needs to be done to have a greater impact on global mortality, is to make earlier diagnoses and, therefore, have to offer screening tests in a massive way, to all people who require it."
In his proposal, specialists and officials of the State AIDS Prevention Council in Jalisco (Coesida), also the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who went to a particular laboratory to take the test, only motivated because he had made it a friend and, despite his young age, was already in the AIDS stage and even suffered from Kaposi sarcoma, a cancerous tumor that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're going to die and don't want to know anything.
"If I'm already going to die, I'd better go three times a week," they say no to my case.
The change was to improve, I eat well, I exercise, I take medicines.
To date, her parents only know that she suffered from cancer.
I live a normal life, like anyone else.
"I work, I have many activities, I travel, I have an active but co-responsible sex life, I take care of myself and the other person," said Fabrizio, who agreed to share his privacy with MILENIO JALISCO to motivate with his testimony those who today, in the framework of World AIDS Day, are afraid.
Let them take the test, if they were at risk, that the sooner they know if they are HIV positive, it is better and if they already have the diagnosis, that they learn that they can live like anyone else, being responsible.
That, his message, sums up the slogan of AIDS battle this year.
Condoms behind the counter
Great are the gaps between health programs and the ordinary citizen, said Ricardo Salazar, a tapatio journalist who has taken the lead in HIV.
And the biggest one is in prevention.
In places dedicated to this task "there has actually been an increase in the distribution of condoms, before they gave us one or two, now they give us packages of a hundred, and that is very good but it turns out that there are those today, still, who do not have access to a condom," he said.
Adolescents are among the most vulnerable to new infections.
"What do you want them for?" is a common question, with sorrow and value judgments of social workers, school counselors, pharmacy employees and health personnel, to which adolescents do not want to be exposed, the communicator said.
He proposed reorienting this ineffective distribution; that condoms not be just behind counters and those hundred are in public bathroom dispatchers from sites frequented by young people.
It's not motivating promiscuity.
Nor is it a question of paying for the cellas and the motel, as Governor Emilio González replied, asking him if there would be a distribution of condoms in his administration.
"That's not how sexuality is, it's best to bring condoms closer to those who already engage in sexual activity," he said.
Keys in Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state is 4th national in new and accumulated cases of AIDS and 13th HIV.
92% of the infections correspond to the sexual route, 6% to the blood route and 2% to the perinatal route.
It is estimated that 50,000 people may be living with HIV, as there are 4 to 5 people who do not know about it in a registered case.
Ratified by an appellate court in the United States, a judgment that ignores the restructuring of the Vitro Group's debt achieved through a commercial competition in Mexico, the scenario sets a bad precedent for any national company with branches in the neighboring country that has solvency problems.
It would be said, therefore, that the procedures behind the survival of the signatures that allow Mexican laws are not valid in the country of bars and stars, contrary to international conventions.
On the practical side, the backlash to the judgment issued on June 15 by Judge Harlin Hale of the Court of Bancarrotas for the Northern District of Texas, leaves Mexican firms helpless in the face of the possibility of embargoing their properties in the area of Bravo.
However, the resolution opens the door to the main glass manufacturer in Mexico to go to the U.S. Supreme Court, alleging three inconsistencies.
At the outset, while the judge of the case points out that creditors must be governed by the United States Bankruptcy Act, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeal, based in New Orleans, says that the main proceedings are the commercial competition in Mexico.
The first point would imply ignoring international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with a transnational profile.
In fact, to that end, the United Nations Model Law on Uniformity of International Trade Law was created, and the American Law Institute was placed as an arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment states that without the intercompany vote, recognized in the critical mass of the commercial competition the debts that the subsidiaries of Vitro had with their parent, the majority required to approve the restructuring would not have been achieved.
However, the possibility is recognized by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro's has not been the first case in which the scheme is accepted.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agromex and Comercial Mexicana, whose intercompany debts were endorsed by the Federal Institute of Mercantile Competitions.
The truth is, moreover, that by subtracting the votes of the subsidiaries, however, Vitro's creditors who fought against it in the U.S. Courts, that is, the "buitre" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergence, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, will not have achieved a majority.
The vote would have been 45 per cent against 37.
The data is omitted by the Court of Appeal.
From another angle, Vitro blames Vitro for the difficult situation he faced from 2008 to the end of the severe economic crisis that the United States faced, taking the collections to the country.
As soon as possible, the signature of the González Sada family will bring an appeal for reconsideration before the appellate court itself so that the vote will reach its full session, i.e. the five judges, given that only three of them voted.
If this does not succeed, Cerciorare's appeal, which requires a review of the proceedings by a higher court, will be filed in this case by the United States Supreme Court of Justice.
The serious thing about the case is that the court dismissed a document sent by the Mexican government under the figure of amicus curiae ("friend of the Court"), detailing the procedure followed by Vitro under the Mercantile Competitions Act, noting that the latter decommissioned with attachment to the agreements signed by both countries to tie it with Chapter 15 of the United States Banking Act.
Moreover, it is noted that the country has adhered to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules established for cross-border insolvency cases, which guarantee equity for debtors and creditors.
Two-banded carambola: Vitro gets hit and the country gets hit.
General balance
Over a period of several months, the complaints lodged at the table by the Mexican Aviation Unions against the company's ex-owner, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, accused of fraudulent administration, the Association Sindical de Pilotos Aviadores has already found the bottleneck.
The body headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has just filed a criminal suit against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is accused of obstruction of justice.
According to this, the supervisory authority has systematically refused to report to the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic on an operation carried out by the employer to extract 198 million pesos from the trust F/589 of Bank IXE, on behalf of Mexican Aviation.
The resources would have been channelled to the purchase of shares of the Professional Hotel Administrator.
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
They're looking for the Dragon Mart.
Meeting on the weekend at a forum at the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and members of civil society in general approved the creation of a comprehensive front to oppose the inauguration of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
We are talking, as you know, about a colossal center of sale and distribution facing Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products of the country of the wall, with an area of housing to the lime for employees of 150 companies.
Previously the Canacintra had managed to unify the governors of the southeast area to oppose the monumental thing that destroyed with part of the protected areas and poses the mother of all the amagos against the industry.
ACTA died
A demand from the Senate to explain under what terms and circumstances the ambassador of Mexico to Japan signed the Anti-falsification Trade Agreement, known by its acronym in English as ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property, the matter has already passed to the archive.
As you know, the action was taken despite the fact that the Senate itself had disqualified the possibility by considering it to be offensive to freedom of expression on social networks.
Long-term homex
In an effort to pay long-term debts without affecting short-term debts, the Homex housing developer is placing 500 million pesos on the market.
The issue is the first of four identicals offering to pay interest every 28 days.
Nace Competival
Integrated by NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet, leaders in information technology, a consortium with competitive social reasons has just been created, whose goal will be the service market of software clusters in Central and South America.
Investments in this area exceed $1.5 billion.
Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "The basketball has been my life"
Trotamundos of basketball Hector "Hetin" Reyes was over 60 years tied to the sport of the board and, thanks to it, traveled the whole world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a mental collection of local basketball history as wide as Hector "Hetin" Reyes has.
And it's that before a stroke confined him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in sport for more than 60 years, he was as a minor player, a player in the National High Basketball, a strong and leading player in the BSN with the Bayamon Cowboys or president of the Basketball Federation.
"I put many hats on basketball throughout my life, including several at the same time, as when I was president of the BSN, general manager of the National Team and federative president during the 90s," Reyes recalled during a first hour visit to his home in Bayamón, where he resides with Isabel, his faithful wife for over 50 years.
"Basketball has been my life."
Kings does not exaggerate in making that assertion.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memorabilia that denote his wide trajectory, attest to it.
Bayamon in the heart
Of all, those who treasure with the greatest emotion are those who remember their passage through the Cowboys from the mid 1950s as a player until 1982, when he turned 15 years into a co-author or a franchisee.
"Those were my best years, the ones I enjoyed most because I had the opportunity to be part of eight cowboy championships since 1967, either as a seizer, co-author or leader.
It was many years of satisfaction, including the five championships running from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, Jerome Mincy's debut year at the BSN.
From then on he took over "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator," said Reyes.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had directed here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me, "I have a very strong 6"7" tall player for you.
Do you want it?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended to sniper Raymond Gausse, who was born and was one of our best shooters.
I remember he said if Mincy had given Bayamon a championship, Gausse would help bring in another one.
The Vaqueros championship with Gausse enjoyed it, but at a distance, since by 1988 it was already a more federative commando.
For that time he preferred to enjoy his executory and those of Mincy on the National Team.
I remember when we first beat the United States during the 1989 Pre-Olympics in Mexico.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we came fourth and it must have been bronze if it wasn't for that Canadian referee who made us repeat the final play for the second time, Reyes said.
Is that 1990 World Cup group the best National Team you've ever seen?
He's one of the best, just like the one who won the Dream Team in the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was that of the Pan-Americans in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and gave a fur to the United States team, which was quite similar to the one that won us bronze in the world.
That team not only repeated Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculin" (Ortiz), but also had (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter young, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who had not been able to be in the 90's due to a knee injury.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of personnel, but gave us a gold medal and a great joy was that of the 1995 Preolimpico in Neuquén, Argentina.
With role-players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and a young Rolando Hourruitiner in place of the players suspended by the trouble of the Pan American of Mar del Plata, we won gold against all the predictions.
What was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Undoubtedly, that was Piculin Ortiz.
Their numbers at the international tournament level are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has mastered that level as Piculin did.
And that's not counting his career in the different leagues he played.
Who was the best boriquial leader?
That's very difficult.
We have had a very good layer that includes Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of young people, I really like Leo Arill's work.
What do you consider your greatest achievement in the federation?
To have been part of the most glorious era of the National Team between 1988 and 1995 and that at the beginning of the 90s the BSN had up to 17 teams in a season.
What's left for you to do?
There were things I would have liked to implement, such as the regionalization of the smaller categories.
For example, that the Ponce boys only played in their area and only faced teams from other corners of the island in the national playoffs.
Right now children travel and play too much unnecessarily.
At least I see the fruit of the compulsory certifications and course for leaders, desk officers and arbitrators.
That pleases me.
What are you doing now?
The most I do is listen to music, watch videos of my time's music on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball games.
And of course, enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been with me.
Actor Larry Hagman dies
Larry Hagman, born on September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, became world famous for his central role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R.", in the television series "Dallas", in which he embodied an unscrupulous, malicious and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the oil predator J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
I was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas", died on Friday afternoon due to cancer complications, according to a family statement provided to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., home producer of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in her beloved home town of Dallas, again representing the iconic role she liked best," the family said.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for Thanksgiving.
Linda Gray, who played her wife's role in the original series and in the sequel, was with Hagman when she died in a hospital in Dallas, said her publicist, Jeffrey Lane.
It brought joy to everyone I knew.
He was creative, generous, fun, funny, loving and talented, and I'll miss him so much.
"He was an original person and lived life to the fullest," Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and recognized that he had been drinking a lot for years.
In 1995, he was found to have a malignant tumor in his liver and underwent a transplant.
Years before "Dallas", Hagman became famous on television as a decent guy in the light comedy "I Dream of Jeannie", broadcast by the NBC channel from 1965 to 1970.
In it she played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life was altered when she found an attractive genius, played by Barbara Eden, and took her to live with him home.
He also starred in two short-lived comedies, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His film work included roles well received by the critics in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterful interpretation of the charmingly detestable J.R. that led Hagman to his greatest starry.
The CBS drama series on the Ewing clan and other characters in its orbit was aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional phrase "Who shot J.R.?", designed to generate expectation around an episode full of emotions in which Hagman's character is almost killed, generated international speculation and millions of dollars risked in gambling houses.
He also helped give the series a record audience at that time.
When the answer was revealed in a November 1980 chapter, an average of 41 million viewers tuned it up and turned "Dallas" into the second most viewed entertainment program in history, behind the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law, Kristin (played by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. pregnant her and then threatened to call her a prostitute unless she left town, but others also had reason to attack her.
Hagman interpreted Ewing as an insatiable corrupt with a charismatic smile: a cheating businessman and an unfaithful husband who tried to have his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), hospitalized.
"I know what I want on J.R.'s tombstone," Hagman said in 1988.
You should say, "Here lies the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only deal he's lost.
Victoria Principal, co-protagonist of the original series, reminded Hagman on Friday as someone "huge, inside and outside the screen."
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of admirers in the world, and in the hearts of each of us, that we were lucky enough to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success for the TNT channel.
The recording of five of the chapters for the second season had already been completed and a sixth was in progress, the chain reported.
Immediately there was no pronouncement by Warner or TNT on how the series will handle Hagman's loss.
From Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who starred in classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when she had him in 1931 during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tasted luck in New York theaters in the early 1950s, and then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
While there she met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001 he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I didn't put anything there that I thought was going to hurt someone or affect them somehow," he told Associate Press at the time.
After the liver transplant he became a promoter of organ donation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist fearful patients.
"I advise them, I give them courage, I meet them when they come for their surgeries, and then," he said in 1996.
I try to offer some comfort, like "don't be afraid, it'll be a little uncomfortable for a short time, but they'll be fine."
He was also an anti-smoking activist and participated in several campaigns.
Begin course that explores the "End of the World"
Each week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when the professor of religion Stuart Charmé decided to give a course on the end of the world, he knew that he had an irresistible hook: The end of the "long countdown" of the Maya Calendar, on December 21, to which many people have clinged as proof that the end of the world is coming.
But Charmé had no idea what he expected in the next couple of months: Hurricane Sandy, a cataclysmic fiscal precipice that some have called "deudarmagedon" and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where the late Christian theorists believe that the Apocalypse will begin.
"I didn't realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester ever," Charmé said this week to students at Rutgers-Camden University (New Jersey).
If you analyze what has been happening in the world today as if we were 30 days away and counting, this has been a really good time.
And remember that evil is good for those of apocalyptic mentality.
And he's not the only teacher who offers courses on the "end of the world" this semester, theoretically the last in history.
In Temple, Assistant Professor Barry Vacker is teaching the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World".
Each week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas proliferate over time," he said, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that guide certain human behavior.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could erupt.
This month the students analyzed films with apocalyptic themes and explored how they compare with real life examples.
"I have tried to inform students about what is possible, probable, credible and impossible," Vacker said.
On the main campus of the State University of Pennsylvania, Latin American History Professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an associate professor of Art History and Anthropology, have teamed up to deliver a course entitled "The End of the World".
"We don't add '2012' to always have the option to give the course again, in case the world doesn't end," Restall said.
Despite the "imminent ruin", students must study, generate projects and take final exams.
In Penn State, the final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse, which leaves students no choice but to work "until the same night the world is supposed to end," Restall said.
The courses were quite popular.
"It was saturated in two hours," Restall said about his course for high-average students, which was filled with 35 students.
We received e-mail messages for weeks and weeks before the start of the semester, from people asking if there was still room.
Students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"I find it fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, at Rutgers-Camden.
And it is that the apocalyptic mentality, secular or religious, is only a matter of consolation or the absence of it.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old student of the Psychology and Nursing career, said he saw all the apocalyptic films.
"I've never heard of a class that could teach that," he said.
I enjoy it.
But no student interviewed - let alone a teacher - said he believed in the expiry date of December 21.
"Our first project dealt with the Mayan prophecy and in a way we discredited it," said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old student at Temple and West Chester.
The Maya never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key point in the calendar, Restall said.
But he noted that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, dating back several centuries, in which people react to the changes around them by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused an upsurge in these speculations.
"On other sides people don't think about this," he said.
Mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question of whether he knew about any course on the "end of the world" there.
"The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world," he wrote, suggesting an exception from a higher authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall noted that many days of the final judgment have been talked about over the years, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will start thinking immediately about the next date" or philosophy that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period after which the world will end.
Students and teachers are taking the date lightly.
Several said they plan to go to "end of the world" parties.
"Maybe call some friends to laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
