Accumulated rapidly increasing incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union or the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows similar trends in the countries of the European Union or the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, confirming that, although at different stages depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is advancing rapidly in all countries.
Based on Italy's experience, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should improve their preparedness for a wave of patients with COVID-19 who will require medical care and, in particular, intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a conglomerate of cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of China reported that the causative agent was a new coronavirus that is now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence to date indicates that 80% of people with COVID-19 have mild illness, i.e. respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, and that most are recovering.
In 14% of cases, VOCID-19 evolves into a more serious disease requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% develop a critical disease requiring intensive care.
Mortality in patients hospitalized for VOCID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we examined trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each country of the European Union or the European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and compared them with those in Hubei Province, China.
We also compared the current number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and UK countries with Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and UK countries
After China, COVID-19 continued to spread geographically and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world are currently following that of this country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
In the March 5 edition of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al. reported on the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe according to the WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were registered in France on 24 January 2020, in persons who had returned from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As at 15 March 2020, cases of COVID-19 had been detected in the 30 EU/EEA and United Kingdom (UK) countries, according to which between 31 December 2019 and that date inclusive, 39,768 cases and 1727 deaths had been recorded, of which 17,750 cases and 1441 deaths had occurred in Italy alone.
Accumulated amount obtained and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC), reports of cases of COVID-19 reported in each country of the world, obtained only from official sources, such as the Ministry of Health of the countries, national and regional health authorities and WHO, are updated every day at 8:00 a.m.
These data were used to examine trends in COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK and to compare them with that in Italy.
As an indicator of the prevalence of active cases of COVID-19, we calculated the cumulative incidence of cases of COVID-19 truncated to 14 days; thus, we took into account the natural course of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA and UK country, during the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also present the cumulative number of reported cases in each country as of March 15, 2020, at 8:00 a.m., compared to Italy for the period from January 31 to March 15, 2020.
Trends in COVID-19 in EU/EEA and UK countries
Trends in the cumulative incidence of 14-day truncated COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and UK countries in general followed that in Hubei Province, China (Figure 1).
In the EU/EEA and the UK in general, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to increase around 21 February and then increased considerably around 28 February 2020 (complementary material).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of reported cases in Italy, but all other EU/EEA and UK countries showed upward trends in the cumulative incidence of similar COVID-19 (complementary material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and UK countries, compared to Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It points out that as of 15 March at 8:00 a.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had already registered a total number of cases comparable to Italy only 3 weeks earlier or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported COVID-19 cases is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is advancing at a similar rate in all countries.
This is true despite the different stages of countries, variations in national public health responses and, possibly, different country case definitions and different protocols for selecting patients to be tested to confirm COVID-19, including delayed tests.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy described a situation where 10% of patients with VOCID-19 required intensive care, and the media reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on admissions of cases of COVID-19 to a hospital or intensive care unit are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (data are not shown).
However, they should be systematically collected to complement current surveillance data focusing on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A study conducted in 2010–11 showed a wide variation in the availability of intensive care and intermediate care beds in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 inhabitants in Portugal.
This means that countries can have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds of intensive care and intermediate care every 100,000 inhabitants in 2010–11).
Model scenarios regarding the saturation of medical care capacity, with calculations for each EU/EEA country and the UK of the prevalence of cases of hospitalization by COVID-19 associated with a risk >90 % of overcapacity of intensive care beds, are provided in the sixth update of the ECDC rapid risk assessment on COVID-19.
Since, so far, clusters of cases have been formed in certain regions of EU/EEA and UK countries, and hospitals and intensive care units normally serve a defined regional catchment population, information on cases and intensive care beds should preferably be made available at the level of the Nomenclature of Territorial Statistical Units 2 (NUTS-2).
Italy's experience and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is advancing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units, therefore, should prepare for a sustained community transmission scenario of SARS-CoV-2 and an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 requiring medical care and, in particular, intensive care, such as that taking place in the affected regions of Italy.
As indicated in the ECDC rapid risk assessment, it is essential to adopt a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach to delaying the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with a change from a containment approach to a mitigation approach, since the anticipated rapid increase in the number of cases may not provide sufficient time for decision makers and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt their response accordingly if not implemented in advance.
The rapid risk assessment also lists the public health measures necessary to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a short period of opportunity during which countries have the opportunity to deepen their control efforts to curb the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on the health system.
If this is not done, health systems in other EU/EEA countries are likely to face a wave of patients requiring intensive care in the coming days and weeks.
The 2019 Coronavirus Disease Outbreak (COVID-19), caused by Coronavirus 2 of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) (SARS-CoV-2), has so far resulted in the death of 3000 people and has infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere around the world, causing a catastrophe for humans.
Similar to its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could also be transmitted from bats and causes similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality than SARS, but it is much more transmissible and affects older people more than young people and more men than women.
In response to the growing number of publications on emerging disease, the purpose of this article is to provide a timely and comprehensive analysis of the research theme, which is developing rapidly.
We will address the basic aspects of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and disease prevention.
Although many questions have yet to be answered, we hope that this analysis will help to understand and eradicate this threatening disease.
The Spring Festival of January 25, 2020 has become an unheard of and unforgivable memory for all Chinese, who were urged to stay at home throughout the festival and for several more weeks due to the outbreak of a new viral disease.
The virus has almost the same name as the coronavirus (CoV) that caused an outbreak of severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, on February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) called it SARS-CoV-2, and the associated disease was called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China and spread rapidly throughout the country and to almost 50 more countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus has caused more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients discharged and more than 3,000 patients killed.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is the "public enemy number 1" and that it is potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 scientific articles on VOCID-19 have been published, including virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report of 7 January 2020, which determined the sequence of the isolated virus of multiple patients.
The aim of this analysis is to summarize the progress made in research on this new subject, which is being developed rapidly.
When possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another disease caused by a CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, an outbreak in 2012).
We will also examine what is known so far about disease prevention and prognosis, as well as some critical questions that have not yet been answered.
Coronaviruses have traditionally been considered non-lethal pathogens for humans, which mainly cause about 15% of common colds 4.
However, in this century, we have met twice with highly pathogenic coronaviruses in humans, i.e. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused an outbreak originally in China, in 2003, and Saudi Arabia, in 2012, respectively, and soon spread to many other countries with horrific morbidity and mortality.
Therefore, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is the third coronavirus that is recorded in the history of mankind.
As shown in Fig. 1.1, conglomerates of pneumonia of unknown origin were reported for the first time on December 31, 2019 from Wuhan to the Chinese National Health Commission.
Seven days later, the sequence of the coronavirus was released.
On 15 January 2020, the first fatal case was recorded in Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to cities, provinces and neighbouring countries.
On 20 January, the infection of health-care providers was reported, suggesting that human transmission was possible.
On 23 January, the city of Wuhan was quarantined and all public transport was suspended.
On 24 January, the first clinical study on the disease reported that, of the 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 had had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market that was considered the source of infection from an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
As of the date of this report, the disease has already spread throughout China and almost 50 more countries around the world (fig. (fig. 2).
As the situation evolves rapidly, the final size and severity of the outbreak cannot yet be determined.
On February 11, 2020, a multicenter study of 8866 patients, including 4021 patients with confirmed VOCID-19, presented a more up-to-date illustration of the epidemic described below (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, but mainly people between 30 and 65 years of age.
Almost half (47.7%) of infected persons were over 50 years of age, very few were under 20 years of age and only 14 were under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 infected men more (0.31/100 000) than women (0.27/100 000).
The COVID-19 expanded into conglomerates mostly in Hubei and its surroundings.
On average, 5 days (from 2 to 9) passed between the onset and diagnosis of COVID-19.
The average incubation period was 4.8 days (between 3.0 and 7.2).
The average time from appearance to death was 9.5 days (between 4.8 and 13).
The basic reproductive number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people increased exponentially before January 23, 2020, coinciding with the period of massive mobilization prior to the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86 %), and the adjusted mortality of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (male), age (≥60) and severe pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a subfamily of large and wrapped viruses that contain a single-sense chain RNA.
They can be divided into four genera, alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, of which alphacoronaviruses and deltacoronaviruses are those that infect humans.
Spy glycoprotein (S) of the envelope binds to its cellular receptors, angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and then membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released to the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, genomic RNA, along with the glycoproteins of the envelope and the proteins of the nucleocapsid, forms vesicles containing virions, which then merge with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was announced on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was found to be a new type of beta-coronavirus with a genetic identity of more than 99.98% in 10 sequenced samples taken from the original outbreak site: Wuhan's Huanan seafood market.
SARS-CoV-2 is more genetically similar to SARS-CoV than to MERS-CoV.
With an electronic transmission microscope, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in ultra-thin sections of the human respiratory epithelium.
Human ACE2 was determined to be a recipient of SARS-CoV-2, as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to human ACE2 weaker than that of SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a less severe infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein encoded by orf3b and a secreted protein encoded by orf8.
The orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 could have a function in viral pathogenicity and inhibit the expression of IFNβ; however, the orf8 does not contain any known domain or functional motive.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al. revealed the electronic cryomicroscopy structure of the full-length human ACE2 in resolution 2.9 Å, in a complex with the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They discovered that the complex, which had open and closed conformations, was assembled as a dimer, and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can bind two S proteins, which provides evidence for the recognition and infection of the coronavirus.
B0AT1 could become a therapeutic target for the drug study in order to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The origin and the intermediate guest
It is known that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated in bats and were transmitted to humans through civetas and camels, respectively.
In a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, bats were considered to be the native host of SARS-CoV-2, since the new virus is identical in 96% to two coronaviruses similar to SARS of bats called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, it is still unknown which intermediate host helped the virus cross the barrier of species to infect humans, and the transmission route remains to be clarified.
Ji, et al., proposed snakes as carriers of bat virus to humans, implying homologous recombination within protein S.
According to a study, researchers from Guangzhou, China, suggested that pangolines (long-snacked mammals that feed on ants and are often used in traditional Chinese medicine) are a possible intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 based on a 99% genetic homology in a pangoline-discovered coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a 1 % difference propagated by the whole of two genomes remains a big difference; therefore, conclusive results are expected to provide concrete evidence (fig. 33).
The physicochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still widely unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at less than 20 °C with a humidity of 40-50 %.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be sensitive to ultraviolet rays and heat at 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, a chlorine disinfectant, perchloric acid, chloroform and other fat solvents, but not chlorhexidine, are effective in deactivating the virus.
The entire human population generally lacks immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to the new coronavirus.
To date, no detailed study on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 has been announced.
Therefore, we can only use previous studies with other coronaviruses, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (fig. (fig. 4).
In general, after the virus invades the host, it is first recognized by the innate host immune system through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including type C lectin receptors, type Toll receptors (TLRs), type NOD receptors (NLRs) and type RIG-I receptors (RLRs).
Through different pathways, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate macrophagic phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, SARS-CoV N protein can help the virus escape immune responses.
Soon, the adaptive immune response adds to the fight against the virus.
T-lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies, and CD8+ T cells directly kill virus-infected cells.
Cooperating T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to help defense cells.
However, coronaviruses can inhibit T-cell functions by inducing T-cell apoptosis.
Humoral immunity, which includes complements such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, is also essential to fight viral infection.
For example, isolated antibodies from a recovered patient neutralized the MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an exaggerated reaction of the immune system locally generates a large number of free radicals that can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst case scenario, multi-organic failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by conglomerate onset, most likely affects older people with comorbidities and pregnant women.
It is common for people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune functions are compromised to be more likely to become infected than others.
The estimated mean incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1 to 14 days, mostly between 3 and 7 days, according to a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1099 cases showed that the incubation period was 3 days on average and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, shows that the incubation period was 4.8 days (between 3.0 and 7.2) based on the demographics of 8866 cases.
It is very important that health authorities adapt effective quarantine time to the most accurate incubation period; this is how asymptomatic infected people will be prevented from transmitting the virus to others.
As usual, people exposed to the virus or infected should normally remain in quarantine for 14 days.
Is quarantine supposed to extend to 24 days?
Fever is usually the primary and initial symptom of COVID-19, which may be accompanied by no other symptoms or other symptoms such as dry cough, dyspnoea, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients had dyspnoea or hypoxemia one week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients evolved rapidly to develop acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever or respiratory symptoms and acute fever, even without lung abnormalities in imaging studies, should be tested for early diagnosis.
A demographic study at the end of December 2019 indicated that the percentages of symptoms were 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dyspnoea and 3% for diarrhoea; 8% of patients required respiratory assistance.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies of a family conglomerate and a conglomerate caused by the transmission of an asymptomatic person.
Comparably, a 2012 demographic study showed that patients with MERS-CoV also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnea (55%) as the main symptoms.
However, 80% of them required respiratory assistance, much more than patients with COVID-19 and in line with the greater lethality of the MERS compared to COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in patients with MERS.
In patients with SARS, fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnoea (40%-42%), diarrhoea (20%-25 %) and sore throat (13%-25 %) were shown to be the main symptoms and respiratory assistance was required in approximately 14% to 20% of patients.
By 14 February, COVID-19 mortality was 2% when confirmed cases reached 66,576 worldwide.
Similarly, SARS mortality by November 2002 was 10% in 8096 confirmed cases.
For the MERS, according to a demographic study in June 2012, mortality was 37% in 2494 confirmed cases.
In a previous study, the SARS-CoV-2 R0 was reported to be high and to be 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71 to 7.23, while the SARS-CoV R0 ranged only between 2 and 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality and R0 is presented in Table 1.1.
The above figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher propagation capacity than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but its lethality is lower than that of the latter two.
Therefore, it is much more difficult to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than those of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Conglomerate appearance usually occurs within the same family or from the same meeting or vehicle, such as a cruise.
Patients usually have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan and other affected areas or contact with infected persons or patients within two weeks of onset.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and that patients discharged from the hospital can recommence the virus, an alarm signal that quarantine time should be increased.
Patients have a normal or reduced amount of white blood cells in peripheral blood (especially lymphocytes) at the early stage.
For example, lymphopenia was observed with a white blood cell count of <4×109/l, including a lymphocyte count of <1×109/l, and elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase in 1099 patients with COVID-19.
The levels of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin were elevated in the blood of some patients, and reactive protein C and erythrocyte sedimentation were elevated in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the level of dimer-D, a product of fibrin degradation in the blood, was high, and lymphocyte count was progressively reduced.
Anomalies in thoracic X-rays are detected in most patients with COVID-19, characterized by bilateral shadows or opacities in emerilated glass in the lungs.
Patients usually develop atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis seriously affect the gas exchange.
The dysfunction of type I and type II pneumocytes decreases surfactant level and increases surface tension, which reduces the ability of the lungs to expand and increases the risk of lung collapse.
As a result, the worst findings in chest X-rays are often in parallel with the maximum severity of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated the desquamation of pneumocytes, the formation of a hyaline membrane and infiltration of lymphocytes into the interstitium, and multinucleated syncial cells in the lungs of a patient who died from the disease, which coincides with the pathology of a viral infection and the ARDS, and similar to that of patients with SARS and MERS.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negatives, which could accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which was no longer based solely on RT-PCR) in China on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation also occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of a history of disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological findings is essential and imperative for an effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a CRISPR-based SHERLOCK protocol for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments between 20 × 10-18 mol/l and 200 × 10-18 mol/l (10-100 copies per microlitre of sample) using a rod graduated in less than one hour that does not require complex instruments.
Hopefully, the new technique can dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience if checked in clinical samples.
Due to lack of experience with the new coronavirus, physicians can mostly provide supportive care to patients with COVID-19, while testing a variety of therapies that have been used or proposed before for the treatment of other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapies include current or potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from recovered patients, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
It was even proposed to use plasma from recovered patients for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies compete to see who first develops antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs at first and probably also attacks, to a lesser extent, other organs that express ACE2, such as the digestive tract and kidneys.
However, respiratory dysfunction and insufficiency are the greatest threat to patients and the leading cause of death.
Therefore, respiratory assistance is critical to relieve symptoms and save lives, and includes general oxygen therapy, high flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation according to the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need extracorporeal membrane oxygenation assistance (OMEC), a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique used to treat life-threatening heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, maintaining electrolyte balance, preventing and treating secondary infections and septic shock, and protecting vital organ functions are also essential in patients with SARS-CoV-2.
Cytokine storm is known to be the result of an exaggerated reaction of the immune system in patients with SARS and MERS.
Cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a number of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release a huge amount of free radicals that are the main cause of ARDS and multi-organic failure.
Immunosuppression is essential for the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, a monoclonal antireceptor antibody of IL6, have been used to treat cytokine storm.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokine storm include modulation of T-cell-directed immune response; blockage of IFN-γ, IL-1 and TNF; inhibition of JAK; blinatumomab; a suppressor of cytokine signaling pathway 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, such as immunosuppressants, were widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, steroids at high doses were not beneficial for severe lung lesions in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
On the other hand, they can cause serious side effects, particularly osteonecrosis, which significantly affects the prognosis.
However, the prudent use of corticosteroids at low to moderate doses has been recommended for a short period of time for patients with critical COPID-19.
At the time of this analysis, the efficacy of any antiviral therapy has not been confirmed.
However, the efficacy of remdesiver, a nucleotide analogue administered intravenously in an American patient with COVID-19 has been verified.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead initially for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Subsequently, remdesivir also demonstrated the potential to inhibit other viruses with monocatenary RNA, such as MERS and SARS.
Based on these, Gilead has provided the compound to China to conduct a couple of trials in people infected with SARS-CoV-2, and there is great expectation for the results.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon alfa, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin have been suggested as possible therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other drugs used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma of recovered patients and antibody generation
Blood extraction from patients who have recovered from contagious disease to treat other patients who have contracted the same disease or to protect healthy people so that they do not contract the disease is not novel.
In fact, recovered patients usually have a relatively high level of antibodies against the pathogen in the blood.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B-lymphocytes to combat pathogens and other foreign objects, and recognize certain molecules in pathogens and neutralize them directly.
Based on this, plasma was extracted from the blood of a group of patients who recovered from COVID-19 and 10 severely ill patients were injected.
Its symptoms improved in 24 hours, accompanied by reduced inflammation and viral loads and improved oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, it is necessary to verify and clarify this in order to propose the method for large-scale use until specific therapies are developed.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some disadvantages associated with plasma should be considered carefully.
For example, antibodies can overstimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, possibly causing fatal toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the demand for plasma is high to treat critically ill patients.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to combat a global pandemic.
It is therefore more important and practical to isolate B cells from recovered patients and to identify genetic codes that encode effective antibodies or to search for effective antibodies against essential proteins of the virus.
In this way, we can easily increase the production of antibodies.
MCT has been used for thousands of years to treat a variety of diseases in China.
However, its effects depend to a large extent on a combination of several components in a formula that varies according to the diagnosis of a disease according to MCT theories.
Most of the effective components remain unknown or inaccurate, as it is difficult to extract and verify such components or their optimal combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific therapy for COVID-19, CTM has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for those who have recovered from severe stages.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were found to be effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
The main recovery rates in the treatment of patients with VOCID-19 were observed in several provinces of China that used CCT in 87% of their patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei province, which used CCT in only about 30% of its patients with VOCID-19, had the lowest recovery rate (13%).
However, this is a fairly approximate comparison, as many other impact factors, such as the amount and severity of patients, should be included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and his colleagues published a study comparing Western Medicine (MO) treatment only with the combined treatment of MO and MCT.
They found that the time required to recover body temperature, disappearance of symptoms and hospitalization were significantly lower in the MO+MCT group than in the MO group alone.
Most surprisingly, the rate of worsening of symptoms (from mild to severe) was significantly lower in the MO+MCT group than in the MO group only (7.4% versus 46.2%) and mortality was lower in the MO+MCT group than in the MO group only (8.8% versus 39%).
However, the effectiveness and safety of TCMs are still awaiting further well-controlled trials at larger scales and in more centres.
It would also be interesting to characterize the mechanism of actions and to determine the effective components of CTM treatments or their combinations if possible.
Patients with suspicion or confirmation of COVID-19 are usually very afraid of highly contagious and even deadly disease, and quarantined people also experience boredom, loneliness and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as the adverse effects of treatments, such as corticosteroid insomnia, can cause more anxiety and mental distress.
In the early phase of the SARS outbreak, a number of psychiatric morbiditys were reported, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitement, psychotic symptoms, delirium and even suicidal tendencies.
Mandatory contact tracing and quarantine, as part of public health responses to the outbreak of COVID-19, can make people feel more nervous and guilty for the effects of contagion, quarantine and stigma on their family and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to patients with COVID-19, people with suspicion and people in contact with them, as well as to the general public who need it.
Psychological support should include the formation of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communications with regular and accurate updates on SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and treatment plans and the use of electronic devices and professional applications to avoid close contact between people.
Effective vaccines are essential to disrupt the chain of transmission of infected animal and human reservoirs to susceptible hosts, and often complement antiviral treatment in the control of epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop protein-based S vaccines to generate potent, long-term neutralising antibodies or immunity that protect against SARS-CoV.
Vaccinations with live viruses attenuated in animal models for SARS have been evaluated.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these potential vaccines in older people and lethal stimulation models and their protection against zoonotic virus infection should still be determined before a clinical study is initiated.
This is probably because SARS died 17 years ago and no new cases have been registered since then.
On the other hand, there are still cases and conglomerates of MERS sporadically in the Middle East that spread to other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies for MERS have been developed using deactivated viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
Developing a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for non-immune people is an urgent and critical task to control the ongoing pandemic.
However, it is difficult to overcome the difficulties due to the long (18 months on average) required for the development of a vaccine and the dynamic variations of coronaviruses.
As a new disease, VOCID-19 has just begun to manifest its complete clinical course in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can gradually recover without sequelae.
However, as with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, creating a forecast model for the disease is essential for health agencies to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on the clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of patients with COPID-19 (Table 33):
Age: age was the most important factor for SARS prognosis, which is also correct for COVID-19.
VOCID-19 occurred mostly in people aged 30 to 65 years and 47.7% of these patients were over 50 years old in a study of 8866 cases, as described above.
Patients who required intensive care with a higher probability had underlying comorbidities and complications and were significantly higher than those who did not (mean age 66 versus 51), suggesting that age is a predictor of the evolution of patients with COVID-19.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men than women (0.31/100 000 compared to 0.27/100 000), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: patients with COVID-19 who require intensive care most likely suffer from acute cardiac injury and arrhythmia.
Heart events were also the leading cause of death in patients with SARS.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 may also be associated with positive ACE2 cholangiocytes, which may cause liver dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.
It should be noted that age and underlying diseases are strongly correlated and can interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: the level of reactive protein C (PCR) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and has been proposed as a possible prognostic factor for disease, response to therapy and final recovery.
The correlation between the PCR level and the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 has also been proposed.
In addition, a high level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) can also help predict patient evolution.
These enzymes are intensely expressed in several organs, especially the heart and liver, and are released when tissue is damaged.
They therefore constitute traditional markers of cardiac or hepatic dysfunction.
Major clinical symptoms: chest X-ray and temporary progression of clinical symptoms should be considered in conjunction with other symptoms for the prediction of clinical outcomes and complications of COVID-19.
Steroid use: as described above, steroids are immunosuppressants that are commonly used as adjuvant therapy for infectious diseases in order to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Since the use of high doses of corticosteroids was widespread in patients with severe SARS, many survivors developed avascular osteonecrosis with permanent disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used at low doses and for a short period of time in patients with COVID-19.
Mental stress: As described above, during the outbreak of COVID-19, many patients have suffered extraordinary stress, as in general, they endured long periods of quarantine and extreme uncertainty, and attended the death of close relatives and other patients.
It is essential to provide long-term psychotherapy and support to these patients to help them recover from stress and return to their normal lives.
According to demographic studies conducted so far, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological characteristics from SARS.
In addition to replication in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can be replicated efficiently in the upper respiratory tract and causes mild or no symptoms in the early stage of infection, as with other coronaviruses that cause common colds.
Therefore, patients infected at an early stage or incubation period can produce a large amount of virus during their daily activities, which makes it extremely difficult to control the epidemic.
However, transmission of SARS-CoV was considered to occur when patients were seriously ill, whereas transmission was not most likely at the early stage.
Thus, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is much more severe and difficult to control than the outbreak of SARS.
Great efforts are being made at this time in China, including the closure of Wuhan and surrounding cities and the continued quarantine of almost the entire population in the hope of interrupting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures have caused significant damage to the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is decreasing, indicating the slowing down of the epidemic.
According to the most optimistic forecast, the outbreak will be completed by March and the descending phase will last 3 or 4 months.
However, some other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimated that COVID-19, which appears to be considerably more infectious than SARS, will not be completed by 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., created a model to predict the evolution of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two thirds of the world's population.
One Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in both nasal and pharyngeal exudates in patients who had recovered and left the hospital 2 weeks earlier, indicating that the newly identified virus could become a flu-like cyclic episode.
However, promising signs have been seen in China given the decline in the number of new cases, indicating that current strategies could be working.
It was originally predicted that Ebola would cause up to a million cases with half a million deaths.
However, through strict quarantine and isolation, control of the disease has been achieved.
Like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 may be weakened in terms of infectivity and eventually extinct or become a less pathogenic virus that coexists with humans.
A comparison of the COPID-19 epidemic with that of SARS and MERS is provided below (fig. (fig. 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible through coughs or sneezes, and possibly also through direct contact with materials contaminated with the virus.
The virus was also detected in the faeces, which raises a new possibility of faecal-oral transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of the cases were possibly caused by infections in nosocomia, including 17 patients with other previous diseases and 40 health care providers.
Therefore, precautions should be taken to protect humans, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, colleagues and even passers-by in contact with patients or infected persons.
The first line of defense that could be used to reduce the risk of infection is the use of masks; the use of surgical masks and masks with N95 respirator (serial number 1860) helps control the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks prevent the liquid droplets of a potentially infected person from being transmitted through the air or adhere to surfaces, from where they could be transmitted to others.
However, only N95 masks (serial number 1860) can protect against the inhalation of virions as small as 10 to 80 nm, and only 5% of the virions can penetrate them completely; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size and both measure around 85 nm.
Since particles can penetrate up to five stacked surgical masks, medical care providers in direct contact with patients should use N95 masks (serial number 1860) and not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health care providers should wear custom isolation coats in order to further reduce contact with viruses.
Viruses can also infect a person through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor became infected with SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through his inflamed eyes.
Therefore, health care providers should also use protective facets or transparent glasses while working with patients.
For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is strongly suggested that the population wash their hands with disinfectant soaps more often than usual, try to stay at home in voluntary quarantine and limit contact with people who may be infected.
It is considered that three feet is an adequate distance for people to stay away from a patient.
These measures are effective methods to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 appeared as a new virus for the human world, its high homology with SARS-CoV, reported on 7 January 2020, should have caused great alert in China for its experience with the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, it was not until January 19, 2020 that the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control reassured citizens that the new virus had low infection and limited reproductive capacity among humans, and that there would be no problem in preventing and containing the disease.
This message greatly relaxed the alarm of the public, especially at a time when the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical moment to contain the disease on a minimal scale in Wuhan was missed.
China's disease control agencies should learn from this hard lesson and take decisive improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should be (1) more cautious in making public announcements, since every word matters to citizens and can change their attitude or decisions; (2) more sensitive and reactive to unusual information from clinics, rather than waiting for formal reports from doctors or officials; (3) more restrictive to contain a possible epidemic at an early stage, rather than trying to reassure the public; and (4) more regular in implementing adapted and effective simulations to increase public awareness of epidemic diseases and test and improve society's response system periodically.
The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread throughout China and about 50 more countries around the world at the time of this analysis.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and there are also many similarities between the symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS, the outbreak of COVID-19 has generated the sensation of reappearance of SARS.
However, there are some notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential to contain the epidemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people and men more than women, and severity and mortality are also higher in older people than in young people.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
Patients with COVID-19 transmit the virus although they do not have symptoms, while patients with SARS usually do so when they are seriously ill, which creates a much greater difficulty in containing the spread of COVID-19 compared to SARS.
This explains, in part, why SARS-CoV-2 spread much faster and more widespread than SARS-CoV.
Regular RNA testing for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some patients with COVID-19.
On the other hand, cured patients can give positive in the virus again.
These results dramatically increase the risk of spreading the virus.
Given the rapid progress made in the investigation of COVID-19, a number of important issues remain to be resolved, such as:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% genetic homology was found between SARS-CoV-2 and two coronaviruses of bats similar to SARS, it is not yet possible to conclude that SARS-CoV-2 comes from bats.
Which animal was the intermediate species that transmitted the original host virus, say bats, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to number 1 and 2, it is not possible to stop the transmission efficiently, and the outbreak can re-emerge at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter respiratory tract cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to the cells that express ACE2 in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, it is not possible to achieve a rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus genetically evolve while transmitting between humans?
Will it become a global pandemic, become extinct like SARS, or periodically resurrect like the flu?
Although it may take some time, it is essential to seek answers to these and many other questions.
However, whatever it takes, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to our normal lives.
Zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses
Mutation and adaptation have driven the co-evolution of coronaviruses and their guests, including humans, for thousands of years.
Until 2003, it was known that two human coronaviruses caused mild diseases, such as common cold.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have reversed the coin by revealing how devastating and deadly a human coronavirus infection can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 put the coronaviruses in the focus again and surprised us with high transmissibility and reduced pathogenicity compared to their brother, SARS-CoV.
Human coronavirus infection is a zoonosis and it would be useful to know the zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses.
Most human coronaviruses originate in bats, in which they are not pathogens.
The intermediate reservoir guests of some human coronaviruses are also known.
Identifying animal guests has direct implications for the prevention of diseases in humans.
Investigate interactions between coronaviruses and animal hosts could also shed important information on the pathogenesis of coronaviruses in humans.
In this analysis, we present a general description of the existing knowledge about the seven human coronaviruses, with emphasis on the history of their discovery, as well as their zoonotic origins and transmission between species.
Notably, we compared and contrasted the different human coronaviruses from the perspective of virus evolution and genome recombination.
The current disease epidemic by coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is analyzed in this context.
In addition, the requirements for successful guest changes and the implications of virus evolution for the severity of the disease are also highlighted.
Coronaviruses belong to the Coronaviridae family, which includes a group of positive monocatenary RNA viruses with envelope.
These viruses, which host the largest genome, from 26 to 32 kilobases, among RNA viruses, were called "coronavirus" because of their morphology, because of the crown shape they have under an electronic microscope.
As for its structure, coronaviruses have unsegmented genomes that share a similar organization.
Approximately two thirds of the genome contains two large open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which translate into replicate polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab.
Polyproteins are further processed to generate 16 nonstructural proteins, called nsp1~16.
The remaining part of the genome contains ORF for structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
A series of specific accessory proteins of each lineage are also encoded by different coronavirus lines.
Based on the difference in protein sequences, coronaviruses are classified into four genera (alfacoronavirus, betacoronavirus, gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus), among which the genus of betacoronaviruses contains the majority of human coronaviruses and is subdivided into four lineages (A, B, C and D).
The phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents are the source of genes of most alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses, while birds are the main reservoir of gammacoronaviruses and deltacoronaviruses.
For thousands of years, coronaviruses have constantly crossed the barriers of species and some have emerged as important human pathogens.
To date, seven human coronaviruses have been known.
Among them, the HCoV-229E and the HCoV-NL63 are alphacoronavirus.
The other five beta-coronaviruses are HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1 and HCV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as a common cold or diarrhoea.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the recently identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic and cause serious infection of the lower respiratory tract in a relatively larger number of patients, with a higher probability of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
The first strain of HCoV-229E, B814, was isolated from the nasal secretion of patients with common cold in the mid 1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been gained through comprehensive studies of HCV-229E and HCV-OC43, which cause self-limited symptoms.
In fact, until the SARS outbreak, it was a widely accepted concept that human coronavirus infection is generally harmless.
The SARS outbreak that occurred in 2003 is one of the most devastating in current history and infected more than 8000 people, with a crude lethality of about 10%.
Ten years later, the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) led to a persistent epidemic on the Arabian peninsula with sporadic spread to the rest of the world.
The new human coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), later referred to as SARS-CoV-2, is the cause of the ongoing epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has claimed more than 3120 lives and infected more than 91,000 people as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm has been ringing and the world must prepare for the approaching SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
The seven human coronaviruses have a zoonotic origin in bats, mice or domestic animals.
Several lines of evidence support the evolutionary origin of all human coronaviruses in bats, in which viruses are well adapted and not pathogens, but have great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has posed enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges in China and the rest of the world.
Tracking the zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses provides a framework for understanding the natural history, the driving force and the limiting factors of jumping between species.
This could also guide or facilitate the search for the reservoir and intermediate animal hosts and amps of SARS-CoV-2, which would have important implications in preventing future spread.
In this analysis, we present a general description of the zoonotic origins, the transmission between species and the pathogenesis of human coronaviruses.
In particular, we highlight and analyze the common theme that human coronaviruses are not normally pathogens in their natural reservoir hosts, but become pathogens after transmission between species to a new host.
We also examined the trend of evolution of human coronaviruses, in which increased transmissibility usually leads to decreased pathogenicity.
The evolution of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is also analysed in this context.
Animal coronaviruses have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the first isolation of the HCoV-229E strain B814 from nasal secretion of patients who had contracted a common cold, different coronaviruses had been isolated in different infected animals, such as turkey, mouse, cow, pig, cat and dog.
In recent decades, seven human coronaviruses have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of the discoveries of human coronaviruses in chronological order (Table 1) would be informative and instructive.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966 and subsequently adapted to grow in WI-38 lung cell lines.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E had symptoms of common cold, such as headache, sneezing, general discomfort and sore throat, with fever and cough in 10~20% of cases.
Later, in 1967, the HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and the subsequent serial passage into the brains of lactating mice.
The clinical characteristics of HCoV-OC43 infection appear to be similar to those caused by HCoV-229E, whose symptoms are identical to those of infections by other respiratory pathogens, such as influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.
Both the HCoV-229E and the HCoV-OC43 are distributed around the world and tend to be transmitted predominantly during the winter season, in temperate climates.
In general, the incubation time of these two viruses is less than one week, followed by a period of disease of about 2 weeks.
According to a study with human volunteers, healthy people infected with HCV-229E developed mild common cold.
Only some immunocompromised patients had a severe lower respiratory tract infection.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia", caused the first pandemic caused by a well-documented human coronavirus in human history, and the etiological agent is SARS-CoV, the third human coronavirus that was discovered.
The first SARS case dates back to late 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8096 reported cases of 774 deaths and spread across many countries and continents.
Apart from the superpropagators, it was estimated that each case could cause approximately two secondary cases, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days and the onset of the maximum viral load on the tenth day of disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially have myalgia, headache, fever, general discomfort and chills, followed by dyspnoea, cough and difficulty in breathing as late symptoms.
Lymphopenia, impaired liver function, and elevated creatine kinase levels are common abnormal results in SARS laboratory tests.
Diffuse alveolar damage, proliferation of epithelial cells and an increase in macrophages are also observed in patients with SARS.
Approximately 20-30% of patients subsequently require intensive care and mechanical respiratory assistance.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, several organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidney, may also be infected in these severe cases, usually accompanied by a storm of cytokines, which could be fatal, particularly in immunosuppressed patients.
The virus was first isolated from the open-pit lung biopsy of a family member of the initial patient who travelled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, enormous efforts have been made to investigate human coronaviruses.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
Initially, it was found to be prevalent in young children, older adults and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
The presentation of choriza, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis is common in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from a nasal sample taken from an 8-month-old child suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was identified in the Netherlands, it is actually distributed around the world.
It has been estimated that HCoV-NL63 causes approximately 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, and its maximum incidence occurs in early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as crup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to pneumonia and bronchiolitis acquired in the community, HCoV-HKU1 was reported to be associated with acute exacerbations of asthma.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 was worldwide and caused mild respiratory diseases.
These four human coronaviruses acquired in the community have adapted well to humans and are generally less likely to mutate to cause highly pathogenic diseases, although accidents have occurred due to unknown causes, such as in the rare case of a more virulent subtype of HCV-NL63, which was recently reported to have caused serious infection of the lower respiratory tract in China.
Generally, when these human coronaviruses acquire the ability to transmit efficiently and maintain continuously in humans, they also become less virulent or pathogenic.
The MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lung of a 60-year-old patient who had developed acute pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most of the laboratory-confirmed cases originate in the Middle East, cases have been registered with occasional contagion to close contacts in several European countries and Tunisia.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to those of SARS, characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also developed acute renal failure, which so far only occurs with the MERS among diseases caused by human coronaviruses.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2500 confirmed laboratory cases were recorded, with a high mortality rate of 34.4%, making the MERS-CoV one of the most devastating viruses for humans known to be.
From mid to late December 2019, conglomerates of pneumonia patients were detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, which retrospectively were associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The World Health Organization declared the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 a public health emergency of international importance and, in addition, referred to COVID-19 disease.
As of 3 March 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with a crude lethality of 3,4 %.
Notably, the lethality in Hubei, China, is 4,2 %, while outside it is 1,2 %.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infection, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which occurs as fever, cough, and dyspnea.
Diarrhoea has also been observed in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can rapidly develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to a high nucleotide sequence homology of 82 %, they are categorized into different branches of the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogenic, but more transmissible compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Cases of asymptomatic people infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported, which could contribute to their rapid spread around the world.
When comparing and contrasting SARS-CoV-2 with the other six human coronaviruses, similarities and differences of great interest are identified.
First, the incubation period and duration of the course of the disease by human coronavirus are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six human coronaviruses.
Secondly, the severity of the symptoms of COVID-19 is between SARS-CoV and the four human coronal viruses acquired in the community (i.e., HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection has characteristics that are more frequently observed in human coronavirus infections acquired in the community, including the presentation of non-specific or mild symptoms or even the absence of symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subgroup of serious cases of COVID-19 is also observed, as is the case with SARS-CoV infection, although the relationship is somewhat smaller.
Thirdly, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting patterns characteristic of both the human coronaviruses acquired in the community and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of human coronaviruses acquired in the community.
On the other hand, it remains to be verified whether the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after passing between humans, as is the case with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, as with other human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples.
If the faecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role, as in the case of SARS-CoV, at least in some circumstances, it still needs to be clarified in future studies.
It is also of particular interest to find out whether SARS-CoV-2 could exhibit seasonality, as is the case with human coronaviruses acquired in the community.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustainable propagation following human passes, will influence the final outcome of the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19.
The four human coronaviruses acquired in the community that cause mild symptoms have been well adapted to humans.
From another perspective, it may also be true that humans have adapted well to these four human coronaviruses.
In other words, both could be survivors of ancient human coronavirus pandemics.
Coronaviruses of humans causing serious diseases in humans and humans developing serious diseases by human coronaviruses have been eliminated.
In order for this to happen, human coronaviruses must be replicated in humans to a sufficient extent to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that counteract host restriction factors.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak persists and the more people it infects, the more likely it will be to fully adapt to humans.
If properly adapted, its transmission in humans would be difficult to stop by quarantine or other measures of infection control.
For many years, the four coronaviruses acquired in the community have been circulating in human populations and have caused common colds in immunocompetent people.
These viruses don't need an animal reservoir.
In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not been well adapted to humans and their human transmission is unsustainable.
They need to be kept and spread in their zoonotic reservoirs and seek the opportunity to spread to susceptible human targets, possibly through one or more intermediate hosts and amplifiers.
SARS-CoV-2 has characteristics similar to both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV as well as the four human coronaviruses acquired in the community.
It is highly transmissible as the coronaviruses of humans acquired in the community, at least for the moment.
However, it is more pathogenic than human coronaviruses acquired in the community and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it will fully adapt to humans and circulate among humans without a reservoir or intermediate animal host.
Before analyzing the animal origins of human coronaviruses, it will be useful to examine the definitions and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate and amplifier guests of human coronaviruses.
An animal acts as an evolutionary host of a human coronavirus if it harbors a closely related ancestor who shares a high homology at the nucleotide sequence level.
The ancestral virus is usually well adapted and is not pathogenic in this host.
Similarly, a reservoir host hosts a human coronavirus on a continuous and long-term basis.
In both cases, guests are naturally infected and are the natural guests of the human coronavirus or their parental virus.
On the other hand, if the human coronavirus was introduced into the intermediate host just before or almost at the same time as its introduction into humans, it is not well adapted to the new host and is usually pathogenic.
The intermediate host can act as the zoonotic source of the infection in humans and fulfill the host amplifier function by allowing the virus to be replicated transiently and then passed on to humans to amplify the scale of the infection in humans.
A human coronavirus may cause infection in the terminal host if it cannot sustain its transmission in the intermediate host.
On the contrary, human coronaviruses can also be adapted to the intermediate host and even generate long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate guest becomes a natural reservoir guest.
Epidemiological data retrospectively revealed that the initial SARS case had had contact with hunting animals.
Further research on seroprevalence indicated that animal traders had a higher prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV IgG compared to the general population.
Civets of masked palm trees (Paguma larvata) and a raccoon dog in live animal markets were the first identified carriers of SARS-CoV-like viruses that are almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that no more SARS cases were recorded after killing all the civetas in the markets.
However, it was reported that wild or farm masked palm civets without exposure to live animal markets were mostly negative in SARS-CoV, suggesting that the masked palm civets would only act as an amplifier intermediate host, but not as a natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
Notably, since 80% of the different animals in Guangzhou markets have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibility of several species of small mammals also acting as intermediate hosts amplifiers of SARS-CoV cannot be ruled out.
They all seem to be terminal guests of SARS-CoV.
Subsequent searches of the SARS-CoV natural animal host revealed a closely related bat coronavirus, known as the SARS-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 Rhinolophus bat CoV (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which exists in Chinese horseshoe bats.
These bats are positive in anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and the genome sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
This and other bat coronaviruses share a nucleotide sequence homology of 88-92% with SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the foundation for the new concept that bats harbour emerging pathogens in humans.
Several SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoV) have also been identified in bats, but none, except one called WIV1, can be isolated as a live virus.
The human angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ACE2) is known to be the SARS-CoV receptor.
WIV1 obtained from a faecal sample of bats was shown to use the ACE2 of bats, cyvets and humans as receptors to enter cells.
Amazingly, serums from patients with convalescent SARS were able to neutralize WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents the most closely related ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, which shares a 95% nucleotide sequence homology.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, in general, it is believed that WIV1 is not the immediate parental virus of SARS-CoV and that bats are not the immediate reservoir host of SARS-CoV.
According to the phylogenetic analysis, the MERS-CoV is categorized into the same group as the bat CoV-HKU4 and the bat CoV-HKU5.
Bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), for virus entry.
The phylogenetically MERS-CoV RNA-dependent polymerase RNA sequences are closer to their beta-coronavirus counterparts of bats identified in Europe and Africa.
So far, a live MERS-CoV can't be found in wild bats.
The MERS-CoV and its nearest relative, the bat CoV-HKU25, share a nucleotide sequence homology of only 87 %.
Therefore, the bat may not be the immediate reservoir guest of the MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that dromedaries are seropositive in specifically neutralizing antibodies to the MERS-CoV, as are camels originating in the Middle East in several African countries.
A live MERS-CoV identical to the virus found in humans was isolated from the nasal exudate of dromedaries, which further supports that camels act as guests of a bona fide reservoir of the MERS-CoV.
It should also be noted that, in general, mild symptoms were observed, but a massive spread of the virus in camels infected for research with MERS-CoV.
Notably, infected camels spread viruses not only by respiratory route, but also by faecal-oral route, which is also the main route of bat virus propagation.
However, questions remain, as many confirmed cases of MERS do not have a history of contact with camels prior to the onset of symptoms, which is reasonably attributed to the transmission between humans or unknown transmission pathways involving unknown animal species harbouring MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares a 96.2% nucleotide homology with a bat coronavirus, RaTG13, isolated from Rhinolophus affinis bats.
As in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to assign a parental relationship.
In other words, bats may not be the immediate reservoir guests of SARS-CoV-2 unless they are in the future coronavirus of almost identical bats.
Presumably, intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2 should be among the wild species that are sold and killed in the wholesale seafood market of Huanan, with which many of the initial cases of VOCID-19 were associated, indicating a likely animal-to-human transmission event.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have suggested that a group of small endangered mammals, known as pangolines (Manis javanica), could also host ancestral SARS-CoV-2-related betacoronaviruses.
The genomes of this new pangoline coronavirus share a nucleotide sequence homology of 85-92% with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are equally closely related to the RaTG13, with an identity of around 90 % at the nucleotide sequence level.
They are grouped into two SARS-CoV-2-like virus sublines in the phylogenetic tree, one of which shares a receptor binding domain (RBD) more similar to SARS-CoV-2, with an amino acid sequence identity of 97,4 %.
In sharp contrast, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 RBDs are more divergent, despite a higher degree of sequence homology across the genome.
An earlier study of diseased pangolines also reported the detection of viral contigates in lung samples, which also appear to be related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted different methods of assembly and manual healing to generate a partial genome sequence that comprised about 86.3% of the full-length viral genome.
We cannot rule out the possibility of the pangolin being one of the intermediate animal guests of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to support a direct origin in the SARS-CoV-2 pangolin due to the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and the betacoronaviruses of pangolins related to SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even smaller than that between SARS-CoV-2 and pangoline-related betacoronaviruses of SARS-CoV-2.
The evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolines and other mammals still needs to be established.
Although the highest sequence homology was found in RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, beta-coronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the highest complete genome sequence homology.
It is highly speculative that the high degree of similarity between the RBDs of pangoline betacoronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 is due to convergent evolution mediated by selectivity.
A counterproposal defends a recombination between pangoline beta-coronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 in the third species of wild animal.
As a driving force in evolution, recombination is widespread among betacoronaviruses.
No conclusion has yet been reached on the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, the zoonotic origin of HCV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCV-NL63 and HCV-HKU1 was also studied.
The phylogenetic evidence indicated that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E could have originated from bat coronaviruses, while parental viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in rodents.
It was reported that a bat coronavirus called ARCoV.2 (coronavirus of the Apalaches Mountains) detected in a tricolor bat in North America had a close relationship with the HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, the HCoV-229E was genetically related to another bat coronavirus, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, although camelids have also been suspected as intermediate guests.
For greater clarity, the knowledge so far of the animal origins of known human coronaviruses is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
The phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence of human coronavirus transmission events among species in history.
When the HCoV-OC43 crossed species to infect humans from livestock in 1890, a pandemic of respiratory infection was recorded.
The history of transmission between species of the HCoV-229E is not so accurately known.
Bat alphacoronavirus has been found to be closely related to the HCV-229E.
Among them is an alphacoronavirus of alpacas.
Several lines of evidence support the transmission of bat virus to humans directly.
First, unlike alpacas, humans could have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
Instead, humans have close contact with alpacas.
Second, bat alphacoronaviruses related to HCoV-229E are diverse and non-pathogenic in bats, while alpaca alphacoronaviruses caused an outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alphacoronavirus of alpacas has not been found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility of alpacas acquiring alphacoronavirus related to HCoV-229E from humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are the direct source of pathogenic viruses in humans, such as rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it would not be too surprising for bats to transmit the HCV-229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, while bat alphacoronaviruses act as a genetic collection of the HCV-229E, alpacas and dromedaries could act as intermediate hosts that transmit viruses to humans, particularly in the case of the MERS-CoV.
The MERS-CoV serves as an excellent example of interspecies transmission, from bats to dromedaries, and from dromedaries to humans.
The evolutionary origin of the MERS-CoV in bats is discovered with its initial identification, and has also been supported by later findings.
It is evident that bats contribute, with a profuse collection of virus species, to the exchange of genetic fragments between species and to transmission between species.
Longevity, densely populated colonies, narrow social interaction and the great ability to fly, are all favorable conditions that make bats the ideal "virus propagator".
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV has been introduced to the dromedaries for decades.
It is well adapted to these camels, which have gone from being an intermediate guest, to being a guest of stable and natural reservoir.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
Its sporadic transmission to humans is an accident and humans remain a terminal host of the MERS-CoV, as the transmission is unsustainable.
Compared to the role of camels in the transmission of the MERS-CoV, the role of pangolines, if any, in the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 is different.
In particular, pangoline betacoronaviruses are highly pathogenic in pangolines.
They may be a terminal host of SARS-CoV-2-related betacoronaviruses, such as civetas in SARS-CoV.
Several possibilities for transmission between species of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans should be confirmed or discarded in future studies.
First, bats could be the reservoir host of a SARS-CoV-2-related virus, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans could share the ecological niche with bats, through slaughter or coal mining.
Secondly, pangolines could be one of the intermediate amps guests in which a SARS-CoV-2-related virus had recently been introduced.
Humans contract the virus through the killing and consumption of game meat.
Many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
A study of antibodies in domestic and wild animals is required.
Thirdly, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could have occurred in a third species that has contact with both bats and pangolines.
The search for the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 continues.
Apart from the different types of animal hosts, three main factors in viral terms also play an important role in facilitating coronaviruses to cross the barriers of species.
First, their mutation rates are relatively high in RNA replication.
Compared to other monocatenary RNA viruses, estimated coronavirus mutation rates could be considered "moderate" to "high", with an average replacement rate of ~10-4 substitutions per year, per site 2, depending on the phase of adaptation of the coronavirus to new guests.
Coronaviruses have an exorribonuclease reading check, the elimination of which results in extremely high mutability and attenuation or even unfeasibility.
Interestingly, the remdesivir nucleotide analogue suppresses the replication of coronavirus by inhibiting this exorribonuclease and RNA-dependent polymerase.
Remdesiver is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents tested in clinical trials.
However, coronavirus mutation rates are about a million times higher than those of its guests.
In addition, the rate of mutation is often high when the coronaviruses are not well adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV, which has a high mutation rate, the SARS-CoV-2 mutation rate is apparently lower, suggesting a higher level of adaptation to humans.
It is to be hoped that he has already adapted to another guest close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to dromedaries.
In theory, it is unlikely that genetic drift will cause vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 to lose their effectiveness quickly.
Secondly, the long RNA genome of coronaviruses exerts additional plasticity in the modification of the genome for mutations and recombination and, in this way, increases the probability of coevolution between species, which favors the appearance of new coronaviruses when appropriate conditions are given.
This is supported by unique copious open reading frames and the functions of the encoded proteins towards the 3' direction of the genome.
Third, coronaviruses randomly and frequently change templates during RNA replication using a single copy-choice mechanism.
In a guest acting as a mixing vehicle, chain change occurs frequently during RNA transcription of the coronavirus.
Full-length RNA and highly homologous subgenomics could be recombined to generate new coronaviruses.
phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal coronaviruses such as bat SL-CoV and bat CoV-HKU9.
Virus-host interaction in relation to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with the host receptor is another key factor that influences transmission between species.
In the present, the recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example, which also showed evidence of positive selection in transmission events between species.
Based on the comparative analysis between isolates of SARS-CoV from humans and civets, SARS-CoV is believed to experience rapid adaptation in different guests, in particular with mutations in the RBD of protein S.
In general, the S protein RBD of a coronavirus interacts with the cell receptor and is intensely selected by the host's antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is found in amino acids 318 to 510 in fragment S1, which binds to human ACE2 and its correctors for viral entry.
SARS-CoV RBD is able to recognize the ACE2 receptors of several animals, including bat, civeta, mouse and raccoon dog, allowing transmission between species of the virus.
In fact, it was observed that only 6 amino acid residues were different from isolated strains of human and civet viruses in the RBD and 4 of them were found in the reason for binding to the receptor for interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
The SARS-CoV of civetas has K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD, which could increase the affinity of the interaction of the spike protein with the ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions could be fundamental to the adaptation of the virus to humans.
It should be noted that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cell receptor with SARS-CoV.
A 30 % difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of protein S implies that the affinity of binding of protein S with human ACE2 could have altered.
In fact, an electronic cryomicroscopy study indicates the 10 to 20 times greater affinity of this binding compared to human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S protein.
It will also be of interest to determine whether any other corrector might be necessary for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Surprisingly, the HCoV-NL63 also joins the ACE2, but with a different part of the S.
There are many other human coronavirus receptors, such as aminopeptidase N in HCV-229E and sialic acid 9-O-acetylated in HCV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronaviruses in humans, after transmission between species from their animal hosts.
In addition to cellular receptors, the result of transmission between species of human coronaviruses is also determined by other factors of dependence and restriction of the host.
The divergence of these host proteins between humans and natural reservoir hosts of human coronaviruses, such as bats, dromedaries and rodents, could constitute an obstacle to transmission between species.
Human coronaviruses must usurp guest dependency factors and subvert host restriction factors to make cross-species transmission successful.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this important area of host-virus interaction still need to be identified and characterized.
An objective full genome investigation of guest dependency and restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2 using advanced CRISPR technology could be beneficial.
New human coronaviruses appear: we leave from scratch
The diversity of bat coronaviruses offers numerous opportunities for the emergence of new human coronaviruses.
In this sense, bat coronaviruses act as the genetic collection of human coronaviruses.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also drive the evolution of human coronaviruses and constitute two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein encoder genes has the potential to drastically modify viral phenotypes.
Among the accessory proteins of SARS-CoV, ORF8 has been considered important in human adaptation, since bat viruses related to SARS-CoV have been isolated, but they have been determined to encode divergent ORF8 proteins.
An elimination of 29 nucleotides characteristic of SARS-CoV was found in isolates at the onset of the epidemic in humans.
This elimination divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is believed to be an adaptive mutation that promotes guest change.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a possible history of recombination with alpha and gammacoronavirus lines, in which a large number of smaller recombinant regions were identified in RNA-dependent polymerase RNA.
Recombinations locations were also identified in nsp9, most nsp10 and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, epidemic MERS-CoV has been shown to have undergone recombination events between different lines, which occurred in dromedaries in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in other human coronaviruses, in which human coronaviruses are recombined with other animal coronaviruses in their nonstructural genes.
It should also be noted that artificial selection can contribute to unwanted changes in viral genomes, which most likely results from releasing viruses from selection pressures exerted, for example, by the host's immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of a full-length ORF4 in the prototype strain of the HCV-229E due to the elimination of two nucleotides.
Although intact ORF4 could be observed in bat and camel viruses related to the HCV-229E, alphacoronavirus alpacas has a single nucleotide insertion, causing a change in frame.
Last but not least, the evolution of new human coronaviruses is also driven by the pressure of selection in their reservoir guests.
No symptoms were detected or only mild symptoms were detected when bats were infected with coronavirus, indicating mutual adaptation between coronaviruses and bats.
Bats appear to be well adapted to anatomically and physiologically coronaviruses.
For example, defects in activation of the proinflammatory response in bats efficiently reduces the pathology caused by coronaviruses.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in bats is suppressed due to the positive regulation of the inhibitory receptor of natural killer cells NKG2/CD94 and the low level of expression of class I molecules of the major histocompatibility complex.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from the elevated metabolic activity of bats could suppress the replication of the coronavirus and affect the reading check of exorribonuclease, which provides the selection pressure for the generation of highly pathogenic virus strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic coronavirus strains could also evolve by recombination, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for adaptation to the host.
Therefore, it is no coincidence that three new human coronaviruses have appeared in the last two decades.
Coronaviruses are not pathogens or cause mild symptoms in your reservoir guests, such as bats and camels.
They are strongly replicated without causing a strong immune response from the host.
This is why there are asymptomatic carriers and why there are serious cases of infection in humans.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to overactivation of immune response and cytokine storm, in which the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
On the other hand, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response has dissociated from coronavirus replication.
The same strategy of untying the immune response could have beneficial effects on anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
Interferon response is especially strong in bats.
Therefore, the administration of type I interferon at least at the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans should be beneficial.
In addition, activation of NLRP3 in bats is defective.
According to this reasoning, inhibition of NLRP3 inflammation with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The appearance of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general line that led to the appearance of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Although a bat betacoronavirus has been found that shares a 95 % nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV, there is also a bat coronavirus that shares a 96 % nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although civetas and other market animals have been found to contain viruses identical to SARS-CoV, no immediate intermediate guests of SARS-CoV-2 have been identified.
Pangoline beta-coronaviruses have been found to be remarkably similar to SARS-CoV-2, indicating that pangolines could act as one of the intermediate hosts or that pangoline beta-coronaviruses could provide fragments of genes to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is made by man, either deliberately or by accident.
Coronaviruses have regained prominence due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of coronaviruses in bats and other animals has profoundly changed our perception of the importance of the zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs of human coronaviruses in human transmission.
Vast evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats and are transmitted to humans through intermediate guests.
Since SARS-CoV infection originates in contact between humans and cyvetas in the markets, closing the wet markets and killing the civetas in them could have been effective in curbing the SARS epidemic.
Following this same reasoning, pangolines should be withdrawn from wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission, given the discovery of several beta-coronavirus strains of pangolines closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, if and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolines and other mammals remains to be clarified in future research.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV has existed in the dromedaries for a long time.
These camels are an important transport tool, as well as a main source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the local population.
They are widely distributed throughout the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control the MERS, as was done in China with wild animal markets to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To prevent recurrent outbreaks of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV for camels, in combination with other infection control measures.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes that cause outbreaks may appear.
A variety of zoonotic coronaviruses are circulating in the wild.
In particular, bat coronaviruses with zoonotic potential are very diverse.
There is a great chance that these zoonotic coronaviruses will evolve and recombine, which would lead to the emergence of new coronaviruses that are more transmissible or more deadly in humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some places in China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
Based on bad experiences with SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better preparedness and response plan should be adopted.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their own natural reservoirs until the opportunity to propagate occurs.
Although bats have many characteristics that favor the spread of viruses, human contact opportunities with bats and other wild species can be minimized if the population is educated to move away from them.
Continuous surveillance of mammals is necessary to better understand the ecology of coronaviruses and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing animal to human transmission and future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonoses is for humans to stay away from the ecological niches of the natural reservoirs of zoonotic viruses.
Several pieces are still missing in the puzzle of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
First, if bats transmit an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolines, it will be interesting to analyze under which circumstances bats and pangolines could share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if bats have a more direct role in human transmission, it must be determined how humans come into contact with bats.
Thirdly, if a third mammal acts as the true intermediate host, it should be clarified how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats and pangolines.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, monitoring and experimental infection should be carried out.
Whether a bat, pangolin or other mammal, SARS-CoV-2 or its almost identical parental viruses are expected to be identified in its natural hosts in the future.
Continuous research in this area will clarify the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications for the prevention and control of VOCID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the diagnostic criteria for the "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases" of COVID-19
On February 6, 2020, our team published a quick guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of infection with the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), and this guideline included our experience and is a good reference for fighting this pandemic worldwide.
However, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge gradually increase based on the results of ongoing research and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
In this letter, we responded to a comment on our guideline and provided the most recent diagnostic criteria for "suspicious case" and "confirmed case" according to the latest Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of VOCID-19 (seventh edition) published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) triggered an outbreak, which is now officially known as the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the virus was called Coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO designated COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick advisory directive that was published online in Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
He's attracted a lot of attention since it was published.
However, it should be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge gradually increase on the basis of the results of ongoing research and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
For example, the Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of VOCID-19 published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, have published a total of seven editions and some contexts have changed considerably.
Now, our guideline received a comment from Zhou et al., presented a simple classification proposal based on their clinical experience.
His work added new evidence to our guideline and is also a valuable reference for this pandemic around the world.
We support your important work and express our appreciation.
However, his work also needs updating according to the latest Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of VOCID-19 (seventh version of the trial) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm a suspicious case, it is necessary to combine any point of the epidemiological background characteristics with two points of clinical manifestations to make a thorough analysis, or three points of clinical manifestations must be fulfilled if there is no clear epidemiological background:
Epidemiological background: (1) history of travel or residence in the city of Wuhan and surrounding areas, or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) history of contact with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2 (positive nucleic acid test); (3) history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms in the city of Wuhan and surrounding areas, or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (4) history of contact with confirmed case groups (≥ 2 cases with fever or respiratory symptoms occurring within 2 weeks in small areas, such as home, office, school class, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever or respiratory symptoms; (2) characteristics of COVID-19 infection images; (3) total white blood cell counts showing normal, decreased or reduced lymphocyte counts at early onset.
The diagnosis of a confirmed case should be based on a suspect case with some characteristic of pathogenic or serological tests as follows: (1) positive real-time polymerase chain reaction test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) complete viral genome sequencing showing high homogeneity to recognized new coronaviruses; (3) positive result for specific IgM antibody and specific IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2 in a serum test; or a change of specific IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2 from negative to positive, or titre increase ≥4 times more in the recovery phase than in the acute phase.
We can see that the real-time polymerase chain reaction test to detect nucleic acid in blood or airway samples was added to the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions.
The detection of pathogens from blood samples was added to the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions; and then serological tests were added to the seventh edition.

In addition, more and more evidence reminds us that we should be cautious with asymptomatic and symptomatic atypical patients.
Therefore, the flow diagram of Zhou et al. should be updated as they classified the person without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The scoring system should also be verified in other clinical studies and practices.
In conclusion, we hope that more direct evidence will emerge and we ask readers to send us their comments.
For the diagnosis of "suspicious case" and "confirmed case", we recommend seeking and complying with the newer guidelines of their countries of origin.
Our team will also update our guideline in a timely manner to offer help.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths from COVID-19, the largest in one day
Bangladesh confirmed yesterday five new deaths from COVID-19 in one day.
It's the highest number of deaths in a day due to the virus.
Until yesterday, Bangladesh's Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported that the number of registered infected cases included 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases that were remaining in their homes.
A total of 17 deaths have been recorded.
In an online briefing, IEDCR director Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora said the victims were four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases were over 60 years old, two between 51 and 60 years old and one between 41 and 50 years old.
He also said that two of the victims were from Dhaka.
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemic.
A hospital official told Anadolu Agency, a local news outlet, that one of the deceased was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bangladesh Anti-Corruption Commission, who was being attended to at the Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video announcement, Bangladesh's Minister of Road and Bridge Transport, Obaidul Quader, said that public transport would be suspended for longer than originally planned, until next Saturday.
This suspension of public transport had initially begun on 26 March and was scheduled to end on Saturday, 4 April.
The transport of essential products, such as medical supplies, fuel and food, was still permitted.
The first recorded cases of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh occurred on 8 March, involving two men who returned from Italy and also their wife.
By 19 March, these three had recovered.
More than 1 million SARS-CoV-2 infections worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronary virus infections exceeded one million worldwide, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52 000 deaths were related to COVID-19, the disease caused by coronavirus.
The milestone took place on the same day that Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infections and Zambia had its first coronavirus-related death.
North Korea claimed, on Thursday, that it was one of the few countries without coronavirus infections.
Yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases within 24 hours prior to 10:00 a.m., European Central Time (UTC-0800), on 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus were recorded, linked to at least 5900 deaths.
CBS News reported, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, that on Wednesday there were more than 1,000 deaths in the United States caused by coronavirus infections.
Across the world, countries announced stricter measures to inhibit the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, extended the closure of the city until May 1.
At the national level, President Vladimir Putin declared that the Russians would continue to receive their wages without going to work until 30 April.
The Parliament of Portugal voted to extend the state of national emergency 15 days; the vote was adopted with 215 votes in favour, ten abstentions and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia extended curfews in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina throughout the day; previously, curfews were only kept between 3:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m.
Thailand planned to implement a curfew between 10:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state had extended its order to stay home until May 1.
Supermarkets in Australia lower toilet paper limits per transaction
On Sunday and Saturday afternoon, Australian supermarket chains Woolworths and Coles lowered their purchasing limits of toilet paper to two and one package per transaction in all supermarkets in the country, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also applied the limit of a package.
These limitations were published as messages on the boxes and on the Facebook pages of the chains.
Consumers were reportedly being supplied for fear of COVID-19 in the event that people had to self-insulate.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited purchases of toilet paper for home delivery to one package per order.
These changes were introduced after the previous restriction of four packages per transaction applied by Woolworths and Coles on 4 and 5 March, respectively.
Coles, in his press release of March 8, reported that, with the application of the restriction of four packages, "many supermarkets still exhaust the product within one hour of delivery," and said that the claim "had no precedent," while ALDI, in a Facebook publication on Tuesday, said it was "unexpected."
Sales rose with a "strong increase" last week, according to a Woolworths spokesman.
Costco supermarket in Canberra also limited the amount to two packages last week.
To further alleviate the shortage, Coles requested larger packages from suppliers and increased the frequency of deliveries, Woolworths ordered additional stocks, while ALDI made stocks available for a pre-planned Wednesday special offer.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers are trying to increase stocks, but local city hall restrictions on truck delivery schedules make it difficult.
It foresees an increase in production costs, as suppliers try to meet demand, and fewer offers.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that, following the early release of stocks, some supermarkets cannot make Wednesday's special offer.
In a report on News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, said supermarkets supply stocks every night.
He pointed out that toilet paper is a bulky item, which causes a low number of stocks in numbers, and, when exhausted, leaves a wide empty space in shelves, which intensifies the feeling of scarcity.
Coles and Woolworths have the idea that if there was an abundant quantity of the article on the shelves, if products like toilet paper rolls and disinfectants could [buy] and there were large quantities, panic would probably be minimized, said Russell Zimmerman by ABC News.
The manufacturer of recycled toilet paper Who Gives to Crap said last Wednesday that stocks were exhausted.
Kimberly-Clark, who manufactures Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper, who manufactures Sorbent, said they were working 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to maintain supply, according to the report on News.com.au.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported that some property sellers offered free toilet paper to the first bidder at auctions in Melbourne, when fewer auctions were held because buyers had free time on the long weekend of Labor Day.
The Thursday edition of NT News, a Darwin-printed newspaper, included an eight-page insert designed to be cut and used as toilet paper.
Supermarkets initially were reluctant to impose restrictions, according to an ABC Australia report of 3 March, in which they said they had no plans to introduce restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products also have a lot of demand, including masks, disinfectant, dry products, liquid soap and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, Sunday afternoon it was observed that the British online supermarket Ocado limited the purchases of Andres toilet paper to two packs of 12 rolls.
World Health Organization Declares Pandemic COVID-19
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared pandemic the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.
While the word "pandemic" refers only to the magnitude of the spread of a disease, not to how dangerous the specific cases are, WHO stressed the need to encourage Governments to take action:
All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries detect, test, treat, isolate, identify and mobilize their inhabitants in response, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director General of WHO.
We are very concerned, both about the alarming levels of propagation and gravity, and about the alarming levels of inaction.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States, the pandemic "has no precedent."
In statements published by CNN in February, he stated, "In addition to influenza, no other respiratory viruses have been traced from the onset to the continuous global spread."
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar opinion, and said "We have never seen a pandemic caused by a coron virus before."
"And we've never seen a pandemic before that can be controlled at the same time," he added.
The new pandemic condition arises following the WHO decision in January to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international importance.
The director of the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases of the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said about the outbreak, "in conclusion, it will get worse."
Until Thursday, Associated Press reported that there were at least 126 000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, and more than 4600 deaths.
The 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing coronavirus disease pandemic 2019 (COVID-19), caused by Coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared a public health emergency of international importance on 30 January 2020, and was recognized as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As at 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 were reported in 210 countries and territories, and around 97,000 deaths as a result.
About 364,000 people recovered.
It was estimated that the case-by-case mortality rate is 4% in China, while globally it ranges from 13.04 % in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but may vary from two to fourteen days.
There is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment.
Primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. Recommended preventive measures include washing your hands, covering your mouth while coughing, keeping away from other people, and controlling and insulating people who suspect they are infected.
Authorities around the world responded by implementing travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace hazard controls and facility closures.
The pandemic caused serious global socio-economic disruption, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and the widespread shortage of supplies aggravated by panic-driven purchases.
Schools and universities closed at national or local level in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4% of the world ' s student population.
Misinformation on the virus was disseminated over the Internet, and there were incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, other people of East and South-East Asian descent and appearance, and other cases of significant viruses.
Owing to reduced travel and closures of heavy industry, air pollution and carbon emissions were reduced.
On 31 December 2019, the health authorities in Wuhan, China, (the capital of Hubei Province) reported a group of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause, and an investigation was initiated in early January 2020.
Most cases were related to the wholesale seafood market in Huanan, so it was thought that the virus had a zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus closely related to bat coronaviruses, pangoline coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV. Subsequently, it was discovered that the first person who was known to manifest symptoms was ill on December 1, 2019, and that person had no visible connections to the last wet market group.
Of the first group of cases reported in December 2019, two thirds were found to have a link to the market.
On March 13, 2020, an unverified report from the South China Morning Post suggested that, a case dating back to November 17, 2019, of a 55-year-old from Hubei Province, could have been the first. On February 26, 2020, WHO reported that, as new cases, according to reports, declined in China but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had for the first time exceeded the number of new cases within China.
There may be a considerable number of uninformed cases, especially among those with milder symptoms.
As at 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported in young people, and those aged 19 and under accounted for 2.4% of cases worldwide. Patrick Vallance, the UK's Senior Scientific Adviser, estimated that 60% of the British population would have to be infected before effective collective immunity could be achieved.
The cases relate to the number of people who underwent COVID-19 tests, and who obtained a positive result confirmed according to official protocols.
As of 23 March, no country had conducted tests in more than 3% of its population, and many countries have had official policies not to carry out tests on people who had only mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March revealed that, in China, until 23 January, an estimated 86% of infections with VOCID-19 had not been detected, and that these unregistered infections were the source of infection of 79% of the cases recorded.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the amounts of infections in Italy were considerably higher than reported cases.
The initial estimates of the basic reproductive number (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States found that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who do not, the time elapsed from the development of symptoms to death has been between 6 and 41 days, the most common being 14 days.
As at 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths had been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, as at 5 February, around 80% of deaths were for people over 60 years of age, and 75% had pre-existing diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Official records of deaths from the VOCID-19 pandemic generally refer to those who died who gave positive results in the VOCID test, according to official protocols.
The number of actual deaths due to COVID-19 may be much higher, as it may not include those who died without the test, for example, in their homes, homes of the elderly, etc.
Partial data from Italy revealed that the number of additional deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official registration of deaths by COVID in a factor of 4 to 5 times.
A spokesman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States admitted "We know that [the number of deaths reported] is an underestimation", a statement corroborated by the anecdotal sub-counting reports in the United States. This underestimation is common in pandemics, as in the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic. The first confirmed death occurred in Wuhan on January 9, 2020.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on 14 February.
On 28 February, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths were recorded in each of the countries of Iran, South Korea and Italy.
As at 13 March, more than 40 countries and territories had reported deaths, on all continents except Antarctica. Generally, several indicators are used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary according to the region and over time, and are influenced by the number of tests, the quality of the health system, treatment options, the time since the initial outbreak and the characteristics of the population, such as age, sex and general health. The proportion of deaths in cases reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a given time interval.
According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, the world's share of case deaths is 6.0% (97 039/1 617 204) as at 10 April 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, estimates of the proportion of deaths in cases decreased from 17.3% (in those with symptoms from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (in those with symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other indicators include the case-by-case mortality rate, which reflects the percentage of people diagnosed who died from a disease, and the rate of infection mortality, which reflects the percentage of infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who died from a disease.
These statistics do not have a specific time frame and consider a specific population from infection to resolution of the case.
Some scholars have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine of the University of Oxford estimates that the mortality rate for pandemic infections as a whole is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The higher estimate of this range is consistent with the results of the first random trials for COVID-19 in Germany, and a statistical study that analyzed the impact of the tests on estimates of the mortality rate per case.
WHO claims that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and final duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may differ depending on the location.
Maciej Boni of the State University of Pennsylvania said, "Infectious outbreaks, if not controlled, usually stabilize and then begin to decrease when the disease is left without available guests.
But, at this time, it is almost impossible to make any reasonable prediction of when that will happen."
The Chinese Government's chief medical adviser, Zhong Nanshan, said that "it could end in June" if all countries can be mobilized to follow the WHO recommendation on measures to halt the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in London said SARS-CoV-2 "will be circulating, possibly for one or two years."
According to the Imperial College study led by Neil Ferguson, physical distancing and other measures will be necessary "until a vaccine is available (possibly 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner of the University of Vanderbilt said, "I think it is unlikely that this coronavirus, as it is transmitted so easily, will disappear completely" and "it could become a seasonal disease, which will reappear every year."
The virulence of reappearance would depend on collective immunity and the magnitude of the mutation.
The symptoms of VOCID-19 may be relatively non-specific and infected people may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less frequent symptoms include fatigue, sputum production in the respiratory tract (flema), loss of sense of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, haemoptysis, diarrhoea or cyanosis. WHO states that approximately one in six people is seriously ill and has difficulty breathing.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States, emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pressure or pain, sudden confusion, difficulty waking up and bluish color in the face or lips; in view of the manifestation of these symptoms, immediate medical attention is recommended. The greater progression of the disease may lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock and death.
Some of the infected people may be asymptomatic, have no clinical symptoms, although the results of the test confirm the infection, so researchers advised to carefully monitor and examine those who have close contact with confirmed infected people in order to rule out the infection.
Chinese estimates of the proportion of asymptomatic people range from a few to 44 per cent.
The usual incubation period (the time between infection and onset of symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; more often it is 5 days. As an example of uncertainty, the estimate of the proportion of people with VOCID-19 who lost their sense of smell at first was 30% and then decreased to 15%.
Some details of how the disease is spread are still being determined.
The disease is believed to spread mainly during close contact and through small drops that occur when coughing, sneezing or speaking; close contact is considered a distance of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
According to studies, when coughing without covering the mouth the droplets can move from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some have proposed that the virus can also be transmitted through small drops that remain in the air for longer periods of time, which can be generated by speaking. Respiratory droplets may also occur during exhalation, even when speaking, although the virus is usually not transmitted through the air.
Droplets may enter the mouth or nose of people nearby or possibly inhale into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), may cause aerosolation of respiratory secretions and therefore aerial propagation.
It can also spread when you touch a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then you touch your eyes, nose, or mouth.
While there is concern that it can be transmitted through faeces, this risk is thought to be low.
The Chinese Government denied the possibility of oral faecal transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is more contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although the spread may be possible before symptoms are manifested and at more advanced stages of the disease.
People achieved positive results in the disease tests up to three days before the onset of symptoms, indicating that transmission is possible before developing significant symptoms.
There are only a few reports of laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic cases, but some countries have identified asymptomatic transmission during contact tracing investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) maintains that, although it is not entirely clear how easily the disease is spread, one person usually infects two or three others. The virus survives from hours to days on the surfaces.
Specifically, it was determined that the virus is detectable for up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, one day in cardboard and up to four hours in copper.
This, however, varies according to humidity and temperature. Positive results were obtained in COVID-19 tests performed on pets and other animals.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although the British authorities recommend washing their hands after contact with animals, as well as after contact with other surfaces that may have touched infected persons.
Coron virus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with the group of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in coronaviruses related to nature. Outside the human body, the virus dies when it comes into contact with soap, which dissolves its protective wrap. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It is believed to have a zoonotic origin.
Genetic analyses revealed that the coronavirus is genetically grouped with the genus betacoronavirus, its subgenus sarbecovirus (line B) along with two strains derived from the bat.
At the level of the complete genome, it is 96 % identical to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only one difference in amino acids in certain parts of genome sequences between pangolines and human viruses.
To date, the comparison of the complete genome indicated that pangoline coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 share a maximum of 92% of the genetic material, which is not sufficient to demonstrate that pangolines are the intermediate host.
Virus infection may be provisionally diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, although it is ultimately confirmed through the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RTR-PCR) of infected secretions or through computed tomography images.
According to a study conducted in Wuhan comparing polymerase chain reaction with computed tomography, computed tomography is much more sensitive than polymerase chain reaction, although less specific, and many of the characteristics in the images coincide with the processes of other diseases and pneumonias.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has recommended "not to use computed tomography as a detection method or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19".
WHO has published several RNA test protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on 17 January.
The test uses the polymerase chain reaction with real-time reverse transcriptase (rRT-PCR).
The test can be done in blood or respiratory samples.
Results are usually available within a few hours or days.
This test is usually performed with a nasopharyngeal hysop, although a throat hysop can also be used. Some laboratories and companies are developing serological tests, which detect antibodies.
As of 6 April 2020, none of these proved to be accurate enough for their widespread use to be approved.
In the US, a serological test developed by Cellex was approved for emergency use by certified laboratories only.
The characteristic features in the images of X-rays and computed tomography (CT) of symptomatic people include asymmetrical peripheral depleted glass opacities and absent pleural effusions.
The Italian Society of Radiology is compiling an international online database of the results obtained in images of confirmed cases.
Due to overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, unconfirmed imaging by polymerase chain reaction has limited specificity in the identification of COVID-19.
A comprehensive study conducted in China compared the results of chest computed tomography with those of polymerase chain reaction and demonstrated that, although imaging is less specific to infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting its consideration as a detection tool in areas affected by the epidemic.
Convolutional neural networks based on artificial intelligence were developed to detect characteristics of the virus in the images, both with X-rays and computed tomography.
Strategies to prevent the transmission of the disease include maintaining good general personal hygiene, washing your hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth with your hands without having washed them before, sneezing or coughing on a disposable handkerchief and throwing the handkerchief directly into a waste container.
It is recommended that those who may already be infected wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical distancing measures are also recommended to prevent transmission. Many Governments have restricted or discouraged all non-essential travel to and from countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached the phase of community spread in many parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities, and some community members do not know where or how it was infected. It is recommended that health care providers who care for someone who may be infected take standard precautions, contact precautions and use eye protection. Contact tracing is an important method for health authorities to determine the origin of an infection and to prevent further transmission.
The use of mobile phone location data by governments for this purpose has generated privacy concerns, and Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement demanding limits on this type of surveillance.
Several mobile applications have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record a user's proximity to other mobile phones.
Users then receive a message if they were in close contact with someone who gave positive in the VOCID-19 test. They are circulating wrong ideas on how to prevent infection; for example, nasal washing and mouthwashing gargles are not effective.
There is no vaccine against COVID-19, although many organizations are working to develop one.
Handwashing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after using the bath or when their hands are visibly dirty; before eating and after the nose sounds, coughing or sneezing.
This is because, outside the human body, the virus dies when it comes into contact with soap, which disintegrates its protective bubble.
The CDC also recommended using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% volume alcohol when water and soap are not available.
WHO recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth with their hands without having washed them before.
The surfaces may be decontaminated with several solutions (within one minute of exposure to disinfectant on a stainless steel surface), including 62–71 % ethanol, 50–100 % isopropanol, 0.1 % sodium hypochlorite, 0,5 % hydrogen peroxide and 0,2–7,5 % iodinated povidone.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that, if a case of COVID is suspected or confirmed in an installation, such as an office or daycare centre, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common spaces, shared electronic equipment, such as tablets, touchscreens, keyboards, remote controls and ATMs that have been used by sick people should be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouth and nose with a flexed elbow or a disposable tissue for coughing or sneezing, and that they discard the tissue immediately.
It is recommended that those who may be infected wear surgical masks, as the use of a mask may limit the volume and distance travelled by the respiratory drops that are dispersed when speaking, sneezing and coughing.
WHO issued instructions on when and how to use the masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "Using a mask can reduce the tendency [of] people to touch their faces, which is an important source of infection without proper hand hygiene." It has also been recommended to use masks in people who care for someone who might have the disease.
WHO has recommended the use of masks by healthy people only if they are at high risk, for example, those who care for a person with COVID-19, although it also recognizes that wearing masks can help people avoid touching their faces.
Several countries have begun to encourage the use of masks by the public.
In the US, CDC recommends using non-medical masks made of fabric. China specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks by healthy members of the public, especially when in close contact (1 meter (3 feet) or less) with other people.
Hong Kong recommends using a surgical mask to take public transport or be in crowded places.
Thai health officials recommend people to make fabric masks in their homes and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia banned leaving public spaces without wearing a mask or covering their noses and mouths.
On March 16, Vietnam requested that all people wear a mask while in public spaces to protect themselves and others.
The Government of Austria demanded the use of masks by all persons entering a supermarket.
Israel requested that all residents wear masks in public.
Taiwan, which has manufactured 10 million masks per day since mid-March, on 1 April demanded the use of masks by passengers on long-distance trains and buses.
Panama imposed the mandatory use of masks to go outdoors, while also recommending the manufacture of homemade masks from those who cannot buy them.
Masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes measures to control infection designed to stop the spread of the disease by minimizing close contact between people.
The methods include quarantines, travel restrictions and closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres and shopping centres.
People can implement social distancing methods by staying in their homes, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using non-contact greetings and physically distancing themselves from other people.
Many governments now demand or recommend social distancing in regions affected by the outbreak.
The maximum size of meetings recommended by government agencies and U.S. health organizations was reduced rapidly from 250 people (if there was no known spread of COVID-19 in one region) to 50 people, and subsequently to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public meetings of more than two people. Older adults and those with underlying diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension and compromised immune systems are at increased risk of disease and serious complications, and the CDC recommends that they stay in their homes as much as possible in the areas of the community affected by the outbreak. At the end of March 2020, WHO and other health agencies began to replace the term "social distance" with "physical distance", to clarify that the goal is to reduce physical contact while social connections are maintained, either virtually or remotely.
The use of the term "social distance" has had an impact on the assumption that people should adopt complete social isolation, rather than encouraging them to keep in touch with others through alternative means. Some authorities have issued guidelines on sexual health for use during the pandemic.
They include recommendations to have only sex with a person you live with, who does not have the virus or symptoms of the virus.
Self-insulation at home was recommended for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those suspected of becoming infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions on proper self-insulation. Many governments have required or recommended the self-recommendation of entire populations in affected areas.
The strictest self-quarantine instructions were issued for those belonging to high-risk groups.
People who may have been in contact with someone with COVID-19 and who have recently travelled to a country or region with widespread transmission are advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of the last possible exposure.
Strategies for controlling an outbreak are containment or suppression and mitigation.
Containment is carried out in the early stages of the outbreak and is intended to identify and isolate infected persons, in addition to introducing other infection control measures and vaccines to prevent the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to control the spread of the disease, efforts shift to the mitigation phase: measures are taken to curb the spread and mitigate its effects on the health system and society.
A combination of containment and mitigation measures can be taken at the same time.
The suppression requires more extreme measures to be able to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic number of reproduction to less than 1. Part of controlling the outbreak of an infectious disease involves trying to reduce the epidemic peak, which is known as flattening the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of health services collapse and allows more time for the development of vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can control the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, use of masks and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing, such as school closure and cancellation of mass competition events; community commitment to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures and surface cleaning. In China, more drastic measures were taken to contain the outbreak once its severity became evident, for example, the implementation of quarantines in entire cities and the imposition of strict travel bans.
Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea implemented mass detection assessments and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected persons.
Singapore provided financial support to those infected who decided to quarantine and imposed large fines on those who did not.
Taiwan increased the production of masks and sanctioned the accumulation of medical supplies. Simulations in Britain and the United States show that mitigation (which decreases the spread of the epidemic but does not stop it) and suppression (which reverses the growth of the pandemic) have great challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies could reduce the maximum demand for health care by two thirds and deaths by half, but still generate hundreds of thousands of deaths and the collapse of health systems.
Removal may be preferred, but it should be maintained for as long as the virus circulates in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if that happens first), as otherwise the transmission is reactivated rapidly when measures are relaxed.
Long-term intervention to eliminate the pandemic entails social and economic costs.
There are no specific antiviral drugs approved for COVID-19, but efforts are being made to develop them, including testing existing drugs.
Taking over-the-counter cold medications, drinking fluids, and resting can help relieve symptoms.
Depending on severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids and respiratory assistance may be required.
The use of steroids can worsen the results.
Several compounds previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being investigated for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO also indicated that some "home and traditional remedies" can relieve symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO describes capacity-building and the adaptation of medical care to the needs of patients with COVID-19 as a key response to the outbreak.
ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have developed guidelines for hospitals and primary health care services for the redistribution of resources at different levels, including focusing laboratory services on VOCID-19 testing, canceling optional procedures where possible, separating and isolating positive patients in VOCID-19 and increasing intensive care capabilities through staff training and increasing the number of respirators and beds available.
There are several theories about where the first case might have originated (the so-called patient zero).
The first known case of the new coronavirus can be traced back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Over the course of one month, the number of cases of coronavirus in Hubei gradually increased.
These were mainly linked to the wholesale seafood market in Huanan, which also sold live animals, and one theory is that the virus originated from one of these animals; or, in other words, it has a zoonotic origin. On 26 December, a series of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause were observed that Dr. Zhang Jixian was in charge of at Hubei Provincial Hospital, which reported to the Jianghan CDC in Wuhan on 27 December.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about a "SARS-like coronary virus".
The police admonished eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, for spreading false rumors, and another doctor, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by his superiors for giving the alarm.
Subsequently, on 31 December, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public note and informed WHO.
At the beginning of January, sufficient cases of pneumonia of unknown cause had been reported to the health authorities in Wuhan to initiate an investigation. During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, contributing to migration for the Chinese New Year and the fact that Wuhan is a transport hub and a major rail crossing.
On 20 January, China reported about 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Further official data show that, as of January 20, 2020, 6174 people had already developed symptoms. As of March 26, the United States has surpassed China and Italy with the largest number of confirmed cases in the world. As of April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97 000 people have died and more than 364,000 have recovered.
Around 200 countries and territories have had at least one case.
Because of the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have restricted free movement and established border controls.
National reactions have included containment measures, such as quarantines (known as orders to stay at home, shelter orders in place or confinement) and curfews. As of 2 April, about 300 million people, or about 90 per cent of the population, are serving some form of confinement in the United States, over 50 million people are confined in the Philippines, about 59 million people are confined in South Africa and 13 billion people are confined in India.
As at 26 March, 17 billion people around the world were serving some form of confinement, which increased to 26 billion people two days later, about one third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 dates back to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report indicates that the first case occurred on 17 November.
On 26 December, Dr. Zhang Jixian observed a group of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause, and her hospital reported to the Jianghan CDC in Wuhan on 27 December.
The first genetic tests of patient samples on December 27, 2019 indicated the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
On 31 December, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public note.
WHO was informed on the same day.
While these notifications were being made, the police warned doctors in Wuhan to "spread rumors" about the outbreak.
The Chinese National Health Commission initially stated that there was no "clear evidence" of human transmission.
At the end of January, the Chinese government launched a drastic campaign, later described by the Secretary General of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, as a "popular war", to contain the spread of the virus.
In what was described as "the greatest quarantine in the history of humanity", on 23 January a health cordon was announced that prohibited travel within and outside Wuhan, this spread to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, and affected a total of about 57 million people.
The use of private vehicles in the city was prohibited.
Chinese New Year celebrations were cancelled (25 January) in many places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Subsequently, another hospital, Leishenshan Hospital, was built to receive more patients.
In addition to the new hospitals built, China also converted 14 other facilities in Wuhan, such as convention centers and stadiums, into temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the Government implemented more measures to contain the outbreak of the COVID-19, which included the issuance of health declarations for travellers and the extension of the Spring Festival holiday.
Universities and schools were also closed throughout the country.
The Hong Kong and Macao regions implemented a number of measures, especially in relation to schools and universities.
Remote working measures were established in several regions of China.
Travel restrictions were implemented inside and outside Hubei.
Public transport was modified and museums were temporarily closed throughout China.
Control of the public movement in several cities has been implemented, and it has been estimated that around 760 million people (over half of the population) faced some kind of restriction on outdoor outings. Following the start of the global phase of the outbreak in March, the Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the "import" of the virus from other countries.
For example, Beijing has imposed a mandatory 14-day quarantine for all international travellers entering the city. As of 23 March, in mainland China, only one case had been transmitted nationally in the previous five days, on this occasion, through a traveler who returned from Istanbul to Canton.
On 24 March 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang reported that the spread of cases transmitted nationally was basically blocked and that the outbreak had been controlled in China.
On the same day, travel restrictions were relaxed in Hubei, as well as in Wuhan, two months after the confinement was imposed. On 26 March 2020, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that the entry of visa holders or residence permits would be suspended from 28 March, with no specific details of when this policy will end.
Those wishing to enter China must apply for visas at Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Chinese Government encouraged companies and factories to reopen on 30 March and provided economic stimulus packages for the firms. The State Council declared a day of mourning that it will begin with a moment of national silence of three minutes on 4 April at 10:00, coinciding with the Qingming Festival, although the Central Government asked families to show their respect online to comply with the physical distance in order to avoid the resurgence of the COVID-19.
On 20 January 2020, it was confirmed that COVID-19 spread from China to South Korea.
On February 20, the country's health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases, attributed mainly to a meeting in Daegu of a new religious movement known as the Church of Jesus Shincheonji.
It is suspected that Shincheonji devotees who visited Daegu from Wuhan were the origin of the outbreak.
As of February 22, out of 9336 church followers, 1261 or about 13% reported symptoms. On February 23, 2020, South Korea declared the highest alert level.
On 28 February, more than 2000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, which increased to 3150 on 29 February.
All military bases in South Korea were quarantined after the tests confirmed that three soldiers were positive for the virus.
Airlines' schedules were also affected, and therefore changed. South Korea presented what was considered the world's largest and best-organized program for testing for the virus in the population and isolating infected people, as well as identifying and quarantineing those who were in contact with them.
The detection methods included mandatory self-reporting of symptoms by newly arrived people from other countries through a mobile application, drive-thru centres to conduct virus detection tests with results available the following day and increased diagnostic capacity to be able to test in up to 20,000 people every day.
South Korea's program is considered a success in controlling the outbreak despite not adopting quarantine in entire cities. South Korea's society at first was polarized with President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions to demand the removal of Moon so they considered the outbreak to be mismanaged by the government, or to commend his response.
On 23 March, it was reported that South Korea had the total number of cases in a lower day in four weeks.
On 29 March, it was reported that, from 1 April, all new arrivals from abroad should remain in quarantine for two weeks.
According to media reports, on 1 April South Korea received requests for assistance in testing the virus from 121 different countries.
On 19 February, Iran reported its first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Qom, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people died later that day.
Early measures announced by the Government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural events, sporting events and Friday prayers, and the closure of universities, higher education institutions and schools.
Iran allocated five billion rials to fight the virus.
On February 26, 2020, President Hassan Rouhani said that there were no plans to quarantine areas affected by the outbreak, and that only people would be quarantined.
In March, plans to limit city-to-city travel were announced, although heavy traffic between cities as a result of New Year ' s Persa Nowruz continued.
The Shia shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until March 16, 2020. During February, Iran became a center for spreading the virus after China.
Amidst the allegations of a cover-up of the magnitude of the outbreak in Iran, more than 10 countries had traced their cases to Iran by 28 February, indicating that the magnitude of the outbreak could be more severe than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian Government by that date.
The Iranian Parliament closed, and on 3 March, 23 of its 290 members reported that they had achieved positive results in testing the virus.
On 12 March, Human Rights Watch urged the Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders detained for peaceful dissent, and also to temporarily release all eligible prisoners.
He indicated that there is an increased risk of the spread of the virus in closed institutions, such as detention centres, which also lack adequate medical care.
On 15 March, the Iranian Government reported 100 deaths on the same day, the largest number recorded in the country since the outbreak began.
As of 17 March, at least 12 ex-politicians or politicians working in Iran had died of the disease.
As of March 23, Iran experienced 50 new cases per hour and one new death every ten minutes due to the coronavirus.
According to a WHO official, there may be five times as many cases in Iran as reported.
It is also suggested that US sanctions on Iran may be affecting the country's financial capacity to respond to the viral outbreak.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has demanded the relief of economic sanctions for the countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
On 31 January, the outbreak spread to Italy was confirmed, when two Chinese tourists gave positive results in the SARS-CoV-2 tests in Rome.
Cases began to increase rapidly, leading the Italian Government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.
Subsequently, a group of unrelated COVID-19 cases was detected, which began with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers announced a new law to contain the outbreak, which included quarantine of more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, "You will not be allowed to enter or leave the areas affected by the outbreak.
On 4 March, the Italian Government ordered the complete closure of schools and universities throughout the country while Italy reached 100 deaths.
All major sporting events, including Serie A football matches, were to be held behind closed doors until April, but on March 9, all sporting events were completely suspended for at least one month.
On March 11, Prime Minister Conte ordered the discontinuation of virtually all commercial activities except supermarkets and pharmacies. On March 6, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Reanimation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published recommendations for medical ethics on the screening protocols that could be used.
On March 19, Italy surpassed China as the country with the largest number of coronavirus-related deaths in the world after reporting 3405 pandemic deaths.
On 22 March, it was reported that Russia had dispatched nine military aircraft with medical equipment to Italy.
As at 5 April, there were 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 recoveries in Italy, most of which occurred in the Lombardy region.
A CNN report indicated that Italy's combination of a large elderly population and the inability to test all people with the virus to date could contribute to the high mortality rate.
The United Kingdom's response to the virus first emerged as one of the most relaxed affected countries, and until 18 March 2020, the British Government did not impose any social or mass quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the Government received criticism for the apparent lack of speed and intensity in its response to public concerns. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made an announcement in which he advised against social contact and all non-essential travel, and suggested that people work from their homes when possible and avoid places such as bars, restaurants and theaters.
On 20 March, the Government announced the closure of all leisure facilities, such as bars and gyms, as soon as possible, and promised to pay up to 80% of workers' salaries up to a limit of GBP 2500 per month to prevent unemployment during the crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced stricter social distancing measures, which banned meetings of more than two people and restricted travel and outdoor activities to those deemed strictly necessary.
Unlike the previous measures, the police could demand compliance with these restrictions through the imposition of fines and the dispersion of meetings.
The closure of most companies was ordered, with the exception of those considered "essential", including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware stores, gas stations and workshops.

On January 28, 2020, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the main public health institute of the U.S. government, announced that they had developed their own test kit.
Despite doing so, the United States had a slow start in conducting tests, which obscured the true magnitude of the outbreak at that time.
The tests were tarnished by the defective test kits produced by the federal government in February, the failure of the federal government to approve non-governmental test kits (from academies, companies and hospitals) until the end of February, and the restrictive criteria for individuals to qualify for a test until the beginning of March (after a medical order was required).
As at 27 February, the Washington Post reported that fewer than 4000 tests had been conducted in the United States.
As at 13 March, The Atlantic reported that less than 14,000 tests had been conducted.
On March 22, Associated Press reported: "Many people with symptoms and a medical order have waited hours or days for a test."

On 3 April, in the state of New York, the cases exceeded 100,000 people. The White House has received criticism for underestimating the threat and controlling messages by telling health officials and scientists to coordinate public statements and publications related to the virus with the office of vice president Mike Pence.
The general approval of Trump's crisis management has been polarized among party lines.
Some U.S. officials and commentators criticized the U.S. dependence on the import of critical materials, including special medical supplies, from China.
An analysis of travel patterns was used to identify and predict spread patterns and was published in The Journal of Travel Medicine in mid-January 2020.

Medical tests were conducted prior to take-off, and four South Africans with signs of coronavirus had to stay to mitigate the risk.
Only South Africans who gave negative evidence were repatriated.
The test results authorized all South Africans, including flight crew, pilots, hotel staff, police and soldiers who participated in the humanitarian mission, who, as a preventive measure, remained in observation and quarantine for a period of 14 days at The Ranch Resort.

On the other hand, China's aid was widely accepted in parts of Latin America and Africa. On 2 April, the World Bank launched emergency support operations for developing countries.
WHO commended the efforts of the Chinese authorities to control and contain the epidemic.
WHO noted the difference between the SARS outbreak of 2002–2004, when Chinese authorities were accused of secrecy that prevented prevention and containment efforts, and the current crisis, in which the central government "has provided periodic updates to avoid panic at Lunar New Year's holidays".
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to implement a transport ban in Wuhan, WHO representative Gauden Galea noted that, although "it was definitely not a recommendation made by WHO", it was "a very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic in the place where it is most concentrated" and said that "it had no precedent in the history of public health." On 30 January, following confirmation of human transmission outside China and the increase in the number of cases in other countries, WHO declared the outbreak an emergency of public health of international importance (SPII), the sixth ESPII since the first call for action during the 2009 swine flu pandemic.
The Director General of WHO, Tedros Adhanom, said that ESPII was "due to the risk of global spread, especially to low- and middle-income countries without solid health systems."
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros stated that "there is no reason to take measures that unnecessarily interfere with international trade and travel" and that "WHO does not recommend limiting trade or movement".
On 5 February, WHO turned to the global community for a contribution of $675 million to finance strategic preparedness in low-income countries, citing the urgency of supporting those countries "that do not have systems to detect people who have contracted the virus, should they exist."
Tedros also made statements in which he stated that "we are only as strong as our weakest link" and urged the international community to "invest today or pay more in the future."On February 11, WHO announced at a press conference that COVID-19 was the name of the disease.
On the same day, Tedros stated that the Secretary-General of the United Nations, António Guterres, had agreed to provide the "power of the entire United Nations system in response".
As a result, a United Nations crisis management team was activated, which enabled the coordination of the response of all the United Nations, which, according to WHO, will enable them to "focus on the health response while other agencies can provide their expertise to address the broader social, economic and development implications of the outbreak".
On 14 February, a joint WHO-led mission team with China was activated to provide international and WHO field experts in China to assist in national management and to assess "the severity and transmissibleness of the disease" through the organization of workshops and meetings with key institutions at the national level and to conduct site visits to assess the "impact of response activities at the provincial and county levels, including urban and rural environments." On 25 February, WHO stated that "the world must do more to prepare for a possible coronavirus pandemic", and noted that, although it was still very early to call the pandemic, countries should nevertheless be "in a phase of preparedness".
In response to a developing outbreak in Iran, WHO sent a joint mission team there to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials said that the global threat assessment for coronavirus would rise from "high" to "very high", its highest level of alert and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, Executive Director of the WHO Health Emergency Program, warned in a statement that "This is a reality check for all governments on the planet: wake up.
This virus may be on its way and we must be prepared," insisting that appropriate response measures could help the world avoid "the worst."
Ryan also said that the current data did not guarantee that public health officials would declare a global pandemic, and said that such a statement would mean that "we are basically accepting that all human beings on the planet will be exposed to that virus."
On 11 March, WHO declared the outbreak of coronavirus pandemic.
The Director General said that WHO was "very concerned, both about the alarming levels of spread and severity, and the alarming levels of inaction." WHO has received important criticisms for what is considered an inadequate management of the pandemic, including the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
The negative reaction included the request for the resignation of the Director-General of WHO, Tedros Adhanom, signed by 733,000 people as at 6 April.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of United Nations human rights experts emphasized respect for the rights of all persons during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The expert group indicated that everyone has the right to life-saving interventions and that the Government has this responsibility.
The group stressed that lack of resources or health insurance should never be used as a justification for discrimination against a specific group.
Experts stressed that all persons have the right to health, including persons with disabilities, those belonging to minority groups, older persons, internally displaced persons, homeless persons, those living in extreme poverty, persons detained, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups in need of government support.
International governmental organizations are addressing the social and economic impacts of the crisis by COVID-19.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development launched a platform to provide comprehensive and timely information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as views and advice.
From policies to strengthen health systems and the global economy to addressing the effects of confinement and travel restrictions, the digital centre includes a country-by-country policy tracker, which aims to help countries learn from each other and facilitate a coordinated global response to the coronavirus challenge.
The Government of China has been criticized by the United States, the United Kingdom Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove, and the son of Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro, Eduardo Bolsonaro, for his management of the pandemic, which began in the Chinese province of Hubei.
Several administrators at the provincial level of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC) were fired because of their management of quarantine efforts in Central China, a sign of discontent with the political system's response to the outbreak in those regions.
Some commentators believe that this step was taken to protect the Secretary General of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, from public anger over the outbreak of coronavirus.
Some Chinese officials, for example, Zhao Lijian, rejected an earlier recognition of the onset of the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, in favor of conspiracy theories about the origin of COVID-19 in the US or Italy.
The US administration of Donald Trump has referred to the coronavirus as the "Chinese virus" or the "Wuhan virus", and stated that the "Censorship of China overfed a virus that has now become a global pandemic," which, in turn, was pointed out by some critics as racism and "distracted from the failure of its administration to contain the disease."
The Daily Beast obtained a telegram from the U.S. government describing a strategist of communications with apparent origin in the National Security Council, and citing the strategy as "All about China".
We have been told to try to convey this message in any way possible, including press conferences and television appearances. "Media such as Politics, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have stated that China's efforts to send aid to countries affected by the virus are part of propaganda to gain global influence.
EU foreign policy representative Josep Borrell warned that "there is a geopolitical component that includes a struggle for influence through propaganda and the policy of generosity."
Borrell also said that "China is aggressively pushing the message that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner."
China also called for the United States to lift its sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while, according to reports, it sent aid to the latter two countries.
On April 3, United States sanctions blocked Jack Ma's donation of 100,000 masks to Cuba.
The US authorities were also accused of diverting aid from other countries to their own country.
And disputes related to masks have been reported among other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland; and between the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey seized hundreds of respirators destined for Spain.
At the beginning of March, the Italian Government criticized the European Union's lack of solidarity with Italy, affected by the coronavirus.
Maurizio Massari, Italian ambassador to the European Union, said that "China alone responded bilaterally.
This is certainly not a good sign of European solidarity."
On 22 March, after a telephone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the Russian army to send military doctors, special disinfection vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa cited an anonymous "high-level political source" that claimed that 80% of Russia's aid was "useless or of little use for Italy".
The source accused Russia of undertaking a "geopolitical and diplomatic" seduction offensive.
The president of Lombardy, Attilio Fontana, and the Italian minister of foreign affairs, Luigi Di Maio, rejected the journalistic reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical aid to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that "by offering help to American colleagues, [Putin] assumes that when US manufacturers of medical materials and equipment gain momentum, they will also be able to respond if necessary."
NATO's planned military exercise "Defender 2020" in Germany, Poland and the Baltic countries, NATO's largest military exercise since the end of the Cold War, will be carried out on a small scale.
The Secretary General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Kate Hudson, criticized the exercise Defender 2020: "In the current public health crisis, it endangers the lives not only of the United States troops and the various European countries participating, but also of the inhabitants of the countries in which they operate."The Iranian government was greatly affected by the virus, with about two dozen infected members of Parliament, as well as fifteen other current and previous political figures.
On March 14, 2020, Iran's President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to world leaders asking for help, saying that his country is having trouble fighting the outbreak due to lack of access to international markets as a result of the United States sanctions against Iran. The outbreak boosted the demand for the United States to adopt common social policies in other rich countries, such as universal health care, universal child care, paid family leave and higher levels of public health funding.
Political analysts anticipated that it could negatively affect Donald Trump's potential for re-election in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea worsened due to the pandemic.
South Korea criticized Japan's "ambigious and passive quarantine efforts" after Japan announced that anyone from South Korea would be quarantined for two weeks at government-designated sites.
South Korean society at first was polarized with regard to Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions to demand the removal of Moon for what they considered to be a mismanagement of the outbreak by the government, or to commend its response. The pandemic has allowed countries to pass emergency legislation in response.
Some commentators have expressed concern that it could allow governments to strengthen their control of power.
In Hungary, its Parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule indefinitely by decree, suspend Parliament and elections and sanction those who are believed to have spread false information about the virus and the management of the crisis by the government.
The outbreak of coronavirus was blamed for several cases of shortage of supplies, as a result of the increased worldwide use of equipment to combat outbreaks, panic-driven purchases and interruptions in logistics and factory operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about the shortage of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and supplier disruption.
Several localities also witnessed panic-driven purchases that left the shelves empty of essential products, such as food, toilet paper and bottled water, causing shortages of supplies.
The technology sector, in particular, has been warning about delays in the shipment of electronic products.
According to the Director-General of WHO, Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment increased 100 times.
This demand generated a price increase of up to twenty times the normal price and also caused delays of four to six months in the supply of medical supplies.
It also caused a shortage of personal protective equipment worldwide, and WHO warned that this would endanger health workers.
In Australia, the pandemic provided a new opportunity for daigou buyers to sell Australian products in China.
The activity has created a shortage of formula for babies in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the subsequent demand for food products, none of these areas was affected by the acute shortage of food.
China and Italy's measures against the accumulation and illicit trade in essential products have been successful, avoiding an acute food shortage that was anticipated in Europe and North America.
Northern Italy, with its large agricultural production, has not had a significant reduction, but prices could rise, according to representatives of the sector.
Food shelves were only temporarily empty, even in the city of Wuhan, while Chinese government officials released pork reserves to ensure sufficient food for the population.
Similar laws in Italy require food producers to maintain reserves for these emergencies.
The damage to the world economy was felt in China: according to a journalistic report of 16 March, China's economy was severely affected in the first two months of 2020 due to measures taken by the Government to stop the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell by 20,5 %.
Since mainland China is an important economic and manufacturing centre, the viral outbreak has been seen as a threat of considerable destabilization for the world economy.
Agathe Demarais of The Economist's Intelligence Unit has predicted that markets will remain volatile until a clearer picture of the potential consequences emerges.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic consequences of the epidemic on global growth could outweigh those of the SARS outbreak of 2002–2004.
An estimate by an expert at the University of Washington in San Luis indicated an impact of over $300 billion on the world's supply chains that could last up to two years.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is reported to have been "returned" after a sharp drop in oil prices due to China's lower demand.
On 24 February, global securities markets fell due to a significant increase in the number of cases of COVID-19 outside mainland China.
On February 27, due to growing concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, several U.S. stock indices, including the NASDAQ-100, the S&P 500 index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average published their most pronounced falls since 2008, the Dow dropped 1191 points, the biggest drop in a day since the 2007–08 financial crisis.
The three indices ended the week with decreases of more than 10%.
On 28 February, Scope Ratings GmbH claimed China's sovereign credit rating, but maintained a negative outlook.
The actions fell again on the basis of fears for the coronavirus, the biggest fall occurred on March 16.
Many believe that there is likely to be an economic recession.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the timely emergency measures of the states and central banks.
Central banks are reacting faster than they reacted to the 2008 financial collapse.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors due to travel bans, the closure of public places that include travel attractions and the recommendation of Governments not to travel anywhere in the world.
As a result, many airlines have cancelled flights due to lower demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, while the British regional airline Flybe collapsed.
The impact on the cruise industry reached a level never before seen.
Several railway stations and ferry terminals have also been closed.
The epidemic coincided with the Chunyun, an important travel season related to Chinese New Year's holidays.
Several events involving large crowds were cancelled by national and regional governments, including New Year's festivals, while private companies also independently closed their shops and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many events and tourist attractions of the Lunar New Year have been closed to avoid mass concentrations, including the Forbidden City of Beijing and the traditional temple fairs.
In 24 of China ' s 31 provinces, municipalities and regions, the authorities extended the New Year ' s holiday until 10 February and ordered most workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These regions account for 80% of GDP and 90% of the country's exports.
Hong Kong raised its level of response to infectious disease to the highest and declared an emergency, closed schools until March and cancelled its New Year celebrations. The retail sector was affected globally, with reductions in service schedules or temporary closures.
Visits to retailers in Europe and Latin America decreased by 40%.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East experienced a fall from 50 to 60%.
This also led to a 33% to 43% drop in pedestrian transit to shopping malls in March compared to February.
Trade centre operators around the world imposed additional measures, such as increased hygiene, installation of thermal scanners to control the temperature of buyers and cancellation of events. According to an estimate by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the pandemic-induced recession could leave between 14 and 22 million more people in extreme poverty in Latin America than would have been left without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the peak of the Wuhan epidemic, around 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of China's nearly 300 million migrant rural workers were stranded in their homes in inland provinces or trapped in Hubei Province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
The outbreak of coronavirus could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate can reach 32%, according to estimates by the Bank of the Federal Reserve of San Luis. The confinement in India has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (who receive daily wages) unemployed. According to the Angus Reid Institute survey, 44% of Canadian households experienced some kind of unemployment. Around 900,000 workers have lost their jobs in Spain since the beginning of the confinement in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a universal credit scheme. Almost half a million companies in Germany have implemented short-term schemes subsidized by the Government, known as Kurzarbeit, for their workers.
The German scheme of short-term employment compensation has been adopted by France and Great Britain.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors were deeply affected by the pandemic, which affected the operations of organizations and individuals, both employed and independent, around the world.
Culture and arts organizations sought to carry out their mission (often funded by public funds) to provide the community with access to cultural heritage, maintain the safety of its employees and the public, and support artists where possible.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, entertainment venues and other cultural institutions had closed indefinitely worldwide and their exhibitions, events and shows had been cancelled or postponed.
In response, great efforts were made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and increasing consequence of the disease is the cancellation of religious services. Important sporting events and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion shows.
The film industry also suffered interruptions. The Vatican announced the cancellation of the Holy Week celebrations in Rome, which take place during the last week of the Lent Christian penance season.
Many dioceses have recommended that older Christians stay in their homes instead of attending Mass on Sundays; some churches offered religious services through radio, live broadcasts on the Internet or television, while others offer spaces to pray from the car.
Following the decision of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome to close its churches and chapels and the empty St Peter's Square of Christian pilgrims, other religious organizations also cancelled their services and limited public concentrations in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.
The Ministry of Health of Iran announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak and then the shrines were closed, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims and their residents to the sacred places in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the most significant alteration in the world sporting calendar since World War II.
Most major sporting events were cancelled or postponed, including the UEFA Champions League 2019–20, the Premier League 2019-20, the UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019–20 NBA season and the 2019–20 NHL season.
The outbreak interrupted the plans for the 2020 Olympic Games, which were originally scheduled to begin in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event will be "rescheduled for a date after 2020 but not after the summer of 2021." Casinos and other gambling venues around the world closed and online poker tournaments were postponed or cancelled.
This caused many gamblers to resort to the Internet, many online betting sites reported significant increases in their new registration rates. The entertainment industry was also affected, several music groups suspended or cancelled concert tours.
Many large theaters, such as Broadway, also suspended all shows.
Some artists have explored ways to continue producing and sharing their work over the Internet as an alternative to traditional live shows, such as live broadcasts of concerts or the creation of "festivals" on the Internet for artists to interpret, distribute or publish their work.
Online, numerous memes of the Internet were disseminated on the coronavirus, as many resort to humor and distraction in the midst of uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia and racism towards people of Chinese and East Asian descent, and towards people in areas of Europe, the United States and other countries where the situation is critical.
Incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility have been observed in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
February reports (when most cases were still limited to China) have documented racist sentiments in various groups around the world expressing that the Chinese deserved the virus or that they were receiving what they considered a just reprisal.
Some countries in Africa have also seen an increase in anti-Chinese sentiments.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei have reported discrimination on the basis of their regional origin.
The Chinese and those in the areas affected by the virus have received support, both on and outside the Internet.
Following the advance of the outbreak to new countries where the situation is critical, the people of Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a serious outbreak of COVID-19, could also be subject to suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed petitions for a ban on Chinese entry into their countries in an effort to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan was trending on Twitter.
The Chinese, in addition to other Asian people in the United Kingdom and the United States, have reported higher levels of racist insults, as well as assaults.
The president of the United States, Donald Trump, was criticized for referring to the coronavirus as the "Chinese virus", a term that many critics considered racist and anti-Chinese.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses transporting Ukrainian and foreign evacuees from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from northeastern India, who share a border with China, and who study in major Indian cities, reportedly suffered harassment in connection with the coronavirus outbreak.
The president of the state unit of the Bharatiya Janata party in West Bengal, Dilip Ghosh, said that the Chinese had destroyed nature and "that is why God avenged them."
The Chinese consulate in Calcutta then condemned the comments and said they were "mistaken." In China, xenophobia and racism increased to non-Chinese residents as a result of the pandemic, and foreigners were described as "foreign garbage" and destined for "waste."
Many newspapers with paid walls removed them for parts or all of their coronavirus coverage.
Many scientific publishers published scientific articles related to the outbreak available with open access.
Some scientists chose to share their results quickly on preprint servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory tests for coronavirus 2019 respiratory disease (COVID-19) and the associated SARS-CoV-2 virus include methods that detect the presence of the virus and those that detect antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by the polymerase chain reaction test with reverse transcriptase, which detects the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is specific and is designed to detect only SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
The detection of antibodies (serology) can be used for both diagnostic and population surveillance.
Antibody tests show how many people have had the disease, including those who had symptoms too mild to report or who were asymptomatic.
Based on the results of this test, a precise mortality rate of the disease and the level of collective immunity in the population can be determined.
Due to limited testing, until March 2020, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population.
As at 23 March, no country had conducted tests on more than 3% of its population, and there are large variations in the number of tests carried out in the different countries.
This variability is also likely to significantly affect mortality rates for reported cases, which are likely to be highly overestimated in some countries.
Through the polymerase chain reaction with real-time reverse transcriptase (rRT-PCR), the test can be done in respiratory samples obtained through several methods, including nasopharyngeal hisopates or sputum samples.
The results are usually available within a few hours up to 2 days.
The polymerase chain reaction test with reverse transcriptase performed with pharyngeal hisopads is only reliable in the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus may disappear in the throat, but it continues to multiply in the lungs.
In infected people who are tested in the second week, as an alternative, the sample material can be obtained from the deep parts of the airways by suction catheter, or the material that is expelled to the cough (sputum) can be used.
One of the first polymerase chain reaction tests was conducted in Charité, Berlin, in January 2020, using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RTR-PCR), and formed the basis of the 250 000 kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
As of January 23, 2020, the UK had also developed a test. On January 28, 2020, South Korea's Kogenebiotech company developed a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on the chain reaction of clinical grade polymerase (PowerChek Coronavirus).
Search for the "E" gene shared by all beta-coronaviruses and the SARS-CoV-2 specific RdRp gene. In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to obtain emergency approval from the Chinese National Medical Administration of a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on polymerase chain reaction. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are distributing their polymerase chain reaction diagnostic panel with real-time reverse transcriptase for the new 2019 Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) to public health laboratories through the International Reagent Resource.
One in three genetic tests in the previous versions of the test kits generated unfinished results due to defective reagents, and a jam in testing at the CDC in Atlanta; as a result, on average, less than 100 samples were successfully processed per day throughout February 2020.
The reliability of the tests using two components was not determined until 28 February 2020, and only thereafter were State and local laboratories allowed to start testing.
The Food and Drug Administration approved the test under an emergency use authorization. US commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the availability at national level of evidence for VOCID-19 based on polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcriptase.
Similarly, as at 9 March 2020, Quest Diagnostics provided evidence for COVID-19 at the national level.
No limits on quantity were announced; the collection of specimens and processing should be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the CDCs.
In Russia, the test for the VOCID-19 was developed and produced by the State Research Center for Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Service for the Surveillance of Medical Care. On March 12, 2020, it was reported that Mayo Clinic had developed a test to detect the infection with VOCID-19. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that could be performed within 3.5 hours in large volume, allowing a machine to perform approximately 4128 tests over a 24-hour period.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA issued the emergency use authorization for Abbott Laboratories for a test in Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA had previously issued similar authorisations for Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received FDA emergency use authorization for a test that takes approximately 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test that uses isothermal amplification technology of nucleic acids instead of polymerase chain reaction.
As this does not require a series of alternative temperature cycles, this method can provide positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
Currently, there are about 18,000 of these machines in the United States and Abbott plans to increase production to perform 50,000 tests per day. In Taiwan, a test is being developed that uses a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the nucleocapside protein (N protein) of the new coronavirus, hoping it can deliver results within 15 to 20 minutes as well as a rapid influenza test.
In March 2020, the review of the publications concluded that "thorax X-rays have little diagnostic value in the early stages, while CT results [computed tomography] can be obtained even before the onset of symptoms."
Typical features in CT include bilateral multilobar opacities in exposed glass with peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution.
As the disease progresses, subpleural domain develops, pattern in stone and consolidation.
According to a study conducted in Wuhan, at the point of origin of the current pandemic, where polymerase chain reaction was compared with computed tomography, computed tomography is much more sensitive than polymerase chain reaction, although less specific, and many of the characteristics in the images coincide with the processes of other diseases and pneumonias.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has recommended "not to use computed tomography as a detection method or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19." Since March 2020, CDC has recommended polymerase chain reaction as an initial test.
Part of the immune system's reaction to infection is the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These can be used to detect infection in people approximately 7 days after the onset of symptoms, to determine immunity and to monitor the population. Analyses can be performed in central laboratories or by testing at the point of attention.
High-performance automated systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these analyses, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For analysis in central laboratories, a single specimen of peripheral blood is usually used, although serial specimens can be used to follow the immune response.
For tests at the point of attention, a single specimen of blood is usually obtained by a puncture to the skin.
Unlike polymerase chain reaction methods, no extraction step is required prior to analysis. On March 26, 2020, the FDA appointed 29 entities that provided notification to the agency as appropriate and can therefore now distribute their antibody tests.
As of April 7, 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA under an emergency use authorization. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics were approved by Europe for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The ability to perform tests is several hundred samples within hours and is therefore much faster than the conventional chain reaction test of viral RNA polymerase.
Antibodies can usually be detected 14 days after the onset of infection. In early April, the United Kingdom discovered that none of the antibody test kits it purchased were good enough to use them.
Hong Kong has created a program in which suspect patients can stay at their homes, "the emergency department gives the patient a specimen tube", the patient spits in the tube, sends it and gets a result shortly. The British NHS announced that it is implementing a pilot program to analyze suspected cases in their homes, eliminating the risk that the patient will infect others if he goes to the hospital or the need to disinfect an ambulance if used. In the tests at drive-through centers for the COVID-19 of suspected cases, a health professional takes the samples taking the proper precautions.
Drive-through centres have helped South Korea do some of the fastest and most extensive tests in any country. In Germany, the National Association of State Health Insurance Physicians said on March 2 that it had a capacity for approximately 12,000 tests per day in the outpatient environment and that 10,700 people had been tested the previous week.
Health insurance assumes the costs when the test is ordered by a doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a general capacity to do 160 000 tests per week.
As of March 19, tests were offered using the drive-through system in several large cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown, because only positive results were reported.
A first laboratory survey revealed that, by the natural week of 12/2020, at least 483,295 samples had been analyzed in total, up to and including the week of 12/2020, and 33,491 samples (6.9%) yielded positive results for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers from the Technion Institute and the Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method for analyzing samples of 64 patients simultaneously, consisting of grouping the samples and only making further analysis if the combined sample is positive. On February 5, 2020, in Wuhan, the BGI inaugurated an improvised emergency detection laboratory of 2000 square metres called "Huo-Yan" (Chinese: . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Fire Eye), which can process more than 10,000 samples per day.
With the construction, which was overseen by BGI founder Wang Jian, and which took 5 days, the model showed that the Hubei cases had been 47% higher and that the corresponding cost to cope with quarantine would have doubled without this ability to perform tests.
After the Wuhan laboratory, Huo-Yan laboratories were immediately built in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities in China.
As of March 4, 2020, total daily production was 50,000 tests per day. Open source multiplexed designs provided by origami analysis were implemented to evaluate up to 1122 samples of patients for VOCID19 using only 93 analyses. These balanced designs can be used in small laboratories without the need to use liquid handling robots.
By March, shortages and insufficient amounts of reagents affected mass testing in the European Union and the US.
This led some authors to explore sample preparation protocols that involve warming the samples to 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes for further testing. On March 31, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates was now doing more testing for coronavirus per person in its population than any other country, and was on its way to increasing the level of testing to cover the majority of the population.
This was achieved through the combination of drive-through capacity and the purchase of a mass production laboratory at the population level of Group 42 and BGI (which was based on its "Huo-Yan" emergency detection laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory has the capacity to perform tens of thousands of polymerase chain reaction tests with reverse transcriptase per day and is the first in the world of this magnitude to work outside China.
Different test formulas were developed that address different parts of the genetic profile of coronavirus in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted the German formula to manufacture kits that it sent to low-income countries that did not have the resources to develop their own kits.
The German formula was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was not available until 28 January, which delayed the evidence available in the United States. China and the United States had problems with the reliability of test kits at the beginning of the outbreak, and these countries and Australia were unable to provide sufficient kits to meet the demand and recommendations of health experts on the evidence.
On the contrary, experts say that South Korea's high availability of evidence helped reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
The Government of South Korea achieved its capacity for testing, mainly in private-sector laboratories, over several years.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization requested an increase in testing programmes as the best way to reduce the advance of the VOCID-19 pandemic. High demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus caused delays in hundreds of thousands of tests in private laboratories in the United States, and supplies of hysopads and chemical reagents were exhausted.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC had "defects"; the government then removed bureaucratic barriers that had prevented private testing. Spain bought test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but obtained inaccurate results.
The company explained that the incorrect results could be due to the incorrect collection of the samples or the incorrect use of the kits.
The Ministry of Spain said it would remove the kits that yielded incorrect results and replace them with a different test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits that the Czech Republic purchased from China yielded incorrect results. Slovakia bought 1.2 million kits from China that turned out to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested that they be thrown into the Danube. Ateş Kara, of the Turkish Ministry of Health, said that the test kits that Turkey purchased from China had a "high error rate" and did not "use them." The UK bought 3.5 million test kits from China, but, in early April 2020, announced that they were not serving.
The tests, complemented by the quarantine of those who obtained positive results and the identification of those with whom they had had contact who gave positive results in SARS-CoV-2, produced satisfactory results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vò, the place where the first death occurred by COVID-19 in Italy, carried out two rounds of tests in the entire population of about 3400 inhabitants, with about ten days of difference.
Approximately half of the people who achieved positive results had no symptoms, and all the cases detected were quarantined.
With the restriction of travel in the municipality, this completely eliminated the new infections.
With intensive tracing of contacts, restrictions on overseas travel, testing and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore advanced much slower than in other developed countries, but did not apply extreme restrictions, such as forced closure of restaurants and retail establishments.
Many events were cancelled, and on March 28 Singapore began to recommend to residents to stay at their homes, but schools reopened in time after the March 23 holiday.
Other countries have also controlled the pandemic with intensive tracing of contacts, restrictions on overseas travel, testing and quarantine, but with less stringent confinements, such as Iceland and South Korea.
According to a statistical study, countries that have conducted more tests, in relation to the number of deaths, have much lower mortality rates for cases, probably because these countries have more ability to detect people who have only mild symptoms or have no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have the capacity for testing and have national laboratories with limited experience in COVID-19 send their first five positive samples and their first ten negative samples for COVID-19 to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmatory testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the column "Positive as % of evidence" is influenced by the policy for conducting country tests.
A country that only carries out tests on persons entering hospitals will have a higher number of positive tests as % of tests than a country that carries out tests on all citizens, whether they show symptoms or not, the other issues are the same.
Handwashing, also known as hand hygiene, is the action of washing your hands in order to eliminate dirt, fat, microorganisms or other unwanted substances.
The constant washing of hands with soap in certain "critical moments" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, for example, diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted via faecal-oral.
People can also be infected with respiratory diseases, such as flu or common cold, for example, if you do not wash your hands before touching your eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
The five critical moments during the day when it is important to wash your hands with soap include: before and after defecation, after cleaning a child's tail or changing diapers, before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing a meal or handling raw meat, fish or poultry meat.
If water and soap are not available, the hands can be cleaned with ashes. The World Health Organization recommends washing your hands:
Before, during and after preparing meals.
Before and after caring for a sick person.
After changing diapers or cleaning a child who used the bathroom.
After you ring your nose, cough or sneeze.
After touching animals, animal feed or animal waste.
Medical hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Handwashing before taking medication or medical care can prevent or minimize the spread of diseases.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to remove from the hands pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that can cause a disease) and chemicals that can cause damage or disease.
This is especially important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Handwashing has many health benefits, including minimizing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
and reduce the infant mortality rate at home.
A study conducted in 2013 showed that improvements in hand washing practices can generate small improvements in the height growth of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory and diarrhoeal diseases can be reduced by introducing simple behavioural changes, such as washing your hands with soap.
This simple action can reduce the mortality rate for these diseases by almost 50%.
Interventions that encourage handwashing can reduce episodes of diarrhea by about a third, and this is similar to providing drinking water in low-income areas.
48 per cent of reductions in diarrhea episodes can be related to hand washing with soap. Hand washing with soap is the most effective and cost-effective way to prevent diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections, such as automatic behavior adopted in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, an important acute respiratory disease, is the leading cause of mortality in children under five years of age, and lives are claimed for an estimated 1.8 million children per year.
Diarrhoea and pneumonia together account for almost 3.5 million infant deaths per year.
According to UNICEF, turning handwashing with soap before eating and after using the bath into a deep-rooted habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, which would reduce deaths from diarrhoea to almost half and deaths from acute respiratory infections to a quarter.
Handwashing is usually integrated with other hygiene interventions as part of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programmes.
Handwashing also protects against impetigo, which is transmitted through direct physical contact.
A small harmful effect of hand washing is that its frequent realization can cause skin damage due to dryness of the skin.
According to a Danish study conducted in 2012, excessive hand washing can cause a skin condition that causes itching and makes the skin squamous known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is especially common in healthcare workers.
Too frequent handwashing is also considered to be one of the symptoms of compulsive obsessive disorder (COD).
There are five critical moments during the day when hand washing with soap is important to reduce the oral-fecal transmission of diseases: after using the bath (sweep, defecate), after cleaning a child's tail (change diapers), before feeding a child, before eating and before/after preparing a meal or handling raw meat, fish or poultry meat.
Other occasions where a proper handwashing technique is required to prevent disease transmission include before and after treating a cut or wound; after sneezing, coughing or blowing the nose; after touching animal waste or handling animals; and after touching garbage.
In many countries, there is a low hand washing rate with soap.
A study on handwashing in 54 countries conducted in 2015 concluded that, on average, 38.7% of families practiced handwashing with soap. A study conducted in 2014 indicated that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate at 97%; the United States was close to half at 77%; and China had the lowest rate at 23%. Currently, there are several methodologies for behavioural change, to increase the adoption of handwashing with soap at critical times. Group handwashing of children in school at certain times of the day is an option in developing countries to incorporate handwashing into children's behaviour.
The "Essential Health Care Programme" implemented by the Department of Education of the Philippines is an example of tailor-made action to promote children's health and education.
Disparate twice a year, in addition to washing your hands with soap every day, brushing your teeth daily with fluoride, are the basis of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of microorganisms from the skin improves by adding soaps or detergents to the water.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce barriers to solution and increase solubility.
Water alone is ineffective in cleaning the skin because fats and proteins, which are components of organic matter, are not easily dissolved in water.
However, a reasonable flow of water facilitates cleaning.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, may contain bacteria acquired in previous uses.
Some studies that analyzed the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap concluded that the transfer is unlikely, as bacteria are rinsed with foam.
Still, the CDC states that "liquid soap with dispensation controls that do not involve using hands is preferable."
Antibacterial soaps have been promoted intensively for a health conscious audience.
Currently, there is no evidence to show that the use of recommended disinfectants or antiseptics preserve antibiotic-resistant organisms by nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents, such as triclosan, which has an extensive list of strains of resistant organisms.
In this way, even if antibacterial soaps do not preserve antibiotic resistant strains, they may not be as effective as they are promoted.
In addition to the surfactant and skin-protecting agent, sophisticated formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as well as pH regulator, benzoic acid with antimicrobial activity and more skin conditioners (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, vegetable extracts).A thorough analysis by the University of Oregon School of Public Health indicated that common soaps are as effective as antibacterial soaps for the consumer containing triclosan to prevent diseases and eliminate bacteria from the hands.
The nice warm water to wash your hands is not enough to remove bacteria.
Bacteria grow much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, warm soapy water is more effective than cold soapy water to remove natural oils that retain soil and bacteria.
However, contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using lukewarm water has no effect on reducing microbial load in the hands.
A hand disinfectant or hand antiseptic is a water-free hand hygiene agent.
At the end of 1990 and in the first part of the 21st century, hand hygiene agents without water and with alcohol for rubbing (also known as alcohol-based hand solution for rubbing, hand antiseptic solution for rubbing or hand disinfectants) began to acquire popularity.
Most are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated with a thickening agent such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) in a gel, or a moisturizer such as glycerin in a liquid, or foam for easy use and to reduce the dryness effect of alcohol.
Adding diluted hydrogen peroxide further increases antimicrobial activity. Hand disinfectants containing at least 60-95% alcohol effectively eliminate germs.
Alcohol-based smear disinfectants remove bacteria, multidrug-resistant bacteria (SARM and ERV), tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol-based smear disinfectants containing 70% alcohol eliminate 99.97% (3.5 logarithms reduction, similar to 35 decibels reduction) of bacteria in the hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.99% (4-5 logarithms reduction) of bacteria in the hands 1 minute after application. Hand disinfectants are more effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based hand disinfectants are virtually ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) viruses, the most common cause of contagious gastroenteritis. Sufficient antiseptic or alcohol-based hand solution should be used to rub, such as to moisten or cover both hands completely.
The palm and back of both hands, between the fingers and the ends of all fingers, rub for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel dry.
Finger tips should also be washed well, rubbed in both palms. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States recommend hand washing before hand disinfectants to rub, especially when hands are visibly dirty.
The increase in the use of these agents is based on their ease of use and the rapid elimination activity of microorganisms; however, they should not be used as a replacement for proper hand washing unless water and soap are not available.
Frequent use of alcohol-based hand disinfectants may dry the skin, unless emollients or moisturizers are added to the skin's formula.
The dryness effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand disinfectants containing emollients caused significantly less skin irritation and dryness than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Contact allergic dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or alcohol hypersensitivity or additives present in alcohol-based hand solutions for rubbing are very rare.
The lower tendency to cause contact irritating dermatitis was attractive compared to hand washing with soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, water-free agents do not remove organic matter from their hands, but simply disinfect them.
For this reason, hand disinfectants are not as effective as water and soap to prevent the spread of many pathogens, as pathogens remain in their hands.
The effectiveness of non-alcoholic hand disinfectants depends to a large extent on the ingredients and the formula, moreover, historically, has been much less than that of alcohol and alcohol-based solutions for rubbing.
More recently, formulas using benzalconium chloride have been found to have persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, whose efficacy decreases after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin adverse reactions.
Many people in low-income communities cannot buy soap and instead use ashes or land.
Ashes or land can be more effective than water alone, but less effective than soap.
One concern is that if the soil or ashes are contaminated with microorganisms, this may increase the spread of disease rather than diminish it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant, since in contact with water it forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommended using ash or sand as an alternative to soap when soap is not available.
The correct hand washing technique recommended by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to prevent disease transmission includes the following steps:
Wet your hands with warm or cold running water.
Current water is recommended because containers with stagnant water may be contaminated, while water temperature appears to make no difference.
Rub your hands to form foam with a generous amount of soap, including the backs of your hands, between your fingers and under your nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies indicate that people usually wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap than when using water alone.
Squeeze for at least 20 seconds.
Restricting creates friction, which helps remove the germs from the skin, and restricting for longer periods eliminates more germs.
Rinse well with running water.
Rinse in a container can contaminate your hands again.
Dry with a clean towel or let the air dry.
Wet and wet hands become more easily contaminated again. The most frequently forgotten parts are the thumb, the wrist, the areas between the fingers and under the nails
Artificial nails and peeled nail polish can house microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotion is often recommended to prevent hand drying; dry skin can cause skin damage that may increase the risk of infection transmission.
Several economic options can be used to facilitate hand washing when running water and soap are not available, for example, pouring water from a hanging can or pumpkin with appropriate holes or using ash if needed in developing countries. In situations where there is limited water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to save water, such as "home taps" and other economic options.
A homemade faucet is a simple technology that consists of using a hanging jar of a rope and a lever driven with the foot to pour a small amount of water on the hands and a bar soap.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is some debate about the most effective way to dry in public baths.
More and more research indicates that paper towels are much more hygienic than electric hand dryers found in many bathrooms.
In 2008, the University of Westminster, London, conducted a study, sponsored by the European Tissue Symposium paper towels industry association, to compare the hygiene levels offered by the most modern paper towels, hot air hand dryers and air jet hand dryers.
After washing and drying your hands with the hot air dryer, it was found that the total amount of bacteria increased, on average, by 194 % in the fingertips and 254 % in the palms.
Drying with the air jet dryer resulted in an average increase in the total amount of bacteria by 42 % in the fingertips and 15 % in the palms.
After washing and drying their hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria decreased, on average, by 76% in the fingertips and 77% in the palms. Scientists also conducted tests to determine whether there was a possibility of cross-contamination of other bathroom users and the bathroom environment as a result of each type of drying method.
The air jet dryer, which blows air from the unit at speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), was able to blow the microorganisms from the hands and the unit and potentially contaminate other bathroom users and the bathroom environment at a distance of up to 2 meters.
The use of a hot air hand dryer spread the microorganisms up to 0.25 meters away from the dryer.
Paper towels did not show a significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt, different hand drying methods were evaluated.
The following changes in bacteria count were observed after hand drying:
There are many manufacturers of hand dryers, and hand dryers have been compared to drying with paper towels.
Washing your hands with hand disinfectant wipes is an alternative during trips, when you don't have water or soap.
The alcohol-based hand disinfectant must contain at least 60 % alcohol.
The washing of the hands of the doctors became mandatory long after the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) for the prevention of diseases in a hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital staff to wash their hands when they forget.
One study found a decrease in infection rates with its use.
The washing of the hands of the doctors is done for at least 15 seconds, with abundant amount of water and soap or gel to form foam and tighten all parts of the hands.
Hands should be squeezed together by intertwining fingers.
If there are remains under the nails, a brush of bristles can be used to remove them.
Since germs can remain in the water in the hands, it is important to rinse them well and dry them with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to close the water (and open any exit door if necessary).
This prevents the hands from re-contaminating on these surfaces.
The purpose of hand washing in the health care environment is to eliminate pathogenic microorganisms ("germs") and avoid transmitting them.
According to the New England Journal of Medicine, the lack of handwashing continues to exist at unacceptable levels in most medical settings, where many doctors and nurses usually forget to wash their hands before touching patients and thus transmit microorganisms.
A study showed that proper handwashing and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of catheter-related bloodstream infections by 66%. The World Health Organization has published a sheet demonstrating handwashing and standard hand rubbing in the health care sectors.
The preliminary version of the organization's hand hygiene guide can also be found on your website so that the public can comment.
Whitby and others carried out a relevant review.
Commercial devices can measure and verify hand hygiene if demonstration of regulatory compliance is required.
The World Health Organization has "Five moments" for hand washing:
after exposure to blood or body fluids
before aseptic work and
after taking care of patients. Addition of antiseptic chemicals in soap (soap soaps "medical" or "antibacterial") gives you the possibility to remove the hand washing agent.
This removal may be necessary before surgery or in environments where antibiotic resistant organisms are very common. To wash your hands before surgery, you need a tap that can be opened and closed without touching it with your hands, some chlorhexidine or iodine for washing, sterile towels to dry your hands after washing, a sterilized brush to scrub and another sterilized instrument to clean under your nails.
All jewels must be removed.
This procedure requires washing your hands and forearms to the elbow, generally, for 2 to 6 minutes.
It is not necessary to wash for a long time (10 minutes).
When rinsed, the water of the forearms should be prevented from returning to the hands.
After washing, the hands dry with a sterile cloth and a surgical gown is placed.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use a hand antiseptic before and after caring for sick people.
In order to control infections caused by staphylococcus in hospitals, it has been found that the greatest benefit of hand cleaning is in the first 20% of washing and that very little additional benefit is obtained when the frequency of hand hygiene increases more than 35%.
Common soap washing results in more than triple the incidence of bacterial infections transmitted to food compared to antibacterial soap washing. Comparing hand washing with an alcohol-based solution with hand washing with an antibacterial soap for an average time of 30 seconds in each case, it was observed that alcohol rubbing reduced bacterial contamination by 26% more than antibacterial soap.
However, water and soap are more effective at reducing AH1N1 influenza virus and difficult Clostridium hand spores than alcohol-based hand disinfectants. Interventions to improve hand hygiene in health care centers may include training staff on hand washing, increasing the availability of alcohol-based hand disinfectants and written and oral reminders to staff.
Further research is needed on which of these interventions are the most effective in the different health care environments.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is seen as an economic and fundamental tool for achieving good health and even good food.
However, the lack of a reliable supply of water, soap or hand-washing facilities in homes, schools and workplaces makes it a challenge to achieve universal hand-washing behaviour.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, there are very few faucets to wash your hands near public or private toilets, although there are economic options for building hand washing stations.
However, low hand washing rates may also be the result of deep-rooted habits and not lack of soap or water.
The promotion of handwashing with soap can influence political decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of handwashing and lead to long-term behavioural change in the population.
For this to work effectively, it is necessary to monitor and evaluate.
In a systematic review of 70 studies, it was observed that community-based approaches are effective in increasing handwashing in PRBMs, while social marketing campaigns are less effective. An example of promoting handwashing in schools is the UNICEF "Three Stars" approach, which encourages schools to take simple and cost-effective measures to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other hygiene requirements.
When the minimum standards are reached, schools can move from one to, finally, three stars.
The construction of hand-washing stations can be part of the hand-washing promotion campaigns that are being carried out to reduce illness and infant mortality.
The World Handwashing Day is another example of a awareness campaign that seeks to achieve a change in behavior. As a result of the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF promoted the creation of an emoji for handwashing.
Few studies have considered the overall cost-effectiveness of handwashing in developing countries in relation to avoided ADVs.
However, an analysis indicates that promoting hand washing with soap is considerably more effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of handwashing for human health, particularly for people in vulnerable circumstances, such as mothers who have just given birth or soldiers in hospitals, was recognized for the first time in the mid-20th century by two hand hygiene pioneers: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, English, the "founder of modern nursing".
At that time, most people still believed that infections were caused by unpleasant odors called miasmas.
In the 1980s, outbreaks of food-borne diseases and health-care-related infections led the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States to promote hand hygiene more actively as an important way to prevent the spread of infections.
The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 made many countries more aware of the importance of washing their hands with soap to protect themselves from these infectious diseases.
In Germany, for example, posters were hung with "right hand washing techniques" next to the washbasins of public bathrooms and the bathrooms of office buildings and airports.
The phrase "washing your hands" is a statement of not wanting to take care of something or share the complicity of something.
It originated in Matthew's Bible passage in which Pontius Pilate washed his hands at the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but it has become a much broader use phrase in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands compulsively in an attempt to clean up an imaginary stain, which represents her conscience of guilt about the crimes she had committed and which had induced her husband to commit.
It has also been found that after remembering or reflecting on non-ethical actions, people tend to wash their hands more often than others and tend to value more the elements for hand washing.
In addition, those who are allowed to wash their hands after such reflection are less likely to get involved in other compensatory "cleaning" actions, such as volunteering.
Religions recommend handwashing for hygienic and symbolic purposes. Symbolic handwashing, with water, but without soap, is part of the ritual handwashing in many religions, such as Baha'ism, Hinduism, Tevila and netilate Yadayim in Judaism, the washroom in Christianity and Wudu in Islam. Religions also recommend handwashing, particularly after certain actions.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam force their hands to wash after going to the bathroom.
And Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam force you to wash your hands before and after each meal.
Workplace Risk Controls at COVID-19
Risk controls at the workplace with COVID-19 relate to the application of occupational safety and hygiene methodologies in risk controls for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Appropriate workplace risk controls depend on the workplace and the job task and are based on a risk assessment of the sources of exposure, the severity of the disease in the community and the risk factors of workers who may be prone to contract COVID-19.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) of the United States, work at lower risk of exposure has minimal work contact with the public and co-workers, for which basic infection prevention measures are advised, including hand washing, the recommendation to workers to stay at home if they are ill, respiratory hygiene standards and the maintenance of a routine of cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Work at risk of medium exposure includes work requiring frequent or close contact with people who are not known or suspected to have COVID-19, but who may be infected by existing community transmission or international travel.
This includes workers who are in contact with the general public, such as in schools, working environments with a high concentration of people and some large retail environments.
Risk controls for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation with high-efficiency air filters, protective covers and personal protective equipment available in the event of a person with VOCID-19.
OSHA considers that workers in health care and funeral services, exposed to people who are known or suspected to have COVID-19, are at high risk of exposure, which increases to very high if they perform procedures that can generate aerosols in people who are known or suspected to have COVID-19 or take or manipulate samples of these people.
Risk controls appropriate for these workers include engineering controls, such as ventilation rooms with negative pressure, and personal protective equipment suitable for work.
The outbreaks of COVID-19 can have several consequences in the workplace.
Workers may be absent from work because they are ill, because they have to take care of others, or because of fear of possible exposure.
Trade patterns may change, both in terms of what goods are being claimed and in terms of the means of purchasing such goods (such as buying at hours other than peaks, by means of home delivery services or by car window).
Finally, shipments of items from geographical areas seriously affected by COVID-19 could be interrupted, and a plan of preparedness and response to infectious diseases can be used to guide preventive measures.
The plans address risk levels related to various workplaces and work activities, including sources of exposure, risk factors arising from home and community environments, and risk factors for individual workers, such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
They also describe the controls necessary to address these risks and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of outbreaks.
Infectious disease preparedness and response plans may be subject to national or regional recommendations.
The objectives of the response to an outbreak include reducing transmission among staff members, protecting people at greater risk of adverse health complications, maintaining business operations and minimizing adverse effects on other entities in their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community in which the company is located affects the measures taken.
The hierarchy of risk controls is a widely used occupational health and safety framework for classifying risk controls according to their effectiveness.
If the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative and, finally, personal protective equipment.
Engineering controls involve isolating employees from work-related hazards without using workers' behaviour and may be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative controls are changes in labour policies or procedures that require action by the worker or the employer.
Individual protective equipment is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but can help prevent some exposures.
All types of personal protective equipment should be selected according to the worker's hazard, placed as appropriate (e.g. respirators), used in an appropriate and systematic manner, frequently reviewed, maintained, replaced if necessary and disposed of, cleaned and stored or disposed of correctly to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA), jobs at lower risk of exposure have minimal work contact with the public and co-workers.
The basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include deep and frequent handwashing, the recommendation for workers to stay at home if they are ill, the respiratory hygiene standards that include coughing and sneezing, the provision of paper and containers for waste, the preparation for teleworking or staggered shifts if necessary, the deterrence of workers from using tools and equipment from others and the maintenance of a routine of cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
The immediate identification and isolation of people who may be infected is a fundamental measure to protect workers, customers, visitors and others in the workplace.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that employees who have symptoms of acute respiratory disease stay at home until they cease to have fever, fever signs and any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without taking medication to relieve symptoms or reduce fever; that sick leave policies be flexible and allow employees to stay at home to care for a sick family member, and that employees be aware of these policies.
According to OSHA, work at risk of medium exposure includes work requiring frequent or close contact at less than six feet (1.8 m) with people who are not known or suspected of having COVID-19, but who may have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to the community transmission of the time around the company's location, or because the person recently made an international trip to a place with widespread transmission of COVID-19.
These include workers who are in contact with the general public, such as in schools, work environments with a high concentration of people and some large retail environments. Engineering controls for this group and higher-risk groups include the installation of high-efficiency air filters, increased ventilation rates, the installation of physical barriers such as transparent plastic protective covers and the placement of a window for the care service so that the customer can order from the car. Administrative controls for this group and higher-risk groups include recommending sick workers to stay at home, replacing face-to-face meetings with virtual communications, setting up staggered shifts, suspending travel that is not essential to existing COVID-19 outbreaks, developing emergency communications plans that include a forum to respond to workers' concerns, providing training and up-to-date training to workers on risk factors and prevention behaviours in relation to COVID-19, training workers who are not required to use the industry and protection equipment on how to use the environment, providing for the use of the environment, for example, for example, for example, for example, for example, for example, for example, for example, for example, for workers, for example, for example, for example, for example, for example, for example, for example, for workers, for workers's use of work, for example, for the use in the use in the environment, for the environment, for the use, for the use, for the environment, for the use, for the use, for the use, for the use, for the use, the environment, for the environment, for, for, for, for the use, for the use, for the use, the use, the use, the use, the use, the environment, the use, the use, the use, the environment, the environment, the use, the use, the use, the use, the use, the use, the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the environment, the environment, the environment, the use of the use of the environment, the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use
Workers in this risk group should rarely use respirators.
If a person gets sick on a plane, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include separating the sick person from the others at a distance of 6 feet, appointing a crew member to care for the sick person and offering a mask to the sick person or asking him to cover his mouth and nose with paper tissues when he coughs or sneezes.
The cabin crew should wear disposable surgical gloves to care for a sick passenger or to touch body fluids or possibly contaminated surfaces and, perhaps, individual protective equipment if the sick passenger has fever, persistent cough or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items should be disposed of in a bag for hazardous biological waste and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected at a later stage. In the case of commercial navigation, such as cruises and other vessels carrying passengers, risk controls include postponing travel due to illness, self-insulation and immediately informing the medical centre on board if anyone has a fever or other symptoms while on board.
Ideally, medical screening should be done in the isolated person's cabin. In the case of schools and child care centres, the CDC recommends short-term closure to clean or disinfect if an infected person was in the school building, regardless of community transmission.
When community transmission is minimal or moderate, social distancing strategies can be implemented, such as cancelling excursions, assemblies and other mass gatherings, such as physical or choir education classes or meals in the dining room, increasing the space between desks, staggering check-in and check-out times, limiting non-essential visits, and using a separate place for the health room for children with flu-like symptoms.
When there is considerable transmission in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, it may be considered to extend the cancellation of classes. For police personnel who carry out routine daily activities, the CDC considers that the immediate risk to health is low.
Police officers are advised to contact individuals with a confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19 to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including the use of personal protective equipment.
If there is close contact during detention, workers must clean and disinfect their work belt and equipment with an aerosol or household cleaning wipes before using them again and follow the standard operating procedure for the containment and disposal of personal protective equipment and the containment and washing of clothing.
OSHA considers that certain health and morgue workers are in high or very high risk of exposure categories.
Among the high-risk work of exposure are those of delivery, support, laboratory and medical transport workers who are exposed to patients with confirmed diagnoses or suspicions of COVID-19.
These become very high-risk exposure jobs if workers perform aerosol generation procedures in patients with confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19 or if they take or manipulate samples from these patients.
Some aerosol-generation procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and examinations, or invasive sampling.
High-risk exposure morgue work includes those in which workers are involved in the preparation of corpses of persons who had COVID-19 or who were suspected of having it at the time of death; they become at a very high risk of exposure if they perform autopsies. Additional engineering controls for these risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with confirmed diagnosis or suspicions of COVID-19, even when they are subjected to aerosol generation procedures.
Specialized ventilation with negative pressure may be appropriate in some health care settings and morgues.
Samples should be handled with Biosafety Level 3 precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients entering should be separated into different waiting rooms depending on whether or not they are suspected of having COVID-19. In addition to other types of personal protective equipment, OSHA recommends the use of masks for those working at a distance of up to 6 feet from patients who have been infected or suspected of having been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and for those who perform aerosol generation procedures.
In the United States, N95 respirators with filter masks approved by NIOSH or higher should be used in the context of a written integral respiratory program that includes adjustment tests, trainings and medical examinations.
Other types of masks can provide greater protection and improve the worker's comfort. WHO does not recommend the use of protective monkeys, since COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, not one that is transmitted by body fluids.
WHO only recommends the use of a surgical mask for classification staff of incoming patients.
For those who take respiratory samples from patients with COVID-19, provide care or transport them without performing aerosol-generation procedures, WHO recommends the use of surgical masks, glasses or facial protectors, robes and gloves.
If an aerosol-generation procedure is performed, the surgical mask should be replaced by an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Because the provision of personal protective equipment is insufficient, WHO recommends minimizing the need to use it, replacing it with telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, limiting the entry permit to the room of a patient with COVID-19 only to those involved in their direct care, using the same mask without removing it while caring for several patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the supply chain of personal protective equipment and discouraging the use of masks by asymptomatic people.

This month, we are in unique circumstances.
The COVID-19 epidemic highlights our global human interconnection and the responsibilities we have with each other.
The challenges it presents have no precedents, but we know that our best response lies in the empathy, cooperation and global community building that form the core of this organization.
The camaraderie and concern we have seen among all our colleagues in emails, calls and conversations is a great validation of how amazing the people we are lucky to work with are.
I couldn't feel more gratitude and pride for all of you being my companions.
Last week, someone shared with me the appreciation I felt for our work.
They reminded me how important it is for the world to be able to go to Wikipedia at this time and the powerful symbol that is the fact that this critical resource remains online and available to all.
Your work makes this possible, whether by keeping the sites running, helping our colleagues get paid or keeping our communities safe.
The world needs the information Wikipedia provides, today more than ever.
This is a time when not only what we do but the way we do it will have a profound effect on the world.
Due to the importance of this mission and its role in it, starting next week, we will make some important adjustments to the way we work together.
Adjustments to our work and timetables
As Robyn mentioned earlier, Team C met last night to talk about our approach and schedule for the next few days and months.
In that conversation, we considered what we thought would be an appropriate response to what we are facing and what would be the best way to maintain the sustainability of the organization at this time.
To a greater extent, we wanted to eliminate stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to slow down, that's fine.
For all staff, contractors and contract workers:
our daily work expectations will be about 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week, until next notice.
We are not declaring a holiday; if you can work on a more normal schedule, this would be of great use to the mission.
However, the world is an unpredictable place today, and whether you have to take care of your loved ones, shop or go to the doctor, our priority is your well-being.
We're not keeping track of your hours.
If you're sick, don't work.
Although we shouldn't have to say it, we do.
You don't need to apply for sick leave or paid time off; just inform your manager and help your team review schedules and schedules to make sure the key areas of work are covered.
(If you receive a positive diagnosis of COVID-19, notify Bryan, T&C Operations, so that T&C can help with the support and make sure the management is aware of your situation).
People who work per hour will receive the full payment.
As we have said, we renew our commitment to our hourly contractors and staff.
Everyone will be paid on the basis of their normal hours worked under normal circumstances.
This also applies if you are sick and cannot work.
If you want to work, you have our support.
Many people use work as a way to channel their stress with the world around us.
What we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially in these times.
Again, it's about your personal care.
What we ask you to do is to communicate with your manager so that we know what to expect and we can adapt correctly.
Certain work is considered essential.
There are some things we should continue to do.
Site Reliability Engineering, Human Resources Operations, Trust and Security and Fund-raising teams, among others, are performing critical work that may require additional support.
We will begin a process with all departments to assess current objectives and change our approach in order to support what is essential to our mission.
There are enough tasks for all of us; the only difference is that we will all focus on the most essential projects.
Slowing down today won't hurt us tomorrow.
We don't plan to "duplicate the hours to catch up" when the pandemic is over.
It will not be expected to work overtime to meet deadlines that are no longer realistic.
We accept that circumstances have changed and will work to establish new goals and deadlines when appropriate.
What happens to the APP, or Annual Planning?
To adjust to our new reality and daily working hours expectations, we plan to adjust the schedule for the delivery of our 2020-2021 Annual Planning.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan that allocates more time to the budget so that employees can prioritize critical work, personal care and caring for loved ones as we adapt to the needs of those who need or want to work on a reduced schedule over the coming weeks.
This extension of our schedule greatly reduces the current planning loads and pressure throughout the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Council next week and we will communicate the next steps to delegates and teams as soon as we have a confirmation.
Thanks to the APP team for their leadership in this situation.
State, exhibition and cleaning of the office
Last week we learned that one of our colleagues at the San Francisco office might have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, as a precaution, we hired an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces of the San Francisco office.
They used an antiviral solution for hospital use to disinfect all surfaces, in addition to the reception and lifts that go to our floor.
The building has adopted its own duty of care protocol, using products that support the safety of its occupants.
We feel confident that the office will be well prepared for when we decide to return.
Our office in DC is located in a WeWork, which has shared its protocol for COVID-19 with us and all staff members in DC offices.
Since last week, our DC office has moved its operations to a completely remote environment in accordance with the guidelines shared with San Francisco.
As some of our New York City colleagues already know, we've also talked about renting a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions are still ongoing but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues work remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues who have worked remotely since before know that this modality requires adaptation, so they offer the following suggestions:
Limits the duration of meetings to a maximum of one or two hours.
If longer sessions are required, consider how to section them over several days.
Clearly define the meeting with a list of topics and send the reading materials in advance.
Adopt video usage by default, using tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaboration and live connection.
Designate a leader to moderate each meeting, a person who controls questions in the chat and list of speakers, and someone who helps take notes (or take notes collaboratively).
Send an email to technical support if you need comfortable headphones.
Use the wellness refund for snacks.
Join the #remoties channel in Slack to talk to your colleagues about the distributed work
RR. HH.'s Operations team is analyzing web-based ergonomics guidelines to support the increased work distributed throughout the Foundation.
This past week, we asked all beneficiaries of community grants to cancel public events funded by Wikimedia, such as publishing, until the WHO declared the end of the pandemic.
We informed them that we understood that our request for cancellations and other restrictions could make it impossible to meet their share of the activities agreed upon for the grant and that there would be no penalty for delaying or modifying those objectives.
Next week we will follow up with additional guidelines in Wikimania and other community and regional thematic conferences.
The general feeling of the community at the global level seems to be, in part, sadness over the interruption and, in part, relief for the clarity and ability to focus on their own communities, both Wikimedia and others.
From now on, CRT will be working to set up a page in Meta-Wiki to provide space for the community to monitor the impact and follow our communications with them.
Maintaining contact in relation to COVID-19 matters
We will send you an invitation through your calendars for next Thursday, 2:00 p.m., universal coordinated time/07:00 p.m., Pacific time, for a special staff meeting.
We will take this opportunity to share additional news, answer your questions and spend time connecting with each other.
We're together in this and we're available to help the way we can.
Meanwhile, you can continue to find the information from this email and any additional essential information related to COVID-19 on Office Wiki.
CRT will keep these pages updated and all information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with staff residing in countries that are being affected to a large extent today.
If you have any questions about travel, events, an important workflow, any coverage issues or anything you may need help with, feel free to notify CRT and work with them.
We are here to help provide support and function as a link when necessary.
If you have sensitive or confidential matters, send an e-mail to Bryan Judah, Director of Global International Operations at RR. HH.
None of these changes should be seen as abandoning our work and our obligations.
Instead, they are a recognition that, at this time, our work and our obligations are probably to be adapted in a way that had not happened before.
These are the measures we believe are necessary to support each other so that we can continue to work, give our movement the necessary support and provide the world with the service it trusts.
Our planned work will remain there for us when the time comes.
For now, it is time to support each other and make room for the important work that will come in the coming weeks and possibly in the coming months.
We need all of you to make this possible and, therefore, we need you to take care of yourselves and take care of your families so that you can find yourself in the best possible state when the need arises.
Now, please, wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S) and the rest of the Leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
The angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ACE2) is an enzyme that adheres to the outer surface (cellular membranes) of the cells of the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.
ECA2 counteracts the activity of the related angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and increasing angiotensin (1-7), which makes it a therapeutic target for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ECA2 also serves as a point of entry to cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is usually called hECA2.
The converting enzyme of angiotensin 2 is a zinc-containing metaloenzyme found on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
The ECA2 protein contains a N-terminal domain of peptidase M2 and a C-terminal domain of renal transporter of collectrine amino acids.
ECA2 is a type I unipass membrane protein, with its enzymatically active domain exposed to the surface of lung and other tissues cells.
The extracellular domain of ECA2 is split from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as shedase and, as a result, the soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and ultimately excreted into the urine.
ECA2 is present in most organs: ECA2 is mainly attached to the cellular membrane of the type II alveolar cells of the lungs, to the enterocytes of the small intestine, to the arterial and venous endothelial cells, and to the arterial cells of the smooth muscle of most organs.
The expression of mRNA of ACE2 is also found in the cerebral cortex, striated body, hypothalamus and brain stem.
The main function of ECA2 is to counteract ECA.
The ACE breaks the hormone of angiotensin I and forms angiotensin II, which is vasoconstrictor.
In turn, ECA2 decomposes the phenylalanine carboxyl-terminal amino acid of angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyses it to form the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ECA2 may also split several other peptides, including [des-Arg9]-bradikinin, appelin, neurotensin, dinorphin A and greline.
ECA2 also regulates the membrane traffic of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and has been associated with Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ECA2 serves as the main entry point for some coronaviruses, including HCOV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus causing SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus causing COVID-19).
More specifically, the binding of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 Spice protein S1 with the enzyme domain of ECA2 on the cell surface results in endocytosis and virus transfer along with the enzyme to the endosomes within the cells.
This entry process also requires the preparation of the S protein by the host's TMPRSS2 protease serum, the inhibition of which is currently being investigated as possible therapy. This has led to certain hypotheses that reducing the levels of ACE2 in cells could help fight infection.
However, several professional associations and regulators have recommended continuing standard ACE and BRA inhibitor therapy.
A systematic meta-analysis review published on 11 July 2012 found that "the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant reduction of 34% in the risk of pneumonia compared to control cases".
In addition, "the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients receiving treatment with ACE inhibitors and who had a higher risk of pneumonia, particularly those with stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were not as robust for the overall risk of pneumonia."
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhECA2) appears to be a new therapy for acute lung injury and appears to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The mean life of rhECA2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the onset of action is 30 minutes in addition to the 24 hour effect (duration).
Several findings suggest that rhECA2 may be a promising medicine for people with intolerance to classical renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or in diseases where circulating angiotensin II is elevated. Infusion of rhECA2 was evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
VOCID-19 applications are mobile device software applications designed to help track contacts in response to the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying people ("contacts") who may have been in contact with a infected person.
Various applications were developed or proposed with the official support of the government in some territories and jurisdictions.
Several frameworks have been developed for the creation of contact tracking applications.
Privacy concerns have been raised, in particular, with respect to systems that are based on tracking the geographical location of the users of the application.
There are other less invasive alternatives, such as using Bluetooth signals to record a user's proximity to other cell phones.
On April 10, 2020, Apple and Google jointly announced that they would integrate the functionality to admit such Bluetooth-based applications directly into their iOS and Android operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, together with Alipay, has implemented an application that allows citizens to verify whether they have been in contact with people who have COVID-19.
It is already in use in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore an application called TraceTogether is being used.
The application was developed by a local IT community, launched as an open source application and will be transferred to the government. In Northern Macedonia, "StopKorona!" was launched, a Bluetooth-based application to track exposure to potentially infected people and provide a quick response to health authorities.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communication and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was awaiting approval from Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On April 12, the government reported that the contact tracking application was at an advanced stage of development and would be available for implementation in the coming weeks. It is planned to use a similar application in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering applications based on the TraceTogether application and Singapore's BlueTrace protocol. Russia plans to introduce a geoperimeter application for patients living in Moscow who have been diagnosed with COVID-19, designed to ensure that they do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, Professor of Security Engineering at the University of Cambridge, presented a number of potential practical problems with application-based systems, including false positives and the possible lack of effectiveness if the adoption of the application is limited to only a small part of the population.
In response to concerns about the spread of misleading or harmful "coronavirus" applications, Apple limited the types of organizations that can add Coronavirus-related applications in its App Store to "official" or trusted organizations only.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates expressed concern about the consequences of mass surveillance through Coronavirus applications and, in particular, whether the infrastructure created to deal with the Coronavirus pandemic will be dismantled once the threat passes.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations submitted a communiqué demanding limits to this type of surveillance.
The organizations established eight conditions for government projects:
surveillance should be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
the extension of monitoring and monitoring would have to have sunset clauses;
the use of data should be limited to objectives related to COVID-19;
security and anonymity should be protected and there should be evidence of such protection;
digital surveillance should avoid exacerbating discrimination and marginalization;
any exchange of data with third parties should be defined by law;
Protections against abuse should be implemented and citizens' rights established to respond to such abuse;
the significant participation of all "relevant stakeholders", including public health experts and marginalized groups, will be mandatory. The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen, RSF) of Germany also published checklists.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to address the problem of persistent surveillance by removing the tracking mechanism from its operating systems when no longer needed.
In some countries, a network-based location tracking instead of applications was used, eliminating both the need to download an application and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking was approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data present significant potential privacy issues.
However, it is not necessary for all systems with central servers to have access to personal location data; several privacy protection systems have been created that use central servers only for intercommunication (see below).
In South Korea, a non-application-based system was used to track contacts.
Instead of using a specific application, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and credit card transaction data, and combined them to generate alerts through text messages for potentially infected people.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts, the government has also made location information available to the public, which is allowed due to far-reaching changes to information privacy laws following the outbreak of MERS in that country.
This information is available to the public through various applications and websites. Some countries, including Germany, considered using centralized and privacy protection systems.
As of 6 April 2020, the details have not yet been published.
The tracking of contacts with privacy protection is a well-established concept, with a large number of published investigations dating back at least to 2013. As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as the use of low-energy Bluetooth (BLE) to record a user's proximity to other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort that contains both centralized and decentralized approaches and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include decentralized proximity tracking to preserve privacy (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, formerly known as contact event numbers, CEN) and protocols and mechanisms for mobile contact tracking for privacy protection (PACT), among others.
In these protocols, personal identification data never leaves the device and all pairing occurs on the device.
The MIT Media Lab Privacy Group has been developing SafePaths, a platform for the use of privacy-protecting techniques when collecting and using location or route intersection data to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on the research of the technical report "Applications out of control: how to maintain personal privacy during an epidemic", published in March 2020. Another similar effort is the SafeTrace platform of Enigma MPC, a company that develops privacy technologies that was also originally founded at MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies that allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and officials, without compromising the privacy of such data.
On 5 April 2020, several groups united around what was essentially the same approach and with highly coincident protocols formed the Global TCN Coalition with the aim of reducing fragmentation and enabling global interoperability of tracking and alerting applications, a key aspect for achieving broad adoption.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had opened the BlueTrace protocol code used for its official government application.
On April 10, 2020, Apple and Google, the companies that control iOS and Android mobile platforms, announced an initiative for tracking contacts that they said would protect privacy, which is based on the combination of low-energy Bluetooth technology and privacy encryption.
They also published the specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is intended to be implemented in three stages:
implementation of tools for governments to create official coronavirus tracking applications that protect privacy
integration of this functionality directly into iOS and Android. Google and Apple plan to address adoption and persistent surveillance issues by first distributing the system through OS updates and then removing them in the same way once the threat has passed.
b'Reperfiliation (also known as repositioning or therapeutic change) is the re-adaptation of a drug approved for the treatment of a disease that is not the one for which it was originally developed.
This is in line with scientific research that is currently seeking to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other research lines include the development of a VOCID-19 vaccine and convalescent plasma transfusion. SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 chemomodulable proteins, each of which has multiple binding sites.
Analysis of these binding sites provides a reasonable basis for the project to develop an effective antiviral drug against the proteins of COVID-19.
Among the most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are papain-like protease, RNA polymerase directed by RNA, helicase, protein S, and ribofosphatase ADP.
Hussein A. A. et al. studied several compounds of medical interest that were then optimized and analyzed to identify the similarity of their main chain with the most similar approved drugs in order to accelerate the development of a potent drug against SARS-CoV-2 in their preclinical study and recommend it for the design of a clinical study.
Chloroquine is an antimalarial drug that is also used against some autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs to be studied in the clinical trial Solidarity.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that New York State trials with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin on March 24th. On March 28th, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate through an Emergency Use Authorization (U.S.).
Treatment has not been approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is authorized under a U.S. only as an experimental treatment for urgent use in patients who are hospitalized but cannot be treated in a clinical trial.
CDC said that "the use, dose or duration of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" is not yet established.
Doctors have said they use the drug when "there is no other option."
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Large studies are under way at Duke University and Oxford University.
The NYU's Langone Medical School is conducting a study on the safety and efficacy of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed to demonstrate that favipiravir was "clearly effective".
Thirty-five patients in Shenzhen reported negative on an average of 4 days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study in Wuhan in 240 patients with pneumonia, half received favipiravir, while the other half received umifenovir.
The Italian Medicines Agency reminded the public that the existing evidence supporting the drug is scarce and preliminary.
On 2 April, Germany announced that it would buy the drug from Japan for its reserves and that it would use the military to deliver the drug to university hospitals, where it would be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has made proposals to Trump's Administration on buying the drug. The drug can be less effective in serious cases of the disease if the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or women who are trying to conceive.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir antivirals concluded that "no benefits were observed".
The drugs were designed to inhibit HIV replication by joining the protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify the drugs to find a compound that joins the SARS-CoV-2 protease. In the scientific community, criticism has emerged about the allocation of resources to the rehabilitation of drugs specifically developed for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international trial Solidarity.
The remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections. Gilead Sciences later discovered that the remdesivir had antiviral activity in vitro against multiple phyloviruses, pneumoviruses, paramixoviruses and coronaviruses.
One problem with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can result in more serious disease and transmission.
Some early studies prior to the trials suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier against resistance. Several clinical trials are ongoing, including two conducted by hospitals at the University of Cleveland; one for people with a moderate disease and one for those with a more serious disease.
Three clinical trials of intravenous vitamin C for hospitalized and severely affected by COVID-19 are ongoing; two placebo-controlled (China, Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).
The state of New York began trials with azithromycin antibiotic on March 24, 2020.
The National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) in Japan is planning a clinical trial with Teijin's Alvesco (cyclosonide), an inhalable corticosteroid for asthma, as a treatment for asymptomatic patients infected with the new coronavirus.
A form of angiotensin 2 converting enzyme, a phase II trial is ongoing and 200 serious patients hospitalized in Denmark, Germany and Austria will be enrolled to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and pulmonary complications in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, called COLCORONA, is enrolling 6,000 adults aged 40 and older with a diagnosis of COVID-19 and mild symptoms that do not require hospitalization.
Pregnant women, who breastfeed or who do not have an affective contraceptive method are not eligible.
Several anticoagulants are being evaluated in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, so the Italian Medicines Agency published guidelines on its use.
On April 14, a multicenter study of 300 patients investigating the use of enoxaparin sodium in preventive and therapeutic doses was announced in Italy.
As SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, scientists are paying close attention to the rehabilitation of antiviral drugs developed for previous outbreaks of the SROM, SARG and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of Chinese guidelines
Umifenovir: Umifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of Chinese guidelines
These are some treatments that were identified for possible readaptations for the treatment of COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (blocks the IL-6 receptor): approved by China.
{NS}
b'A vaccine against COVID-19 is a hypothetical vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, there are many ongoing attempts to develop this vaccine.
By the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing the disease, in less than 18 months.
In April, five possible vaccines were in Phase I safety studies.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major outbreak spread around the world in 2020, triggering considerable investment and research activity to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop possible SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.
Established in April, the requirements of the CEPI initiative for the development of a vaccine are speed, manufacturing capacity, scale implementation and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were being researched and developed in early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Among the targets of the main platforms that went to Phase I security studies are the following:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (phase I developer and possible vaccine: Modern, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (phase I developer and possible vaccine: CanSino Biologics, type 5 adenovirus vector)
According to CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 potential vaccines are in the early stages of development, 78 of which are confirmed in active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute) and the other 37 are announced, but with little information available (presumed to be planned or developed).
A Phase I or II trial performs preliminary safety and immunogenicity tests, usually random, placebo-controlled and performed at several sites, while determining more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III trials usually involve more participants, including a control group, and evaluate the effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent the disease, while controlling the adverse effects that occur at the optimal dose.
Of the 79 vaccines in active development (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 were not yet being evaluated in humans (followed by the "preclinical" research).
Around 24 January 2020 in Australia, Queensland University announced that it was investigating the potential of a molecularly-subject vaccine that would genetically alter viral proteins to stimulate immune reaction.
Around January 24, 2020 in Canada, the University of Saskatchewan's International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) announced the start of work on a vaccine and hopes that human testing will begin in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were announced at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in China on 26 January 2020 and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
About January 29, 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that they had started developing a vaccine.
Janssen is co-developing an oral vaccine with his biotech associate, Vaxart.
On March 18, 2020, Emerging BioSolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart for vaccine development.
On February 8, 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a document with a design for a vaccine with similar technology as it is used in the treatment of neo-antigenic cancer vaccines.
On 25 March, the head of the research institute announced that the vaccine synthesis had been completed and that the tests were beginning.
On February 27, 2020, a subsidiary of Generex, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced that it was starting a project to create a li-key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
They wanted to produce a possible vaccine that could be tested in humans "within 90 days".
On March 5, 2020, the University of Washington in San Luis announced its projects to develop a vaccine.
On March 5, 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Material Command at Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research at Silver Spring, both in western Maryland, announced that they were working on a vaccine.
About March 10, 2020, Emerging Biosolutions announced that it had joined Novavax Inc.
in the development and manufacture of a vaccine.
Partners also announced plans for a clinical trial and a Phase I clinical trial by July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that it was working with 11 isolates and that, although moving fast, it would take at least a year and a half to two years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported the development of a coronavirus-like particle with partial funding from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
The possible vaccine is in the laboratory research stage and human testing is expected to begin in July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump had offered CureVac "'large amounts of money for exclusive access to a vaccine against COVID-19," to which the German government complained.
On March 17, 2020, U.S. pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced an association with German company BioNTech to jointly develop a mRNA-based vaccine.
The possible BNT162 mRNA vaccine is currently in preclinical trials and clinical trials are expected to begin in April 2020.
In Italy, on 17 March 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that it will have the results of preclinical tests in April 2020 and that human tests of the possible final vaccine could begin in the autumn.
In France, on March 19, 2020, the Coalition for Innovations in Epidemic Preparedness (CEPI) announced an investment of USD 4.9 million in a research alliance for a vaccine against COVID-19 that includes the Institut Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, bringing the total investment of CEPI for the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 to USD 29 million.
The other CEPI partners for the development of a VOCID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, Hong Kong University, Oxford University and Queensland University.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officers announced that scientists began testing animals for six possible vaccines.
Researchers at the Imperial College of London announced on March 20, 2020 that they were developing a self-replicating RNA vaccine against COVID-19.
The possible vaccine was developed within 14 days of receiving the Chinese sequence.
At the end of March, the Canadian government announced funding of CAD 275 million for 96 research projects on medical measures to counter COVID-19, including a large number of potential vaccines in Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medicago and University of Saskatchewan initiatives.
More or less at the same time, the Canadian government announced the use of CAD 192 million specifically to develop a vaccine against COVID-19, with plans to create a "national vaccine bank" with several new vaccines that could be used if another outbreak of coronavirus occurs.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh's Faculty of Medicine announced the tests of PittCoVac, a possible vaccine against COVID-19, in mice and said that "S1 SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccines administered by MNA obtained powerful responses from antigen-specific antibodies (in mice) that were evident two weeks after vaccination."
In Canada, on April 16, 2020, the Faculty of Pharmacy at the University of Waterloo announced the design of a possible DNA-based vaccine as a likely nasal sprayer.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be designated to replicate within the human bacteria and produce virus-like harmless particles that can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, industry and three U.S. universities gathered resources to access IBM's supercomputers, along with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have non-specific effects.
That means they can have benefits beyond the disease they prevent.
Another randomized trial in Australia seeks to register 4170 health workers.
Vaccines that are developing may not be safe or effective.
Initial research to assess the efficacy of vaccines with specific animal models of COVID-19, such as the transgenic mouse expressed by ECA2, other laboratory animals and non-human primates, demonstrates the need for level 3 biosecurity containment measures for the handling of live viruses and international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
SRAG and SROM vaccines have been tested in non-human animal models.
By 2020, there is no cure or vaccine that protects against SARA that has been proven to be safe and effective in humans.
According to research publications from 2005 to 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medicines to treat SRAG was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. Nor is there a confirmed vaccine against SROM.
When the SROM became widespread, it was believed that existing research on SARG could be a useful template for developing vaccines and treatments against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, one vaccine against SROM (based on DNA) completed phase I clinical trials in humans, another three were ongoing, all of which are viral vector vaccines, two of adenoviric vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one of MVA vectors (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media publications promoted a conspiracy theory that the virus causing COVID-19 was known and already had a vaccine.
Patents cited by various social media publications refer to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other coronavirus strains, such as the coronavirus of the SRAG.
b'Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Other symptoms include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea, sore throat, loss of smell and abdominal pain.
The time between exposure and onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but may vary between two and fourteen days.
While most cases result in mild symptoms, some progress to viral pneumonia and multi-organic failure.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases were reported in 210 countries and territories, with more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered. The virus spreads mainly among people during close contact, usually through droplets that occur when coughing, sneezing or speaking.
While these droplets are produced by exhaling, they usually fall to the floor or on surfaces, rather than being contagious in long distances.
People can also get infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive on the surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is more contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although propagation is also possible before symptoms appear and in late stages of the disease. The standard method for diagnosis is the polymerase chain reaction with inverse real-time transcription (rRT-PCR) of a nasopharyngeal hisopate.
The use of masks is recommended for those who suspect that they have the virus and its caregivers.
Recommendations on the use of masks for the general public vary. Some authorities recommend that they not be used, others recommend that they be used, while others require their use.
Currently, there is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment against COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries in the six WHO regions.
Those infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or have flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty walking and face or bluish lips. If these symptoms occur, it is recommended to seek medical attention immediately.
It is less common to observe symptoms in the upper respiratory tract, such as sneezing, nasal dripping and sore throat.
Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, have been identified in varying percentages.
Some cases in China initially presented chest oppression and palpitations.
In some, the disease progressed to pneumonia, multi-organic failure, and death.
This is called an incubation period.
The incubation period of VOCID-19 is usually five to six days, but may vary from two to fourteen days.
97.5% of people who have symptoms do so within 11.5 days of infection. Not all infected people are reported to have symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers is not yet fully known; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they can contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of people infected with no symptoms is currently unknown and is being studied. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of Korea (KCDC) reported that 20% of confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during hospitalization.
The National Health Commission of China began to include asymptomatic cases in daily cases on 1 April. Of the 166 infections on that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of the test.
Both sputum and saliva can have large viral loads.
Speaking out loud releases more droplets than when speaking with a normal volume.
A study in Singapore found that not covering your mouth while coughing can cause droplets to travel 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not usually airborne, the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that transmission by biological aerosols is possible and explained that air collectors in the hallway outside people's bedrooms gave positive viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), may cause aerosolation of respiratory secretions and, consequently, air transmission.
While there are concerns about the possibility that it may spread through stools, the risk is thought to be low. The virus is more contagious when people have symptoms; although the spread is possible before the onset of symptoms, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) explains that, although it is not entirely clear how easily it spreads, a person usually infects two or three more. The virus survives hours or days on the surfaces.
Specifically, the virus was detected for one day in cardboard, up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours in products with 99 % copper.
However, this varies according to humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergent are also effective if used in the right way. Soap products degrade the protective lipid layer of the virus and deactivate it, as well as remove it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorohexidine glucanate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective. In a Hong Kong study, saliva samples were taken in an average of two days after the start of hospitalization.
In five of six patients, the first sample had the highest viral load. In the case of the sixth patient, the highest viral load was observed on the second day of the test.
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coron virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new severe acute respiratory syndrome coron virus, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to a group of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in coronaviruses of a related nature.
Outside the human body, domestic soap kills the virus, as its protective bubble bursts. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
Lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19, because the virus enters host cells by means of the angiotensin I converting enzyme type 2 (ECA2), which abounds more in the type II alveolar cells of the lungs.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called "spike" (peplomer) to connect with ECA2 and enter the host cell.
In 12% of infected people hospitalized in Wuhan, China, an acute heart injury was identified, which is more common in severe disease.
Cardiovascular symptom rates are high, due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression, but acute myocardial injury may be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
The ACE2 receptors have a high expression in the heart and participate in its functioning.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was detected in ICU patients with COVID-19 virus infections and may be related to a poor prognosis. In autopsies of people who died from COVID-19, diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and inflammatory infiltrates with lymphocytes were detected in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has tropism for epithelial cells expressing ACE2 of the airways, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, it was observed that the secretory T lymphocytes of GM-CSF pathogens correlate with the recruitment of secretory IL-6 monocytes and a severe pulmonary pathology in patients with COVID-19.
Lymphocytic infiltrates were also reported in autopsies.
WHO has published several test protocols to detect the disease.
The standard test method is the polymerase chain reaction with real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually done in samples of the airways obtained by a nasopharyngeal hysopate; however, nasal or sputum hysopate samples may also be used.
The results are usually available within a few hours or two days.
Blood tests may also be used, but two blood samples should be taken two weeks apart and the results have very little immediate value.
Chinese scientists managed to isolate the crown virus strain and published the genetic sequence so that the world's laboratories could independently develop polymerase chain reaction tests (PCR) to detect virus infection.
As of April 4, 2020, antibody tests (which can detect active infections and if the person was infected in the past) were being developed, but were not widely used.
Experience in China with the tests has shown that the accuracy is only 60 to 70 %.
The FDA in the United States approved the first immediate diagnostic test on March 21, 2020 for use at the end of that month. The diagnostic guidelines published by the Zhongnan Hospital at Wuhan University suggested methods for detecting infections based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
Bilateral multilobular emerilated glass opacities with peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution are common in the early stages of infection.
As the disease progresses, subpleural domain, disordered stone pattern (lobulillary septal thickening with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation may appear.
Few data are available on microscopic lesions and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological results of the autopsy are as follows:
Macroscopy: pleuritis, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary oedema
Four types of viral pneumonia severity can be observed:
mild pneumonia: pulmonary oedema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, atypically large pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration and formation of giant cells with multiple nuclei
severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudates.
DAD is a cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
pneumonia in healing: organization of exudates in alveolar cavities and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
Blood: disseminated intravascular coagulation (IDC); leukoerithroblast reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include staying at home, avoiding places with many people, washing your hands with soap and water often for at least 20 seconds, having good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth without washing your hands.
The CDC recommends that the mouth and nose be covered with a tissue when coughing or sneezing and, in case of no tissue, use the inside of the elbow.
Appropriate hand hygiene is recommended after coughing or sneezing.
The CDC has recommended the use of fabric covers in public places, one of the reasons is to limit the transmission by asymptomatic people. Social distance strategies seek to reduce the contact of infected people with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and canceling mass public meetings.
Distance patterns also indicate that people must maintain a distance of 6 feet (1.8 m).
There is no effective medicine to prevent COVID-19. As there is not expected to be a vaccine until 2021, as soon as, a key part to control COVID-19 is to try to prevent the epidemic peak, which is known as "flatten the curve".
CDCs also recommend washing your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, particularly after going to the bathroom or when your hands are visibly dirty, before eating and after ringing your nose, coughing or sneezing.
They also recommend the use of an alcohol-based hand disinfectant that has a minimum of 60% alcohol, but only when there is no water and soap available in a timely manner. For areas where hand disinfectants are not easy to obtain, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In these formulations, antimicrobial activity results from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; "it is not an active substance for hand antisepsis".
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
Patients are given supportive care, which may include rehydration, oxygen therapy and treatment for other vital organs affected.
CDC recommends that those suspected of having the virus wear a simple mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (OMEC) has been used to address the problem of respiratory failure, but the benefits are still being analyzed.
To improve immunity, personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet have been recommended.
Supportive treatments can be useful for those with mild symptoms at the initial stage of infection. WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations for the care of people hospitalized with VOCID-19.
Intensivists and pneumologists in the U.S. compiled the recommendations of several agencies into a free resource, the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For the initial treatment of symptoms, some medical professionals recommend paretamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen.
Precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in health care settings when performing procedures that can generate aerosols, such as intubation or manual ventilation.
The CDC recommends that health care professionals take care of people with VOCID-19 placing the patient in an air infection isolation zone (AIIR), in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions and precautions to avoid air transmission. The CDC highlights the guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
The recommended equipment are PPE coat, mask, protective glasses and medical gloves. When available, respirators (instead of masks) are preferred.
The N95 masks are approved for industrial environments, but the FDA authorized their use by means of an Urgent Use Authorization (U.S.).
They are designed to protect against particles that are in the air, such as dust, but they are not guaranteed effectiveness against a specific biological agent that is not stipulated in the product indications.
Where no masks are available, the CDC recommends the use of protective masks or, as a last resort, home masks.
Most cases of VOCID-19 are not serious enough to require mechanical ventilation or alternative ventilation, but a percentage of cases are.
This type of respiratory support is being actively studied for hospitalized people with COVIDA-19-related respiratory failure and there is already some evidence that intubation can be avoided with a high flow nasal cannula or positive bipressure in the airways.
It is not yet known whether either of these two provide the same benefit to people in critical condition.
Some doctors prefer to use invasive mechanical ventilation when it is available because this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to high flow nasal cannula. Serious cases occur mainly in adults older than 60 years of age and, in particular, older than 80 years of age.
Many developed countries do not have enough beds per head in hospitals, which limits the ability of the health system to deal with the sudden increase in serious cases of COVID-19 requiring hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5% was admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support and 1.4% died.
In China, approximately 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 are finally transferred to the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex when a patient with COVID-19 has acute respiratory distress syndrome (ACRD) and oxygenation is increasingly difficult.
Respirators with different pressure control modes and PPTE are needed to maximize oxygen supply, while minimizing the risk of lung injury associated with the respirator and pneumothorax.
Older respirators may not have high HIPC.
Research on possible treatments began in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
The remorse seems to be the most promising.
Although the development of new drugs may take some time until 2021, several drugs that are being tested are already approved for other uses or are in advanced testing.
Antiviral medicines can be tested in people with severe illness.
The WHO recommends that volunteers participate in trials of the efficacy and safety of possible treatments. The FDA granted temporary authorization to convalescent plasma as an experimental treatment in cases where the person's life is at serious and immediate risk.
It has not been subjected to the necessary clinical studies to demonstrate whether it is safe and effective for a disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application to deal with the outbreak of the disease.
Users must enter their name and identification number.
The application can detect "close contact" and therefore a potential risk of infection through surveillance data.
Each user can also control the status of three other users.
If a possible risk is detected, the application not only recommends self-containing, but also alerts local health officers. Analysis of the macrodata of cell phone information, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are used to track infected people and those they were in contact with in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli Government allowed security agencies to track mobile phone data of persons suspected of having coronaviruses.
The measure was taken to strengthen quarantine and protect those who may come into contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared the summary data of the location of the telephones with the German federal government agency, Robert Koch Institute, in order to investigate and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia implemented facial recognition technology to detect quarantine violations.
Regional health commissioner Giulio Gallera said mobile operators have told him that "anyhow, 40% of people are still moving."
The German Government carried out a 48-hour weekend hack with more than 42,000 participants.
In addition, the President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a worldwide demand for creative solutions against the spread of coronavirus.
People may be distressed by quarantine, travel restrictions and side effects of treatment or fear the infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor: "The growing social isolation, loneliness, anxiety about health, stress and economic problems are a perfect storm for people's mental health and well-being."
The disease can follow a mild evolution with few or no symptoms, so it will look like other diseases of the upper respiratory tract, such as common cold.
Mild cases usually recover within two weeks, while serious or critical cases may take three to six weeks to recover.
Pregnant women may run the risk of getting a serious infection with the VOCID-19 virus, according to data from other similar viruses, such as the SRAG virus and the SROM, but the VOCID-19 data are insufficient. In some people, VOCID-19 can affect the lungs and cause pneumonia.
In the most severe cases, COVID-19 can progress rapidly to the respiratory distress syndrome water (SDRA), which causes respiratory failure, septic shock and multi-organic failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, coagulation disorder, and cardiac, renal and hepatic damage.
Coagulation disorder, specifically the increase in protombin time, has been reported in 6% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19, while renal function disorder is observed in 4% of this group.
Approximately 20 to 30% of people with CODIV-19 have elevated liver enzymes (aminotransferases).
According to the same report, the average time between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, with five days of hospitalization.
However, for patients transferred to ICU, an average of seven days elapsed between hospitalization and death.
In a study of incipient cases, the mean time from the manifestation of the first symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full interval of 6 to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China, the mortality rate among males was 2.8% and among females was 1.7%.
Histopathological examinations of postmortem samples of the lungs show diffuse alveolar damage with exudated cell fibromyxoids in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes in pneumocytes were observed.
The image of the lungs resembled acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the Chinese National Health Commission, cardiac damage resulted from high levels of troponin or cardiac arrest.
According to the US March data, 89% of hospitalized people had a pre-existing condition. The availability of medical resources and socio-economic aspects of a region can also affect mortality.
Estimates of mortality from the condition vary due to these regional differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
Inadequate counting of mild cases may overestimate the mortality rate.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of cases contracted in the past may indicate that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to experience severe symptoms of COVID-19 and approximately 2.4 times more likely to need intensive care or die than non-smokers. Long-term sequelae of this disease are of concern.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a 20 to 30% decrease in lung capacity in some people who recovered from the disease, and lung images suggest organ damage.
This can also cause the syndrome after intensive care after recovery.
As of March 2020, it was not known whether previous infections generated effective long-term immunity for people who recovered from the disease.
It seems that immunity is possible, based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but recovered cases of COVID-19 have been reported which subsequently gave positive in coronaviruses.
These cases are believed to be a worsening of a persistent infection and not a reinfection.
It is considered that this virus is natural and of animal origin, through an interspecific infection.
The actual origin is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of the infection was almost entirely due to human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, noted as the first date of onset of symptoms as of December 1, 2019.
Official WHO publications reported that the first manifestation of symptoms was on December 8, 2019.
In general, several measures are taken to quantify mortality.
These figures vary by region and time, in addition to being affected by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, treatment options, the time since the initial outbreak and the characteristics of the population, such as age, sex and general health.
At the end of 2019, WHO assigned emergency CIE-10 disease codes U07.1 to deaths with laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 to deaths with a clinical or epidemiological diagnosis of COVID-19 without laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The mortality rate reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed in a given time interval.
Based on statistics from Johns Hopkins University, the overall mortality rate is 6.9% (153 822/2 240 191) as at 17 April 2020.
Other measures include the rate of death in diagnosed patients (CFR), which reflects the percentage of people diagnosed who die from a disease, and the rate of death in infected people, which reflects the percentage of people infected (with or without a diagnosis) who die from a disease.
These statistics do not depend on time and follow a specific population from infection to case resolution.
While not all infected people produce antibodies, their presence may provide information on how many people have been infected.
In the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small villa of 4600 inhabitants, 80 (1.7 %) already died.
In Gangelt, the disease spread during carnival festivals and affected the youngest, resulting in a relatively low mortality rate, and not all COVID-19 deaths may have been classified as such.
Moreover, the German health system has not been overtaken.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population have antibodies, as determined by blood donors.
It has been confirmed that 69 (0.004% of the population) died from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and the mortality rate are different for men and women.
Mortality is higher among males in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The greatest risk for men is for those in their 50s, and the gap between men and women is narrowed to only 90 years.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 in males and 1.7 in females.
The exact reasons for this difference by sex are not known, but could be due to genetic and behavioral factors.
Immune differences based on sex, the lower number of women smoking, and the fact that males have comorbid conditions, such as hypertension, at an earlier age could have contributed to the higher mortality rate in males.
In Europe, 57% of infected people were males and 72% of those killed by COVID-19 were males.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government does not track information on sex in infections with the COVID-19 virus.
Research shows that viral diseases, such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS, affect males and females differently.
A higher percentage of health workers, particularly nursing staff, are women, and are more likely to be exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of the disease would be "COVID-19".
WHO Chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO refers to crown, VI to virus, D to disease and 19 to the date the outbreak was discovered: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (e.g., China), animal species or group of people, in line with international recommendations under name to prevent stigmatization. The virus causing the COVID-19 is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
In addition, WHO uses "COVID-19 virus" and "COVID-19 virus" in public communications.
It is common to use "coronavirus" to refer to both the disease and the virus.
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, it was common to refer to the virus and disease as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan's coronavirus".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCov and water respiratory disease for 2019-nCoV as temporary names for the virus and disease, in accordance with the 2015 indication not to use locations in the name of viruses and diseases.
Official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued on 11 February 2020.
Due to capacity constraints in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing health material, such as nasal swabs and parts of respirators.
For example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed the valve of a respirator and the supplier could not deliver it in the required time, a local emerging company carried out reverse engineering and printed the 100 valves needed during the night.
Following the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, false information and misinformation about the origin, scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease emerged and spread rapidly over the Internet.
It seems that humans can transmit the virus to some other animals.
The study found no evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks or chickens.
There are no approved medicines or vaccines to treat the disease.
Government organizations, academic groups and researchers in the sector are carrying out international research on vaccines and medicines for COVID-19.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the "SOLIDARITY Test" to assess the therapeutic effects of the four most promising antiviral compounds in terms of efficacy.
There is no vaccine, but several agencies are actively developing possible vaccines.
The previous work on SARS-CoV is being used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the receptor ECA2 to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are being investigated.
First, researchers seek to develop a complete virus vaccine.
The use of this virus, whether inactive or dead, aims to generate a rapid immune response from the human body to a new infection by the VOCID-19 virus.
A second strategy, subunit vaccines, seeks to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this research focuses on the S protein that helps the virus get into the receptor ECA2.
A third strategy is nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new technique to create vaccines).
Experimental vaccines of any of these strategies should be studied to determine their safety and effectiveness. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a four-volunteer vaccine began in Seattle.
The vaccine contains an innocuous copy of the genetic code of the virus that causes the disease. It has been suggested that antibody-based improvement is a potential challenge for the development of SARS-COV-2 vaccines, but this is controversial.
As of April 2020, there are more than 300 active clinical trials.
Seven trials evaluated treatments already approved for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Re-adapted antiviral drugs constitute most of China's research, including nine Phase III trials on remdesivir in several countries, which are due to be submitted by the end of April.
In April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical developments on the vaccine and potential drugs against COVID-19 was under way. Several antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 were evaluated, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with interferon-beta.
As of March 2020, there is tentative evidence on the effectiveness of remdesivir.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with the compassionate use of remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the US, China and Italy. Chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020. The results obtained were preliminary.
However, there are requests for peer reviews for the investigation.
The health authorities of Korea and China recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, although the Wuhan Institute of Virology recommends a daily dose of one gram, it points out that twice that dose is very dangerous and could be lethal.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorisation for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of physicians treating patients with COVID-19. The seventh edition of the Chinese guidelines also includes the use of interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are needed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Further in vivo studies of nitazoxanide have been recommended after determining that low concentrations inhibit SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that the initial cebate of the S protein made by transmembrane serine-protease type 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 by interaction with the receptor ECA2.
Studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have important limitations that prevent the medical community from adopting these treatments without further studies. oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and does not have a known role in the treatment of VOCID-19.
The release of cytokines may be a complication of the last stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have properties that prevent the release of cytokines. The Chinese National Health Commission included tocilizumab in treatment guidelines after completion of a small study.
It is in a national non-randomized phase II test in Italy after observing positive results in people with severe disease.
It is expected that, in combination with a serum ferritin blood test to identify cytokine releases, these effects, which are believed to be the cause of death of some infected people, will be countered.
The FDA approved the interleukin-6 receptor antagonist based on past cases for the treatment of steroid-resistant cytokine release syndrome induced by another cause, the treatment of T-CAR T lymphocytes, in 2017.
To date, there is no unrandomized controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
The transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system from those who have recovered from COVID-19 to people who need them as a passive immunisation method without vaccines is being investigated.
This strategy was tested with the SRAG with inconclusive results.
Viral neutralisation is the expected mechanism of action by which passive treatment with antibodies can defend against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms are possible, such as antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity or phagocytosis.
Other forms of passive treatment with antibodies are being developed, for example, using manufactured monoclonal antibodies.
The production of convalescent serum, which consists of the liquid part of the blood of recovered patients and contains specific antibodies against this virus, could be increased to achieve a faster distribution.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, who later died from COVID-19 after raising awareness about the spread of the virus.
