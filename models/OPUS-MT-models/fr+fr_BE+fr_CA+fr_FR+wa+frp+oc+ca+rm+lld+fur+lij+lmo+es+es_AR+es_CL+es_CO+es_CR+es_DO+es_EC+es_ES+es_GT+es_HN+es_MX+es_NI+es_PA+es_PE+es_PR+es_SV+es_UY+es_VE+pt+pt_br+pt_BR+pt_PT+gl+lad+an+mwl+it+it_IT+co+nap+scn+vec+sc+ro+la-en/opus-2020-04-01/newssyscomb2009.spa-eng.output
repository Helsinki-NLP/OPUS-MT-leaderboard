A triumph of the populist right in Austria, together form 29 %
Early elections to the Austrian parliament have brought about the first approximate results, a significant weakening of both parties of the current great coalition and an expressive strengthening of the populist right party.
Strong and special losses have been suffered by the Austrian People's Party (OVP), where the position of the current president, Wilhelm Molterer, is seriously shaken.
On the contrary, the leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZO), the head of the government of the state of Carinthia, Jörg Haider, prepares his triumphal return to national politics.
According to the approximate results, the Social Democracy (SPÖ) remains the strongest party in the country with 29.8 percent votes, thus losing a 5.5 percent vote compared to the last elections in 2006.
Worse still has finished the OVP that loses 25.6 percent, almost nine percent votes.
These are the worst results, literally catastrophic, in the history of these two great Austrian parties since the post-war period and especially for the people who called these early elections.
Even in early July, when the OVP came out of the coalition, the popular had a considerable advantage in terms of preference for the SPO.
It is clear, however, that voters punished them for letting the government sink.
Already in the first reactions to the results speculations were heard about the resignation of the party president and, to this day, vice-chancellor, Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that it could be achieved this Monday at the exceptional meeting of the party presidency.
Such an evolution would obviously facilitate the path of the constant and more approximate starting point of the electoral results, that is, of the renewal of the great coalition between SPO and OVP.
In view of the fact that the reinforcement of both parties on the populist right - the Liberals (FPO) have won approximately 18 percent and the BZO, 11 percent of the votes - and that the Social Democrats at the same time expressed their fears that the same thing would happen again in 1999 when the popular people negotiated with the populists (then FPO was a unit, but in 2005 it dismembered from BZO) for a coalition government that eventually generated a sanction on the part of the European Union.
For this evolution Haider clearly bets who has already announced that he is prepared to collaborate with any party and that he is already taking his return to Vienna, to national politics.
The Green Party has also managed to reach parliament, although it has lost slightly and fell from third to fifth among the Austrian political parties.
No other party clearly exceeded the four-per-cent limit and is therefore not part of parliament.
Schwarzenberg: relations with India can cool down
If we fail to solve the problem of Czech scientists who have been accused in India of illegally collecting beetles, we could come to a cooling of Czech-Indian relations, according to Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg.
Thus the minister manifested in New York, after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart, Pranab Mukherjee.
"If this was not resolved then yes, then it would certainly come to this cooling," he noted after the meeting that was organized on a Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, after the meeting, that the executive can hardly get involved in legal matters.
However, he stated that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was free of charge and punished with a fine, the government can negotiate with the local government of Darjiling whose jurisdiction falls within the matter.
"Your problem could be solved," the minister said.
For Emil Kučera, sentenced to three years in prison, the best would be, according to Mukherjee, to appeal to the highest courts.
Then you can ask for relief from the case and await the judgment at large, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his colleague expressed himself in the same terms during the meeting.
"It advises to appeal to the High Court and then pardon would be possible," said the Head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way in which the Czech side can get into the matter is by getting the condemned one "legally competent support," the Indian minister said.
On the other hand, he said that such support is already obtained by the Indian side.
"We have the greatest interest in maintaining the best relations with India, which have a long tradition.
The Indians also recognize it," Schwarzenberg said.
On the other hand, as the ČTK said, his colleague stressed that the Czech Republic considers the problem of Czech entomologists of great importance.
"We really find it a terrible mistake to imprison and condemn these Czech scientists," he announced.
The minister eluded the answer to the question of whether he received from the Indian side the promise that he would deal with the matter.
"I've received a lot of promises," he just noticed.
A Czech Arbitrates a Struggle on the Seabed
I approach an electronic wall map, it depicts Australia surrounded by sea.
He is not interested, however, in the continent but in a small point lost in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and next to it also the seabed that surrounds it.
The region is, at the same time, as large as a single continent," says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the team of thirty members working in the UN Division for Ocean Law and Sea Affairs.
Its head, Director of the Division, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the exhibition and sometimes completes it.
It governs this talent and work enthusiasm.
The seabed hides until today a little-known world, rich in natural sources.
Oil and other mineral raw materials can be found, but also unknown organisms that are in themselves the key to the development of cancer drugs.
The bottom is greater than the mainland
The countries with coasts today have begun to fight vigorously the new territories under the sea.
According to the UN Treaty these take advantage of the rights they agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
This is basically the so-called continental border, which sometimes extends a few hundred kilometres from the coast of the given country.
According to the Treaty, it has exclusive rights in all the resources of the continental border.
"Simply, continental border means the part of the seabed and its surface, which is the natural continuation of the continent under water.
It reaches the limit of the coast of the sea, and often, to the border of the two hundred nautical miles, that is, pure economic zone", explains Mikulka.
The request submitted by the given country to the Commission for the delimitation of the outer limits of the Border of the Continent must be submitted with scientific technical documentation based on research and measures.
It is the result of a series of years of preparation of work.
"One of our tasks is to organize a technical and legal specialist assistance commission.
The committee has so far processed five requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
For now, only those of the last three countries mentioned have come forward," adds Mikulka.
Not long ago, Australia's success had a global impact as it was the first to substantially expand its marine dominance.
However, New Zealand also got it - the seabed area that gave it the commission last week is 1.6 million square kilometers, i.e. almost six times more than the size of the state itself.
Both countries invested millions of pains for their study.
The gain that will be derived from the use of the seabed will, as they promise, be invaluable.
Other states are also gradually submitting their applications.
They can do so until ten years after they ratified the "Treaty of Montego Bay".
Where the continental border ends, the region of the oceanic bottom declared by the Treaty as "the common heritage of humanity" begins.
Already here, no nation has an exclusive position.
The right of exploitation in these areas is administered by the Treaties established by international institutions.
"The seabed, however, is no gold mine," says the director Mikulka with emphasis adding "that its separate areas are legally and clearly restricted and its regime defined by contract."
Czechs in the Pacific
And today, part of the seabed also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It is distributed with other countries of the then Eastern Block within the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
This was achieved in 1991 with a Treaty as an investor as well as a few other states, states called "the pioneer investor."
It has the power to operate in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is something bigger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The background there is rugged, it's something like a marine replica of the Tatras.
"A total area of 75,000 square kilometres can be exploited.
The area is rich in polymetallic concrete deposits containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," adds Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan.
A Macedonian Division employee, Rober Sandev, brings us a sample of that kind of concretion.
It reminds us of a little potato or with a little fantasy, the Shem, which according to legend revived the Golem.
During the liberation of the hostages the command of German special forces was in the place of action
To solve the hostage crisis the Egyptian government had asked for Germany's help – the experts came.
When the situation became serious, the Special Forces Command was ready, but the operation was not carried out.
More and more details are known about the circumstances of the liberation of 11 European tourists in Egypt.
According to the data of the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior in the action of salvation, German special forces were also indirectly involved.
Therefore at the site of liberation were the specialists of the German army as well as officials of GSG 9, aircraft squadron of the federal police, of the Federal Office of Criminal Investigation also experts in the field of logistics of the technical charity institution.
As the spokespersons of the ministries reported on Monday night, German forces were not needed because kidnappers, realizing a violent release, let their prisoners go and escaped.
The government of Egypt accepted Germany's help to use it as support on the spot.
"Fortunately that time did not come," said a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
On 19 September in southern Egypt, the assailants had kidnapped a group of travelers composed of 5 Germans, 5 Italians, a Romanian and 8 Egyptian companions.
After the kidnapping in the desert region of southern Egypt to the hostages they were deported from one side to the other in the border area between Egypt, Libya, the Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers remained unknown until the end as well as details of the release or possible ransom payments.
Meanwhile, healthy, saved people arrived in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the released hostages were under the tutelage of the German embassy.
He didn't say a word about the details of the release.
At first in Berlin there was no information about their return to Germany.
According to the newspaper "Bild", 5 tourists and special forces have to return to Airbus from Germany's air forces and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
U.S. House of Representatives Does Not Approve Salvation Package
The first chamber of the United States Congress let a large $700 billion bailout package for the financial markets fail with little.
The Dow Jones fell very drastically.
The United States House of Representatives rejected with 227 votes against 206 the government's package for saving the financial markets.
Despite all the appeals of President George W. Bush and former politicians of both parties, he did not come to a majority for the program with which disorder in the financial markets should be limited.
With dramatic action the desperate defenders had still tried to convince critics to accept the great $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, the leader of the Democratic negotiations had asked the deputies to make a vote although the plan is not so popular.
"It is difficult to get political approval to avoid something that has not yet absolutely happened," he admitted.
Already during the vote the Dow Jones fell to more than 6 percent or 600 points.
The cause of this was the concerns of investors that the state's salvation package might fail.
He rested at the end of the vote and after the failure was made public, he fell again.
Experts have other serious turbulence in international financial markets.
To allow the programme to enter into force, it is necessary to have the approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
Organizers record the increase in the number of reservations
It seems to be a good winter for German travel organisers:
According to one study, the sales volume of travel bookings for the coming months increased compared to last year - even the winter season by more than 30 percent.
According to one study, despite the weakened situation the desire to travel of the Germans remains as before.
As the German Travel Association (DVR) in Berlin reported on Monday, with travel reservations for the winter season the travel agencies recorded a sales volume that is 31 percent more in comparison to the same period last year.
According to the investigation of the GfK market research institute, reservations for the autumn months had already risen in number.
Thus the sales volume of travel agencies in October was almost 11 percent more than in 2007, reported the DVR.
The basis of the results are GfK figures which are the information analyzed about the reservations in 1200 travel agencies and calculated approximately for the whole market.
The data collected are travel reservations made until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weakened course of the dollar especially travel to the United States is in great demand, the DRV reported.
In this case the number of reservations increased to almost a third.
The preferred destination points of the Germans are not only Spain, Turkey and Greece but also the regions of Germany.
Especially organized trips are much preferred, explains Klaus Laepple, the president of the DRV.
In view of the fact that energy and food prices are rising, in this case travel expenses are "better for the customer than during an individual trip".
Among other things, consumers can save money with early booking discounts or with All-Inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
Also in the summer months the trips were well reserved, so the volume of sales compared to last year again rose - although according to another study the number of Germans making a trip, comparing last year, dropped.
My first Oktoberfest
Hits of parties under the open sky in the endless spa, beer in 1 liter jars and famous people dressed in traditional Bavarian designer costumes.
A debut at a tent.
Susanne Kronzucker and I really don't have much in common.
She is blonde, the moderator on television and wears a custom Bavarian traditional costume.
I have dark hair, I'm a student and my dress is already worn.
But there's one thing that unites us: we're barely in the tent, the photographers have already rushed to us and filled their memory cards with the photos - it's very flattering especially because I'm first in Oktoberfest.
That's how you make friends.
The cheap Bavarian traditional costume seems to fulfill its function.
Actually as a tourist in the Oktoberfest coming from northern Germany my feeling of well-being in a traditional Bavarian costume until this day was still limited.
But after arriving at the Prado of Teresa everything is not for so much.
Almost everyone wears the traditional Bavarian suit or leather pants; none of it seems to be paying attention or feeling unpleasant - everything is absolutely normal.
Only my apron gets weird looks next to a banana stand in chocolate.
A munchess draws my attention to my apron that I had dressed in the wrong way: "The left side is single, half is the virgin, on the right side is compromised, behind is a widow. "
Oh, God, now I'm closing from behind to the left.
"Okay," he says, laughing.
The others do not worry about many of the subtle methods to flirt and wear hats where it is written "To drink to get dressed!" and show, without asking them, their bare ass.
A young boy who behaves exhibitionistically is called Bob, is from England and is also for the first time in the Oktoberfest.
To him it seems "gorgeous", which pronounces with a very long "or".
She tells me after she put her glass of a liter of beer that she's finished drinking.
He put it right next to the fire hydrant, most people think that's a garbage can.
So Bob is one of the famous people who knows how to drink a lot.
The others are not very lucky and cannot consume so much alcohol.
About eight o'clock in the night, health care groups run around the party place and have to worry about poor drunks.
The toilets appear each time in a group - suddenly there are always four people who bring the skirts covered from one tent to the other.
That works like most visitors: They come sober, they come back drunk.
You can't see who's suffering from the degrees of alcoholemia and is in the walks.
"They're the ones who "can't do it anymore", I was answered by a health care provider answering my question and disappeared in turmoil.
Accident victim identified by the police
The 63-year-old pedestrian who died in the hospital after being hit by a vehicle in Essex County has been identified.
Carole Paulson of Chelmsford Road in the city of Brentwood was involved in the Shenfield Road accident on Friday afternoon.
The woman was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of negligent driving.
Since then, he has been released on bail.
Turkey expands its diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey intended to be a member of the European Union, the European powers created the desire to enter the country.
In the eastern part of the Bosphorus, perhaps just 20 steps inland Asia, lies one of the most interesting relics of the disastrous imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha train station was designed by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu, in neo-Renaissance style.
At least, this is what the guides say.
The building is set to flatten the end of the platforms and carries in front two towers, one for each corner, looking like a typical German town hall.
The stone's dirty.
The building in its complex is a little decadent.
But once the vaulted locker was over, there's no doubt what the company's greatness was that this was the westernmost door.
The station was opened in August 1908 by the German consortium Anatolia-Bagdad Corporation.
Germany, a "latecomer" in the imperial game, had the ambition to dominate the Middle East through this railroad that was curing itself to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond what is now Saudi Arabia.
However, the ambitions of this imperial Germany failed during World War I.
His railroads were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
Because of the relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, it fell below
British rule and when forces advanced in Egypt, they pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
The news was bad for Hyderpasha station as well.
In 1917 an ammunition train exploded destroying its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources commented that it was sabotage.
Since then the station has fallen and remained out of the way of history.
But today, this railway, the gateway to Anatolia and all the eastern centres, serves - at least symbolically - to highlight Turkey's willingness to expand its diplomatic horizons.
The Justice and Development Party that is in government - the AKP - has planned a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
There is now a new policy of collaboration.
The Turkish Government has excellent relations with Israel and Syria, with both the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
To assess the parameters of this new foreign policy, I went up to a bunk and went to the Turkish capital Ankara, in order to visit one of the leaders of the AKP, foreign policy expert, Turkish Prime Minister Suat Kinikioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a shock trip, which produced the cadences of the ancient world in the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived at the Turkish capital - a new city, designed to govern a new secular state, far from the Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, with its clear Islamist roots, represents a paradigm shift in the Turkish consensus
which has raised some suspicions in the West and, especially, in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the headquarters of the AKP, an ultra-modern structure of stone and steel - built ad hoc - in a developing suburb, surrounded by medium-built shopping centers and "power pastry shops" where middle-class managers in business suits - men and women - meet early in the morning to agree/do business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a centre-right politician of almost any party in Europe.
Suit, tie, I'm sure he still has a Blackberry.
"The objective of the party's foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate neighbourhood.
The Cold War was an anomaly," she tells me.
Turkey has been cut off in relations with its interior.
Today you have to look at the East and the West at the same time.
It's not a case if it's not towards one or the other.
You have to do both.
"But surely at some point," I ask, "Turkey might be forced to choose?"
"Turkey," he replied, "doesn't want to face that choice."
Next, he underlines one point that almost everyone I have spoken to up to that point had recited to me almost in memory: the relations that Turkey has not only with the Middle East, but with the Caucasus region, and with the whole Black Sea, represent a benefit for Europe and the United States as well as for Turkey itself.
The message seems to be: with Turkey on board, Europe in its complex can metaphorically mount those railway lines that open the world to East Asia and the Middle East.
Once again at the Hydarpasha station, after a second night without sleep, my thought returns to the two German lords, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who had attended the construction of this building 100 years ago.
How surprised would they have been to know that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East, to a large extent, would be in the hands of Turkey today?
And waiting at the terminal for the ferry that will take me back through the Bosphorus, I remember that in those days Turkey was considered "the sick man of Europe."
So there is not much doubt that the continent to which this fascinating country must claim will be the continent.
Lifes to remember: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: as Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (Scale, September 11) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and the Choir.
As part of the musical project for the city, in the following year he founded his magnificent youth choir, Proteus.
It was supposed to be for children under 21, but at the time that Proteus sang his final in 1979, several of us were finishing our 20s - let's just refuse to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the changing mythological being of the forms) represented the will of the choir and the ability to perform any music presented to it, be it madrigal or Messiaen, regardless of whether accompanied or with complete orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by this youth choir was often surprising, always exciting, and everything was due to that man's inspiration and enthusiasm for music that remained absolutely constant over the years.
Tod often told us to "let the music speak for itself."
He would say, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all there, in the music.
All you have to do is sing!"
His wand was always absolutely clear and precise, though never impossive, nor too flowery.
Whatever the musical score, it always ended up at an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any driver should have been a gentleman, this is Vernon Handley.
I knew him very well during the two decades in which he directed the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Especially in the last 40 years, I've reviewed over 100 of their concerts and I can honestly say that I've never, for none of them, been disappointed – otherwise, I've often been inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of greatness and extreme personal modesty.
He hated drivers who, in his words, simply "sold one or two well-known war horses around the world."
We'll miss you a lot.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
in his sequel to William Woodruff (September 25) you affirm that "in 1946 he resumed his economic history studies at Oxford and in 1950 he won a research scholarship from Houblon-Norman... at the same time he was studying for a bachelor's degree, a master's degree and a doctorate degree."
This is learned in a note from Woodruff's author at Beyond Nab End, but it is not entirely correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, during which season he completed a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J.D. Chambers, and later published in 1958 under the title The British Rubber Industry.
He spent the years between 1950 and 51 in the United States, enjoying a scholarship from Houblon-Norman, and the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he definitely left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason Woodruff chose to overlook this part of his career is unknown.
J. Vicente Resino, Faculty of Philology
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino "Flamenco y vida" because his photographs in black and white, documentary style, are fantastic.
I was drawn to attention by their simplicity and by the force they transmit, always treating the protagonists with great respect.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feeling.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments."
Second round for Honda Supersales
In November Honda will start marketing the second generation of Jazz.
If its predecessor already had a large habitability, this new monovolumen presents an even wider interior space.
All this is combined with refined mechanics, which increase driving comfort and save more fuel.
Evolution in the face of revolution.
That's the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Jazz has a line very similar to the model that happens, the changes introduced in this monovolume are numerous.
Among other things, it is worth noting an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
However, before analyzing the new model, we have to comment that this new Jazz comes six years after introducing the first generation into the market.
Therefore, a first observation is that Honda has renewed this model within a shorter time frame than that used by other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, Jazz is less known, in other markets this model is a sales phenomenon.
This is the case of Japan, a country where Jazz has been the most commercialized car in 2002 and also during this 2008.
Precisely in Japan, nearly a million Jazz units have been sold since its launch.
The second market has been that of the Old Continent, with about half a million units in six years.
However, Honda claims that this new Jazz will increase sales within the segment.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese firm commercialized a total of 83,000 Jazz units, in 2009 the estimates point to 100,000 cars, which would mean a 17% growth in the European market.
With regard to the Spanish market, Honda has marketed a total of 8,000 Jazz units since 2002, accounting for 6.7% of Honda's total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation, the heads of the Spanish branch expect to sell 2,000 Jazz units in a full year.
Precisely the arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to greatly alleviate the decline in sales in Spain.
In fact, those responsible for the brand expect to end the year with a total of 22,000 units marketed, which is 4,000 less than in 2007, a 16 per cent drop.
Despite this increase in Honda sales it has increased its market share in Spain, reaching 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
The Japanese firm also expects to reach 2 per cent by 2010.
To achieve this Honda quota trusts the arrival of another new model.
It is the Insight, a hybrid of five doors and compact size - 4.37 meters long - of which the Japanese company expects to market about 200,000 units a year worldwide.
By market and according to Japanese manufacturer estimates, 50% of Insight's sales will occur in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be distributed between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of the Insight is scheduled for the first months of the year, once it is presented as a company in January in Valencia.
As for the first generation, the new Jazz grows in all its odds.
Its length is up to 3.90 meters (five centimeters more), the width up to 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and the distance between axes up to 2.50 meters, which means an increase of five centimeters.
The height, on the other hand, does not vary and remains at 1.52 meters.
Alongside the increase in dimensions, the interior habitability also grows.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the inclusion of a new platform and, on the other, to the introduction of the fuel tank in a central position, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz.
Also, the capacity of the trunk - which has a double bottom system - rises to 399 litres, 19 litres more of the trunk capacity of the first generation.
It should be noted that these measurements are of the version with engine 1.4, since the capacity of the trunk of the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 liters.
Other improvements - in addition to external elements such as rear leds or the possibility of mounting the panoramic glass - is an improvement in access to the rear seats.
And it is that the doors that give access to the second row have an opening angle of 80 degrees, compared to the 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
The engines are also new in this second generation of Jazz.
At the beginning of its commercialization, this small model will have two petrol propellants of 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both mechanics incorporate the i-VTEC technology that achieves lower consumption, emits less carbon dioxide, achieves excellent mechanical refinement and at the same time achieves a high torque throughout the engine's regime.
The first 1.2-litre mechanics achieves a power of 90 horsepower to 6,000 revolutions with a maximum torque of 114 Nm. to 4,900 spins.
This propellant - which in the previous Jazz reached 78 horses - has an expenditure of 5.3 liters and a emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
With regard to the previous propellant, which in the previous generation achieved 83 horses, now it becomes 100.
This 100 horse Jazz 1.4 achieves a combined consumption of 5.4 liters and 128 grams of CO2.
The bee car that avoids collisions
To advance the development of technologies for accident prevention Nissan has been inspired, this time, by nature, in particular, by bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, based on the flight of the bees, avoids accidents.
This is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C that is the first step in collision prevention technologies.
The engineers of the Nissan Motor Co. Advanced Technical Center have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Center for Advanced Science and Technology Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Director General of Public Relations for Technology and Research and Brand Management Development, the BR23C is presented as an extension of the Security Shield to four areas of Nissan.
This robot intends to strengthen the ability to prevent collisions of brand vehicles.
During their flight, each bee creates its own personal space with oval shape that looks a lot like the Nissan Security Shield.
But the most important thing is the bee's composite eyes, capable of seeing at an angle of more than 300 degrees in all directions, allowing you to fly seamlessly within your own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, engineers designed what they have called a Laser Range Finder.
It detects obstacles up to two metres away within a radius of 180 degrees in front of the BR23C, calculates the distance to that object and sends a signal to a micro-processor that immediately translates into collision prevention.
"At the moment you detect an obstacle, the small robot will imitate the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by turning its wheels at a straight or higher angle to avoid collision.
The biggest difference with any existing system is that the escape maneuver is totally instinctive.
If not, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and chief engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot be turned upwards or downwards, or diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to rotate its wheels and not in infinite directions and ways like the bees.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, for the small robot to avoid collisions.
"This device only needs to process information every few seconds, and act on that data.
It does not require saving information or intuitive logic from previous maneuvers, so it can work continuously with just a couple of dozen KB of memory.
This may surprise you, but we're not talking about memory gigas, not even mega."
This is the first step to develop new technologies for instantaneous collision prevention, a technology that Nissan predicts will be introduced into serial cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than the variety of lithium ions.
Another possible future application of this technology could be the integration of the unit with a GPS satellite navigation system to guide the driver to his destination avoiding obstacles along the way.
Tiemble before mortgage
It must be recognized that the US Treasury Department, in addition to having plenty of fluid to make injections, is not lacking in wit.
In the face of the crisis, and to prevent Americans from embarking on mortgages in questionable solvency banks, they have created a friendly and informative game for the browser: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
That is, the Hotel of Bad Credits... or the Troubles.
The tetric aspect of this accommodation and especially of its receptionist is to think one, two and up to three times if it is time to ask for a credit.
And, above all, where to do it, which is probably your goal.
True, he has useful information, but little detail.
It's more a teen page than a site for all audiences.
What happens if the game is completed?
Well, there's a dream room inside the hotel.
Something's something, because we don't even talk about buying a better house.
Morgan Stanley sells participation to Japanese MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry into his capital of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first Japanese bank, which will disburse nine billion dollars to acquire 21 % of its capital, a news that has been accepted with a strong drop in its stock exchange listing.
One week after discovering an interim agreement, both banks explained that MUFG was going to buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's ordinary shares at a unit price of $25.25, or an amount of $3 billion.
The agreed price is less than 19 % of the book value of the securities as at 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional six billion dollars with the purchase of convertible securities, which will ensure you a yield of 10% and a conversion price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley stated that the overall transaction would be carried out on the basis of a unit price of $29 or 28% above its current exchange rate.
The Morgan Stanley action lost however 6.79 % to 23.07 dollars each at 17:00 GMT.
" This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to banking holding status, " explained Juan Mack, the general manager of the American group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which would allow him to diversify his activities but he passes under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
Its alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces the larger names of Wall Street to adopt a much more prudent behavior than before.
The modalities presented last Monday also show that the agreement has been modified over the last few days: last Monday, Morgan had announced that he would sell up to 20% of his shares to Japanese for almost $8.5 billion.
" A week ago, " he explained in Tokyo Toshihide Mizuno, the executive director of MUFG, "we thought that participation had been made up only of ordinary shares.
But in view of the current economic and market situation, we have wanted to minimize risks and cover ourselves. "
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley securities 7 % below its book value.
And the operation will result in a dilution of about 20% of the profit per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG may convert within one year half of its preferred securities into ordinary shares if they are sold at more than 50 % above the conversion price, i.e. at 47 dollars or more, over a given period.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital provided by MUFG will allow him to take investment opportunities, strengthen his balance sheet and increase his liquidity.
A spokesperson for the group refused, however, to elaborate on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After MUFG's investment, Morgan Stanley should show a Tier One solvency ratio of about 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan needed to have greatly eased his balance sheet since the end of August.
The last few weeks have been exhausting for the group, which saw its stock exchange listing fall in half while the cost of security against a risk of defaults on its debt took off.
This cost fell back last Monday but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" of Wall Street's large investment banks after the bankruptcies of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchase of Merrill Lynch, announced that they raised $15 billion, in part for Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa in Quito, this Monday.
Refound the republic around 21st century socialism.
This is the common project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, like his colleagues and friends, he is the third to vote on a draft for a new Constitution.
Mission accomplished since 64% of voters voted "yes" to the referendum, according to the official results that referred to 80% of the votes.
According to these results, the "no" obtained 28 %, 7 % of the votes cast were null and 0,7 % were blank.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, it had to obtain half of the votes plus one.
On Sunday, two polls at the exit of the electoral centres and a count from a non-governmental organization had announced a broad victory for the "yes", estimated at between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had also claimed the victory of his draft Constitution on the night of Sunday to Monday.
The "Constitution triumphed overwhelmingly " , he had assured, congratulating the Ecuadorians who lead the Guayaquil government, 280 kilometres southwest of Quito.
Thus, Rafael Correa has been congratulated by Chávez and Morales but also by his Chilean colleague Micaela Bachelet.
The elections, which will take place in full calm, according to the observation mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), referred to a text of 444 points consolidating the " new socialism " defended by the President.
The draft Constitution implies an increase in the power of the State over the economy, reserving it with the " development planning " of a country that lives essentially through the extraction of oil by foreign companies and through foreign exchange sending its emigrants.
Held by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also grants strengthened powers to the Head of State, who can make up to two consecutive terms of four years each and will have the opportunity to dissolve the Assembly.
Correa has already announced that it would use this power and seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution further consolidates the principle of free health and education services that the President began to establish in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, in which 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
It finally provided for the ban on the presence of foreign troops, which would put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for American anti-drug operations.
The 19 people abducted have been released in Chad
An Egyptian commando launched the assault on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions kidnapped ten days ago in the desert arrived unharmed in the Egyptian capital after being released on Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they had been released by the Egyptian special forces in Chad.
They all looked good when they arrived at 3:30 p.m. on board a special plane at the Al Maza military base, adjacent to Cairo International Airport.
They were immediately transported by helicopters to the Maadi hospital, a residential suburb of Cairo, for medical testing, so they were unable to talk to the press.
"They are in good health" and "no ransom was paid" to the kidnappers, Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garana declared at the airport.
On 19 September these hostages fell into the possession of 35 unknown kidnappers while enjoying a safari on all-terrain in a desert area at the foot of Mount Ouanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, and since then have gone from one zule to another.
The group consisted of eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the Aegyptous travel agency, in charge of the safari organization.
An Egyptian security officer indicated that 30 members of the special forces, carried on board two helicopters, had launched the assault during the night before dawn.
" An exchange of fire took place, and half of the kidnappers were killed, the others have fled, " said the man who kept the anonymous.
According to him, 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the flash unit were sent to Sudan, where they were supported by German and Italian commanders.
The Italian Foreign Minister, Franco Frattini, mentioned in Belgrade the role played by the secret agents and by members of the Italian special forces.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and effectiveness of our men in the secret services, the special forces," he said without going into detail.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
On the eve of the day, the Sudanese army claimed to have intercepted during a patrol an all-terrainer on which the kidnappers were on board, of which six were killed, including the Chadian chief and arrested two.
He also stated that they were related to a rebel group in Darfur, the Sudan Unity Liberation Movement (SLA-U), a claim immediately denied by this group.
Letters - Silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture is taking place in the current electoral campaign.
It's better this way.
But a sector of our cultural life is always forgotten.
Who will stand up to denounce the miserable sums given to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historic sites that are starving?
What politician will dare to remind the federal government to neglect its monuments and heritage buildings?
Why don't we have real laws that actually preserve our heritage as in Canada and Quebec?
Did you know that the French government devotes three and a half million euros to restoring it only to the Chinon castle in the Loire Valley?
In the United States, it is written in its Constitution that the protection of heritage is part of the culture of Americans and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all elected and all government departments, and all this, in concert.
In Quebec, in the Federation of Quebec History Societies, at least 40,000 benevolent people regrouped in 211 societies of history, heritage, archives and genealogy are concerned with searching in history, preserving with little money piles of private archives and preserving archaeological remains.
These are often the guardian dogs of our heritage, who protest with energy and despair when promoters and responsible throw their bulldozers at our forgotten old stones and cemeteries.
For when, a monument to history and heritage?
The governments of the Netherlands are nationalizing a part of Fortis Bank.
The Netherlands states - being the first in Europe - will help with a nationalisation to the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis that is in trouble due to the effect of the mortgage crisis of the American market: the three countries will support in total with 11,2 billion euros to this financial and insurance institution that also has business in Hungary.
This weekend, the governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands held higher-level consultations with the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission's head of economic competition.
The Fortis Bank is the first to suffer the Eurozone crisis in the context of the international financial crisis that has occurred in several waves more than a year ago, so the decisions taken with respect to the Bank, in a sense, can be regarded as precedents.
According to the decision taken on Sunday morning, the three States will purchase approximately half (49 per cent) of the Bank's property in their area.
The Bank will surely sell part of its business, including mainly insurance activities purchased last year from the Dutch ABN Amró.
The actions of Fortis began a sharp decline last week and for the second half of the week there were already important signs of crisis in the institution.
However, analysts agree to point out that with its 85,000 employees this Bank is too large to allow it to break down.
The company's shares only decreased by 12 percent on Friday, being the lowest point in the last 14 years.
Since January the value of the shares has decreased by more than two thirds.
Observing the current stock prices, the total value of the group's capital in the market is around 14 billion euros, but according to the company's executives this is not real.
The Bank's management blamed the sudden fall of Fortis' shares on the insecurities of the US market in connection with the approval of the US package plan of $700 billion.
On Monday the shares showed a slight increase.
On Friday they appointed Filip Dierckx as the bank's new CEO.
The Bank also sought private investors, but so far no one has given a concrete offer.
The Belgian government had previously assured that investors did not have to worry, they will not lose their money.
Among the Bank's clients so far there was no panic, they did not invade the bank offices to withdraw their money.
The Fortis has its own branch in Hungary and has also purchased leasing companies.
Fox in the henhouse
In the United States, life and health insurance companies, when they see data on the purchase of medication, often refuse to sign an insurance contract.
Privacy policy specialists fear that the personal data market will become uncontrollable.
"There are programs for the protection of personal data, which to the use of the prescription data in all cases binds it to the approval of the given person.
The same must be in independent hands, because otherwise, "we trust the fox" - quotes the Washington Post to Richard Dick, the designer of the prescription follow-up program.
Insurance companies make the insurance price and amount of compensation depend on the customer's state of health and if they believe that the risk is excessive, they simply do not make the contract.
Before they sent the client to medical check and signed the contract with him already knowing the result of the check.
Dick invented a much cheaper procedure ten years ago: with the customer identification number he easily gets from the pharmacies the list of medicines purchased in the last year and a half and the program itself draws the conclusion about the patient's illness and health status.
For example, if you systematically take large doses of cholesterol-lowering pills, it indicates that your blood fat level is virtually incurably high, so you are immediately included in a higher risk category.
Many versions of the program circulate, some even set a number of risks, so the insurance company in addition to the administration has little to do, although there are small difficulties in this.
Among the disadvantages of the program is, for example, that some medicines are multi-use, for example, certain substances serve both to treat headache and heat waves and even as antidepressants.
The latter is an important risk increase factor for insurance companies while the former are not.
Special companies were set up to consult and process these data, which, before acquiring the necessary information from the pharmacies, request the patient's approval.
The authorities are already forcing them to do this, although they have not received a fine for negligence so far.
Some companies have recently also developed the results of laboratory tests and combined them with data on drug use obtain more accurate information on the patient's health.
More and more companies have access to this data and at the same time it is increasingly difficult to control its use.
There is an exclusive law for the protection of personal health data, but it applies only to insurance companies and those providing health services.
The bill that gives the right to control of specialized companies for the provision of personal data is already before Congress.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is insufficient: he has therefore developed his program, which will require the individual's specific approval for the provision of his own personal data.
It is another matter that this person cannot deny his approval, because if the insurance companies do not sign the contract with him.
So the chickens, despite everything, are exposed to the fox's goodwill.
Global menu of Marseille
The European Union doubles its trade with India
Since the European Union and India are reciprocally trading partners, this issue, in addition to the other largely global problems, dominated the agenda of the ninth summit.
A Franco-Indian summit will also be held today to deal mainly with cooperation in nuclear energy.
While the European Union recognizes that India is a great democratic developing power that should have more voice and vote in international affairs, member countries have not yet been able to reach a common denominator as to whether they should support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
This issue was not addressed at the ninth summit in Marseilles yesterday.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, EU President-in-Office, José Manuel Barroso, President of the Commission and Javier Solana, the main representative of foreign policy, welcomed Manmohan Singh, Prime Minister of India, with whom they reached an agreement to double in five years, that is to say, increase their trade to more than EUR 100 billion.
Given that between 2000 and 2007 the exchange of goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not an overly ambitious target.
The 26 existing bilateral civil aviation agreements with India were thus legally harmonized, so air transport can also fly in the future.
India wants to sign the free trade agreement with the Union until the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up negotiations.
The objective is balance, because while the EU is India's first trading partner, New Delhi is only ranked ninth among the trading partners of the Union.
The summit paid attention to global issues.
Both sides condemned the Afghan and Pakistani situation and terrorism - all forms of terrorism - and urged the convening of a UN conference.
The conclusion of the Doha round of trade liberalization was also urged, although both sides bear great responsibility for their failure.
The EU confirmed that it will stick to its energy and climate programme, i.e. until 2020 it wants to reduce pollutant emissions by at least 20 percent.
India also agrees with this, as at next year's climate conference, a global agreement should be reached and the production of greenhouse gases should be reduced by 50 per cent by 2050.
They also wished to impede the rise in food prices and supported the convening of an international conference to review the financial crisis.
Today the head of government of India will travel to the French capital, where - in a bilateral meeting - he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
Paris trusts that French companies will be charged €20 billion to build nuclear reactors.
According to news agency information the agreement would be for a period of 15 years.
In Frankfurt more than three hundred Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Exhibition.
More than three hundred Italian publishers will be present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The international exhibition of the Frankfurt book awaits for this edition more than 7 thousand exhibitors from 102 different countries who will occupy the 171,790 square meters of the exhibition with more than 403,000 titles in exhibition and with Turkey as guest of honor.
He will be the undersecretary of the Ministry of Cultural Goods and Activities Francisco Maria Giro to represent the Italian government at the inauguration ceremony of the Italian pavilion: Italy will be institutionally and effectively present with a point Italy - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
There will be a meeting with the print at Room Struktur in the Buchmesse 5.0 pavilion: this will be the occasion to present numbers, trends and prospects about the state of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the weight of the books of foreign authors gradually decreases over the total Italian production, and in particular for adults and adolescents.
Found Steve Fossett's plane the missing millionaire a year ago
The remains of Steve Fossett's plane, the missing millionaire, were found on September 3, 2007 while flying over the Nevada desert.
The debris has been found on an altiplano at 3000 metres above sea level, in the Nevada mountain range of Mammoth Lakes, on the California-Nevada border.
Inside the plane, there were no human remains.
Wood County Commissioner John Anderson dispelled the remaining doubts: "The plane has been located, we have sent a squadron, and now we have the confirmation that it is proper to what Steve Fossett was flying on the day of his disappearance," he said at a press conference.
The Commissioner has specified that no human remains have been found on or around the plane.
The 63-year-old millionaire has been reported dead in February.
The American office for transport security (Ntsb) has announced that a few hours after the sighting of the remains, a squad of investigators has been sent that has identified the apparatus: it is the Bellanca 8kcab, dispersed since September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, always in California, not far from Nevada's border, some of Fossett's personal remains have been found by a couple near his Mammoth Lakes home.
These are two documents named Fossett, the two issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, cash and a sweatshirt.
Fossett's search had been interrupted one month after his disappearance.
The millionaire had won a position in history thanks to a long series of primaries.
In 2002, at the sixth attempt, he had become the first Man to complete the world's turn into an aerostatic balloon: two lonely weeks of flight.
Three years later he had made the world turn by plane and without stopovers.
Among his records, also that for flying at 15,445 meters high, over the Andes, but with a copilot.
Glk, the publicity you don't expect
A Suv out of the schemes with an original and well established design with defined lines and specific angles.
In short, Glk is the last one born among the all-terrain "compact" vans of the star's house with which Mercedes-Benz has sought to give a window of novelty in this sector.
Owned by the content outside of the traditional, it will be unexpected and unconventional, the communication that accompanied the launch of the Suv Glk, available in the exhibition rooms Mercedes-Benz since the 17th of October.
The advertising campaign that accompanied the debut of the new car will launch an unprecedented mode of communication through a 3D advertising campaign, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
A project with maxi-posters, articulated in three different phases, that will dominate the central street of Milan shopping, avenue Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication will start with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic version and thanks to special glasses distributed on the avenue As it will be possible to see the new suv in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
Indeed, looking at the images you will get the impression that the car comes out of the poster.
Subsequently, through the use of the innovative Ellumina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated at different times in all its details, to be recomposed in a single image.
Undoubtedly Mercedes with this advertising is trying to introduce something new into the stereotype of automotive communication.
Can this formula capture the interest of future buyers? We will see.
It's clear who the Italian hooligans are.
In the Trivenet, the ban on access to sporting events is played.
But who are these 150-200 girls and boys of whom Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the "Other Italy" group that has been following the Italian National for years and that until now, to tell the truth, had never created too many problems.
And they had never met the rival's fanatics either.
The extraction of the group is right.
The promoters come from the Trivenet.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
To these of Sofia have been added a small group (periods units, actually) of the Campaign and Apulia.
They have three-color flags where the city of origin of the militants appears: Saturday night they have been taken out so that they are not identified.
They're inspired by English fanatics.
In Bulgaria they have found a group of real Nazi fanatics, the Levski.
Figc had made 144 entries for the party available to Italian fans: all with names, so easily controllable.
And the minister of the interior had already controlled them all: among that which had gone out to Sofia there was none with a Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) at that time, none that had forbidden him to attend a stadium.
Four Italian fanatics, who had a history of crime in stadiums, have been rejected both the ticket and the trip.
Now the Ministry of the Interior expects to read the actions that come from the Bulgarian police to take action: in this case, it is possible to give the Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) for at least five years to the fanatics who have been arrested or who have been identified in the disorders.
An international Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) which prevents frequenting not only the Italian stadiums but also those throughout Europe.
Our hooligans, they won't set foot in a stadium anymore.
Lucky for you!
But now there is the fear of imitation: that to those few fifty, others are added.
"We have to put this fire out right away and not legitimize anyone who behaves in this way," they say from the Ministry of the Interior.
That's why "well-opened eyes" especially in view of Wednesday's National Party in Lecce."
In Apulia there is also a small core of Ultras Italia supporters.
Tomorrow the Observatory meets, on Tuesday the Cams that can also have a section of the Aise (information agency and external security, that is the secret service, that takes care of the problems in the stadiums.
"The choirs of Duce-Duce and the arm raised during the anthem of Mameli? In Bulgaria it is not a crime...".
This is the thought (expressed in an unhappy way) of Domenico Mazzilli, for a few weeks the director of the Observatory of the Ministry of the Interior (he has taken the post that before was Francesco Tagliente and after Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli had been the head of Trieste's public safety department, where there is a core of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to celebrate the Duke but yes, the behavior of those 150-200 fanatics that has been shameful.
"I don't do the sociologist," adds the Observatory No. 1 "reacts are attributed in the countries in which the fact happens.
So far this group has behaved well now we will see what has happened and we will take it into account for the future.
But let's also talk about the whistles to Mameli's anthem: those too are not a crime, but if they allow they are neither educational..."
