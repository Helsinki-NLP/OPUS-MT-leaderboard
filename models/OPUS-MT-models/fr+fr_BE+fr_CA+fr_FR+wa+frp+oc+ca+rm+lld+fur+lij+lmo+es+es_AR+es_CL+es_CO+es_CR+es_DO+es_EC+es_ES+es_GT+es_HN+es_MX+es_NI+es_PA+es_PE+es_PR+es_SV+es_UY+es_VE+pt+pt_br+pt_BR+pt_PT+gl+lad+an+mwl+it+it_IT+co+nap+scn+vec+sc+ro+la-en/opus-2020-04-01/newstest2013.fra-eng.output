Republican strategy to counter Obama's re-election
Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Centre considers the latter to be a myth, claiming that electoral fraud is more rare in the United States than the number of people killed by lightning.
In fact, Republican lawyers have only identified 300 cases of election fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively influence the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will in part undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the U.S. states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
It was in this spirit that a majority of American governments enacted new laws starting in 2009 making the registration or voting process more difficult.
This phenomenon grew after the November 2010 elections, which saw the addition of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 States were introduced in 2011 alone.
New electoral laws require voters to present a photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws also reduce advance voting periods, invalidate the right to register as an elector on polling day, and remove citizens with a judicial record from voting rights.
Prior to the 2006 elections, no U.S. state required voters to present a photo ID.
Indiana was the first state to make such a requirement.
The United States Supreme Court confirmed the constitutionality of Indiana's law in 2008.
The Republican authorities rushed to extend this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they had sponsored bills in 34 states to force voters to present a photo ID.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have a universal identity card such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, or 21 million people of voting age, do not have photo IDs issued by a government agency in their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such an identity card.
However, it often costs more than a hundred dollars to obtain the required identity card.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities, and low-income people.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of those earning less than $35,000; 18% of citizens over 65 years of age and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years of age do not have the required photo ID card.
Much more.
Students, considered voters voting more for Democratic candidates, are not allowed in several states to use their photo ID issued by their institution.
On the other hand, these same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs who vote more on the Republican side to use the cards issued by these clubs to vote.
Prior to 2004, no State required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first to present such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove that they are U.S. citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting Hispanic voting.
However, it appears that two out of three Hispanic voters favour the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican legislators sponsored legislation in 2011 abolishing voter registration on polling day in eight states.
In addition, they have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to electors wishing to register.
These restrictions are not without consequence.
For example, during the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns helped to register about 10 million citizens.
However, the measures adopted since 2009 have brought down the registration rate of new voters by 17% in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators have passed laws in five other states to reduce the advance voting period.
For example, in the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of voters who voted in advance were Afro-Americans, while the latter accounted for only 13% of the state's voters.
The same was true of the Hispanics.
They represented only 11% of voters, but 24% of citizens who voted in advance.
In return, the whites who made up 76% of the voters represented only 46% of the voters voting in advance.
Of course, the Democratic legislators and their supporters strongly opposed the adoption of laws restricting voter registration.
Several bills have been blocked by the vetoes of the Democratic governors.
The Attorney General of the United States intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 out of 34 States have adopted laws requiring the presentation of a photo ID.
Nevertheless, the new rules put in place will undoubtedly make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been passed and see it as an obvious goal to influence results in 2012 in key states.
A 2011 Brennan Centre report shows that the States that passed these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes needed by the electoral college to win the presidency.
It is too early to state with certainty that these legislative changes in the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively influence the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will in part undermine the American democratic system.
Prostate cancer screening: pass the test or not?
In fact, the PAS test would sometimes have erroneous results, with false negative results or false positives, which lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
What makes men who are already reluctant to take screening tests even more hesitant?
Pass the test or not?
We asked for the advice of two experts.
In studies in the United States, there was a great deal of contamination among control groups, so it is difficult to interpret these data and to have firm recommendations.
Another study, the European one, concluded that there was a difference in mortality between patients who had been screened and those who did not.
This study also demonstrated, with follow-up after 12 years, that there is a 30-40% greater chance of metastases if not detected.
I therefore recommend the test from 50 years of age, or from 40 years of age if you have a direct parent who has already had prostate cancer.
Men of African American origin are also more at risk.
The key is to make the right decision once we've detected cancer.
There are aggressive cancers and others that are indolent.
We really need to make the patient understand the degree of risk of his cancer, by offering him the options, not necessarily treating prostate cancers that do not affect long-term life, and instead opting, in these cases, for active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many men in whom cancer is detected will not be treated, because their cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives.
We'll suggest they do active surveillance, and if the disease progresses, we'll give them treatment.
Increasingly, criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated are being determined with precision.
So I still recommend passing the test.
But the important thing is to have a discussion with your doctor to determine whether you should pass it or not.
In collaboration with the International Society of Urology, Movember has created a tool to evaluate the pro and cons of the PHC test.

Preventing the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe for preventing cancer.
Despite the progress of research, the adoption of good lifestyles remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering.
It is estimated that if everyone ate well and moved well enough, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
"If no one else smoked, this rate would rise to at least 50%," says André Beaulieu, spokesperson for the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, it is estimated that about 10% of cancers are caused by heredity.
Many also remain totally unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, tobacco control remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Cigarettes are related to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for several others.
It's a huge damage to people's health.
"Even today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," said spokesperson André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying of cancer falls by half.
Weight
Burden and obesity also promote the onset of the disease, according to CSC.
They would increase the risk of breast, colon and rectum cancer, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
"Research shows that the regular practice of physical activity throughout a lifetime protects against colon cancer," he adds.
Feeding
The body also recommends limiting its consumption of red meat.
In too much, it increases the risk of colorectal cancer.
So should the charcuterie, and they should be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting may lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"The latter can damage the body's cells and lead to cancer development," one explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, their research is not conclusive at the moment.
Vitamin E studies are contradictory, according to CSC.
While one noted a decrease in prostate cancer risk, another noted an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is also not clearly established.
Mr. Beaulieu also stressed the importance of discussing his concerns and family history with his doctor.
"Putting a screening test doesn't give you cancer."
The Higgs boson in husked
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson created a whole stir last summer, and for cause.
It is believed that this boson participates in the mechanism responsible for the mass of all things in the Universe, just like that.
And then, this is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the Standard Model - our best, or "less worse" explanation of the nature and behavior of the matter - but which has not yet been empirically observed.
But for physicists, it is not yet entirely certain that it is the Higgs.
We know without a shadow of a doubt that we hold an authentic new particle, and that it looks much like the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, new data unveiled this week at a major physics conference in Kyoto seem to confirm this, but there is still a lack of data to be absolutely certain.
Let us suppose, however, that this is the Higgs, since the chances of being wrong seem thin, and let us see what this is all about.
There is a fatally unavoidable law in this low world that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
No way to break that rule - and don't try too hard, you'll hurt yourself.
Although particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that it also has such a law: Pauli's principle of exclusion, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "state" consisting roughly in some of their characteristics.
From there, physicists classify the particles into two categories.
In one corner, there are good citizens called fermions, who wisely obey Pauli's principle.
And in the other, the bosons, a dirty bunch of anarchists who have no respect for anything - in any case, not for this principle, which means that they can really be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons are then divided into two groups, according to the site (absolutely extraordinary, moreover) The Particle Adventure, of the Berkeley Laboratories: the mesons, which we will not approach here, and the "particles of force", through which the great forces of nature spread and to which the Higgs boson would somehow be related.
These bosons, it must be emphasized here, are not all beasts as exotic as one might think.
In fact, if you can read this chronicle, it is thanks to a boson of extraordinary banality: the photon, or the "particle of light" that is the "messenger" of electromagnetic force.
When, in fact, a particle with an electrical charge accelerates or changes direction, it "distangs" the electromagnetic field in this precise place, a bit like a rock thrown into a pond.
From this "disadvantage" arises an electromagnetic wave (from light, or infrared, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon - and therefore, one of the bosons "bearers of force".
More stable field
The same applies to the Higgs boson, except that it is another field, the Higgs field, which must be "disturbed" for this boson to appear.
However, this Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, it is necessary to reach very, very high energies, somewhat as if it were a frozen pond whose only a very large rock could ride the surface.
That's why it takes a huge particle accelerator like the CERN - the Large Hadron Collider is a 27 km ring of circumference! - to reach such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again useful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
It is not all the particles, nor all the materials, that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do, but others don't - a piece of paper, for example, will never keep itself on a fridge.
And in the same way, it is not all particles that interact with the Higgs field: those that do have a mass, while the others (like the photon, here) do not have one.
Now, what is it that "can bring" all this research, asks Mrs Plamondon?
For science, this is used to verify the validity of the Standard Model (MS), and it also allows physicists to scrutinize any discrepancy between the observations and predictions of the MS.
Indeed, there are many who wish very much that they could be found, because the slightest difference could open a door on a "physical new" and shut some holes in the Model.
This one, it must be said, still has enormous deficiencies, not proposing any explanation for gravity (ops!) or dark matter, which forms about 80% of the matter of the Universe (re-ops!).
But we haven't found any such deviations at CERN so far.
Impacts
The impact of this research on Mr. and Mrs. All-World's daily lives is more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there will be no such research.
Here: In the early 1960s, laser pioneers in Bell Laboratories did not suspect the revolution that their work was going to trigger.
They were seeing scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, we have already heard fire from physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (the first were pulsed), in 1962 -, initially the laser was rather seen as a "laboratory gadget".
Imagine...
And then, applications can also come from all the instrumentation that surrounds the research.
For example, this same Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor in 1969, during his optical work.
This sensor, although not at all its original intent, now serves as an "eye" for all digital cameras in the world, and earned it the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
This of course does not mean that LHC activities will necessarily transform our lives, but it means that, really, we never know...
Palliative care - The best way to die...
With its Commission dying in dignity, Quebec recently debated the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate must resume shortly as a bill is being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this essential area.
The Devoir tried to look at it more closely.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that was gnawing at him had left him with a two-year rest.
"They had given me five years to live, I was seven years old," he said, half-fig half-raisin, lying in his bed at the palliative care house Victor-Gadbois, in Beloeil, where he arrived the day before.
"But it's always a shock, you can't be prepared for that," he says.
The disease does its work: a huge weakness that prevents it from going to the toilet alone, and even eating alone.
Attached to an appetizing lunch, he agrees to let himself be helped to eat, resigned.
Courageous, he even smiles, talks to strangers who deal with him, brings him his medicine, offers him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My biggest wish is to be cured of diarrhea, it's humiliating," he says.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this disease.
" In our life, we learn that a man pisses on his feet, " says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at Victor-Gadbois' house.
Returning to the stage of the child, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
"It depends on the person's ability to accept the regression," he notes.
For, in the opinion of several people working in palliative care, great moments are taking place at the very heart of this regression.
Patients entering the palliative care home Victor-Gadbois all suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this point, the "team of doctors and nurses around them no longer provides so-called "curative" care.
For Ms. A., 89, the worst fear is to die "conscious and stifled".
But the disease made me discover my children.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I have no more wishes in life," she says, before accepting a mask to help her breathe.
In the next few days, however, she is still waiting for a final visit from her son from Italy.
At Victor-Gadbois, with a group of volunteers, care and food aid are provided.
It's palliative care that you give when there's nothing else to do.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there is a palliative care bed for 11,700 people.
It's very little when we know that we all end up dying one day.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the house.
Whether at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
When dying, we will agree to give mouth care to brandy or Pepsi, as requested.
Diabetes will no longer be required to control their sugar levels.
And death is part of the daily life.
Last night, we had a beer for Mr. X, who died during the night.
This morning, his son will finish the beer at the feet of the deceased.
" We help loved ones as well as patients, " says Nathalie Savard, Director of Care.
At the Victor-Gadbois house, the days follow but do not resemble each other.
Along with an old 93-year-old man who enjoys his last family gathering in the courtyard, well tucked into his pillows while drinking in his honor, a 36-year-old man dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and two young children, after having tried hard to survive.
" For the past six months, there have always been three to five beds occupied by cancer patients under the age of 45, " worries Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of the patients admitted to the Victor-Gadbois home arrive from their home, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e., care designed to alleviate suffering when a patient has reached the end of his or her life, whether at home, hospital or nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois House and the Society for Home Palliative Care in Greater Montreal, specialize more or less exclusively in cancer care.
It is precisely this great deficiency in Quebec's health care that causes several physicians specialized in palliative care to fear the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto, signed by palliative care leaders including Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has been circulating to testify to their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not effective enough to ensure that everyone will be entitled to quality palliative care before euthanasia is accepted.
Recently, she said, I saw a patient spend 14 days in an emergency, in great pain, without doing what was necessary to relieve her.
I'm afraid patients only want to die because they don't get the right care.
And at the same time, several oncologists cling to their patients until the last day, despite the worst predictions.
The survival expectations of Helen Richard were already minimal when she gave up trying chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was stopping the treatment, she told me that she regretted that I stopped fighting, she told me.
Yet she told me I was finished!
No all-powerful care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients who ask to die thank the caregivers for not having acceded to their request after they were relieved of their pain by a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, Director of Palliative Care at the Society of Palliative Home Care in Greater Montreal, patients would be refractory to pain treatment in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, which means sleeping the patient until the time of death, either sporadically or permanently.
We can no longer pretend not to hear that part of the suffering.
Increasingly, the unrelieved patient will have the opportunity to have this palliative sedation.
Sick people who are not relieved always say the same sentence: "I want to die. "
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want you to euthanize me," it means "I want to be relieved."
This report was made possible through a Journalism Award from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Road officials, BTP entrepreneurs, fund-raisers of political parties and specialists of the Italian mafia tell day after day what they know about a formidable "system", mixing building industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and mafioso.
A "industry" that cost Quebec taxpayers very much, especially in the 1990s and 2000.
"It's curious how the system has been eroding since we took on the major assets," ironically Jacques Duchesneau, Quebec MP and former Chief of Police of Montreal.
It was through him that the scandal broke out in 2011, through a substantive investigation into the embezzlement of road works contracts in Quebec, to which the then Liberal Prime Minister, Jean Charest, had only consented in retrospect.
The "Duchesneau report" established a direct link between industry, hidden party financing and corruption of civil servants.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he points out, the only ministry of transport would have saved a billion dollars on contracts", some refractive their instincts to get a share!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already dropped two mayors", he adds, hoping that it will manage to "demonstrate the ploys behind the individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011, also works with its army of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
More police officers of the "Marteau Squad" who, since 2009, would have led the "water sewer cartel" of Montreal to put the soft pedal on the swelling of contracts...
In recent weeks, she has carried out serial searches and has brought charges of fraud and corruption against elected municipal officials, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a suburban city.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his post as Mayor of Laval, the third city of Quebec.
He is suspected of having repeatedly poached bribes in exchange for public contracts.
In addition, engineers on the road to Montreal and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambimo, are formally accused.
The latter made a sensation by explaining to the committee the mechanics of the "system" of obtaining public contracts.
For years, he himself paid 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to a Mafia-related intermediary who returned the money to Union Montréal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambimo sowed in the 2000s, giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (approximately 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially to the then ruling Liberals.
He also confessed to having organized an illegal fundraiser for former Liberal Deputy Prime Minister, Nathalie Normandeau.
Drainage contracts inflated costs
In Montreal, the corruption "system" was running round.
Gilles Surprising, former public works engineer, detailed this in front of the commission: in ten years, he received gifts from construction companies, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games and bribes totalling $736,000, in exchange for sewage contracts for which he was inflating the costs.
Other road officials admitted that they had their feet fattened by inflating the bills from 30% to 40%, with false extras.
Then an organizer of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately closing his eyes on a parallel budget feeding his caisses with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November, plunged Montreal into a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of Montreal's first elected women to pull the alarm bell.
Mayor of the borough of Rivière-des-Prairies, east of the island, she insurgents from 2010 against the sale of a municipal land bought $5 million and sold... 1.6 million to promoters, in full property boom.
70% dirty money in election campaigns
From the investigation that will eventually be put in place, she says that she "draws on a wire to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop the gangrene and pin the wrongdoers".
The process, she said, is "painful but positive".
We're cleaning up the wound, but it would take a Montreal-specific investigation unit and a day-to-day, not to see suspicious practices come back.
Just like cleaning up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau notes that "officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but he is particularly concerned about the role of "chosen in the knowledge of the ploy", when they did not dip in the mud!
Estimating to 70% the share of dirty money in the financing of electoral campaigns in Quebec, he ironically said: "I was told that it was only a pale reflection of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to the parties to $100 but this will not change the situation, according to him: "As long as we do not strictly limit election expenses, there will be dirty money in politics."
He called for a complete revision of the system of awarding public contracts and financing parties: "We cannot go any lower; going to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow to rebuild the house on more solid bases, with more controls and laws."
If this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh at it to look into their own courtyard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season, you took on a new scale with the PSG.
How do you explain this progression?
It can be explained by an individual awareness, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Big players have arrived.
Every day, I progress next to them.
The technical staff also brought me a lot.
Every day, these elements push me to raise my level of play.
And in the game, it's easier.
Everything goes very fast in football.
But I'm not inflaming.
From my beginnings to the pre-training center of the Clairefontaine INF to my passage to Saint-Etienne, I have always advanced in steps.
So you take advantage of the competition installed by Carlo Ancelotti...
This summer's recruits are used to playing very high-level games.
They also know that every workout is crucial.
Which makes a player like me want to face and provide the maximum.
On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti brings me a lot about my positioning.
He is supported by deputies like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man of the situation?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect in all technicians.
Today, he has no equal in League 1 and is one of the best European coaches.
He has a great experience and has won a lot of titles with hupped clubs.
He's been with some great players.
I think he'll win more titles in Paris.
In January, I had a heartwarming discussion with him.
I was then getting out of a series of injuries.
The trust he gives me also explains my performance.
What are your eyes on the first part of the season of the PSG?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took us as leader.
But we're still in ambush.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we qualified for the 8th final with the way.
What is the goal of the club in this competition?
We're gonna try to get as far as we can.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we will have our say in the face of very good European teams.
First we want to finish first of our hen, in front of Porto, in order to receive the 8th return.
Can the PSG become a major European club in the short term?
He already has the budget...
To become a great European club, Paris needs to win titles and register for the duration.
Today, this is not the case.
Financially, the GMP is giving itself the means to make this project a reality.
In League 1, not winning the title, like last season, would be a big failure?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
This year, we're really looking forward to the title of champion.
Last season, we didn't get far.
In May, there was disappointment because we had the qualities to finish first.
We've had a very big season.
We're done with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points, we're supposed to be champion...
But another team, Montpellier, had an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think it's the right one.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think we have the weapons to win it.
Do you think the media is waiting too long for the PSG?
It's normal that we expect a lot of us in view of what has been invested and the players we have.
We totally accept it.
Then, when you win 4-0 at home against Troyes and you still find things to blame us for, it's sure a little frustrating.
We wonder what else people expect.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set up a game project.
A team is built over time.
We've proven in the Champions League that we can respond present.
Look at Manchester City, who hasn't been able to qualify for the 8th finals in two seasons, they have also made huge expenses!
In terms of the money invested, we imagined you 15 points ahead of the truce!
It was neglecting our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not well last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
This shows that League 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we will be able to have a smile telling us that, despite all the difficulties, we ended up winning it.
PSG seems to be totally dependent on the exploits of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
Good thing we say there's a Zlatan addiction.
This means that Ibrahimovic is very successful and that he sets a lot of goals.
He came here for this, and he proves that he's the star of League One.
He showed wherever he went that he was a great player, a world star.
Within the group, we respect the man and the player.
He also respects the men he has around him.
What he's done is really exceptional.
This pushes others to raise their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone to make progress.
How did you experience the Euro 2012 with the French team?
Like a disappointment.
I wanted to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from grappling with gambling time.
I saw things there, and I came out reinforced.
Today, I manage to make good games in selection.
That's what I've been hoping for since I was baptized with the Blues.
Lessons have been learned from what has happened in Ukraine and we must now have exemplary behaviour.
What do you look at the first months of Didier Deschamps at the head of the Blues?
He's got the results for him.
We are well placed in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The breeder is rigorous, close to the players, and inspires the win.
As was Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
White had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the Blues to Brazil.
Is the good loser (1-1) ripped off, on October 16, in Spain, a founding match?
This game gave us confidence.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before this shock in Spain, I had never had a match like this in my career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
The opposite is true of current currency exchanges based on central banks, identified transactions and processing costs between stakeholders.
Moreover, as often in these technologies, a political vision is palpable: the conviction that the current monetary system, made of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros...) and a secure exchange protocol like BitTorrent, which allows for the exchange of pair-to-pair files.
About 200,000 transactions have already been recorded through 15,000 computers on the network.
A small thousand websites accept bitcoins as gifts or as a means of payment.
The bitcoin price, after reaching a top of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to 2 dollars, five months later, before returning today around ten dollars (the courses are listed on the bitcoincharts.com website).
Nothing very impressive, compared to world trade in real currency or in financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) took an interest in this in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes bitcoin as "the most successful virtual currency", "in competition with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to conventional currencies".
Bitcoin stands out from other types of virtual currency such as "credits", used to advance in a video game that you win by playing or that you can buy (and sometimes exchange in return).
The Facebook social network has also developed this kind of system.
But each time, a central authority controls and deals with trade.
With Bitcoin, all network nodes are both account book depositors, auditors, money issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually made between two e-mail addresses in the way of an e-mail.
Except that a user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is signed electronically by a double key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to make sure that the exchanged bitcoins exist well in the public account book, distributed throughout the network.
The key step is to write this new transaction in this book.
It passes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge to computers, and whose winner, sort of a temporary central banker, will have the privilege of adding this additional line.
This is a phase of file hashing, that is, converting a large file into a shorter and unique digital fingerprint.
Computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before "hashing" the whole.
The goal is to find the number that gives a particular footprint (a lot of zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other nodes easily check that it is the right one.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of all other transactions; any change would change the print.
If, to cheat, one user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (less than ten minutes), only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network - the other remains orphaned because the two have different fingerprints.
The computer that solved the challenge wins 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this reward is divided by two regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible up to the one hundred millionth, which leaves margin...
The difficulty of the challenge is also raised at each increase in computing power.
The life of the network has already had ups and downs.
Websites providing services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins in stolen deposits.
"The fault used does not concern the protocol itself," says Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a real currency payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also mentions the possibilities of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But the cash also has this flaw.
Weight actors like Wikipedia refuse gifts of this nature.
Others, like the WordPress blog platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, of the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the book of accounts and showed that nearly 80% of bitcoins do not circulate.
In November, "giant balances" were launched.
"Three thousand dollars have been exchanged," says Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, who converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, also the author of a teaching book on this currency, believes very much in the potential of this technology as a network of transactions.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a mobile payment without contact, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which thus come back cheaper.
The carrier also manages his identity and can therefore be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement for merchants, who do not need to install new terminals or software.
All they need to do is communicate an address that a phone can "photograph and recognize," says Pierre Noizat, who assures that he has thousands of users.
There is a general movement to challenge hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems.
"It's gonna take time for Bitcoin to push itself, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicts.
The ECB, in its report, also plans to reassess the various risks, which are now considered to be high, in the event of the success of this currency.
We left Afghanistan.
And then what?
French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans are expected to follow by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take possession of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future, without expecting everything from us.
It is mainly the Afghan peasants that we have punished by considering them as terrorists.
And ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, and the wounded, the maimed.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former refugee leaders in Pakistan, but often peasants who refuse foreign military presence, as in Soviet times.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even if they have been joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes helped by local insurgents, they will no longer be so when Westerners become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the base of Nijrab, which I observed from the top of the hills planted with almond trees thanks to French credits, took place in order.
Truck and armoured convoys joined Kabul without being attacked, overflew by helicopters.
There will be no Taliban raid on Kabul by the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed since their irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996.
Kabul was then empty, the country on fire and blood because of the struggles between different factions.
Their takeover of the country at that time had been seen as a sort of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghans have paid the price of the obscurantism of these peasants who have been overtaken by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved today.
Former Mujahedin, Afghan government and current Taliban join in the desire to keep women in a lower position.
The main figures of the anti-Soviet war came back to power in 2001.
They moved into business, seizing government land to resell it into land to build refugees' incomes from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from huge U.S. subcontracting contracts.
They did not consider themselves; most of them did not fight themselves.
People, as I have heard in the campaigns, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have been able to take advantage of the American widths: the flight of capital is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
They joined the modern world in their exiles in Iran or Pakistan, and enjoyed the benefits.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, one fifth of the total population.
In cities, government schools are full of girls and boys.
It will be necessary to provide work for those young people who will no longer want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of certain leaders.
All, including armed opponents, are fond of mobile phones; television, and its Turkish soap operas that present a modern world, are followed everywhere.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities that will order it be considered legitimate?
Former anti-Soviet commanders are already concerned with rebuilding provincial militias, which will escape central power.
Afghanistan, a mountain country with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from some decentralization, like Western nations, but the United States wanted to transform it into a centralized, strong presidential state, abolishing the post of Prime Minister that existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially during the elections scheduled for April 2014.
But his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and long before.
No industry has been restarted, no dams are in place, no major irrigation system is repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except fruit and vegetables.
Priority is given to private initiative.
In a country ruined by thirty years of war, government control over infrastructure would have been necessary.
The noise was widespread that Afghanistan had immense mineral wealth.
This only added to the feeling that the Westerners were only there to seize it.
Without energy to treat iron or copper ore on site, nor means of transport to export it through the mountains, there is no mining operation.
The Chinese have already almost left the Mes Aynak copper mine, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to search the immense Buddhist site and remain the most important employers in the province.
Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are heavily dependent on imports and exports, will also need one day to restore normal relations.
The departure of the French combat troops ended on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aids: girls', boys', department of French at university, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support to the Archaeological Delegation.
Since 2009, in an attempt to "win hearts and minds" and achieve the impossible task of matching aid and offensive actions, a service of "civil-military actions" of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), abolished in 2012, has carried out, and has carried out by a small French NGO, many collective interest work and agricultural rehabilitation actions in dozens of mountain villages.
These works, gourmets in local labor, were able to help contain the insurgency: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increased cultivable surfaces.
What will we leave as a souvenir, after two billion euros of military spending?
A much smaller budget would help to improve local living conditions, which are very harsh in these valleys, often at more than 2,000 metres above sea level.
The Embassy received dozens of written requests for small agricultural achievements from local communities in Kapisa province.
For them to be freed from the insurgency led by foreign groups, what farmers have told me to want, a small, well-controlled and directly affected civil aid should be maintained in their favour.
A Constitution with Strengths in Egypt
This is a new poker shot by President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever around the constitutional declaration, which temporarily grants it full powers, it has decided to play its part.
Taking everyone in court, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on its final text the following day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State gave this House two more months to complete his work.
For almost two years Egypt has been relying on a provisional text, several times amended which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal fraud.
This new initiative has only increased the fracture in the country.
For his opponents, the President perseveres in his "autocratic delusion", continuing to "translate his word" and "piestinate the law".
On the side of its supporters, it is ensured that this is a way to put an end to the institutional and political crisis as soon as possible, by accelerating the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 15 days.
A very short period of time that forces the Brothers to give up their draft to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way to regain popular and democratic legitimacy while the challenge rages throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote in favour, as he stated in an interview with the American weekly Time.
All the more so since this use of a hasty vote owes the ultimatum to the Egyptian people: "You either vote for my text, or I keep full powers", they are supposed to end after the adoption of the Constitution.
It was in a strange atmosphere that 85 members of this Constituent Assembly, with a large Islamist majority, voted on the text yesterday.
Most Liberals were missing the call.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had slammed the door, believing that they had not been able to assert their views.
Representatives of human rights, religious minorities or civil society had done the same.
In order for the necessary quorum to be reached, 11 people, replacement members, were added in haste yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
Unsurprisingly, the articles were most often voted unanimously.
Some commentators also enjoyed the fact that one of the only differences of the day was expressed around... the hour of prayer, with some members of the committee believing that the constituent's pendulum was poorly settled.
The text, which was still being voted on last night, contains 234 articles.
The object of all the attentions, article 2 finally remains the same as that of the 1971 Constitution, stipulating that "the principles of Shariah are the main source of law."
The Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a major claim, hoped to be able to replace "principles" with "rules", which would have allowed for stricter application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is a pledge of their goodwill and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy", answered the Liberals, who see it only as a coup d'communication.
For according to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
These include section 220, which gives Al-Azhar University an advisory role, in particular in verifying compliance with the Sharia law.
According to Egyptian expert Sophie Pommier, it is worrying because "people called to pronounce are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
You can see the firstfruits of a theocracy."
The fears of the Liberals are further exacerbated by the fact that the next rector of this university should be much less moderate than the current one.
"For the time being, there is no concrete religious involvement.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the civil state.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not oulemas but academics, for some trained in the French system" tempers Alexis Blouet, who prepares a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges "that there may be an ambiguity around article 220, because the terms used borrow from religious vocabulary.
It refers to the "fiqh" in particular [Islamic jurisprudence, ndlr].
And in the future, the question might arise as to how competent civilian judges are to decide."
Beyond its religious aspect, the text voted yesterday is highly criticized because of its extended powers to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood argues that these are significantly reduced in comparison to what they were under the former regime.
Another contentious point: the powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the review of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a National Defence Council.
Nor will trials of civilians in military courts be prohibited, as called for by human rights associations.
The latter also express their concerns about the text, which they consider to be liberticide.
The crime of blasphemy is maintained and insult is now prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, including the press.
In addition, there are no more articles that reflect the protection of women, says Human Rights Watch's Heba Morayef.
In her view, the only positive point was the prohibition of torture under article 36.
The word did not appear in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to speak on television last night, demonstrations are scheduled this afternoon.
The support of the Head of State will march them on Saturday.
In Israel, holy places, the center of the world and a sea of brine await Ukrainian tourists
The Promised Land brings together the greatness of Bible truths, modern comfort and wild nature.
Argumenty i Fakty has chosen five major reasons for going to Israel.
Go and worship the holy places
Make yourselves indispensable: the banks of the Jordan, where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that whoever enters these "baptismal funds" will be touched by the divine Grace.
As for Galilee, it is the land of Jesus' miracles: where water was changed into wine, where Jesus walked on water, where he soothed the storm, or where fishing was miraculous.
It was in this particular place that Jesus appeared before his disciples after the Resurrection.
But where you will find the most holy places, it is in Jerusalem.
Believers walk through the Rue de la Sufferance or the Way of the Cross (Latin: Via Dolorosa).
This path begins near the Antonia fortress (the pretoria), where the trial took place, then leads through the streets of the old city to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on the Golgotha, to the place of the Crucifixion, then to the Stone of the Onction and to the tomb.
Here is the Christian center of the world, symbol of the salvation of mankind.
According to the Christian legend, the monastery of the Cross is erected at the place where the tree used to make the cross on which Jesus was crucified grew.
Jerusalem also houses the most sacred place of the Jews: the Wall of Lamentations, which constitutes the rest of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 B.C.
According to tradition, people of different faiths leave small words with prayers that are then answered.
Travel in height
Visit the ruins of the Massada fortress, a former refuge against enemies built by Herod the Great in 25 BC for his family.
These ruins are located on the steep rocks of a mountain 450 m above sea level.
Only mountaineering enthusiasts can go there by their own means.
For the others, a cable car takes them to this summit full of history.
In the north of the country, between 1,600 and 2,040 m of altitude, is the ski resort of Mont Hermont, which welcomes many tourists in the winter.
A shuttle can take you there from the foot of the mountain.
The ski slopes are a total of 45 km long.
Old beliefs want pagan gods to have once inhabited the top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
This country houses nearly 300 museums.
It is impossible to visit them all during a single stay.
Here are the five most interesting ones that are really worth the detour.
First of all: the Israel Museum located near the Knesset (Parliament).
It houses the very ancient manuscripts of Qumrân, or manuscripts of the Dead Sea, discovered in the caves of the Judean Desert, as well as nearly 500 miles of archaeological and anthropological objects.
Also worth seeing: the Tel Aviv Museum of Art.
The paintings of Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso are mainly exhibited.
In Acre, the Hammam Al-Basha awaits you with its Turkish baths composed of moulds of visitors and supervisors of the time.
Once in Caesarea, enter the only private Ralli Museum where you can admire the sculptures of Rodin.
There are no guides or souvenir shops.
The entrance is free and donations are forbidden.
The fifth museum is the Museum of the Holocaust or Memorial of Yad Vashem, located in Tel Aviv, which returns to the most dramatic historical pages of history.
The most tragic part is the children's memorial, built in memory of 1.5 million children exterminated in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter and enter into total darkness.
Stars sparkle.
You then hear the names of Jewish children and the names of countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Health and well-being
Israel's three major seaside resorts are located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
Each offers swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and giant aquariums.
Note: you can swim in the Red Sea even in winter, as the temperature of the water does not fall below 21° while that of the air can reach 23°.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and you can swim there all year round.
By the way, it is the most unique sea in the world: it occupies the lowest point of the Earth, 417 m below sea level.
Azur-coloured water contains brine and very easily retains bathers, even those who can't swim.
The landscapes that surround it are of surreal beauty.
We come here to treat various diseases such as dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes, but also to just relax.
Discover the secrets of ancient times
They are guarded by the old town of Tel Aviv, Jaffa, on the edge of the Mediterranean Sea.
It is crossed by the famous Via Maris, which connects Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it was here that Noah built his ark and that Perseus saved the beautiful Andromede, with whom he lived a long and happy life here.
Tourists especially like to walk in narrow alleys that bear the name of the signs of the zodiac.
It is said that if you touch the walls of the street corresponding to "your" sign, fate will smile at you.
In Jaffa you will be able to meet young married people who have come to take photos of all Israel and even other countries.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can walk through the Roman theatre, "conquer " the fortress of the crusaders.
Under the Roman Empire, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Note to tourists
If you go to Israel, don't worry about your English: about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
For your trip, it is better to prefer the dollars to the euro, as they are easily exchangeable in shekels (today $1 is equivalent to 3.8 shekels).
As far as urban transport is concerned, it is mainly the buses, but Jerusalem is equipped with a fast tram and Haifa has the only metro line in the country, consisting of six stations and able to connect the lower and upper parts of the city.
It's almost an underground funicular.
The journey in all types of public transport costs 6 shekels and allows you to make changes for 1h30.
In Israel, the Jewish tradition wants to celebrate the Sabbath on Saturday.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday, markets, shops and public transport stop their activity.
And the workweek starts on Sunday morning.
Many cafés, restaurants and hotels serve only kosher food, which excludes pork, seafood, scaleless fish and dishes made up of both milk and meat.
It offers a multitude of dishes based on lamb and beef, soups and desserts based on coconut milk, but also houmous, traditional Jewish pasta, different sauces, balls of ground chickpeas, falafels, fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs in the streets of Israeli cities.
On the other hand, there are many well-nourished cats walking around in the air.
We can see them sleeping on the roofs of parked cars in the evening.
These cats love the passing places and do not refuse to be regaled.
Car rental varies depending on the brand from $37 for 24 hours (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Insurance costs $15 a day.
Renting a bike will cost you 15 shekels a day.
An entrance to the museum costs an average of 30 shekels.
The language of numbers
Three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel in 2012.
They were mostly people who came to travel and rest from the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
118.8 miles of Ukrainian tourists went to the Promised Land from January to October 2012, an increase of 51% compared to 2010, before the cancellation of the visas on 9 February 2011.
"Who has a language in Moscow goes": migrants save money to learn the language
While MPs and human rights activists are arguing about what the mandatory language test law will give, fraudsters selling "false" certificates have already made their appearance in the country
Every year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of the time, they are nationals of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to help their families stay at home.
Since 1 December, a law has entered into force and stipulates that every migrant worker will have to pass a Russian exam.
For the time being, this applies only to those who intend to work in the services, housing, personal services and retail sectors.
However, over time, the Federal Migration Service promises, testing will become mandatory for all immigrants.
In addition, knowledge of the language, as well as knowledge of the history of Russia and the foundations of law, will have to be validated.
You will need to validate your language skills in Russian to obtain and renew your work permit.
Only nationals of countries where Russian has official language status are exempt.
Nor are those who obtained educational certificates or diplomas prior to the fall of the USSR in 1991 affected by this law.
Benefit, negative attitude and protection of rights
The network of examination centres will be led by the Russian-language Institute Pushkin, the University of Friendship of Peoples, the Moscow State University, the State University of St. Petersburg and other higher education institutions in Russia.
Immigrants will be able to pass examinations in all the cities of the country: more than 160 centres have already been opened throughout the country.
This initiative to introduce examinations was supported by the members of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Service.
But, before the law comes into force, human rights defenders have already asked the question in the press on many occasions: what will it give?
What will the obligation to know Russian change for Russians and immigrants?
First of all, the representatives of the migration service say, this will reduce the number of people suffering "from slavery to work".
Many speak of defending the rights of migrant workers, explains the director of the office of the Russian Federal Migration Service in Tajikistan, Victor Sebelev.
The protection of rights must begin before they leave.
Only an organized selection system will solve the problems of foreign workers by 90%.
Problems arise for migrants without a profession, without training, those who do not know the language and who do not have medical certificates.
Without the understanding of the language, Sebelev certifies, the future migrant is destined to meet dishonest people who, on the pretext of helping him, will provide him with a "travel" in a crowded house where he and dozens of his fellows will be tormented for months without food and paper and will have to trim between 12 and 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
"They are promised one thing, and when they arrive, they are deceived, they are taken their passport, and they do not receive the salary they will receive," confirms Tajikistan's Head of Migration Services for the Work of the Migration Service, Tolib Charipov.
Don't argue with me, Officer!
However, many citizens of Central Asian republics who want to come and earn money in Russia trust that they do not only know the language of the country where they want to go, but also that they write with difficulty in their own language.
It is of course not their fault, but their misfortune: few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to follow even a fair primary education.
Indeed, their families do not even have enough to feed their children, not to mention to dress them properly and equip them for school.
As soon as they reach adolescence, these young people go out to earn money as soon as the opportunity arises.
It's hard when you don't know the language, trust them.
"You feel diminished and diminished."
Human rights defenders note, however, an important aspect of the language law.
The examinations will be intended only for migrants with legal status.
Without status, there will be no formal examination or work thereafter.
Yet most migrant workers continue to live illegally in Russia.
"Welcome or defense to enter"
Many immigrants explain that it is not so easy to obtain official status in Russia.
The reason? Administrative barriers and always these language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: between 12 and 16 thousand rubles.
And then, you can get a fake recording quickly for only 1,500 rubles.
The Russian police know that we have false documents, that we do not have a record, hence the cases of extortion.
"They ask us 100, 200 rubles, what to buy cigarettes, tea," said the journalists Oumed Khuchkadamov, a citizen of Tajikistan.
"Do it quickly, don't hurt and buy yourself a beautiful work of art"
On the first day of the entry into force of the Language Act, it was discovered that the registration documents of migrants were not the only ones to be false.
Several false language examination certificates have already been confiscated by Federal Migration Service employees.
Falsified papers come out of an ordinary color printer.
Of course, their new owners did not have them for nothing: every migrant who hoped to make it easier for the exams had to pay seven thousand rubles for this document.
This is two and a half times more expensive than the official procedure: it will cost the migrant worker three thousand rubles.
The representatives of the government and human rights defenders agree that the short-term goal is to protect the system from corruption so that it is impossible to simply buy these "tops of paper".
The authorities may give migrant workers who have not been able to validate the examination at first the time to take language courses.
In addition, immigrants who do not know Russian will be offered work in areas that do not involve actively communicating with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not deal with the arms market
The share of crimes involving legal weapons is very low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior proposes to tighten the law against civilian arms carriers.
This is the reaction of the authorities to recent incidents: whether it is the shootings carried out during the weddings or the killing organized by the Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, who caused seven deaths.
The police want to ban the use of rubber bullets in public places and raise the legal age of obtaining the weapons permit from 18 to 21 years.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that amendments to the Arms Act would be introduced in the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is happy to see that the Russian authorities are trying to solve the problem by "screwing the screw".
An open letter appeared on the Net in which its authors, representatives of various shooting centers, demanded to abandon "this senseless hardening".
The percentage of crimes committed with a registered weapon is minimal, Vasily Lesnikov, a lawyer and crime specialist for the BBC, told the Russian service.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, over a period of six months in 2012, 142 crimes were committed with a firearm registered in the police service, while 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded during the same period.
The authors of the open letter are certain that the strengthening of civil weapons laws will not prevent criminals from supplying themselves with the black market.
According to them, we can find today in Moscow any weapon for a reasonable price.
However, the Ministry of the Interior states that it controls the spread of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from factory to officer
The black market for weapons is supplied through several channels.
The main channels are five, says Victor Baranets, retired colonel who served for ten years at the Ministry of Education and Headquarters.
Screenshot from a site taking weapons commands
The first is "the military trace", that is, the weapons that were stolen during the military operations in the Caucasus.
"These weapons were stolen by Russian officers, but also by the Caucasians," explains Baranets.
The second type of weapons from the black market are those stolen by criminals from law enforcement.
Baranets explains that these are both weapons stolen from police stocks and weapons stolen directly from law enforcement officials.
Illegal pistols go on sale from military warehouses.
Many of the latter have often suffered explosions.
"Attested versions indicate that some fires were deliberately triggered to conceal the deficit," explains the former member.
For Baranets, the weapons manufacturers are there for something.
"We see private weapons factories that do not compete with competition on the international market and leak weapons on the black market, especially in Moscow," says one expert.
One of the other sources of the black market is smuggling.
A large proportion of pistols and machine guns come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is a local production, sometimes artisanal, a mafia has formed and organizes the supply," adds the former military.
Where do the guns come from?
Experts assessed the approximate share of each source of illegal weapons in the black market.
A report on this issue was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Study for Public Administration.
Specialists analysed the reports of the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminal records and public data on arms portals.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, the researchers explain, come from the army and law enforcement agencies.
Half of the weapons on the black market were found there "because of the employees whose work is related to the weapons," the report explains.
According to researchers, 17% of weapons come from places of military conflict, 14% are stolen at the time of manufacture and 5% come from "hidden searches".
A seller and consultant at an armory who asked to keep anonymity ensures that for a long time no one has bought the weapons found by these specialists in the clandestine search; they are too old.
Most often, according to him, the sellers will look for the new goods in the military warehouses.
The person buys through a unit, e.g. a TT gun.
We deliver it to him by passing the goods through a wire.
"He transports it to the city and sells it for 900 € per unit with two chargers," he says.
"It is true that the police are aware of all cases, so when crimes are about to be solved, they make a purchase of control from illegal arms dealers," the seller adds.
" Like in a luxury shop "
The seller and buyer are generally found through knowledge.
I looked at sites, blogs, until a guy shows up and offers me to come to Begovaya station where someone was going to take me to a "coin" to bargain.
The price of the gun, they gave it to me on the spot.
Victor Baranets as a military observer
To find a gun, I need to know someone who has a contact, explains the seller. I know someone, but I don't trust him.
There are sellers in the markets, but there you have to come too, saying for example "from such a person, who asked me to transmit that his daughter lost a tooth".
Now I even buy a pair of American fists with the help of someone I trust.
He only gives them to me because he knows I won't give it to him.
The new kids are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former soldier Victor Baranets tried as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he was preparing to publish an article on the subject.
The patterns, according to him, have not changed.
We gave him a photo album in which there was "everything we want."
"I thought I was in a luxury shop," recalls the military.
There is no secret to the buyer, explains Baranets, we can try everything.
As a potential customer, I don't just buy, we go with the salesman to the forest and we set up a target.
"I'm allowed to shoot and when I'm convinced that the weapon is working well, we start negotiating," the expert describes.
A shop from his couch
Search engines display sites and groups on Vkontakte where you can buy weapons "for different uses".
To do this, we don't need any documents and no one to meet.
"It's enough to have a precise amount of money," it says in advertising on the "Buy a gun or a combat machine gun" website.
Users leave their request and ask their questions.
And we sell to the miners?
"Unlicensed, of course," asks the user "Ivan" (preserved spelling).
"Buy TT. Moscow", writes "Fedorenkov" in his very direct request.
The Federal Security Service has spread a huge network of fake sites and is excavating people who want to buy combat weapons.
People roam on food like hungry wolves and then they find themselves exploiting coal in Siberia

I have heard about such schemes: usually, the site is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People take over.
The buyer makes the payment on the automatic terminals.
"He receives in return a photo and instructions indicating where the weapon is hidden," explains the secretary of the "Right to a weapon" association, Dmitry Kislov.
Victor Baranets claims that by applying on the site, we can find ourselves unarmed and behind bars.

One Makarov for $100
The purchase of an illegal firearm, experts estimate, can cost between $100 and $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the "Right to a weapon" association, you can buy a Makarov gun for $100-300.
We'll have to wait about a month and a half.
It was removed from long-term warehouses by the management of these medium-sized warehouses.
According to the Ministry's official data, the overall number of these crimes in Russia decreased by 7 per cent over the period January-October 2011 and amounted to 22.9 miles, while the reported cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosive substances and bombs dropped by 7.8 per cent.
United States: employees of fast food and supermarkets are on strike
Nearly a quarter of American teens go through cashier work at McDonald's
In recent days, a wave of protests has come up against the low wages of Walmart supermarkets and the famous fast food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
At the moment, no one can predict whether this wave is going to grow or be blown away quickly.
These actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing associations.
In addition to the modest wage increases in Walmart and fast food chains, the organisers of the events want to obtain the creation of trade unions.
This sector is not currently covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The demonstrations began last week, after Thanksgiving, the "Black Friday", at a time when a heavy rain of sales taking over millions of people fell on America and sometimes sparked sparks.
On that day, some employees of Walmart, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, left their jobs to organize pickets of strikes with the unions and left-wing activists in the company's stores whose products are intended for consumers in the modest and middle classes.
Walmart sells everything: from diapers to hunting rifles to car batteries, vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
On average, the products are 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That's why many poorly paid employees at Walmart shop only at their workplace.
The price and choice of products made Walmart one of the most powerful groups in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell its cheap products, especially because of the low wages of its employees.
They also complain about difficult working conditions, such as lack of lift trucks or portable scanners.
The participants of the "Black Friday" protests demanded an increase in salary, they complained that the price of the medical insurance provided by the company had increased from $30 to $100 per month.
For the basic employee at Walmart who gets $9.5 an hour, that's a sum he can't afford.
Scientists at Berkley California University show that if Walmart increased the average salary to $12 per hour, it would cost the group $3.2 billion.
This is 1.1% more than it currently spends.
If Walmart transferred all the wage increases to consumers' shoulders, each race in the store would be 46 cents more.
They will spend only one year $12.39 more than now.
Walmart's supporters note with satisfaction that the protests took place in only nine states and did not harm the group.
The "Black Friday" continued in stores from 8am to midnight the following day and Walmart sold over this period 5000 items per second.
Its caisses carried out 100 million transactions for the "Black Friday".
Dan Fogleman's spokesman in an interview at the left-hand site Huffington Post assured that "less than five" Walmart employees had left their jobs and that the protest was only a "com' operation among many others" on the part of the organizing union.
"Next customer!"
Protests continued this week in New York and also concerned Walmart stores (in this progressive city, they are not much appreciated, which is why they are not yet established) but McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's announces selling billions of servings and after they don't even give you sick leave and don't pay you the job you did honestly!
Jumaane Williams, New York City Council Member
Currently, the minimum wage under federal and New York legislation is $7.25 per hour.
Fast food increases over time, but little by little, on average its base employees earn New York $8.90 an hour.
No one touches less than them in this town.
For me it's inconceivable to live with that money in New York.
There was a time when almost a quarter of American teenagers worked at McDonald's after high school while living with their parents.
Few people saw their main source of income or wanted to stay there for a long time.
Today, I find myself interviewing McDonald's employees who complain about having to live with this salary and sometimes having to feed their children with it.
On the other hand, on the Wall Street Journal's forum we find comments saying that it is irresponsible to make children if you don't know what you're going to feed them with.
Protesters who launched the movement on Thursday at 6:30 a.m. near 40th Street McDonald's and Madison Avenue demanded that the cashiers and cooks of fast food be paid at least $15 an hour, a multiplication of more than twice the current minimum wage.
They also called for the establishment of trade unions in the fast food sector.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from obstructing and punishing union protesters for bullying or dismissals.
However, administration rarely simplifies their lives.
For a union, grabbing fast restoration remains a difficult task, and that, for concrete reasons.
One of the most important is the extraordinary rotation of staff.
They don't agree.
Other tumultuous events were held close to several other fast food chains.
The highlight of the protest was the midday rally near the McDonald's Times Square with the intervention of several local democrat politicians, including that of Jumaane Williams, a member of the City Council, who said: "McDonald's announces selling billions of portions and after they don't even give you sick leave and don't pay you the job you did honestly!".
The protesters were supported by other prominent New York Democrats, notably by Mayor Bill De Blasio's candidate who said that "we must all support the employees of fast food so that they get a fair wage and the economic well-being that every New Yorker deserves.
The New York Times characterized this event as the most important event in the fast food industry in its history.
But only a few hundred people participated, not to mention that not all were fast-food workers, who employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
It is difficult for the moment to say whether this spark of mass movement will make small ones.
"For now, we can only mislead the brain."
Recently, fans of new technologies have become used to perceiving augmented reality through special glasses.
Initially, Google unveiled its current model this summer at its annual conference and in November we learned that Microsoft had applied for the patent.
However, it appears from the interview with the director of the interactive 3D technology group at the Microsoft Cambridge laboratory, Shahram Izadi, that for the scientists of this company, glasses are already ancient history.
They are tempted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in bare-handed air, by the creation of open virtual spaces.
- Could you tell us in a few words what your research group is doing?
- We are working on the interaction between man and machine and at the same time trying to widen the boundaries of this interaction.
Humanity as a whole has remained for the moment at pixels on flat screen and sometimes at touch.
We want to look 5 to 10 years ahead of us and guess the radical changes that will occur with this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox is sold today without Kinect because everyone is interested in the control by gesture.
- What does the future hold for us, too?
- Although the Kinect has made physical interaction, a lot of things happen on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of the information has been improved (the system receives more data), but the performance, at the moment, not really.
We're trying to change that and we're working on truly 3D imaging systems that work on different technologies, including projection technologies.
You have to get the computer world out of ours, into the physical world, make it more tactile.
For this, however, it is necessary to identify not only the user, but also the space that surrounds him.
Thus, we can complement the real world with virtual objects in a more practical form.
And for starters, let's get rid of these stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think of the voice control?
She's appreciated, but isn't she overestimated?
One cannot say that it is the panacea: the question of confidentiality arises because one does not always want to inform others of its actions or intentions.
In fact, each type of interaction with the computer is good, but each in its niche.
For example, to order the devices in public places, we had a project for which we thought of gestures, not broad gestures, but rather discrete, restricted gestures.
The gestures were not captured by the camera of the aircraft, but by a hand-held bracelet that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is now large, but it is theoretically possible to reduce it to the size of a watch.
In fact, the future will be marked by the mixed command, for example: gesture + voice.
- What do you mean?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass this can?
You'd do it with the word and the gestures.
- I usually only talk.
- Oh, it's gonna be hard to recognize.
- So you want to force users to adapt according to what the machine can or can't do at some point?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual rapprochement.
I think that very soon we will have to work on the development of new types of sensors that will allow us to better identify human reactions.
It can be for example laser sensors, they produce quite a good resolution in depth and it is very important.
- If we're interested in your work on Xbox Kinect sensors, what don't you like in modern cameras?
Do they lack resolution, depth or something else?
- In principle, it is the current generation that we rely on in our work on 3D recognition.
Obviously it would be good to get about 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 c/s.
But the problem is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
Compared to this last point, all current technologies are quite good, adding work to algorithm designers.
We must keep in mind the resolution according to axes X and Y, but also Z.
Speed also matters a lot, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and the 30 c/s really aren't enough, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our laboratory in Redmond, gave the touch of the sensors a regular delay of treatment between 1 and 100 μs, with the current sensors being closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands how much this influences the interaction of man and the machine.
I'd need a device like this in my work, but I don't need to touch it, to get more frames in the second.
- But shouldn't we increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect now has three cameras, one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the second is a reflected signal receiver.
And the third camera is actually a usual sensor of the visible field.
It is not used to define the depth of the object.
A lot of cameras could solve this problem...
Or make it worse by increasing the required volume of calculations.
It would be interesting to create a soft product similar to the Kinect, play with the camera curve and see how this could help define the locations.
- As far as I can remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present his glasses to the public.
Don't you think that from the point of view of the daily use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the platforms with the most perspectives?
- Of course, walking all the time with a smartphone hands up is not practical but here's what I think: the best option would be an increased reality "transitional" that would allow you from a cloud platform to pass glasses to the smartphone.
The glasses are a very personal device and this is what makes them strong (the personal elements are the ones you are the only one to see) and at the same time their weakness: the reality increased from the glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects in collaboration with other people.
- Let us imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is no longer accessible only to Tony Stark in Iron Man but also to the mere mortal.
There is a problem on which opponents of this idea point their finger: there is no tactile sensation!
Hands don't feel anything!
What are your group's responses to this challenge?
- In my classes, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth could very well be the addition of tactile sensations.
For the moment, one of the interesting techniques is the use of the second hand to serve as image support.
It records the pressures perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are really meant to attribute palpability to these "images in the air": for example the interference of several ultrasound rays directed towards a specific point where the finger is located and which gives you the sensation, for the moment still weak, of an air breath on the tips of the fingers.
There are also bracelets on wrists that influence nerve endings of fingers, they are also a work axis with perspectives.
- And you tried to fool the brain?
Make him think he feels what he should normally feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried yet.
There's still a task down there that will take a long time to get hurt: how to make someone physically believe in a very small space that he's walking in an almost infinite open space - we're working on the concepts of racing rugs (nothing to do with those in fitness clubs), mobile platforms and also giant balls.
At the moment, we can only deceive the brain, there are still many years of work.
This is what makes the work on virtual reality so interesting for the researcher: many things are still in the absolute state of fertilization.
The reign of taste and not culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "La avant-garde petersbourgeois" dedicated to urban dwellers who are in advance, at the avant-garde of culture and art.
This ultra-selective list has already welcomed prominent actors from the Saint Petersburg art scene whose achievements go beyond the city's border and who have found recognition in Europe, after having been known throughout Russia.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is extraverted painter Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, this rather bearded man, all red dressed up that you can meet near the Russian Museum, the Summer Garden or even in the trendy parties and openings.
Kirill Miller's paintings always bring crowds together, no matter where they are.
He is one of the fundamentally social and philosophical peter-bourgeois storytellers, one of the founders of the new myths.
Kirill Miller is an eminent representative of the vanguard of the far-fetched bourgeoisie of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
It is also the symbol of the city, its appearance makes the inhabitants smile and puts them in a good mood.
He recently took a Barbary organ into his hands and became the symbol of this instrument in St. Petersburg as he had matured enough for this difficult role by his existence, his philosophy and his image as a Bohemian.
- Kirill, why do you walk around the city in red and not in yellow or turquoise blue, for example?
- I've chosen red as a tailor who specializes in appearance and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between the painter, the image creator and society.
Even if in society, anything that is not grey provokes aggression and negative agitation.
But my provocations are meant to start the discussion.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to discussion.
- And when did you realize you were supposed to be a painter?
- At the exhibition of the Nevskiy Palace of Culture where my works were.
I realized it was my way.
So, the wave of old unofficial painters had passed and the new, free ones, in my genre, were misunderstood.
I began to bond with the painters of the new wave, with those of the Postgazonevchtchina who gave birth to "Pouchinskaya-10" and then there was no more wave.
I'm interested in theatre, fashion, music, all genres except words.
It was important for me to find myself at the centre of St. Petersburg culture where the best creative forces must gather together.
In 1995, I took a seat in Pushkinskaya-10, which had previously housed a musical and artistic club, a Bohemian club, the house of the Bohemian peter-bourgeois.
Many were born there: Noms, Tequila-jazz, I still see Chnour arriving with the project "The Van Gogh ear".
Chnour and his friends sang easy songs in playbacks in soft jerseys, they counted among them Igor Vdovin, composer today in fashion.
When the band started performing live, it became Leningrad.
Trakhtenberg was running a lot of shows before the Hali Gali era.
We gave them Trakhtenberg and it was then that his great career began, but his basic training and education was at our home that he received them.
Galerie "D137", Club "Griboyedov": these are the repercussions of the Artistic Clinic.
Our employees went there as usual.
I am a hero of the past century, of the time when culture meant something.
In 2000, a survey was organized in the press: it was the prize "The personalities of our city".
I was named Painter of the Year, and that's when my reign ended.
It is not convenient to work in a new era with old rules, I am a representative of the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today it's easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things, you can be popular, but not really a person of culture.
- Your work is characterized by a recognizable style.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they have a very high topicality and acuity.
I'm going to have an exhibition scheduled "The Russian Museum Through Clowns".
Clowns belong to a timeless category.
Before I was a socialist, today it hurts and it scares me to be like this.
But with clowns, everything fades away, the tragic falls.
I like grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the idea of saving the world through total and mandatory disguise.
Today, it is the habit that matters, we are interested in the external mechanism, but not inside the person.
Maybe we can't give him a hand, but we have to spit on him.
And the lie will be erased by disguise.
- Recently we saw you in the role of Barbarian organ player. - A cultural city must have that kind of hero.
Who but me can play it.
- But maybe commercial art can also be beautiful?
- Today, commercial art must be treated, delicate, liqueur.
A disintegration of culture is occurring.
Before, people were divided into herds, bohemian supporters loved one thing, denied another.
Today, everything is divided into micro-communities, it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar bill to please everyone.
Today, you have to think about who you're going to like.
Every star has 100 fans.
- But several thousand people come to see Stas Mikhailov!
- They're people we've thrown out who come to see him, it's the sexual and social side that works.
But for the cultural side, 300 people will come, 10 miles won't come, and ultimately it's less management, money, everything goes downhill.
I have my fans, the main thing is not to deceive them, not to spoil the experience.
When I was young, I painted paintings that a collector hung beside Falk or Larionov.
I started with the paintings that usually are the ones we paint at the end of life.
Today, ideas are often confused.
They say: there is spiritual culture, the culture of consumption.
Consumption has no culture, it has nothing to do with it.
I am a representative of yesterday's culture, I grew up with the example of painters who lived in poverty and died in poverty and who refused money just for painting.
I'm for this culture.
- Kirill, what's missing in St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is this concept: the official of culture.
But not everyone can work in culture.
During the reign of the good Tsars, it was not like that, the Tsars did not understand culture well, but they understood that it was necessary to keep the good experts.
In Moscow, there are now good consultants.
We have people here in St. Petersburg who could be experts, but they are excluded, because we need higher experts who will properly evaluate these experts and lead their way.
Currently, it is the "kingdom of taste" that blooms.
The same Erarta, but they differ in the sense that they honestly say that they do not take all contemporary art, that there are painters who must find other museums.
- What's St. Petersburg to you?
- St. Petersburg is not the cultural capital, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is a soil for it.
And on our rocks, art is hard to grow.
We need a cultural floor and we have more writers than readers, that's bad.
In Europe, there are many curious people who will see exhibitions, concerts.
At home, this layer is very thin.
We must make art fashionable as it was at the beginning of the last century.
Project carried out with the support of the St. Petersburg Stock Exchange
Birth in space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a deadly asteroid.
Space shuttle caravans with earthenware on board are on their way to find a rescue planet.
To save humanity, a big question arises: how can we continue to make our species live in distress or on a rescue planet?
I don't think there's much choice.
In fact, there are two real planets that can be conquered, if only by hypothesis.
" Venus and Mars, " says Vladimir Sourdine, a researcher at the State Astronomical Institute P.K. Chternberg (GAICh).
If on Mars the conditions are more suitable for life, the temperature at the surface of Venus is 500 .
We can only live there at very high altitude or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
We began to focus on the issues of reproduction in space by focusing on flora.
Half a century ago, we were experimenting on plants.
Four generations of small peas grown in orbit did not differ in any way from terrestrial varieties.
Then, insects, small reproductive drosophilic flies, were placed in orbit.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to see how an embryo developed in weightlessness.
We get a perfectly normal chick at the exit.
Then the problems begin.
" The problem is related to the fact that the chick has to find support, he has to get on his feet and start moving," explains the director of the laboratory of the Institute of Medical-Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences (IMBP) Vladimir Sychev.
By not finding any support, the chicks were agitated in a disorderly way.
And after 10 hours, the newborns saw their instincts completely overrun.
The chicks did not react to light or sound.
Unfortunately, they would simply die after four days.
"We peeled their eyes twice, then we gave up, because it is simply impossible to work with them there," explains Vladimir Sychev, noting the failure of the experiment with chicks in space.
The last biological "miniature ark" with animals was sent to orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, the biosatellite "Bion" will only board species of the same sex.
There was an experiment with rats sent with their fetuses into space.
In principle, nothing supernatural was discovered.
" It was still biosatellites, and then it's the only experience, and we have to do this kind of research, " notes Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the space rats gave birth to their offspring.
However, reproductions are not yet possible directly in space.
It's not a big deal.
By losing their usual environment, animals are no longer able to realize their sexual instincts.
Unlike beasts, man is capable, in principle.
Homo sapiens possess abstract thinking, he is able to create a suitable emotional background.
This type of experience is not carried out for ethical reasons.
But women have been in space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was taken by Terechkova.
And the female organism is what humanity has most precious.
Our seagull flew and no one on Earth could tell if it would hold after a flight into space.
If she could have given birth to a child after the robbery.
" No one answered that question, " explains Vakhtang Vatchnadzé, retired from the rocket and space sector.
In June 1964, just a year after her flight into space, the first cosmonaut woman Valentina Terechkova gave birth to a little girl.
The father of the child, Andrian Nikolayev was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second cosmonaut woman Svetlana Savitskaya, having been in orbit twice and even working in an extra-vehicle environment, gave birth to a son.
However, the risk persists.
We have few, even very few cosmonauts who have had nothing and who give birth to a healthy offspring after long flights.
" And if they are longer, it presents a danger even during flights in orbit, " concludes the pilot and cosmonaut, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of Russia, Valeriy Poliakov.
Yet humanity must seek new solutions in biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
Hydrology Laboratory of the Centre for the preparation of cosmonauts: mandatory stage of the preparation for flight.
Here, in zero buoyancy, the cosmonauts train at the extra-vehicle exits.
Water mimics weightlessness.
If for adults the water is comfortable but a foreign environment, for infants, it is their real element.
Small amphibious men seem to confirm this: life on Earth comes from the ocean.
As the baby evolves about 9 months into the lymphatic fluid of his mother's stomach, it is easier for him to get used to water afterwards.
This is logical in principle, because from its birth to its first bath, it only takes 2 weeks.
" It's very little to forget, " explains the infant swimming instructor Marina Aksenova.
In a word, if for the child who has just been born the weightlessness is a more natural state, the woman needs gravitation, a weight force.
In weightlessness, the muscles of the belly and the pelvis atrophy very quickly, the baby's push capacity is lost.
All right, let's just ignore this by relying on birth simulators.
Of course we can prepare a delivery in a special room, the woman will get him out.
"And then?" asks Valeriy Poliakov to invite us to reflect on this complex question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravitation.
If it does not feel the Earth's attraction, the body does not form the skeleton or the muscle system.
You can't dress an infant like an adult with a special training suit.
He will simply be deprived of his vital needs.
"And this experience that we would consider in this case by imagining the birth of a child in a foreign environment will lead to the return to Earth of a disabled child, completely disabling," says the Director of the Bioethics Committee of the Institute of Medical-Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.
The birth of children in space is still part of the theory.
However, over time this will become a reality, when the Terrians travel in their shuttles to a distant planet that will become the habitat of their offspring born in space.
The head of the ISC (Superior Institute of Public Finance Control) said: "The control of pseudo-independent work (in Czech "Švarc system") failed because of politicians.
In the area of public procurement, the Czech Republic has competent inspectors and high-quality legislation but is lagging behind in its implementation.
This is what Miloslav Kala, Vice-President of the Higher Institute of Public Finance Control, said in an interview for Aktuálně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and, in my opinion, that is what is lacking in us," Kala said in her comment on the current situation.
A joint inspection by Czech and German inspectors also suggests similar conclusions.
He cites as an example of abusive practice the "Švarc system" approach by Petr Nečas.
Mr. Prime Minister recently stated that the SDG was not going to bother entrepreneurs with controls; is it allowed or prohibited?
"The law must be applied in one way or another, so if it prohibits anything, even the head of government cannot prevent an authority from acting to inspect to demand compliance with the law," Kala says.
At the meeting of the Monitoring Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you referred to a Czech-German draft in which the laws on public procurement of these two countries were compared.
What was it really about?
This is parallel control that we launched about two years ago.
In simple terms, European legislation provides for how to manage public procurement and specific national legislation, as well as a practice itself, are followed up.
We have gathered all this and although this monitoring procedure has not yet been completed, very interesting differences have appeared to us: generally speaking, our legislation is perhaps "more stringent and of better quality", however, according to some parameters, practice as such is better in Germany.
This confirms, therefore, that it is not sufficient to draw up ever more detailed rules, but that it is necessary to devote itself to the implementation of the law itself.
How can this project help you concretely and what results for you?
This kind of joint control should help us to stop trying to clarify laws, lower and improve thresholds, when this does not have a really positive effect.
The principle of good management means getting the thing in question at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lowest), in order to exclude any enrichment and possible criminal activity.
But by lowering market thresholds, this goal will not necessarily be achieved.
It may be that this system is so overwhelmed by paperwork that those who seek faults will find much more opportunities than if the threshold had remained higher.
You are talking about internal problems regarding the implementation of public procurement legislation.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an institution similar to our CSI or a different way of organizing?
As far as the institutions, like the ISC, operate there the Bundesrechnungshof which is organized similarly, it also has a council constituted a little differently, but these two institutions proceed basically in a similar way.
The competences are also, to a certain extent, similar, but with a nuance compared to our system: Germany being a federal structure, it therefore also has rates of this type at the level of the different Länder.
The HRB can only control federal money, which corresponds to the resources of the state.
The public funds managed at home by the regions and municipalities are controlled there at the level of the Länder' accounts.
With regard to national legislation, is it simpler than ours?
I would not like to make a general comparison without concrete data, however, in some areas Germany is often referred to as a model, but surely it cannot be said that it does better in all areas.
Maybe it's because they have better inspectors?
No, I'm sure I don't, but I repeat, I don't have comparison data.
However, it must also be said that this country, which we regard as a model, is also confronted with a whole series of problems.
Otherwise they wouldn't have any advantage in cooperating with our institution, would they?
With regard to national legislation, what did the amendment of the Public Procurement Act mean to you as an institution?
As this amendment has entered into force relatively recently, it does not yet have an impact on our control operations.
As we do post-controls, we have to count on some delay.
Our observations concern only, for the moment, the process of preparing future controls - we have launched a new instrument of "risk detection of mismanagement" with which we have screened nearly 14,000 public contracts - these changes will of course be felt, because the thresholds have been modified as well as the conditions of certain types of tendering procedures and so on.
So do you consider the adoption of this law rather as an advantage or an additional burden on the administration?
I believe that this law is a step in the right direction and I hope that the future will confirm it.
The problem that may arise is that these rules become more stringent and that they cannot be respected.
Already under the previous regulatory regime, the provider (e.g. the Regional Council, in the case of regional operational programmes) forced the controlled subjects to accept that any violation of the Market Law signifies a breach of budgetary discipline.
Is it really helpful to make the law more severe in this way?
No, not that way, I think.
The system must exclude those who want to attack or abuse the system but not punish those who make formal mistakes without any impact on the decision-making process.
Such a system will put more pressure on administration.
So what's the solution to getting out of it?
Let's look where we're not going.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the DSO was not going to bother entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called Švarc system - what does that mean?
Is the Švarc system prohibited or authorized?
The law must be applied in one way or another, so if it prohibits anything, even the head of government cannot prevent an authority from acting to inspect and demand compliance with the law.
He may say: "We will change the law and authorize it", but he cannot say that we will act as if nothing were.
The contract law contains relatively strict rules on the formalities to be performed, precisely in order to protect the tender.
But it is also tragic that a bidder should be eliminated solely because of formal defects.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and that, in my opinion, is what is lacking in us.
The roads are in frozen places, but most remain feasible.
In some parts of the Czech Republic, roads are frozen and also snowed.
The network, however, remains largely feasible, in some places with increased vigilance.
Karlovy Vary Region
In the Karlovy Vary area, the roads were practicable this morning, but in frozen and snowy places as well.
Temperatures have dropped and fluctuate between -5 ° and -10 ° C but should rise slightly during the day.
Snowfalls have stopped in the area and only a thin layer of snow remains in the plains.
The peaks of the Metalliferous Mountains (Krušné hory) are, however, covered with about 30 centimetres of snow.
The data from the regional road maintenance service show that, due to fog, visibility was reduced in places.
The R6 expressway and the region's national roads are now feasible without difficulty.
However, vigilance remains to be applied, for example on some bridges whose coating can be frozen and slippery.
All departmental roads and third category roads, including mountain roads, are also feasible.
It is still on some of their sections of frozen snow remains and in traffic-stained places.
Especially in areas at altitudes, drivers must increase their vigilance.
Regions of Pardubice and Hradec Králové
The Roads and Highways Directorate reports on its website that some roads in Eastern Bohemia are threatened by ice formation and that traffic-stained snow layers may be found on roads in mountainous areas and at altitudes.
Road maintenance services warn drivers of the risk of ice formation in areas of the Pardubice region at altitude.
There may be ice in the vicinity of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy or Vysoké Mýto, mainly on departmental and third category roads.
Roads I/43 and I/34 around Svitavy were chemically treated.
Snow is found mainly in the Giant Mountains (Krkonoše) and the Eagle Mountains (Orlické hory).
In the districts of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov, a layer of traffic-stained snow is present on roads in the highlands.
In East Bohemian, the weather will now be dry, mostly clear, with possible cloudy passages.
It will blow a low wind and temperatures will generally fluctuate between -3° and + 1° C.
Pilsen Region
Roads in the Pilsen area are now feasible, although in some places there is a need for increased vigilance and adaptation to weather conditions.
It freezes this morning, temperatures fluctuate between -3 ° and -9 ° C.
After the last snowfalls and the subsequent cooling, some channels of communication may be frozen.
Drivers can expect to cross fog zones, however visibility will gradually improve.
This is apparent from the information provided by the Regional Road Maintenance Service.
The D5 motorway can be used almost without difficulty, however, road communications maintenance services recommend increased vigilance between kilometres 80 and 131.
The coating of most national roads is dry and frozen.
Some sections can be frozen in the South Pilsen district and in the Tachov district.
The departmental and third category lanes are wet and in this case the warning against frozen sections applies.
Drivers must be vigilant, especially on the less frequented roads in the Šumava region.
Olomouc Region
Drivers travelling to areas of the Olomouc region at altitudes must now have a thick and soft snow layer on the roads.
This layer remained on the collar called "Červenohorské sedlo" and on the road towards Videlský kříž, after the chemical treatment operations.
Snowfalls forced road maintenance personnel into the field that night; according to road services, it fell more than three centimetres in the Šumperk district.
In other parts of the region, most roads are easily accessible.
" On the heights of Šumperk district are remains of snow.
Drivers travelling towards Jeseník must expect to meet at the pass called "Červenohorské sedlo" a thick and soft snow layer " declared today to ČTK the head of road maintenance services of the district of Šumperk.
Their colleagues in the Jeseník district also went there at night; according to them, after the chemical treatment carried out, the roads are now clear and wet, even in the highest areas.
In the district of Olomouc roads are easy to do, however in the district of Šternberk drivers should pay attention in the sections in forest areas to the wet roads.
Regions of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec
This morning, the maintenance services of the roads of North Bohemia reported several difficult sections.
According to police data, in addition to some places covered with snow or ice, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice na Ústecku is closed.
Temperatures will remain below zero at lower altitude, and therefore snow and ice should remain on the roads. On the plains, especially to the south-east of the Bohemian Central Plateau, there are, on the contrary, no problems and roads are generally dry.
No traffic difficulties have been reported at this time.
Road maintenance services reported the presence of ice, particularly around Štětí.
According to meteorologists, the night conditions were ideal for its formation: rain and snowmelt during the day, clear skies and freezing during the night.
From the main traffic routes, there are also difficult conditions on the national road 13 at the border between the regions of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec.
The closure of the traffic between Telnice and Kninice is due to branches of trees that have bent under the weight of snow until reaching the road.
Šimon Ornest said: "In concert, we want to collect positive energy."
What do you think of the fact that in less than a month this should be the end of the world?
It's just one of those alarming news, the kind of traps we like to fall into.
In our Tap Tap group, we laugh rather and say that we are the only group able to collect a surplus of positive energy in order to repel or prevent the end of the world.
In addition, in December you set up a very unique project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you present this project in more detail to our readers?
This is a charity that we have been preparing for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the Maya calendar announced for December 21 at 11:10 a.m.
The previous day, on December 20, three concerts will take place simultaneously, in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will almost end when the Maya calendar on the island of Kiribati, which is in the peaceful ocean, will end, on a time zone 12 hours ahead of us.
Who had that idea?
At first I think it was my idea, then we designed everything with our creator, Honza Augusta.
Apart from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to save the world, we also want together, with the public, to reflect on the state of the world that we leave to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Maya calendar, we created a collection of unique items, including shoes, T-shirts, bags, and original keys against the end of the world, buying them online at www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The Tap Tap group with other interpreters also recorded an anthem against the end of the world, entitled "End of the world cancelled" (in Czech "Konec světa zrušeno").
She is already very popular on YouTube, will we also hear her at these charitable concerts?
Of course, all in the end, finally, if we succeed and the end of the world does not take place ...
She will be sang simultaneously by all the performers in the three concerts.
The anthems will also be joined at some point in a single live Czech television show.
The lyrics of this song were written by Tomáš Hanák who also plays the main role of Jesus in the clip, Xindl X sings there as well...
How did you come to cooperate with them?
We collaborate with other personalities of the Czech show-biz, due to the fact that we organize numerous concerts and charitable events...
We are trying to get them to participate intensively in these projects.
It turned out that most of them are interested in such cooperation and that it amuses them.
What will the benefits of these concerts serve against the end of the world?
To equip the Studeo training centre which is accessible to people with reduced mobility and which we are working on in the framework of the Jedlička Institute, with the Tap association, and this for six years.
Teachers regularly visit students at the Jedličkův Institute and offer them activities that interest them and entertain them.
Students themselves do not have the means to go to classes, we try to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the construction of the Jedlička Institute, we will transfer this project to a new independent building.
Will several music bands and performers go on stage at each of these concerts?
According to what criteria, have you chosen them?
We have tried to develop a program for all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý will be staged.
Details can be found at www.kpks.cz.
Are you also preparing for other "mega events" of this kind in the future?
In May, we will play for the first time in Prague spring; there too, we will surely prepare a quality program with interesting guests.
We would also like to play next year in the Czech Republic's house in New York and personally, once in the United States, I would like to combine concerts in Washington and Chicago.
Your international projects are minimalist, so far you have played for example in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is nevertheless a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage the organization and logistics of your tours?
It's not so bad that it looks like it's at first.
We have five members in electric chair whose equipment must travel in the hold, of course we also carry a lot of luggage and boxes of instruments....
So far everything has more or less always gone well, ČSA and British Airways were always perfectly prepared for us, they surprised me more than once.
Even in Moscow, from where we recently returned, everything went smoothly.
Thanks to your trips abroad, you can compare how these countries differ in terms of accessibility for people with reduced mobility, the attitude of the public towards people with disabilities and so on.
What have been your experiences so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than at home, we have just witnessed in Moscow that to the east is still only in an initial phase.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is still very little accessible to people with disabilities; there, it is not yet common for a person to travel alone in an electric chair in the center of the city.
They do not yet consider it obvious to give priority to a person in a wheelchair in an elevator.
Fortunately, there too, an association trying to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities is being set up.
How do we still have to catch up with the more developed countries?
There's a lot of things we're still late for...
It is important to mention that improvements and improvements always depend on the efforts of the persons concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with a heavy disability to travel alone in public spaces; they can go to the toilets, the museum, anywhere...
It is not very common there, however, that a large number of people with disabilities actively participate in social life, on this point, you, The Tap Tap, are rather at the cutting edge of progress!
Public respect and access facilities are one thing, but the situation will really start to change when we have sportsmen, artists, actors, politicians or famous lawyers.
For the moment, it is only isolated cases of people who have a strong will.
The Tap Tap Group is currently very popular, let's go back a few years, what prompted you in 1998 to create this band?
I started working as an educator at the Jedlička Institute, where I found myself surrounded by many young people ready to invest in something.
And since I myself am a musician (I play saxophone, among other things), with a colleague, we have created a music activity.
And then, over time, as our moderator Láïa Angelovič says, we have lost a little control of the situation (laughs).
Success has only happened in the last few years, if I'm not mistaken?
True, creating links with well-known singers and actively working on the group's promotion helped us.
We understand that if a job is not visible, it is as if it did not exist in the background.
Thanks to EU subsidies, we can also afford to have quality teachers, equipment, and so on.
Was it your goal to reach such a level with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt that there was a potential to change things.
The show business is full of things that copy each other.
In a way, it makes sense: everything that is new is accepted with caution and it lasts a long time.
Few are the original projects, and I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is naturally pity, it is natural ...
But pity is totally useless, because people with disabilities are not suffering beings, abandoned by all, that we must take pity on.
They are people who can live a full life and flourish, provided they have the necessary means.
I often say that when people with disabilities achieve something, it is not only an advance for them but for society as a whole.
Isn't your success also due to the fact that you are a demanding leader, as you are qualified by many people?
If we are to do quality work, we must be intransigent in many areas and demand discipline.
But I think it's quite normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic vision and head in the clouds and, when they realize that they have to come to rehearsals twice a week, take preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the roads for concerts, they quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But it works the same way in every group that wants to work and achieve goals.
The Tap Tap Group currently has 20 members.
How many of them were there in 1998?
Only one, there's Angelovič.
We're an open group, people come in and out, there's nothing we can do.
Our doors are always open to those who want or would like to join us.
This will be the case on the eve of the scheduled day of the end of the world, on Thursday, December 20, 2012 from 9 p.m.
This action will take place in Prague in the Incheba arena, Brno in Fléda and Ostrava in Plynojem with the participation of twelve groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic.
At the end of the evening, these three cities will be connected by audio-visual relay when the song of the band The Tap Tap "End of the World Cancelled" will be co-sung.
The aim of the concert is to raise financial resources (amounting to CZK 25 million) to equip the multifunctional Studeo training centre in Prague at the Jedlička Institute.
The price of a ticket to this concert is 400 CZK, the entrance is free for children up to 12 years old, the pre-sale ticket is open in Bohemiaticket.
Poland and the cosmos.
Last week, at the meeting of ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency, Poland was admitted as a twentieth member of that agency, it is the second member State of the former Eastern bloc (the Czech Republic became a full member on 12 November 2008).
Poland had started close collaboration with ESA in 1994 and over the years that followed participated in a number of Agency projects.
However, Poland's road to space began much earlier.
Already before the Second World War, passionate Poles worked on space flights; they did not always meet understanding.
I would like to mention, for example, A. Šternfeld's conference at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory on 6 December 1933, at which he presented ideas from his avant-garde book "Introduction to Astronautics".
The developments of this young engineer (born 1905) left the listeners cold and years later Šternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934 Šternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Prize for his work "Introduction to Astronautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a great propagator of astronomy and astronomy.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish newspapers and wrote many books devoted to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski has become a propagator of world-renowned astronautics, his contribution has been rewarded in particular by the fact that his name has been given to one of the craters on the hidden face of the Moon.
In 1925, a drool was built in Poland to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, neither the author nor the details of this project are known.
Nor is it clear whether the rocket was to be used to propel or brake the drool.
The only information known about this Draise is that of the press of the time.
From 1933 onwards, Polish artillery began to devote itself to rockets.
The research was conducted by the Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia Institute in collaboration with Professors Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Gustaw Mokrzyckiego.
It appears from the documents retained that this research had reached the test stage.
Of course, with the arrival of the German armies, the search stopped.
In 1937, the plans of a photoelectric hunting rocket, designed by engineer Rohoziński, appeared in the specialized press and the following year was published the book "Rakieta - torpedoa powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by an author named Leliwy-Krzywoblocki.
Both projects aimed at military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, all rocket technology projects were conducted by the interim scientific advisory committee ("Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy"), which coordinated all the work.
This committee had been established in 1937, but after two years of operation, the beginning of the war put an end to its activities.
After the war, further work on aeronautics was published in the Polish press, thanks to Polish astronaut society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, it is mentioned in the November 1954 issue of the newspaper Problememe, in which there are four more detailed articles on aeronautics.
In one of these articles, written by Professor M. Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a company dedicated to astronautics
At that time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was clear that the field of space research had a future.
At the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) made efforts to join the International Astronautical Federation (created in 1951) and in the autumn, the PTA became a regular member.
The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became vice-president of the International Astronautical Federation.
He remained in office until his death in 1959.
Starting in 1956, the PTA made a significant contribution to the successful development of the meteorological rocket RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research.
The first model, RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
This 1800-metre-range rocket was 80 cm long and weighed just under 5 kg.
Subsequently, an improved version of RM-1A was built and, in the summer of 1959, two-storey flight tests of the RM-2 rocket were initiated in the Bledov Desert.
This rocket was 1.4 metres long and probably weighed 11.5 kg.
The next prototype should have been able to perform concrete scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should have a range of up to 14.5 km and be used to observe the wind at altitude.
But in 1963, all development work was stopped.
The Meteor-1 rocket developed during the period 1962 - 1965, succeeded the first RM-type rockets.
This rocket, designed with two floors, had a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three models (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed; they were distinguished by the dimensions of the space reserved for scientific tools.
Meteor-1A had a space with a volume of 0.4 litre, while Meteor-1B had a volume of 0.34 litre and Meteor-1C had a volume of 0.62 litre.
The maximum range of all these types of equipment was 37 km.
In the period 1965 - 1968, the Meteor-2 rockets were developed in the aeronautical institute, the first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a payload of 10 kg at an altitude of approximately 60 km.
Subsequently, the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
The entry of Poland into the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the establishment of a national COSPAR committee two years later should also be mentioned.
Under the Interkosmos programme, Poland also participated in space exploration on artificial Soviet satellites and, in 1978, pilot Miroslav Hermaszewski became, after Vladimír Remek, the second non-Soviet cosmonaut of this programme.
Repealing the Public Works Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the Public Works Act.
This decision raised a lively discussion in public opinion.
There is no doubt that it is interesting to look at this issue from a broader perspective.
Economic systems oriented towards liberalism, both in the EU and in the context of globalisation, are based on the principle of more unregulated economic competition.
This means in concrete terms that the different economic entities as well as the national economic systems are perpetually in conflict with each other.
This results from the principle of free trade and free movement (without limits) of private capital combined with unbridled financial speculation.
The considerable differences in labour prices (wages) give rise to price pressures.
The following meaning should be put into effect: a producer is trying to import low-priced goods to resist economic competition by " making the competitor's price more expensive" in order to remove a greater share of the market and thus increase its own profits.
On a large scale, this means for most entrepreneurs: either to transfer production abroad, to buy at low prices, or to disappear. The result is significant unemployment in countries where labour prices are high compared to other economies.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and thus no responsibility for the unemployment it generates, the social burdens of the State necessarily increase.
This whole situation intensifys the perfect bad will of gentlemen entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thus to compensate for the economic and social damage caused to society as a whole by this race for profit.
This situation is so well known that there is no need to provide concrete statistical data.
Unscrupulous private capital practices create a situation in the different economies in which the governments of the different countries are forced to engage in mutual competition in order to artificially lower the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital.
In other words, governments put their own people at the mercy of private capital without taking into account the social collapse.
This is mainly reflected in the amendments to the laws in force.
The aim is to economically force its own population to accept the diktat of private capital prices, particularly in the area of wages.
This is achieved both by a system of economic constraints in the event of long-term unemployment and by restricting the rights of employees in the field of labour legislation.
This results in increasing poverty and deepening the differences between the rich and the poor.
In the Federal Republic of Germany, for years there have been public food distribution points for the poor who cannot support themselves with their own work.
We already count in millions the number of these people.
As part of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, it becomes quite common for employees to receive such wages that the state is forced to pay a supplement to reach the minimum living standard.
Such a scandal has, for example, been updated in the case of employees working as assistants to the federal parliament.
The economic measures of almost all the Member States of the south of the EU undoubtedly generate a similar situation in which, under pressure of a catastrophic collapse of society, people are forced either to emigrate (as was the case in the nineteenth century), or to live with wages of misery, on the margins of society, in the hope that one day private capital will invest in their country.
The question here is: where will this capital come from?
If it comes from other EU countries, then poverty will go from one country to another; this capital may not come either, or a Chinese, an Indian, a Brazilian, a Turkish, a Moroccan, an Egyptian or an African will continue to work for a fraction of a European wage.
This also applies to all of Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media say, to get tired of it, that the state cannot make capital investments in its own economy, that the run economy leads to an economic disaster.
Private capital strongly defends the idea that the state cannot intervene in the economy through regulatory interventions.
We must then ask ourselves whether private capital does not influence and, even today, does not govern, according to its own selfish interests, politics and by the same, the entire state.
The answer to this question is undoubtedly yes.
The evidence is that there is a practically all-powerful lobby present in all States.
This results in a desperate situation in the area of corruption, through the granting of mutual advantages, in the legislation, where everything is condemnable but not punishable.
In the Federal Republic of Germany, the situation is such that due to the lack of financial resources, national ministries delegate the development of bills to law firms closely related to industry.
These bills are then passed in the Bundestag.
The entire power does not come from the people, as declared by Western-type constitutions, but from powerful financial groups serving their own interests.
It is clear that liberal-oriented democracies are now rapidly confronted with the situation described by Appianos in his book entitled "the crisis of the Roman Empire in the time of Caesar and Pompeii": "The state was long in delicacy and the functions were attributed by violence.
The bribes, the favors obtained illegally, and the stones and swords were also used to obtain these posts.
The under-tables and corruption proliferated without limits and the people were going to the elections with voices already sold"... ... "The honest people were not seeking any office, it resulted once the state remained 8 months without consuls".... "We really started to say that the remedy to this difficult situation was an autocracy and that it was necessary to choose a energetic man"... It is true that Appianos had in mind Pompey, but it was Caesar who irreversibly transformed democracy into an absolutist regime.
In conclusion, as in antiquity, the present society is based on the preference of personal profit, without regard for the interests of society as a whole.
In essence, private capital is no longer capable of understanding and promoting the interests of society as a whole.
Today, as in the past, the result is an unprecedented decline of elites, without any effort to carry out profound reforms.
We must therefore look for the causes of the emergence of fascist and communist regimes in the unscrupulous liberalization of the economic systems of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
In the current state of affairs, the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of liberal democracies can be seen as a sort of pause before a new stage.
The fact that the current elites completely ignore the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future loss of life, the humanitarian and social crises that we are witnessing today and the crimes against humanity as we know them from ancient and recent history.
Repealing the Public Works Act is not a solution, at least in the long term.
Under pressure from economic competition, both internationally and internally, the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is indeed systemic.
The solution consists of socio-political reforms, which will strengthen the state's capital investments in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the position of private capital monopoly in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: Chaos laboratory.
"Nothing will ever come out of violence and never be able to," Sting says in the song entitled Fragile whose main verse of the chorus is "don't forget how fragile we are."
"If my sons didn't want wars, there wouldn't be wars," said Gutele Schnaper, Mayer Amschel Rothschild's wife on her deathbed in 1849.
Following the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as usual, many reactions have risen.
Some take Israel's side, arguing for its right to self-defence and placing Palestinians as terrorists, others support Palestinians, invoking the racism of the State of Israel, the genocide committed against the Arabs of Palestine and regard Israel as a terrorist State.
I do not want to reflect on the question of who is guilty and who is a victim, in his waves of recurrent killings; all in all, the current inhabitants of Israel, including those of the autonomous territories, were born in this political situation and did not experience the beginning of violence.
I would like to offer readers a point of view "behind the curtain", on the one that mainly benefits from the tensions that have already persisted for more than 95 years (from the Balfour Declaration in 1917) in a small part of the Middle East.
Some of these reflections are based on historical facts available for study, others emerge from my own understanding of that, or more precisely of the group of individuals, which is the main instigator of the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is above all the history of a struggle for power.
At every age, we can find an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether these individuals acted independently or owed their actions to the throne to someone who directed their actions on the basis of previously defined objectives.
We must admit that we live in a time when global wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and that this financial concentration generating certain powers has not been achieved in a single generation.
Among the families with an astronomical richness is the Rothschild family, which could be considered the head of the octopus (I don't know if these families still have a leader but I don't exclude it).
Little is written about them.
Of course.
In the 1990s, they acquired the first world news agency (Reuters) to end the link between their names and serious criminal acts that they were involved in and that had always meant to them a strengthening of their power, an increase in their fortune or both.
They have major stakes in almost most of the world's central banks and are preparing or conducting wars against countries in which they do not yet have such stakes (before the invasion of Afghanistan the number of these countries was 7, after the invasion of Iraq of 5, after the overthrow of Gaddafi only of 4, in the meantime Russia placed the Russian central bank under the control of the Russian government).
Anyone who tried to stand up against this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew to the Bank of America of the Rothschilds the status of central bank and began to issue during the civil war his own money (government, I hear well) and was murdered in a theatre in 1865.
JFK began to issue its own money and wanted to dissolve the EDF, it was murdered in 1963, MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 while he wanted to sue the EDF for triggering the great economic crisis of 1929.
Their worldwide thirst for power led in the years 1859 to 1871 to the formulation of a plan of three world wars by Albert Pike, a freemason initiated to the 33rd degree, being the highest level.
The first war was aimed at eliminating the great state monarchies of Europe, the second was to eliminate colonialism, particularly British colonialism, and the third was to reduce the world population by between 1 and 0.5 billion people (such a quantity of slaves is sufficient for their luxury and comfort), create a single universal religion (ecumenism being nothing more than the beginning of such a solution) and eventually acquire absolute power.
The method used by the clan of the richest families with at their head the Rothschild is to create a crisis and then propose a solution (order ab chaos - the order following chaos).
These solutions are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the creation of the EDF to prevent the recurrence of crises such as those they caused in 1907).
After succeeding in triggering the first world war by the assassination in Sarajevo of Ferdinand, heir Habsburg to the Austro-Hungarian throne, they destroyed Tsarist Russia by provoking the Bolshevik revolution.
The first world war ended abruptly with a German capitulation without economic and military justification (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of Tsarist Russia) and was followed by the fragmentation of Austria-Hungary, the power of Central Europe.
For an easier outbreak of the Second World War, the bankers allowed the politicians to create a situation of latent conflict: on the one hand, they imposed far-reaching war reparations on Germany, thus generating the conditions for radicalisation of the impoverished masses (they then had to place a strong enough leader, pointing fingers at the culprits, offering simple solutions) and, on the other hand, they created a Czechoslovakia composed of different nationalities, including a large German minority, which had to play the fifth (which it did) role in setting fire to the powders and trigger a war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschield inspired the creation of the Zionist movement, one of whose branches aspires to the creation of a Jewish state, preferably in the area of historical Judea with Jerusalem as capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour statement mentioned above laid the foundations for a massive emigration of Jews to Palestine and the first frictions with the Arab local population began.
Terrorist acts were committed on both sides.
The Second World War broke out; it is difficult to appreciate whether Hitler broke the chains in which the international bankers had initially held him; or if everything he did was planned, the fact is that the suffering of the Jews of Europe in the concentration camps created the basis for the acceptance of a Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948; just as the war reparations imposed on Germany led to the Second World War, the founding of the State of Israel lit a firehouse that could cause a third World War.
If international bankers succeed in triggering this war, the Jewish population will be as it was during the Second World War, the first victim of the fighting, this time as well as the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, the source of discord and chaos, not only in this country, but at the international level (it is enough to see how people strongly divide between supporters and defenders of Israel).
Who is guilty and who is victimized in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where a wrong causes another wrong according to a circle of endless violence and where, at the origin of everything, there is the greed of some individuals and their desire to acquire power over the whole world?
Here we must make the difference between the simple citizens of Israel and their leaders, because, as at home, international bankers offer people in elections only their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel is a typical example of a fascist politician, loyal to international bankers, who does everything to trigger a war with Iran, which could, due to the country's accession to the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc.) expand to become a global conflict and, given that Iran controls the Strait of Hormuz through which it transits 20% of all world oil (this naval corridor is only 2 miles wide) and generates a destruction of the world economy.
In what light now appear David Rockefeller's words in 1994: "The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new world order."
In their idea, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which a handful of finance aristocrats are served by the rest of the human population.
A world in which every new born is implanted at birth an electronic chip making him a fully controlled being.
" Let them compel all individuals, small and large, rich and poor, free and enslaved, to bear a red - iron mark on their hands or foreheads, so that they may neither buy nor sell the one who does not bear the name of this fierce beast or the number of his name.
One must understand: that he who has good sense counts the figures of this fierce beast.
This number refers to man and is six hundred and sixty-six."
The film Argo: when everything goes wrong, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a crowd of protesters made up of Islamist students stormed the American Embassy in Tehran and held 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who, after the revolution, had fled to the United States, who had supported his regime for decades.
The situation did not offer the US administration a positive outcome, it could not, in fact, abandon the Shah, because it would have seriously shaken the confidence of its allies in other countries.
However, in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was unable to obtain the release of hostages.
It was a hard blow to the prestige of the United States, further aggravated later by the fiasco of the attempt to release the hostages by force.
The kidnapped diplomats were finally released 444 days later, following negotiations organized by the Algerian government.
Their fate aroused a wave of solidarity and an anti-Iranian sentiment in the United States.
The Iranian debacle strongly contributed to Jimmy Carter's defeat against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film Argo, by actor and director Ben Affleck, describes an episode of this story that offered America a small victory.
Just before she was busy, six employees escaped from the embassy.
After complicated journeys, they found themselves in the residence of the Ambassador of Canada.
In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to get them out of Iran thanks to rock-rock cover: they left the country with Canadian passports as members of a film crew who came to film a science-fiction film.
Gender combination
The plan of the exfiltration expert Tony Mendez requires the collaboration of Hollywood.
In order to make the legend more credible, specialized stores reported this film project, press conferences were organized and a fictional production company had real offices.
The details of the operation remained secret for a long time, with the film based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is an unusual combination of several genres.
On the one hand it is a political thriller conceived realistically but also a "caper movie", the story of a successful coup, of a betrayal - as, for example, in the trilogy Ocean'sleven, tweet and thirteen.
The ambiances follow one another: documentary-style Tehran sequences (in the subtitled sequences are presented iconic photographs of the time of events and how, thanks to these photos, these same situations were transcribed in the film, there are no great differences),
Lighter Hollywood passages, treated with irony and a bit of exaggeration,
and then scenes from CIA headquarters and other institutions with costumed men discussing the situation around conference tables, in the corridors and on the phone...
Ben Affleck managed to re-start his career in a remarkable way.
As a ridiculed actor, he became a respected director and his acting game ceased to elicit ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film after the dark cop "Gone Baby Gone" (2007) and the thriller "The town" (2010).
It's also Affleck's first film that doesn't take place in his hometown, Boston.
The sense of a place's atmosphere is one of the characteristics that placed its first films above Hollywood standards.
Affleck also demonstrates this sense of the atmosphere in Argo where Tehran's role is "held" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in streets, during the reconstruction of real facts; the initial sequence of the embassy's fall is impressive by its clarity which also suggests confusion and unpredictability occurring when suddenly, in a given place, a history page is written.
Affleck and his collaborators have a similar effect on the fictional scenes (the fake shooting team in Tehran's bazaar).
Too many shares in too many places
The director must have contented himself with a subject that actually offers only a few thrilling scenes, in the cinematic sense of the term.
He does very well, he sometimes adds some elements to reality and there, the result is not always as elegant (the scene in which the threat of crisis at Tehran airport is ruled out by a phone call in America and the pursuit on the runway is quite pulled by the hair).
Argo's weakness lies in his dissipated character, due to the need to show too many events in too many different places.
If it is true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are quite charming in their role as Hollywood co-operators, their characters would have deserved a bigger place and they are not, far from it, the only ones in this case.
Affleck's film lacks a bit of dramatic tension, he lets himself be seen with a moderate interest, appreciating the production and retro style of the 1970s.
It trains the viewer, but with difficulty.
As a reminder of a history still, in a certain way, unfinished to date, and as an illustration of the exaggerated nature of the representation of secret services as omnipotent and omniscience, he does the job.
Rules to Inflate Balloons, Bananas and Circus
The www.bankovnipoplatky.com server, which conducts an annual public survey of the most absurd banking costs, has now decided to launch the competition for the regulation or ideas from the most absurd "EU workshop".
"The fact that the EU has been planning to adopt a 40-percent quota for the management of large European companies has led to our decision," said Patrik Nacher, the organiser of this investigation, Právo newspaper.
Among the absurdities mentioned are already, for example, the recent decision of the European Court to unify insurance premiums for men and women.
So far, however, women have been at a disadvantage in terms of life insurance rates because they objectively represent a lower risk to insurance companies.
People can report until the end of the year any other incredible idea of "the EU workshop".
"The vote will take place before the end of February 2013," Nacher said.
Among the controversial EU regulations are, for example, the obligation to add bio-components to fuels, which has adverse environmental consequences, or the ban on the use of reliable mercury thermometers, only because they contain a relatively small amount of a dangerous substance or the directive on the size of chicken cages, which has led to an increase in the price of eggs.
Criticisms have also been expressed in the past against the de facto prohibition of using the term "butter to spread" or the withdrawal of the sale of conventional bulbs.
Quality bananas must be 14 centimetres in size.
The European administration often reacts under pressure from a commercial or industrial lobby whose applications are usually defended in Brussels by a State or group of States (as well as the Czech Republic currently imposes the requests of its banks by threatening to use its right of veto).
For example, the interests of pressure groups are also at the root of the fact that in the Union bananas must not be smaller than 14 cm in size or have an "abnormal curvature".
The European Commission defended itself by arguing that it was merely harmonising non-homogeneous national standards that complicated trade.
Fruit and vegetable standards have been relaxed despite opposition from some States, claiming that the existing directives result in food waste.
The first prize may be awarded in this investigation to last year's EU regulation that should include a warning on inflatable balloons that children under the age of 8 should not inflate without adult supervision.
The EU referred to an American investigation that balloons are, among toys, the leading cause of child suffocation deaths.
A similar restriction applies to children under the age of 14 in terms of blowing in fair trumpets.
We have weird ideas here, too.
The following rule concerning European civil servants themselves is quite absurd: because of the sensitivity of this theme for Greece, anyone with an official function within the EU cannot use the name "Macedonia" and should instead speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In collaboration with the "Laissez Faisse" association of liberal economists, the server Bankovnípoplatky.com has appointed in this investigation, in addition to some of the absurdities mentioned above, the Union Regulation on the volume of food reserves in the territory of the Czech Republic.
The EU had set maximum volumes for food reserves that could be found in the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the fixed volumes for canned mushrooms and therefore faced a heavy fine.
The organizers of this survey found it interesting to pay money to some countries because they do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a grant to apply for subsidies.
These ideas, however, are not from Brussels but from Prague.
"The fact that we don't have a sea handicaps us.
We will ask the European Union for a refund". Thus expressed, in autumn 2004, the Minister of Agriculture of the time Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD).
He argued that, as a result of our wheat production, and following the so-called "interventionist" purchases, the state had found itself with full stocks that it had then had to export.
According to Palas, the EU should have paid us millions of euros, because the Czech Republic is far from ports.
In the end, the European Commission responded positively to the Czech demand and organised a call for tenders for the purchase of wheat from countries without maritime access.
Grants for grants were proposed to the municipalities by the Ministry of Local Development headed by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), which were to be used, in practical terms, to draft grant applications granted by Brussels.
The EU states: "Strange regulations are rare".
While regulations often raise criticism in the Member States, according to many experts, the EU's efforts to regulate and improve the effectiveness of the functioning of the Union and in the field of its general development deserve praise.
More serious, for example, according to experts, is the problem of the use of EU grants for projects that have absolutely nothing to do with strengthening European integration, but which were imposed by the Member States during the budgetary negotiations.
The fact that the Czech Republic, like other EU countries, has to fight in Brussels for the right to use specific names for these traditional products (which it does not always win) gives rise to strong emotions in the Czechs.
If at the end of six years of battle against the Germans and Austrians, the Czechs successfully defended the name "Olomoucké tvarůžky", with regard to the name "Tuzemský rum" which dates back to the nineteenth century, our producers had to replace it with the name "Tuzemák".
Only products based on cane sugar alcohol, and not on beet sugar, may bear the name rum.
The official list of EU registered products now includes cheeses worldwide known as Feta or Gorgonzola, Lübeck's pasta or Parma's ham, Karlovy Vary's biscuits ("Karlovarské suchary"), Pohořelice and Třeboň's carp ("Pohořelický a Třebońský kapr") and Žatec's hop ("Žatecký chmel").
Pardubice's spice bread ("Pardubický perník") and cakes called "Hořice's Cornets" ("hořické trubičky") can also be proud of their community brand.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur, declares Senator Okamura
Senator, how did we get the idea of running for the presidential election?
It's not about being a senator or president that matters to me.
If everything worked smoothly in our country, I wouldn't be a candidate anywhere.
But I can't bear to see how the country has been looted over the past 20 years, that thieves are not under lockdowns and taxes and the age of retirement is increasing.
I didn't have the ambition to become a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, then I try to find a way to change it.
And since I am over forty years old and am independent, a member of no party, I have no other solution to influence the situation than to run for presidential or senatorial elections.
You entered the Senate but quickly set out for the Castle (N.D.T.: seat of the presidency).
Don't you turn your back on those who elected you?
I've always said I'll start the battle for the Castle based on the results of the senatorial elections.
Later, I said that if I was elected senator, I would run for the presidential election.
My goal is not the function, it is only an instrument that allows me to realize my vision.
That is why I need the greatest influence and the widest mandate.
The problem is not only that as a nation we grumble at the bar or in front of our television station, but also that we trample on those who try to bring about change.
To this is added the press that breaks people's reputation and confuses freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
For example, I was told that I bribe journalists or that I was Jiří Paroubek's advisor.
Let's get to your visions.
You have begun the fight for the Castle with as a horse of battle the themes of the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and retroactive tax declarations beyond twenty million [of CZK].
You have to change the law to that end.
As President, you do not have such power and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When, as a citizen, I put pressure on tourism guide activities to be a liberal profession, I won the prize.
The problem is politics: when someone comes from the left or the right with a good project, it is knowingly rejected and it slows the citizens.
As an independent member of no party, I am much more likely to get the support of all parliamentary parties.
I have the advantage of being able, without categorization and dogma partisans, to take from each party what is best for our country and implement it.
Do you consider yourself more like a man on the right or on the left?
From a Czech point of view, I feel like people are putting me on the left.
For me, whether it's a little left or right, it's not really important.
For me, the important thing is that we move forward.
What matters to me is not whether people are left or right, but to bring people together.
I always support any solution that contributes to the common good, even if it is proposed by the Communist Party or ODS and I act equally impartially against bad ideas.
Are you angry when someone says you're a populist?
But doesn't what you said prove it?
When you develop a business plan in a company, you also have some optimal purpose and vision.
You're trying to get close.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals I'm talking about have been applied by the world and recognized experts have talked about it.
But without the support of the parliament, all you have left are slogans.
You won't survive long in politics with this.
Do you think that if you go to people and talk to them, you will, for example, succeed in imposing material and criminal responsibility?
I don't have any other option.
I must convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to rally them to my camp in order to impose it.
If I was elected president, it would not be a problem to broadcast live on television my request to the presidents of parliamentary parties to legislate on the material and criminal responsibility of politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
They should then possibly explain why they do not want it.
When there is a strong personality who will identify the abuses, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take, for example, the election of the president by direct suffrage, which was obtained through the pressure of public opinion.
I admit to being an amateur and not a genius or an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies for my opinions and visions.
I have just embarked on politics and I am trying to get majority support for my programme.
I'm just trying to get things moving, and if it doesn't work, I'll stop in six years and go back to the private sector.
It's kind of like Okamura was supposed to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that only one person cannot make a difference, which is why I went to see a number of personalities to ask them to run for senatorial election as well.
I met Radim Jančura, but he refused because of the amount of work.
At least I supported investigative journalist Jana Lorencová who revealed the oil frauds.
I introduced myself because people are really unhappy but now I hesitate.
Sixty percent of the people did not vote and what they did, for the most part, gave their voice to a representative of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independents.
People have elected a Senate that can hardly impose changes.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, for example the direct election of mayors and prefects of regions.
Are you considering founding your own party?
No, not yet, because I don't have time to check whether the past of each potential member is spotless and then I don't have the financial means.
I don't have any money for my presidential campaign either, I only have twenty thousand on my transparent account.
Don't you have any money?
You're talking tax returns, what's yours?
I estimate the value of my personal property to be about 60 million.
I have in Prague a land worth 25 million, an apartment worth 10 million, another apartment worth 8 million, a collection of works of art worth about 10 million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million and a Škoda Superb worth 1 million and a few million on my account.
By the way, I own an Aston Martin, because it was a kid's dream: I always loved James Bond, who was driving in a car, was gallant with women and was fighting against evil and abuse.
You're driving in Aston Martin, you have a fortune worth 60 million and you don't have any money for your campaign?
You want to change the Republic, but you don't want to invest your own money in it?
It's not very convincing.
I don't have $15 million for this campaign.
Should I be in debt?
I've already invested two and a half million in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors shows that my program doesn't attract much interest.
I don't have to pay for this campaign in my pocket.
My campaign expenses are generally covered by the remuneration I will receive as a senator.
But I couldn't live with it, for example paying for my son's English school, which costs 30 grand a month.
If my only goal was to earn money, I won't run for election.
So you're going to continue your business so you can live?
Didn't you say you'd put your activities in the dark?
But this is not related to the amount of this remuneration.
As I promised, I partially reduced my activities.
For example, my assistant will head the travel agency in the spring.
People would like me to be a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
I have to live on something, though.
What was your usual monthly salary when you were an entrepreneur?
I was winning and I'm still winning between two and four hundred thousand.
If I were president, I would end my business.

The architects of the MVRDV firm prove that true adventures are not just a matter of imagination. To convince yourself, just look at Spijkenisse and the newly erected mountain of books - 2 photos
"I think this building is funny, it makes very futuristic, finally something interesting to see," says Lisette Verhaig, a passer-by on the lower side of the street.
Stefan Spermon, a computer scientist in a large nearby company, tells us: "Yes, it is indeed very beautiful, this building".
But I wonder why we still need a library today.
Everyone has Internet, an iPad and e-books.
Now, no one's going to one of these sloppy libraries of their own free will anymore, is it?
Spijkenisse, a dormitory town that has nothing to do with the gates of Rotterdam, holds a rather special record.
The municipality of 80,000 souls has the lowest education rate in the Netherlands.
In order to restore some neurons to the brains, the city decided, a few years ago, to contribute to the general culture and to reproduce the seven fictitious bridges that appear on the euro banknotes in the form of beautiful miniatures in painted reinforced concrete.
The success of the cultural offensive has remained limited.
This is how the city authorities realized that there was only one way to get back to the statistics: the construction of a library!
Winy Maas, of the architectural office of Rotterdam MVRDV, master of diagrams in bold sticks and creator of buildings full of mind and often cynical, accepted the project with his usual phlegm and presented himself to the competition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a sneezing on his face.
And while the jury members were still looking at each other, bewildered and raising their shoulders, Maas, the faceless, piled up his books of choice in order of size to make it a pyramid, and ended his discourse supported by activist arguments by a "common love!"
Here it is, my proposal for the mountain of books of Spijkenisse, or as they say, the Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million-euro mountain came out of land.
The building is part of a revitalization project that also includes underground parking, a supermarket, a post office and a few buildings and houses for a total of 50 houses.
In early November, the mountain of books received the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project was selected for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
Thus, this dull little town, which until now had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian zone and a town hall of a disgusting ugliness, whose white facades invite to think that they are home to a dairy, has enriched itself with a contemporary architectural work.
The most important thing is that Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.
The long way to reading
First impression: Eldorado of the book under cheese bell.
Certainly, an elevator takes you to the heart of the massif, but the true joys of reading and architecture open to you when you trample the floor of the building to discover its topography.
The interior entirely made of glass is bright and clear, the Dutch brick floor and elegant reverbers speak unequivocally the language of municipal public squares.
The urban atmosphere is perfect.
We're already looking for public benches, dogs and little boys and girls who play ball.
And books, books and books everywhere.
"Normally, the library shelves are located along the façade and in the middle there is a large and dark room, which is often uncomfortable and impersonal," explains Willy Maas.
We completely disrupted the classical spatial configuration and opened the reading spaces from the inside to the outside.
The interior of the mountain of books has been tastefully arranged: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the center for the environment and the technical center of the building.
A particular beauty lies in the black rays of the library, which are sometimes wall tiles, sometimes balustrades, sometimes stairwells.
A new experience for sight, touch and smell.
Even the architects and engineers of the hardened building do not want unknown materials.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials," explains Joop Trouborst, project manager at the municipality of Spijkenisse, in a response to the Standard.
For example, one day we found an ad hoc waste from agriculture in an agricultural enterprise.
In the Netherlands, one millimetre thick synthetic membrane has been used for years as a substrate in greenhouses and fields.
It's cheap, and we're saving time.
The thin membrane is used for one or two seasons, then it can be discarded.
For the library, the membrane was compressed, for the first time in such quantities, into plates four centimetres thick.
Under the influence of heat and pressure, the "Landbouwplastic " (KPL) changes color and turns into a dark, homogeneous and resistant material, the smell of which evokes both a new car and sports shoes.
At the top of the 105 steps is the top of the mountain.
After almost 500 meters, the literary café offers a breathtaking view of the city, but also Dutch croquettes and ficus in pots.
The latter create an atmosphere, but they contribute mainly to the maintenance of the ideal level of air humidity in the literary mountain.
Gifts for the New Soul
"It's incredible, but despite all the glass surfaces, this building is a model project in terms of ecology," says Trouborst.
The temperature of the building is adjusted by geothermal temperature.
Although the mountain of books is below a glass bell, the sun only illuminates the interior for a short time, even on days of good weather.
The thick wooden beams mounted from across the glass facade serve as a sunscreen, intercepting a large part of the rays.
The atmosphere is very pleasant.
Completely automated blinds take care of the rest.
Stefan Spermon, the septic informatician mentioned above, has already risked entering the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
Cynthia Bogarde, a professor of traditional Chinese medicine, even describes Boekenberg as the "soul finally found" of Spijkenisse.
A few weeks ago, at the inauguration, every citizen was invited to donate a book from his personal library.
This has made it possible to fill the gaps in the library that was not yet fully filled (today it has 70,000 books).
The concept is a success.
The rays are all over the place.
For architect Winy Maas, "there's nothing worse than a half-empty library."
"I believe that our invitation has created a certain relationship between every citizen and this new building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it's only for decoration."
This is how MVRDV has reached the master discipline that is called, in professional jargon, "the creation of an identity".
Spijkenisse wrote a new page in literary history.
Even though she may seem young and uneducated.
Finally, it is a new starting point for the birth of an identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a greater role."
Germany chose forbearance during the vote on the admission of the Palestinian State.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on relations between the United States and the EU, this decision puts Berlin in a difficult political situation.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany had announced its intention to vote against the Palestinian request for observer status with the United Nations.
But then she chose forbearance.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not approve of what the Israelis did in Gaza.
However, Berlin must be cautious, as it maintains special relations with Israel.
But I also think that it does not support the American position either.
Germany wanted to assert its independence, but not to be too critical of Israel.
During the March 2011 insurgency in Libya, Germany also chose to abstain in the vote on the establishment of an no-fly zone.
Finally, NATO imposed this measure.
Is it difficult for Germany to adopt a clear position on major international issues?
The answer is yes.
The reason for this is that Berlin is reviewing its foreign policy, seeking to move away from a policy so to speak defined by the Americans and to establish a German foreign policy.
Moreover, the lack of a coherent and common policy within the Union complicates the situation.
The Germans therefore face several fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they're still trying to find that role, but they're on the road to a "more normal" foreign policy.
Foreign policy, such as in France or Great Britain
What, then, does the term "normal" foreign policy mean to the Germans?
It shows the willingness to adopt positions independent of those of the United States and European partners, including with regard to national files.
I believe that German foreign policy is also determined by its economic policy, therefore by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are, to a certain extent, different from those of the other major powers, which is why Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced Germany's position vis-à-vis the Middle East conflict and forbearance during the United Nations vote?
Germany first has important markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf countries.
That is why Berlin must be careful not to clash with public opinion, but also with the elites of the Arab countries.
This is undoubtedly a determining factor.
However, I would not attach too much importance to it, because it is not an exclusively unilateral relationship.
But this is in any case a decisive element in German strategic thinking.
Does Germany undermine its relations with the United States by choosing forbearance in important votes, as in the case of Palestine?
I think that Europeans and Americans understand the German position perfectly.
That is why I think the fracture is not so serious that it was in the case of the Libyan question.
Perhaps even Germany will be more respected.
Indeed, Germany has shown that it must be taken seriously as an international actor and that its interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, opinions on the Palestinian initiative are diverse.
On the other hand, the United States announced its veto with a clear voice.
Do opinions differ between the United States and the majority of European countries?
There have always been differences because of the American domestic political scene.
I believe that the Obama Administration is secretly showing great understanding of the European position.
But given the country's political configuration, the government cannot, of course, defend its position publicly.
I believe that the real differences of opinion are not so great that they always seem to be.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is far from enthusiastic about Netanyahu's policy.
Does Germany find it difficult to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of the major European partners, on the other?
I don't think it makes it any easier for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little simpler for the Germans if there was a coherent and uniform European policy, but today it is not.
They cannot, therefore, join a broader political line and must affirm their unique position.
This is what they are currently doing in the question of the euro.
In my opinion, Germany will play a locomotive role in the future and will push Europe to adopt a European position.
It is not simple for Germany, especially because of relations with Israel.
This issue has always been a sensitive one.
But in my view, the Germans are well aware of the fact that they must play a role that more marks their independence.
Does Germany see itself playing a major role on the international stage, does Germany only want to play a key role?
Or is it still difficult to assume leading roles?
Germany is still not used to it, it is always uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country still has difficulties in playing a more important role.
If we look, for example, at the euro crisis, we notice that every time Germany decides to weigh more, many anti-German feelings are heard.
It doesn't make it any easier for the Germans.
In fact, it is always the same problem: we do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more delicate position than the United States.
It has to deal with very diverse neighbors and opinions, and it is not easy.
Today, the influence of the United States on European policy is only diminishing, but at the moment, the EU is not filling this gap, so who is left?
The Germans will simply have to play a more important role.
And even if they don't like it, even if it's unpleasant to them and if they're only less appreciated, it's life!

"Brand protection" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are well-known brands around the world.
Armani Polo... what is this really about?
Behind this name is a trademark officially registered in China, but which has nothing to do with the original company.
The trade mark thus enjoys protection such that the undertaking bearing the name of the trade mark cannot lodge a complaint.
And even if she could, he's not sure she'd get a win.
"It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," explains Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing's office specializing in violation of property rights in the Far East.
Every week, a new file arrives on my desk.
Impersonators only need a few additional letters to be able to register their brands.
For example, instead of Gucci, Lu-Gucci is recorded, and instead of Prada, Prada-Kny is recorded.
German companies are also legally copied, such as Puma, the manufacturer of sports articles.
Pattloch opens a binder containing records made with the Beijing Trademark Office.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company filed the brand Zegna DF Puma, a name that the company artificially created by taking over part of the name Ermenegildo Zegna, the fashion house.
It is a well-known fact that the Chinese have become world champions for copying and violating intellectual property.
In large cities, multi-storey shopping malls are found that sell practically only counterfeits.
However, Pattloch's cases are different: his principals task him to address the fact that the Chinese Trademark Office officially grants Chinese companies the right to use a name that is already protected in another country.
The Chinese are talking about "Bang Mingpai", a related brand.
The term is derived from "Bang Dakuan".
It is with this term that women are appointed who marry rich men.
The Chinese authorities say they have nothing to blame.
"It's bad for business, we have to fight this trend," says Pattloch.
"The brand is sweetened, the singularity disappears, the damage to reputation is enormous."
Financial losses and legal costs amount to millions for the sectors concerned, especially with regard to expensive flagship products.
According to data from the CLSA market analysis company, China represents, with an annual volume of 15 billion euros, the third world market for luxury products and the fastest growing one.
However, it is not easy to delete dubious registrations from the trademark registry and these procedures are expensive.
The latter can last up to nine years, and the outcome is never certain.
Pattloch refers to the trials in which the court dismissed the complaint, because after a long period of time, the name criticized had become a "market reality".
Pattloch explains that if the complainant is not lucky, he may even be forced to pay money to the plagiarism because he would have harmed his brand in China.
In this area, it is sometimes the law of the jungle that dominates.
Famous cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal battle against the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the same company that had just bought the Putzmeister concrete pump producer.
That's why the Chinese can use an emblem that looks like the Mercedes star.
Geely, the Volvo buyer, used before a blue and white logo that recalled the BMW logo. The conflict was settled and Geely had to modify it.
The Lacoste fashion house had lost to the plagiarisms of Hong Kong and Singapore that had reoriented the gaze of the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
According to the Chinese authorities, they are not guilty of anything.
However, the CTMO Brands Office in Beijing admits to having experienced some difficulties in 2010 due to a lack of personnel and space.
However, the Office would have moved last year from an "emergency situation in the course of work to a found normality".
Thus, the number of untreated opposition proceedings would have decreased by 22%.
Nearly 57,000 such cases were reportedly closed, an increase of 75% over the previous year.
However, 81,500 proceedings remain pending at the Office.
Acting is expensive
As is often the case in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million trademark applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
According to the Office, this is a record and this means that China is for the tenth time in a row at the top of the ranking for the number of new deposits in the world.
This would also apply to the total number of legal marks, which is 5.5 million.
In 2011, the Office reportedly accounted for 1.8 billion yuan of registration fees.
In other words, each registration averaged 1,280 yuan, or 160 euros.
A legal battle costs much more, as illustrated by the German family business Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the company has been fighting a Chinese plagiarism.
Of course, the Germans were able to get the illegal manufacture of vehicle components suspended.
However, the imitator was able to maintain its Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
"It's our fault, because family names cannot be protected in Germany," explains Hanno Wentzler, CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The Trade Marks Office therefore rejected the objection of the Munichers.
Freudenberg has certainly won in the next two instances, but the opposing side continues to fight to this day.
Vigilance is at stake
Today, the case is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident, believes in a positive outcome of the trial and boasts the professionalism of the judges.
Nevertheless, he adds: "The procedure is long, challenging and costs us a lot of time and money."
It is also difficult to assess internal costs. The archives department even had to review the actions of the last hundred years in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg even proposed in vain to the opposing party a "large six-digit euro sum" to settle the dispute.
"That's what it means to us," Wentzler says.
The dangers of the Far East even threaten to overflow into Europe.
This would be the case if imitators from this region were to ensure the exploitation of unprotected marks.
For example, a Chinese producer wanted to file in Germany Freudenberg's name for a shoe and leather production company.
The company had long abandoned this sector, but it had been able to prevent the deposit.
Wentzler adds: "Warning is on."
Pattloch and he advise German companies to exercise great caution in their trade relations with China.
In their view, it is not enough to rely on international trademark law, but foreigners should "register also in China everything that is likely to be protected", as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, the costs may be much higher than those of registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg lost the battle during the last act of his legal drama, the company would have to pay license fees to the opposing party for the use of his own name, as Wentzler explains.
Or we would lose our place in the segment of the market in question.
World AIDS Day: kicking, singing, helping
The Imbongi choir repeats in Heidelberg, and the AIDS orphans in Swaziland rejoice at their arrival.
Here is the story of a link that crosses much more than a distance of 8,733 kilometers.
First of all, you hit the foot: cowboy boots, sneakers, women's shoes and men's moccasins look for the rhythm by hitting the foot floor. Very quickly, they find it.
One, two, three, four.
Then the voices of the singers slowly amplify - alto, bass, tenor and soprano - they win, enchant and follow.
Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor almost lost his canvas shoes when he directed the orchestra with his gestures of wild flexibility.
It's Monday night, the Imbongi choir repeats a new song in the music hall of the Heidelberg Institute of Medical Psychology.
Fifty singers and singers aged 23 to 69 came, from geneticist in human medicine to man at home.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy song, every choirman has different words, all in a very exotic language: the Zulu, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and some parts of Swaziland.
Being helped to help each other
UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS programme, estimates that 34 million people worldwide are suffering from the disease.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
Swaziland has 245,000 infected people.
In addition, more than 40 per cent of the population is HIV-positive.
180 AIDS orphans from the village of Esitjeni found sponsors in Germany thanks to the "Voices for Africa" association.
70 of them attend a secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros less, you can become a sponsor.
This money guarantees the child money for school, a school uniform and a daily hot meal at the gogo center.
Imbongi means in zulu "teller of stories" or even "singer of praises".
No one can speak the Bantu language fluently in this region, but everyone can sing it.
For almost 10 years, the choir has been repeating songs in this foreign language that it has brought to Germany and is now returning to its native region: South Africa.
For at 8,733 kilometers by bird flight from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is Esitjeni, the village that depends on the vocal power of the German choir.
40% of people affected
The village has about 2,000 inhabitants, some live in modest huts of straw or land and the majority of them are children.
More than 300 of them are orphans because HIV has taken their parents away.
In Esitjeni, a smaller scale can be observed of the diseases that plague Swaziland: the highest rate of HIV infection and the lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF.
The population almost never accepts male circumcision, a measure that guarantees a proven reduction in the risk of infection by half.
More than 40% of the population in Swaziland carry the immunodeficiency virus and it is not uncommon to die in the middle of 30.
During a group trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir had been able to discover the village. The Imbongis mainly saw many children on the street who lacked not only parental care, but also just everything: food, clothing, education.
In a poor country, without a school diploma, there is simply no prospect.
At first, they were only a few people who were personally committed to paying a few euros each year so that they could send a child to school and offer him a hot meal a day.
But just a year later, the choir founded "Voices for Africa", an association that has since been working almost professionally with the AIDS orphans of Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most common sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia and blennorragia (or gonorrhea).
Common STIs are HIV, human papillomavirus, genital herpes or hepatitis.
Pubis lice and scabs belong to parasitic STIs.
Which groups are mainly concerned?
Syphilis and blennorragia often occur in men who have sex with other men.
The Robert-Koch Institute estimates that sexual contact between men is responsible for at least four out of five cases of syphilis reported in Germany.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydia-related infections, trichomonase, candidiasis (fungal), blennorragia and human papilloma virus are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The rate of spread of HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low in Germany. However, some 20% of new HIV infections are observed in this group.
In young people, there is a significantly higher rate of chlamydia-related infections than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections concern young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
Moreover, in Germany, the human papillomavirus is common among young people.
What is the evolution of the number of infections?
It is not mandatory to report all sexually transmitted diseases.
According to the Robert-Koch Institute, the number of cases of syphilis has more than doubled in 10 years: the figure has increased from 1,967 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections has declined.
In 2011, there were approximately 2,700 cases.
This represents a decrease of one tenth from the previous year.
What are the symptoms of a sexual disease?
Infectious diseases can cause abscesses in the genital organs, urinary pain, white discharges, lower belly pains, and the appearance of buttons and warts.
However, they do not regularly cause any pain or other symptoms and thus remain hidden.
How can we protect ourselves?
Condoms may reduce the risk of infection, but they do not protect 100%.
The reason for this is that sexually transmitted disease pathogens can also be transmitted by lubricating infection or by close body contact.
The experts therefore recommend that anyone who often changes sexual partners undergo regular examinations.
Most rapidly detected STIs can be cured and late sequelae can be avoided.
Thanks to the sponsorships, the donations, but above all to the funds raised by the choir thanks to their voices throughout Germany, the means accumulate.
"In all, we have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident woman who always gets what she wants, manages the money from Germany.
It also ensures that orphans are well housed, for example, in one of their grandmothers.
Gogos, that's what we call old women in zulu, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them accommodate up to 14 orphans, offer them a roof and ensure that they go to school every day on time in their uniforms.
The orphan who no longer has anyone is welcomed to a safe place, at Khanyisile, a woman who lives alone and is paid for by the association, as are the two cooks who prepare meals every day for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" created a sewing school and allowed the construction of two henhouses. With the help of the American health organization PSI, the association organized an HIV test for many inhabitants.
This is not self-evident, because even if the disease is clearly visible throughout the country, it remains a taboo subject.
A king and his 14 wives
"AIDS is a real taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it's a subject that affects sexuality."
It's quite curious, coming from a country whose king has 14 official wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy in the place of democracy.
These state-sanctioned customs, among others, are responsible for the rapid spread of HIV in recent decades.
Migrant workers have also spread the virus throughout the country.
Yet condoms are found at every corner of the street, adds Annette Lennartz, "but almost no one uses them.
Culture is different, flesh against flesh."
In order to promote some cultural exchange, Imbongi's choir members travel together every two or three years in South Africa and sing songs full of nostalgia, courage, confidence and black identity that many people on the tip of the black continent still know about the time of apartheid.
The bus filled with whites singing in the African language is a sign of recognition such that it not only generates good mood and joy, but sometimes also tears a tear from some formidable border guards.
The bus always takes them to Esitjeni, where the singers visit their bandits.
Although it is difficult to find the small village on a map, Esitjeni is well known in the Ezulweni valley.
"Go to Esitjeni, you will find light there," people say.
And after a 8,733-kilometer flight back to Heidelberg, in front of these singers who beat foot in the rehearsal hall of the Bergheimer Straße, there is also light.
Messenger: NASA discovers the presence of ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe reported evidence of the existence of ice on planet Mercury.
The ice layer could reach 20 meters thick.
The US space agency NASA has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although this planet is closest to the Sun, it contains frozen water, as explained by three studies published this Thursday in the journal "Science".
The Messenger probe reported evidence of an ice cover in the region of the planet continuously plunged into the shadows.
This cover would have a thickness of at least 30 centimetres up to 20 metres.
The water probably comes from comets or perhaps asteroids that would have hit Mercury.
However, there is no link between the discovery of water and the hypothesis of a life presence on the planet, explains the chief scientist of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
The discovery could help to understand how water and other vital elements of life have arrived in other parts of the solar system.
Unnoticed by the inhabitants of our planet, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to the earth, such as small interstices through which infinity is observed.
The image comes from a photographic camera developed by German researchers from the Max-Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not considered a "planet", according to the new definition of the term of the 2006 International Astronomical Union.
This detail of an infrared photograph taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are in blue and the pink dots, more difficult to identify, are the "newborns" in the birth room of the universe.
The Spitzer telescope discovered this region where the stars are born, called "W5", a very unromantic name, in the constellation Cassiopée, at 6,500 light-years.
NASA's Spitzer telescope photographed the flashing glow of a dying star.
The doll-shaped circle is composed of elements that the star projects when it dies.
In the immense trifide nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, gas and dust form new stars.
The Spitzer telescope photographed this galactic delivery room.
The Pleiades, a cluster of stars also called "the seven sisters", can be observed with the naked eye during the night.
However, the telescope enhances the value of colours.
In this infrared photo, Hélice's nebula, like a red eye, looks directly at the viewer.
It is 700 light-years away in the constellation of the Verseau.
His resemblance to an earthly continent earned him the title of North America.
The combination of the normal photo and the infrared photo makes it possible to observe a spectacular shade.
Only the Spitzer telescope's infrared detectors were able to capture an image of the new star in all its beauty.
One of the greatest enigmas of astronomy is the creation of Saturn rings.
One theory is that rings are the remains of a Saturn moon that disappeared 4.5 billion years ago without leaving any trace.
One of the largest and sharpest photographs taken by the Hubble telescope is that of the Tourbillon galaxy.
According to the hue, photographs of spiral galaxies can become real works of art.
The photograph published by the European Southern Observatory shows the trifide nebula in the constellation of Sagittarius, thousands of light-years away.
The name Trifide comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided, divided into three), because three dusty drags divide the shining heart from the birthplace of the stars.
Astronomers have photographed the firsts of a cosmic carambolage in the constellation of the Serpentary: at 400 million light-years of the Earth, the nuclei of two molten galaxies rush one towards the other, the collision is inevitable.
The Hubble telescope observed the birth of these stars in the spiral galaxy M83.
If you don't like technical abbreviations, you can use its nickname "Southern Fire Wheel".
The picture of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a detail of the Iris nebula in the Cepheus constellation.
The nebula is 1,400 light-years away and consists of dust grains that are ten to one hundred times smaller than normal domestic dust.
This photo was made from optical and X-ray photographs taken by different telescopes.
Here you can see the circle composed of black holes that is 430 million light-years away from Earth.
The space telescope photographed this group of galaxies called Arp 273 for NASA.
Scientists have named the largest spiral galaxy "GC 1810".
In this nebula lies the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
The heavenly cradle always gives birth to new stars.
These star clouds, which are connected by the Rosette nebula, also permanently create young stars at 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this galaxy with light rays and pierced by a small black hole, there is still no dust, there is only gas.
Scientists believe that he was born shortly after the bigbang, when the universe was largely composed of hydrogen.
Our gaze on the universe: the main telescopes
The telescope was allegedly invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, before Galileo used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have continued to grow, and thanks to them, it has been possible to see ever further into the universe.
For 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the Hale telescope at the Palomar Mountain Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror on this image had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, in the United States, there is the Large Binocular Telescope.
It makes it possible to observe the universe through two mirrors each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The belly of the Gran Telescopio Canarias in La Palma, Canary Islands, is huge. The mirror alone reaches a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa has been segmented to save money.
The diameter still reaches about 11 meters.
The disadvantage of the economic construction method is that the telescope is fixed at the vertical angle, which limits its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed at the vertical angle.
Its particularity is due to its great ability to collect light.
Despite a relatively small mirror diameter, this capacity is close to those of the world's largest mirror telescopes.
Scientists listen to the universe for extraterrestrial signals using the Arecibo radio telescope (Puerto Rico).
This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
Any person who owns a computer can help the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI, or "search for extraterrestrial intelligence") by using the computing power of his machine.
View on the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope ("very large telescope"), an installation worthy of its name.
Thanks to a total of four mirrors, this telescope can illuminate the average infrared spectrum.
The construction of a very large European telescope (European Extremely Large Telescope) is also planned for the ESO site in Chile.
Its main mirror should reach the impressive size of 42 meters. It will consist of nearly 1,000 mirror elements.
However, the telescope will not be able to take pictures before 2018 at the earliest.
Until 2007, Keck's two telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They had two mirrors with a diameter of 10 meters each.
Keck's telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory that watches the sky with the Subaru telescope and the IRTF.
A new gigantic telescope should also be built on the Mauna Kea and the diameter of its mirror will reach 30 meters.
This illustration allows us to admire it.
However, the most important images of space come from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has been giving us images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been looking for exoplanets, mainly those that are habitable.
NASA announced on February 2, 2011, that it had found 1,235 candidate planets since the start of the mission.
This photo illustrates the latest preparations before the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James-Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent into space as early as 2018 on an Ariane 5 rocket.
The first mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
In particular, the telescope will have the task of finding light projected by the first stars and galaxies after the bigbang.
Scientists believe that Mercury's South Pole is also home to ice.
However, there is no reliable data on this theory, as Messenger orbits much closer to the North Pole of Mercury.
Radar data had for decades indicated the presence of ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the launch of the Messenger probe in 2004, the first to orbit around Mercury, scientists now have the certainty.
Drink butter daily, and live up to 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach ages worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There is even a museum of longevity.
A survey of a country, in which one is still relatively young at 97 years of age.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach ages worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There is even a museum of longevity.
A survey of a country, in which one is still relatively young at 97 years of age.
The trip to the Talysh mountains is of a skewed romanticism.
At the turn of the road, the small bus runs along wooded hills, torrential rivers and modest farms.
Everything's green and fertile, we'd almost look like we're in the Black Forest.
But we are here in the deep South of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometres away.
This is where the Caucasian ethnic group known as Talysh lives, about which we don't know much, except that they speak perfectly Persian and Azeri and that they have a very great longevity.
Terminus: Lerik.
The small town plastrona with its too aggressive architecture of the Soviet era that does not agree at all with the picturesque mountain landscape.
European tourists are rare here, the journey from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is far too painful.
It takes eight hours to travel the 323 kilometers, because the road has only one way.
The province has not yet benefited from the legendary wealth that the country owes to its oil reserves in the Caspian Sea.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva, 48, is convinced that Lerik has the potential to become a touristic place.
"Bakou became famous in May thanks to the Eurovision competition, and next year, there will be the oldest people's festival in the world," explains Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Longevity Museum, the only such museum in the world.
There you can discover the life of about eight dozen Talysh of the region who are over 100 years old. Fatulayeva shows us a picture in black and white.
This is my grandfather, he's 120 years old.
Having a child at the age of 136
But the controversial star of the museum is Sirali Müslümov, a shepherd who would have been 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And when one thinks that the oldest documented person was 122 years old, Müslümov's age seems more than dubious.
"He was born in 1805 in this region, he died in 1973," says Fatulayeva.
The man would have married three times and had 23 children. At the age of 136, he would have conceived a girl again.
Would Sirali Müslümov have been wrong for a few decades in calculating his age?
Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max-Planck Institute in Rostock, also heard about the man of the early Central Asian age.
"Unsurprisingly old people also live in parts of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," explains Scholz, "in Sardinia too, there are men who live incredibly old."
However, it is impossible to establish scientific evidence because of the non-existence of documents, not to mention that there was no civil registry.
Every day, a glass of melted butter
However, people in the Lerik area often reach an age worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
Currently, 20 people are over 100 years old.
So what is the reason for the longevity in the south of this country?
Farid Mugimzadeh, the Azeri tourist guide, explains that the Talysh have particular genes.
On the other hand, Fatulayeva, the museum's director, thinks it's a matter of food.
However, it does not seem plausible, from a nutritional point of view, that Talysh's calorie-rich meals, which love meat, bread and especially dairy products, many of which drink a glass of melted butter daily, are good for health.
Or is it the simple way of life that preserves people's youth? In Cengemiran, a tiny village near the town of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At the age of 97, she is still relatively young for the region.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a modest wooden house, as it is typical to see throughout the Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor next to a bar, whose contents she beat tirelessly.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and a daughter, who have long been adults.
Two little children are also squatting in the house.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for guests served in typical belly-shaped Armoured glasses.
Mirzayeva's white teeth are perfectly aligned, and under her scarf hide long braids of a dark blonde that her son reveals to us proudly.
I always washed my hair with milk, and that's how I never lost them and they kept their color.
"I've never used shampoo," adds Mirzayeva.
Monthly retirement is enough to live
She has always eaten what comes from her own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
All my life, I've never bought any food in a supermarket.
Then she tells us about her husband who was in the army.
The worst moments were after World War II.
But everything improved when the "loved father" Heydar Aliyev took over.
The language of propaganda amazes an old lady's mouth.
However, the cult of the nation's paternal figure, a man who, however, ruled his country as a dictator, knows almost no limits in Azerbaijan
He was in power until 2003, his son Ilham succeeded him later.
In any case, the elderly in Azerbaijan do not know the distress.
Mirzayeva receives 230 manats monthly (about the same amount as in euros) for her retirement, a sum that guarantees a good life in the region.
And maybe Mirzayeva's long-time grisly son is right: "older people enjoy great respect in our culture."
They are the center of the great family, they are loved, cared for and happy.
That is a good reason to live as long as possible.
The "rights of man" omitted in the Constitution
The revolution is reborn in Cairo.
Opposite demonstrations reveal the country's deep fracture.
The draft constitution based on sharia is violently controversial.
The Egyptian president is not greedy of words full of emotions.
We must succeed in the transition.
"And this success is my responsibility to the people and to God," he said on state television.
His speech was intended for the entire people, but also for the Christian Copts, the liberals, enlightened Muslims and lay people.
Because all members of the opposition confused and desperately disunited are afraid.
They are afraid of a theocracy on the Nile in the hands of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohamed Morsi said, almost apologizing, that he temporarily restricted the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded his powers "in order to save the revolution".
However, the Egyptians and the world don't really know what this 61-year-old engineer, who holds a PhD from the American University of South California, wants to save.
Will the judiciary be overthrown?
The 234 articles written in haste by the mostly Islamic Constituent Assembly of 100 people during a fifteen-hour night-force tour are indeed worrying to some extent.
As in previous constitutions, the draft provides that case law is based on "principles of Islamic law".
But what does the word "principles" really mean?
It was and still remains a question of interpretation, and there are good reasons to fear that Islamists use the vague wording and the resulting legal leeway to apply a stricter interpretation of the sharia.
In any case, it suggests a newly introduced article stipulating that, with regard to all matters relating to sharia, the al-Azhar university must be consulted. The institution is the most important Islamic institution in the country and its radiance shines over the entire Sunni Islamic world.
This may, but does not necessarily mean that the clergy will monitor the legislative system, which would de facto result in the judiciary being placed under guardianship.
Many points in the draft Constitution are subject to interpretation
Another problematic aspect is the likely maintenance of military jurisdiction.
During the reign of Mubarak, these courts tried to punish the opponents.
After the dictator's fall, up to 11,000 civilians were detained by the military.
The State must also, we can read in the project, protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family" and "promote its morals and values".
From a legal point of view, the wording is so vague that State institutions could even control the content of cinematography and literature.
Clearly, it would simply be censorship.
Furthermore, there is no specific article that guarantees equality between men and women.
Instead, another article forbids offending or defaming the Prophet Muhammad or his envoys.
On the other hand, the article does not define what an offence is or how it should be punished.
Just as dubious is the wording suggesting that it is forbidden to "offend people".
Is it enough to draw a cartoon of the president or to tell a joke to the detriment of a lawman?
Many points are therefore subject to interpretation in the draft that Morsi puts to the vote and that, according to his own words, will be "very soon" the subject of a referendum with the Egyptians.
"The Revolution Renewed"
The opposition has been mobilizing for weeks against the digital superiority of Islamists.
On Friday evening, tens of thousands of protesters gathered in an unusual concord on Tahrir Square in Cairo, promising to bring down the Sharia before it came into force.
"The revolution is reborn and we will win," says Hamdin Sabbahi, third in the presidential elections.
The Nobel Peace Prize and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El Baradei declared that the draft Constitution is "to be thrown into the garbage cans of history".
On Twitter, the instant messaging service, he accused Morsi's supporters of wanting to foment a "putsch against democracy".
"If he proclaims the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," exclaims Jasser Said, an opponent.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet expiated," Egyptian media reports Khaled Ali, a politician and opposition member.
In addition, several judges announced that they did not want to monitor the referendum, which would result in its nullity.
"The Qur'an is our Constitution"
For its part, the well-organized Muslim Brotherhood called for a counter-demonstration not on Tahrir Square as a precautionary measure, but on the other bank of the Nile, where a great prayer was organized before the University of Cairo.
The veiled women and supporters of the Salafists, who participated in it in large numbers, chanted: "The people demand the application of the law of God."
"Clean our country!" they asked Morsi, claiming that "the Qur'an [was their] Constitution."
A struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic place Tharir, where everything began, would soon have created a situation similar to that of a civil war.
Obviously, this is what Morsi's supporters wanted to avoid.
The Muslim Brotherhood stated that the opponents of the draft Constitution, like its supporters, had spoken loud and clear.
According to them, it is now time to let the people decide by the ballot box of the direction that the country must take.
The Islamist project will certainly win the majority.
"Human rights are not mentioned once"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry at this imposed constitutional process, which should have lasted until February and encompassed all social forces.
This 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) had defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or before the courts under Mubarak.
He did so not because he shared their view of the world, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
That's why he was beaten, tried and imprisoned.
"And now the term is not even pronounced once in the new Constitution," he regrets during his interview with the Welt am Sonntag.
The extension of Morsi's powers to the three powers discouraged the lawyer.
These measures are blatant violations of the rules of democracy and will lead to a new dictatorship in Egypt.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the president de facto takes away all his powers," says Saeda.
Yet a democracy cannot function without civil society organisations.
Saeda feels abandoned, including by the international community, who looks at the battle between the various political ideologies on the edge of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and nervousness.
That could pay off.
A protestor on Tharir Square warns: "You are giving birth to a monster that you will no longer be able to control."
Norway's Rakfisk: Is this the most odorous fish in the world?
The five million people in Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe, but also in the world.
Could the secret of the country's success be linked to the appetite of the premises for an extremely fragrant fish?
Take some advanced cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a pile of wet and dirty football clothes.
Wait a week.
And you get the disturbing smell of rakfisk, one of Norway's most popular dishes.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
It snows, the landscape is spectacular - and this smell, omnipresent, permeates the air.
The rakfisk consists of salt-poiled trout and fermented in water for a period - depending on the smell you want it to exhale - that can go up to a year.
When the darkness settles down and it's cold, the Norwegians gather in mass to attend a festival that takes place here in Fagernes, dedicated to this incredible culinary specialty.
"You eat raw, then swallow a glass of aquavit," explains Havard Halvarsen, a local full-time firefighter who is also called "Rakfisk General", who is responsible for managing the festival.
Around us, people swallow small pieces of fish and put on a large amount of drink.
"Some people prefer aquavit to rakfisk," Havard adds.
The drink kills the smell.
I'm trying a few pieces.
If you can avoid putting it under your nose, it's not bad - it makes you think of a sushi that would have spent long hours on a bus.
The rakfisk dates back to a time when Norway was poor, before the invention of refrigeration, the fish was immersed in water-tight barrels in the air, then salted in autumn.
Then, in the winter, once well fermented, the fish came out and - no doubt with the senses reduced by alcohol - eaten.
In the previous generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country to find work, emigrating mainly to the United States.
Now the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by full employment, high wages and a comprehensive health system.
The Swedes, their old rivals whose country was not so much richer than Norway, crossed the border to come to work.
Rakfisk is considered to be something important, a vital, albeit odorous, element of Norway's past.
This is one of the most expensive dishes.
But everything is expensive - a small pint of beer or a sandwich will cost you 10 € each.
Norway does not often make mention of it in international news, which is not to its displeasure.
Here, people are not willing to talk about Anders Breivik, the right-wing extremist racist who killed 77 people, including women and children.
When they mention this murder, they speak of "the July 22 incident".
It is difficult for Norwegians to accept that in their peaceful country one of their own could have committed such an act of barbarism.
Since the early 1970s, Norway has owed its wealth to its oil and gas industry, one of the most important in the world.
"But oil is not the only reason for our success," explains Anna, our waitress, with a blonde hair and in the eyes of a transpiring blue, the image of Nordic well-being, with a rakfisk tray in her hand.
We are - as you say - prudent people.
His English, like most people who live here, is perfect.
We're discreet, we don't like to be noticed.
Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution - everything, with the exception of a small percentage of money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When other countries threw money through the windows, in the years that led us to the international financial crisis, Norway was able to keep the cords of its stock exchange tight.
"As long as we can ski in winter and hike in summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"Without forgetting the rakfisk," she adds in a carefree laugh.
I stand in the snow and line up to buy myself something to eat - I got my dose of rakfisk.
On the menu, a hamburger made of elk, a real discovery, is excellent.
But tonight, the smell of fish is everywhere.
The hotel I stay in is one of many places where you use rakfisk for dinner and where you can vote for the best of them - or perhaps for the most odorous of them.
There's a TV show where the presenter wears a bow tie, surrounded by rakfisk plates.
We'd think we were in the Eurovision competition.
"What score did you give the best fish in the Thor-Juergen Mountains?"
"Here's our points, Havard."
We hear laughter and applause.
A man falls out of his chair, maybe because of the aquavit abuse.
Or maybe it's because of the fish emanations.
Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto is experiencing a difficult start.
As incoming President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office in Mexico, Will Grant of the BBC is interested in the challenges ahead and the many expectations of the people.
Road traffic in Mexico is particularly bad at the moment.
In a city where traffic jams are legion in normal times, a safety dam has been set up since Monday, blocking several key road accesses in the capital and causing real chaos on the roads.
Nevertheless, the aim was not to prevent people from going to work, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching Parliament.
Next Saturday, Mexico's new president, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential scarf to become the new president at the head of the nation.
A complicated task awaits her.
Mexico's economy is doing well, the results that are due to outgoing President Felipe Calderon, but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has already cost the lives of about 60,000 people in six years.
"My government has made a commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence," Mr. Pena Nieto told US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Before joining the American president, Mr. Pena Nieto was governor of the State of Mexico.
A very populous and tentacular state that encloses the capital. In its favourite land, opinions about this new leader are divided.
A Direct Man
In the bucolic municipality of Valle del Bravo, for example, it is inscribed in the memory of all.
The premises attribute to it the development of tourism and infrastructure in the municipality.
To reach the city, you can take one of the new motorways of M Pena Nieto, an important improvement has been made to these roads, once bogged down and full of crevices.
Plates bearing its name are hung outside a new sports complex and an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
"We are counting on him to bring about lasting change," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of the Congress and party of M Pena Nieto, the PRI.
In terms of security and economy in particular, we hope for a real change that our country needs so much.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was evicted in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
The congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years spent outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there are many expectations within the party concerning Enrique Pena Nieto.
He rejects the criticisms of opponents who reproach the new president for lack of charisma.
He is an entire man, very committed, with an excellent vision of the country.
He is an excellent statesman and, above all, he can listen.
However, it is not always the image of the people of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the paved streets of Valle del Bravo could not be more striking.
Hidden under the autobridges of the highways, it is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City.
And the problems in the municipality are also concrete and urban.
Earlier in the year, soldiers were called to the rescue to fight drug gangs in the neighbourhood, and violence against women is particularly serious.
In a disaster area, dozens of women have been killed in the last two years on the edge of the landfill.
More than 1,000 women were killed in Mexico while Mr. Pena Nieto was governor, a much higher rate than in the very violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a notorious place for the number of innocent women who were killed there.
Mr. Pena Nieto's detractors say that at best, he failed to contain the problem of murders against women when he was in office.
At worst, they accuse his administration of refusing to see reality in the face.
In a concrete house, typical of this depraved neighborhood, Irinea Buendia struggles to hold her tears when she shows me pictures of her late daughter, Mariana Luna.
The official version mentions a suicide committed by Mariana in 2010.
However, her family believes that she was killed by her partner.
"When I arrived at her house, it seemed to me that her body had been washed," says Madame Buendia.
Signs indicated that she had been beaten, and the rigor of the body was already initiated.
While her mother tells the story, a picture of Mariana dresses the wall, next to a cross where the word "Justice" appears.
However, this is exactly what the family has been denied.
The authorities treated me like I was an old gossiper, a troublemaker, a whiner.
They want us to accept what they say and keep quiet.
"But it's not normal that there are so many irregularities and omissions," she said.
When President Pena Nieto receives his scarf on Saturday, she will be accompanied by a heavy responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by crime in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has promised that he will make it his priority during his term.
"I hope he will be as good as president as when he was governor," said Olvera, Congressman in Valle del Bravo.
However, this is exactly what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear most.
Bradley Manning did not complain about ill-treatment, prosecutors say.
Prosecutors are trying to counter Bradley Manning's claims of ill-treatment during his detention.
The trial concerns Manning's detention in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants to close the case on the grounds that Manning's kidnapping took place under extremely difficult conditions.
The soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
The prosecutors tried to demonstrate on Friday that Private Bradley Manning -- accused of causing the biggest leak of confidential information in the history of the U.S. Army -- missed many opportunities to complain about the ill-treatment he claims to have suffered during his military detention.
During cross-examination with Manning, during a preliminary hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Prosecutor Maj. Ashden Fein stated that recordings of weekly visits to Manning by officers during his nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, did not reveal any complaints regarding his treatment.
The cross-examination -- during a hearing, the defence filed a motion requiring that the Manning case be closed on the grounds that the detention took place under very difficult conditions and constituted a sufficiently severe punishment -- took place one day after Manning testified that he wanted to commit suicide during his detention.
This military intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The documents were then published online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning was their source.
At the Friday hearing, Fein reviewed with Manning the forms that the officers had completed after their meeting with Manning during his detention in the Quantico military prison, where he was subjected to maximum solitary confinement from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Fein mentioned the forms on Friday, Manning acknowledged that the treatment he received from his guards was "excellent" and that the treatment he had received in prison was generally "very professional."
The forms do not mention any complaints of ill-treatment, although the officers directly questioned him about his prison treatment, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had verbally expressed concerns about certain problems and that visiting officers had discussed his concerns and indicated that they would take care of them, but they did not record the problems mentioned.
"They wrote "no problems" (after addressing the concerns), and however, it did not mean that I had not raised any problems," said Manning.
Military judge Col. Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he had not complained about his treatment during an interview in January 2011 with the special commission that had met to discuss the suicidal thoughts he had expressed in writing a few months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during the meeting was to change his restrictive status indicating a "risk of injury".
The military stated that they had assigned him this restrictive status -- a level below close surveillance for suicide risk -- for his protection and the safety of others.
"I wanted the staff to know that I was doing well, and I wanted this status to be withdrawn... in order to benefit from a better quality of life from my point of view," Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for nearly two months before being transferred to the military prison at the Marine Corps Base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He stated that he had considered suicide while in Kuwait and had fainted once because of the heat.
He added that the fact that he was not kept informed of what was going to happen to him or what was going on in the rest of the world was very distressing.
"My world was reduced to Camp Arafjon, to this cage," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I was gonna die in that cage.
Once in Quantico, Manning stated that he had spent the clearest of his time in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours -- without company.
Manning also added that the only items he had were a mattress, a blanket, tongs, clothes and glasses.
He tried to stay in motion, because sleeping or lying down during the day was contrary to the regulations.
Manning also stated that when he tried to sleep, he had a light in his eyes, lit outside his cell.
If the guards didn't see his face when he turned around at night, they would wake him up so they could see his face.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal complaint for Manning's salaries in January 2011.
Manning was placed in a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
Also on Friday, the judge asked Manning about an allegation reported in his testimony on Thursday -- that after being forced to sleep naked for a whole night in his cell in Quantico, he was forced to stand naked in front of the guards and other detainees one morning during the appeal.
Manning testified that at no time was he allowed to cover himself with cover during the appeal.
During the judge's questions on Friday, Manning stated that he had deduced from the order of his guard that he should let go of his cover which might have hidden his nakedness, but he acknowledged that no one had ordered him to let go of it.
Manning testified on Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the previous night, as he would have tried to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning allegedly told the officer that he could have used the elastic underpants or tongs to hurt himself, but that he had not.
That night Manning testified that his underwear, his tongs, and his glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hoped that at least the judge would take into account the experiences he had experienced during his detention and that he would significantly reduce his sentence if he were to be found guilty before a court martial, a trial that should take place early next year.
The defence stated that Manning is considering pleading guilty to the least serious crimes and fighting for the abandonment of other charges deemed too extreme.
The hearing should resume this weekend, with prosecutors who should argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon confirmed that Manning was incarcerated in accordance with the regulations governing the conditions of detention of all detainees in Quantico.
The charges brought against Manning include theft of public goods or documents, collusion with the enemy, resulting in illegal publication of Internet information, and transmission of national defence information.
If all charges are upheld, he will face life imprisonment.
My Mexican-American identity crisis
He says that many were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to blame those who left; they remind Mexicans of difficult times, he said.
Navarrette says that the Mexican-Americans find themselves caught between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, arriving in the lobby, in front of the customs and immigration services, I felt lost.
Panels indicated two tracks: one for the "Mexicoans" ("Mexicoans"), another for the "Extranjeros" ("Foreigners").
I remained motionless for several seconds, not knowing which line to lead me to.
I grew up in central California, where I was called the Mexican all my life.
It's an ethnic qualifier, just like the one my friends in Boston use when they call themselves "Irish", or my friends in New York when they call themselves "Italians".
Then I became "Mexico-American."
But here, it was Mexico.
And on the earth that my grandfather was born, there was no need for a special qualification or a trait of union.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, good enough to handle an interview in either language.
But I don't have a native's vocabulary, and I can't lose my American accent.
So I took my U.S. passport and headed for the "Foreign" line.
I thought at that time of the week when the new Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama at the White House.
Generally, when the leaders of these two countries meet, their favourite themes are immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans stay in Mexico rather than risking being in the United States.
He wishes to join the United States and Canada, and to create a Union for Trade on the model of the European Union, but in North America.
And Pena Nieto undertakes to continue the war against drug cartels in Mexico, although he has not provided further details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of bitterness.
Most Americans probably never thought about the fact that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to hand over half of their territory in writing at the tip of the rifle.
But for Mexicans, who think in terms of centuries, and not minutes, memories are everywhere.
Therefore, as soon as a U.S. official makes any criticism of Mexico, you begin to hear -- in the Mexican press, and among the elites -- complaints about how Americans undermine their neighbour's sovereignty.
And the children of Montezuma are looking for a fight.
And yet, for Mexico, the most difficult relationship is the one the country has with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
You want to talk about bitterness?
There's a lot of them.
Mexico has its winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities and others for whom the country does not offer them.
The only reason that explains the large number of Mexican ancestors in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at some point, in our family tree, a person, perhaps a parent or a grandparent, did not find any opportunity in Mexico and had to go to the North.
And most often, this person corresponded to a typical profile -- dark, uneducated skin from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And even if we are currently living the American dream, that we have gone to good schools and that we have good situations, we must never lose sight of the American dream that we are living, and not that of Mexicans.
Our identity is sometimes troubled, but our loyalty is obvious.
We grant it to the United States.
Moreover, we know that part of the Mexican elite among the ruling class does not like us.
The feeling is mutual.
We remind them of a humiliating defeat and they cough us up as if we were individuals of inferior strain and not sufficiently Mexican.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
For them, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families hadn't failed when they were living in Mexico, they would never have left.
And we would not be stuck on the right side of the barrier, living comfortably in the United States, but like lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and who emigrated legally to the United States when she was a child, reminds me that there are frictions between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans, because Mexicans claim their identity more strongly and Mexican-Americans are upset about it.
Although she is an American citizen, she feels like she is part of two countries.
On the other hand, many Mexican-Americans I know don't seem to be part of one country or another.
We love the music of the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also that of Bruce Springsteen.
We have the best of both worlds, but we are not rooted in either.
In Mexico, we are considered Americans.
And in the United States, we are considered Mexicans.
And now, to make the relationship a little more complicated, as I learned during my stay, some Mexican leaders and some of the intelligentsia want to get closer to the Diaspora.
They want the Mexican-Americans to work as ambassadors of fortune for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We will have to explain to our fellow Americans that Mexico is a superb country that must be visited and pressured by political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course.
That won't happen.
There's too much bitterness.
And, considering the pervasive wage inequalities, corruption and drug-related violence, many of us are not convinced that this is a fantastic country.
You're gonna have to take care of yourself, amigos.
It's normal.
While some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States of America for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, they must therefore accept that some Mexican-Americans always wish them the way their family members were treated not so long ago.
Hmm.
Maybe we're more Mexicans than I thought.
Old quarrels, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is still a failure for peace.
Could there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another outpouring of blood seems to indicate that such hope is futile.
While the same futile arguments persist to know who started, dozens of buildings were reduced to dust; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed; and for the first time, rockets fired from Gaza landed near Tel Aviv, Israel's metropolis, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But although Israelis and Palestinians seem to be blocked in their former conflict, all around them, the Middle East is undergoing a change.
The Arab spring has blown up everything, and whether we want it or not, the Palestinians and Israelis are caught up in this regional upheaval.
Perhaps their struggle will intensify a little further.
Yet, there is every reason to believe that this could help them to break out of this deadly impasse.
A war that makes no losers or winners
At first glance, it seems difficult to be optimistic.
Although the ceasefire granted on 21 November continues, this week's fighting has strengthened the supporters of force on both sides.
Hamas leaders, the Islamist movement that has been leading Gaza since 2007, will be proud to have forced the Israelis to abandon, even though Gaza has suffered a beating.
Having killed some of its leaders and returned the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza to one of the most miserable and overcrowded corners of the planet, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently in the hands of their Fatah rivals, the other more moderate Palestinian faction.
Moreover, Hamas leaders might say that time is their ally.
The influence of Islamists in the Arab world is growing, and Hamas has made rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, a growing regional power, once the closest Muslim ally to Israel, has taken on a cause and cause for Hamas, as has Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic states in the Gulf.
Hamas members jubilate and say that the growing Islamist bends around Israel, from Lebanon, in the north, where the Hizbollah militia exercises its domination, through Syria, where the Islamist rebels can overthrow Bashar El Assad, and up to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And the most important, on the southern side of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under the chairmanship of Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and central of the Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time to devote to Hamas.
On the other hand, the Muslim Brotherhood are cousins of Hamas, and their leaders are more easily relying on public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas can emerge as an important actor that can no longer be excluded even by Israel and America.
Meanwhile, supporters of Israel's hard line will draw the opposite conclusions.
In military terms, Hamas was put back in the can.
The Iron Dome missile interception system has proven its effectiveness and many Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis will be able to sleep on their two ears for a while.
In terms of diplomacy, America renews its unwavering support; and many European countries have blamed Hamas for being the source of the last wave of violence.
But above all, Israel prospered, notably under Binyamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister, who totally ignored the peace process.
Although rocket fire in Gaza has killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been spared by suicide bombings, including the separation barrier over the West Bank, the main piece of what could be a Palestinian state, and which protects Jewish settlements that continue to expand despite their illegality in international law.
Mr Netanyahu, whose Likud party merged with an even more bellicose party, that of leader Avigdor Lieberman in the run-up to the January 22 election, has the beautiful part.
Why do you snoop these Palestinian bastards into giving them a state?
If they ran the West Bank, would they not launch rockets, as their compatriots did in Gaza?
It is best to keep them behind this wall and hit them as soon as they come out of the head.
Perhaps the supporters of the hard line will prevail; but the Arab spring may change.
Even if Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere do not appreciate Israel, their priority will be to address problems in their own countries.
Israel's defence budget is more important than that of its four Arab neighbours.
Starting a war with the local superpower won't help the new Arab governments fix their economies.
Mr. Morsi worked with Barack Obama to get a ceasefire, which is a good august -- and could mark the beginning of something.
Israelis should also think about the future.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving the Palestinians of their right to self-determination could create a dustbin that is destined to explode one day in the territories occupied by Israel - a bit like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
The repression already weakens democracy in the Jewish state, and demography exacerbates this problem as the Arab population increases.
Bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to ring Hamas will have a diplomatic prize.
Both sides need to be pushed by those from the outside.
The answer remains that advocated by reasonable persons on either side, and by most of the outside world and by this newspaper: two states, with a transfer of territory by Israel in exchange for security.
A small and short-term hope is that the ceasefire will provide an opportunity for outsiders to defend this cause.
Egypt, which must now work to put an end to the flow of arms to Gaza, like Turkey and Qatar, is better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state in accordance with the 1967 borders with exchanges of land and a shared Jerusalem.
Arabs from outside countries should also put pressure on Hamas and Fatah to unite.
This would contribute much more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the forthcoming proposal for a pseudo state in the United Nations.
Obama also has every interest in Israel agreeing to negotiate.
During his first term, he did not present his own peace plan.
Returning to the White House, he seems equally reluctant to establish one.
It's a very narrow vision.
The stability of the Middle East is a vital issue for America.
This requires a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Laws for Neutral Cigarette Packages came into force in Australia
Warnings and pictures of sick organs cover dark green packages that are all identical, regardless of brand
This law came into force in Australia is a world first, logos and colors have been replaced by a dark olive green and horrific pictures of sick organs and representations of children and babies whose diseases have been caused by the smoking of their parents.
Apart from the different photos and health warnings, the only difference between packages, since this Saturday, is the name of the brand, printed in small characters on all packages.
This is the most stringent tobacco packaging regime in the world.
The Australian federal government stated that the goal was to deter young people from smoking by removing any glamorous representation.
Studies have shown that if people have not started smoking before the age of 26, there is a 99% chance that they will never start.
"Even when they are very young, children understand the message conveyed by tobacco manufacturers through their brand image," said Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that revealed, for example, that children associated the crown of a logo with a princess."
Although Australia has the lowest smoking rate in the world and these changes have little impact on the benefits of multinational corporations, other countries are considering a similar approach.
The tobacco industry has put pressure on this law.
Tobacco manufacturers said that this would boost trade in the black market, which would make it easier to access cheaper cigarettes.
"Wrong consequences will result from this legislation," said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Forgery in China and Indonesia will sell far more counterfeit cigarettes on the streets of Australia.
Others stated that the Act had given impetus to their activities.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, stated that the demand for cigarette cases, including silicone to hide horrible packaging, has increased sharply two months ago since British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco challenged the law and lost to the high court of Australia.
Ha stated that Zico has sold 6,000 to wholesalers and is awaiting stock renewal.
For us, business is good.
The only boredom, experts say, is the popularity of social media and the population targeted by the plan.
After a series of Australian laws prohibiting TV commercials, sports sponsorship and the obligation for retailers to hide cigarettes, tobacco marketing is now available online.
Australia has banned web advertising by businesses and local sites, but cannot prevent foreign sites from doing so.
"If you work in tobacco marketing and have only a small showcase to promote your products, the Internet is the perfect place," said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman noted an increase in the contributions of some Lambda citizens to brands on social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
Do we have to ask ourselves whether it is a simple citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes and who has bothered to make a video, or whether it is a marketing campaign orchestrated by an agency?
British American Tobacco Australia stated that the industry focuses on the new regulations in place rather than on marketing.
Industry went so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge these new judicial decisions - these countries told WHO that trade is unfairly disadvantaged, although none of these countries had significant trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected to be taken in 2013.
Plibersek stated that the government had held discussions with other countries on similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to make warning photos mandatory on packaging in 2001.
Now these warnings are present in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
More stringent laws are currently being studied in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia remain insensitive to these photos.
The pictures don't bother me.
I don't know.
"You take a cigarette and put the package away," said Victor El Hage when he bought a package with a picture of a tumor in his mouth.
To be honest, the only reason I'm going to be arrested is my little girl.
James Yu, manager of the "King of the Pack tobacconist" in central Sydney, said the uniformity of packaging made it difficult to store packages on display.
"Before, it took me an hour to unload a package, now it takes me four hours," Yu said.
"The government had only to ban them once and for all and we would have said OK, it's okay, we stop and put the key under the door," he added, raising his arms to heaven.
In a constantly connected world, it may be good to get bored.
I spent five hours at an airport during Thanksgiving because our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
Therefore, I had enough time to reflect on the theme of boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Spending half a day at an airport to wait for a flight is quite boring, even when you have books, magazines and iPhones to distract you (not forgetting duty-free shops).
But more and more, some academics and experts specialized in child development praise boredom.
It is perfectly normal for us - and our children - to get bored from time to time, they say.
This forces the brain to take interesting paths, or even to nourish creativity.
And since we are, for the most part, constantly in front of several types of screens, we no longer know the benefits of boredom.
Then should we welcome boredom with open arms?
Yes.
And no.
But I'll come back.
First of all, like many people, I thought boredom was a rather recent phenomenon, especially since we have more free time.
But this is not the case, says Peter Toohey, professor of Greek-Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011).
"The boredom goes back a long way," he says.
On the walls of Pompeii are Latin graffiti that evoke boredom, they date back to the first century.
Then there is the definition that we give to boredom.
The problem is that it has been defined and debated in different ways, said John D. Eastwood, Associate Professor of Psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After having gone through many publications and submitted the idea to a discussion group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experience that consists of "wanting to do something, but not getting started in a satisfactory activity."
What differentiates the boredom from apathy, he says, is that the person is not undertaking a task although he or she would like to do so.
With apathy, he said, there is no desire to do anything.
What is at the heart of boredom, he said, is "the interruption of the attention process, associated with a bad mood and the feeling that time is passing slowly."
The boredom can be strongly like depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that if the two can be linked, bored people tend to think that the problem comes from the environment or the world, while depressed people think the problem comes from them.
Sometimes we think that we are bored when it is actually a problem of concentration.
As part of their study, "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", which was published in the newspaper "Perspectives on Psychological Science" in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues highlighted an older experience in which participants listened on tape, the voice of a person reading a magazine article.
Some groups heard, coming from the next room, the too loud sound of a TV show that was unrelated, others just heard the TV show, and the third group did not hear the soundtrack at all.
Those who heard TV at a low sound level said they were bored more than the other two groups - they had difficulty concentrating, but did not know why, and attributed this problem of concentration to boredom.
When you are trying to focus on a difficult or challenging task, an interruption of attention can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, an associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you perform a boring task, "like looking at objects on a editing chain, music can help you not get bored."
In fact, he says, right now, we know that when we twitch or scratch, these gestures, often seen as signs of boredom, are actually a good way to stay physically more alert.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to giggle learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to remain motionless," said Professor Fenske.
We're all bored one day or the other - the delay in my plane flight, a speaker with a monocord voice, a particularly boring film.
But some people are more likely to get bored than others.
To measure this, researchers developed a "Taste Predisposition Scale" in the 1980s.
The scale includes statements like, "Among the tasks I perform, many of them are repetitive and monotonous," and "I have so many interests that I don't have time to do everything."
Using such a scale, researchers found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, and need, among other things, numerous and varied stimulations.
But in general, teenagers are quickly blasphemed.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of individual and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day via a beeper.
He noted that 32 per cent of adolescents reported being bored at school and during homework, while 23 per cent reported being bored when they were not in school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson stated that he did not know if today's boredom percentages, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he added that he knew that "adolescence is a time when boredom reaches its highest level", especially because children and adolescents do not have much control over what they want to do.
If I answer my question: Is boredom good for you?
Sometimes not, because in its extreme form, it can lead people to take absurd physical risks, make bets or abuse certain substances to pass the time, as studies show.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers mention a link between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying the problem for more than two decades.
"Blood is the way the brain found it to let you know that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a psychology professor at the N.Y.U.
But the brain doesn't always know what is the most appropriate thing to do.
If you get bored and use this energy to play guitar and cook, it will make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it will make you happy in the short term, but not in the long term.
So if your child gets bored and you give him an iPad, he won't be bored anymore, but he won't have learned to take care of himself or self-regulating, says Professor Fenske.
And "this self-regulation goes from one situation to another," he says.
Your child not only learns to have fun, he gets more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should glorify boredom.
Just like I don't think we should criticize him either.
Feeling comfortable outside of the constant brothing generated by activities and technology is the goal to which we should strive.
Professor Eastwood agrees with this.
"We need to get bored more often, but boredom awakens an acute and frantic desire to be connected to something that makes sense," he said.
According to him, what people are looking for is a way to disconnect and appreciate the stopping times.
"In an environment where we are constantly overstimulated," he added, "it is difficult to find ways to get into something when the noise stops."
In Colorado, no directives for the new marijuana law
Anthony Orozco, 19, a university student and football player in Colorado, is charged with something that will soon become legal in his condition: possession of marijuana pellets and a pipe used to smoke them.
Mr. Orozco stated that one day, in September, he and some friends were on board a car in Lamar, in the middle of the fields, near the Kansas border, when they were arrested.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco received a summons for possession of drugs and equipment that could be used for his consumption - minor offences, each accompanied by a fine of $100 - and a date of appearance.
"We are treated like criminals," said Mr. Orozco.
But is he one?
During the weeks of uncertainty that followed the Colorado vote to legalize the consumption of small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the response to hundreds of cases involving low drug use depends more on the place than the law.
Here and in the state of Washington, which has adopted a similar measure, hundreds of offences involving marijuana use have been filed without further action.
Police agencies have stopped charging adults 21 years of age and older for minor possession of marijuana, as the law will come into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in the more conservative constituencies of Colorado have called for the acceleration of existing marijuana cases and continue to charge those who own them.
At the same time, several cities from the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains are currently voting to prevent the opening of state-approved marijuana shops in their neighbourhoods.
"Things are changing so quickly that I don't know what the future holds for us," said Daniel J. Oates, the chief of police at Aurora, east of Denver.
Washington State regulators are also asking a lot of questions.
They are looking for guidelines on how to install a permit system, allowing them to produce, manufacture, distribute and sell - before the deadline of December 1, 2013.
They say that Colorado, whether we like it or not, is ahead of most of the marijuana regulatory states, first of all regarding therapeutic use and now regarding personal use.
" Colorado has a more regulated market and is a good indicator," said Brian E. Smith, spokesperson for the Washington State Liquor Control Board.
But no place or system, Mr. Smith admits, can do more than suggest what works.
"There is no real precedent on which we could base ourselves," he said.
Washington's law, which is called I-502, takes effect on December 6, leaving a one-year legal vacuum, during which the licensing system will still not exist, while possession of marijuana will be legal.
In the meantime, practical issues remain outstanding: how to balance the state's mandate, which guarantees appropriate access to approved marijuana and prohibits the installation of cannabis sales shops within a 30 km radius of a school, park, playground or nursery.
"There will be no more difficult places than urban areas to set up an approved cannabis sales trade, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area," said Ben Livingston, a spokesperson for the Cannabis Legalization Centre, a newly formed research group.
On 21 November, the chief of police, Oates, in Aurora, sent an e-mail to his officers announcing that the "City actorney" (representative of the Public Prosecutor's Office) would no longer prosecute people 21 years of age and over who own small amounts of marijuana, and that the police had to stop accusing people of this type of crime "with immediate effect."
Chief Oates stated that the police would implement the new court decisions that regulate the activities of those who grow marijuana for medical purposes, and that they would continue to prosecute drug traffickers and drug dealers.
In Weld County, northern Colorado, Ken Buck, the District Attorney of the Republic, embodies a stricter vision.
After the vote, he stated that his office would continue to deal with marijuana possession cases, mainly in order to put pressure on users to be detoxified.
At present, 119 people are charged with possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, but many of them are the subject of other charges.
"Our office has an obligation to prosecute those persons who committed an offence that, at the time of the incident, was a recognized offence," said Mr. Buck.
Reactions were complicated even in rural areas such as Mesa County, where voters rejected the initiative for restricted marijuana consumption.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, no longer produce adults for possession of limited quantities.
The county prosecutor's office, Pete Hautzinger, supported this decision, but also decided not to dismiss all cases of marijuana detention without further action.
"I don't feel like I'm wasting my time continuing to enforce the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measure, providing an appropriate legal and government framework for personal marijuana consumption is not easy.
And the contradictory reactions that have been observed in different American cities highlight the deep ambivalence among local officials regarding the legalization of marijuana.
"This is a cultural barrier" with representatives of the Public Prosecutor's Office, said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer representing people accused of marijuana use and speaking as a local spokesperson for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
"They spent much of their lives prosecuting people who used marijuana, so they have difficulty accepting it as legal," he said.
As the first states to deal with restricted consumption of marijuana at the same level as alcohol, Colorado and the state of Washington are in the process of becoming a case of case law for the legalization of drugs.
While defenders and government officials are planning a new legalized sales border, they are anxiously awaiting federal government directives, which still see the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Defenders of legalization of marijuana hope that the Ministry of Justice will give way.
Despite some reported arrests of therapeutic marijuana patients and sellers, the federal government has mainly allowed marijuana sales outlets for therapeutic purposes to operate in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
While it is true that the police are probably not going to break into the doors to seize small bags of drugs, there is a strong bet that they are opposed to the licensed personal-use marijuana shops authorized by the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former political adviser to the Obama administration.
Many cities in Colorado have not waited for federal authorities to act.
Long before the vote, some local governments approved moratoriums on the creation of new marijuana sales businesses, even if this is only a one-year carry-over.
Last week, the city of Montrose obtained a six-month moratorium, and is expected to impose this ban next week.
"We don't want to find ourselves in a situation where a permit is granted to someone and then face a federal problem," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the municipal council.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We are interested in the vote of the community rather than the vote of the state.
Many questions arise.
Petronella Wyatt: I was misled and excluded from Oxford because I was a "Tory".
It is not only the students of today who are attacked for their opinions.
As far as I can remember, I've always dreamed of entering Oxford University.
My father and older brother studied in what was for me an eminent place to know, a kind of Greek amphitheatre of modern times that stimulates the two pillars of civilization, free thought and tolerance.
However, two weeks after I moved to Worcester College in the late 1980s to study history, I decided to pack my bags, causing the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and started crying.
My friends were bewildered.
The L'Evening Standard newspaper claimed that I left this university because I objected to the fact that undergraduate students had sex in the room next to my own.
Author A.N. Wilson stated with facsimile that I had left after being forced to drink in cut cups.
The truth was less funny.
I ran away.
Yes, I fled, because I had been intimidated and subjected to constant bullying.
Not because of my rather outrageous name, nor because I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for one single reason, and in this cradle of so-called knowledge, I was the victim of racist and barbaric behaviour: my late father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a very influential advisor to Margaret Thatcher and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party.
Why would you mention that today, you will tell me.
Well, recent studies have revealed that a new generation of centre-right students suffer the same type of persecution.
The growing and institutionalized hatred of Tory students in Oxford is such that last week, some of them demanded protection of their rights, along with those of gays, persons with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Student Hall (JCR) at Corpus Christi College stated that they were "often isolated, attacked personally and felt unwanted" because of their political opinions.
They want a representative on the University Committee on Equal Opportunities so that their views can be expressed freely.
Their situation has not been facilitated by the recent BBC documentary "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" ("The Land of Wonders: Young, Intelligent and Right"), devoted to student politics, which portrayed the "Tories" as eccentric and neo-Nazi.
In particular, the student Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), who moves to Rolls-Royce, has a silver suit and moves with a chrome-headed cane.
In other universities, conservative students claim to be treated as scapegoats for setting up higher tuition fees."
Luke Black, 20, vice president of the Nottingham University Conservative Association, told a Sunday newspaper that "there is a growing left-wing bias in universities.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without even meeting us."
Samuel Roberts, 21, a history student at Corpus Christi, who proposed a motion for more protection, said that such a climate was "uncomfortable," and Stephanie Cherill, 19, president of the OICA, said that there had been a deterioration in the attitude of members of the JCR towards people who were centre-right.
"This constitutes an obstacle to the freedom of intellectual debate, as well as to the well-being of members," she said.
I was the only one who thought that way during my first weeks in Oxford.
I entered September 1986, when I was 18 years old and paralysingly shy.
The hatred of the Conservative party was very virulent.
The previous year, the university had voted against granting Margaret Thatcher - a former student - an honorary title, because of the reduction in funding for higher education.
The atmosphere was full of Stalinist vibrations.
From the first days of the welcome week, when the new students met with others and teachers, I had a taste of what was going to happen afterwards.
I discovered that teachers not only participated in sarcasm towards Tory students, but also took pleasure in it.
It was as if the policy on strikers, privatization and government opposition to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa was engraved in the wood of classrooms.
The first sarcasm of which I was a victim concerned a translation into English of the French texts of the 18th century, and I was not prepared there.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I lost my foot.
Pitt, a little man with a pustulous face, easily got away with it.
"Do Thatcherists refuse to learn French or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students laughed.
The tears burned my eyes.
"I suggest you take French lessons during your free time - finally, if you're not too busy making friends," he said in a harrowing tone.
I went back to my room, inconsolable.
At dinner that night, I sat alone and felt a slight slap on my shoulder.
He was a second-year English student, named James, who presented himself as a member of the UOCA.
"I know who you are," he said, kindly.
I'm afraid so.
Anyone suspected of being a Tory (conservative) is targeted.
It's hard enough for me, but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it'll be even harder for you.
Most young Torys claim to be Labour (workers).
Later, at the local pub, I loosely tried to hide.
I insisted that I disagreed with everything Mrs Thatcher said.
This ploy has failed.
A first-year student of philosophy, political science and economics who, ironically, had studied in Eton, said, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're contaminated.
Other students have taken over the chorus.
I was perverted, you piece of shit.
"How do Tories make love?" asked one of them.
They hit each other, don't they?"
I felt like homosexuals before the liberal legislation of the 1960s.
Would I have only been able to lead a normal life in Oxford?
Would I have been forced to meet people who share the same views only after nightfall?
Should I have become Labour and denied my opinions?
The next three years would look like a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only professor openly Tory was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history, who taught at my university.
He was hated not only because he was conservative, but also because he was thatcher's foreign policy advisor and one of the authors of his speeches.
He was almost never there.
He hated this provincial and insignificant place, as well as its adherence to the Marxist-determinist point of view of history.
In 1997, he accepted a professorship position at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he said.
I began to shuttle between Oxford and my parents' home in London, finding refuge with my family and my more open - minded city friends.
I told my father I hated Oxford and I explained to him why.
He was unbelieving.
During his studies in Oxford in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But this is the best place in the world," he said pathetically.
They wouldn't do that, not in the city with dreamy bells.
Even my communist friends had irreproachable ways.
He had tears in his eyes.
Give them a chance.
I'm sure it's to tease you.
It would break my heart if you left Oxford.
Tired of my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance gradually deteriorated.
A friend, also Tory, succumbed to pressure and gave up his convictions.
During a work session conducted the following week, when another history teacher suggested the most serious in the world, that I was "an enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Inwardly blushing with shame, I admitted to being the victim of my parents' brainwashing and called them "old fools."
The respite was short-lived.
It was my father who pushed the last nail in my Oxford coffin.
At that time, he wrote two columns in Murdoch's press each week.
My door was locked.
I stayed up in my room, and after five minutes, my pursuers dropped out.
When they left, I packed my suitcase and took the first train to London.
I've never been back.
You can call me "wet chicken" whining.
But no 18-year-old child should be subjected to such intimidation in a school.
The most tragic thing is that it was Oxford, which not only produced 14 Tory prime ministers, but also enjoyed an unshakable reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to fame"
As part of the exhibition "Valentino: a Master of Couture", inaugurated this week in London, ABC interviewed Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous Italian seamstress customers.
Somerset House, the former residence of Élisabeth Ire of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The couturier recognized it at the inauguration of "Valentino: a Master of Couture", a prestigious retrospective that brings together more than 130 models of haute couture created for his sewing house over the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he declared with his inimitable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the centrepiece of a story whose only protagonist is "il señor" Garavani, but which could not have been written without its famous clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the closed world and apart from the nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until March 3, we find an impressive number of private letters and photos signed by the aristocracy's cream, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, through Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino exposes his personal memories as the trophies of his social ascension: from the modest seamstress of the city of Voghera, north of Italy, to the idol of the international jet-set.
There's nothing wrong with loving royalty.
"At least they don't crush their cigarette butts on your gorgeous carpet like some pop stars do," said Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and we were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and receives with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved being invited to his Gstaad cottage," explains former wife of "Heini" Thyssen, an intimate friend of past beauties like Marella Agnelli or Eugénie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to fame.
And even so, he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino model
The Argentine model, Valeria Mazza, has also not forgotten the charism of the seamstress.
Several years ago, after a parade on the Spanish square in Rome, we went to his apartment for dinner.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
We saw and felt his mind in every detail of his apartment, in decoration, food, music.
"With him, each guest felt important and appreciated", recalls the "top model", who began working with him during the week of the Haute-Couture in Paris in 1995.
"It will never go out of fashion, because its creations are works of art," she concludes.
Nobile lineage parade
Garavani's life is not a story of obsession but of shared love.
He loves people very high and with the greatest titles and they love him too.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a glamorous podium of 60 meters wide that proposes to exchange roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and has to parade on the podium to admire a "public" of dream carrying the main creations of Valentino, like the tailor that Jackie Kennedy had chosen for his wedding with Aristotle Onassis, the costume that Monica Vitti wore in "La Notte", or a coat of wool and fur that belonged to Empress Farah Diba.
Among these are names such as Sybille of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria and Sophie of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the seamstress in 2006
Many of his clients say that the first Valentino clothes are like the first love, "impossible to forget".
I remember it perfectly.
It was a trousers, a shirt, a vest "gillette" and a jacket from the Fall-Winter 1971-72 collection.
"It's a gift he gave me," said Naty Abascal, one of the seamstress' muses.
"I prefer him to all others for his femininity, his great love for women, and because he enhances our beauty," adds the former Duchess of Feria.
I like the colors he uses very much, they are bright and illuminate the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and Modesswoman Patricia della Giovanpaola d'Arenberg cannot, either, forget the first time she wore a Valentino model.
When she was a teenager and lived in Italy, she dreamed of being the age and opportunity to wear one of her evening dresses...
Finally, this was possible in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino model for a party in my cousin's castle, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red evening dress, with a steering skirt, a draped buster and a cleavage to fall.
"It was a dream come true," said Rodriguez d'Arenberg's widow.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, he is obsessed with timeless," explains the Italian aristocrat who shares his life between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The Princess of Arenberg keeps the evening dresses of the seamstress with "the greatest care, because an evening dress is not only a dress, it is also all the memories that she conveys".
The "king" of fashion
The grand finale of the Somerset House exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress worn during her marriage to Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "girls" (the seamstress thus calls his seamstresses) to make this dress in ivory silk with pearl inlays, twelve different kinds of laces and a four and a half meter drag.
According to Suzy Menkes, the supreme authority of the specialized press, this dress represents a historical fact of the high seams of the late 20th century, "the return of the clients of the high society".
Emboldened for years by the "knowledge-being" of the nobility, Valentino is now his best representative.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the largest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters, decorated with the Legion of Honor, Garavani has as many honours as any spouse of its clients.
"Its refinement, its calmness, its neat and perfect appearance have always jumped in my eyes," admits d'Arenberg.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Musée d'Orsay.
He was sitting at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, one of my great friends.
"He was impeccable, years have no effect on him."
If it's a princess who says so...
The toughest job in the world: Kawah Ijen's human mules
For four euros, Indonesian volcano-bearers risk their lives and health by carrying 70 kilos of sulphur across steep stone paths.
There are people for whom work is hell and others who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their living wearing the sulfur of the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
It must work every day to the bottom of the crater, where the sulphuric gas from the earth's insides solidifies in contact with the air.
After collecting large sulphur rocks, which weigh about 70 kilos in total, he installs them in two bamboo baskets which he loads on his shoulders through the steep trails.
There are only 250 meters to the top of the volcano that peaks at 2,386 meters of altitude, but exhausted carriers take more than 40 minutes to climb this distance, at a turtle's appearance, keeping the balance and measuring their steps so as not to stumble and fall into the precipice.
They know that a false step could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who made a fatal fall in the Kawah Ijen volcano several years ago.
The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 cents of euro for each kilo of sulphur extracted.
Once at the top, a path is paved between tourists who photograph them as if they were circus beasts, and carrying the heavy baskets painfully, they walk the 3 kilometers until the balance that a mining company has installed a little below at 1,850 meters of altitude.
This is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has operated the volcano since 1960 and, as we can tell, its employees, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents of euros) per kilo of sulphur.
It then sells it to the petrochemical industry at 10,000 rupees (83 cents euro) since this ore is very present in everyday life and is used to make candles, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to bleach sugar.
"As we transport about 70 kilos, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) per trip," explains Anto, who usually makes three trips a day.
Each one takes 3 hours and ends up exhausted, but this allows him to earn 138,000 rupees (11.50 euros) at the end of the day.
Although this seems to be a misery for such a superhuman effort, it is three times what he would gain in the fields.
"The income of minors is very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros) per day and where the average monthly wage is 2 million rupees (167 euros)", says the porter who used to work as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.20 euros) per day and the job was not as difficult, but Anto returned to his family in Banyuwangi, a village close to the volcano, for a reason which, in Indonesia, is as unquestionable as sulphur: "I married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I brought her back to Java to convert to Islam".
Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases.
At the age of 27, he spent three of his life defying the danger on the Kawah ljen, but the sulfur has already begun to make him pay the bill although he covers his face with a mask and wears special gloves.
Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases released by the volcano.
That's the price he has to pay to pursue his dream.
"I'm going to work another two years, because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French," he promises in an English more than acceptable.
Life-ridden, this friendly and intelligent young man could be a tourist guide, waiter or receptionist in a hotel, but instead he does the work of a mule.
It shares an unhealthy wooden masura with other carriers, rises every day at two o'clock in the morning because the sulphur keeps pouring out at night, when its characteristic yellow color becomes blue and shines in the middle of darkness.
Defying the darkness, Anto descends into the crater with a small lamp attached to his helmet, which he bought himself with his own money.
Some 400 carriers load the sulphur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater.
Despite its comfortable profits, the mining company did not mechanize the extraction of sulphur to save costs and does not provide any equipment to the carriers who work on their own and are paid by weight.
In addition, they do not touch a sub of the 30,000 rupees (2.50 euros) increase per camera, in addition to the entrance of 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros), that the guards of this natural park charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This work is done for beasts, not for humans," protested Madrusin, a 42-year-old porter who has been working in Kawah Ijen for thirty years, since he left college.
Capable of carrying up to 110 kilos, he assures that he will not stop working "as long as he can", because he needs money to raise his 3 sons, aged between 10 and 18.
I won't retire, I'll die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although sulphur damages the throat and irritates the eyes when the wind turns and traps the miners in the thick columns of smoke that come out of the volcano, they are so hardened that no one complains of suffering from serious diseases... to which are obviously added their usual breathing problems, osteoarthritis, pains in the knees and shoulders, distorted by the weight of the baskets.
By balancing the basket on his back, Unainik, 53 years old, can only load 50 kilos.
Every day, his companions and him extract 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, which three trucks transport to the Tamansari warehouse, 18 kilometers from there by a goat trail invaded by weeds.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano is my whole life," Unainik says by opening his mouth well, revealing several missing teeth.
The eldest of his five children, 30 years old, also works as a sulphur carrier.
Time passes, but the perpetual misery from generation to generation one of the most difficult trades in the world: the one made by the human mules of the Kawah ljen volcano.
Singapore looking for babies to save the economy
Singaporeans place responsibility for this lack of children on the career, stress and cost of access to property.
"The people of Singapore must grow."
I am a husband and a patriot, you are my wife and a patriot, let us fulfill our civic duty and let us give life!
It may seem improbable that these words come from advertising for mint pills, but despite this, or perhaps because of this, the video spread like a powder drag on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The lyrics come from a rap group that uses local references like "Let's put a polychinel in the drawer" to mock Singapore's birth rate.
BBH, the advertising agency behind the video, hopes to draw attention to the problem in a fun way thanks to this advertising.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music to make people fulfill "their national duty."
It is intended only for the Internet, so we were able to make it entertaining and fun.
This is the main problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in the field of birth, so we felt that it was a theme we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried several things like throwing perfumes at pheromones or organizing speed-dating parties.
Many of these ideas were creative but did not necessarily work.
So we said to ourselves: what more creative way to solve this problem than to make it a rap song?
1.2 children
The Singapore government does not take it so lightly.
It spends US$1,300 a year on policies to encourage its citizens to have more children.
A government measure in favour of marriages and fathers grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all of this has had little effect.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
Singapore ' s birth rate, according to its national population distribution, currently stands at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time he was above 2, considered the renewal rate, was in 1976.
Why, then, do Singaporeans not have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage and Family Policies of the National Population Division, says that this is due to "better education" and "a wider choice of career opportunities".
"This has made it possible for people to have a wider range of options in terms of life objectives and priorities, beyond marriage and family formation," she explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to the increase in singles and delayed marriage and birth, resulting in a decrease in Singapore's birth rate.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at radically increasing immigration in order to counter population decline has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites that abound in barely disguised xenophobia against new immigrants, especially against Chinese people who are accused of raising wages downwards and not integrating.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why last year's party in Singapore has had its worst electoral results since independence.
Since the elections, they have tried to correct the problem by introducing higher quotas and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the fall in the birth rate has known effects on a country's economic growth, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, Singapore's example also has unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to avoid the construction of many small houses.
For example, this began to affect the real estate sector.
Urban development authorities have begun to monitor the number of small apartments, known as the "shoe box", which can be built in specific areas of the city.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and their sale is very successful.
However, the authorities are concerned that they can promote a single lifestyle and discourage promoters wishing to build large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, general manager of the real estate company EL Developers, claims that his "shoe boxes" sell much faster than larger housing.
They are more popular, in the sense that these dwellings are built much faster than larger ones.
For this reason, it is much more profitable for our cash flow.
However, he admits that the new standards give clearer instructions to promoters, who were previously put in the wheels if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
If these new regulations can be a step towards increasing the national birth rate by talking to Singaporeans working in the financial quarter of the centre, it would seem that they will not have much effect.
"People are very stressed, homes are expensive, just like education, that's why people are putting it back on," says a young executive.
Other people may have children.
"But for me, it's important to have my money and my time," says another young man in his 20s.
Men and women mention their careers, stress and the cost of access to property and education as the reasons for preventing them from having children.
So, although the government is trying to convince its citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies, Singaporeans themselves have the last word.
What is private offline is private online
Confidentiality
According to the Dictionary of the Spanish Royal Academy, it is about the quality of the private domain or "the domain of private life that we can protect from any intrusion".
What is the private domain for those under 16 years of age?
How to apply this definition in everyday life and on social networks?
Does he understand the dangers to which he is exposed by broadcasting events on the Internet that he would certainly not share offline?
The newspaper elPeriódico interviewed five young boys, aged between 10 and 15, who were frequent users of the web.
In four of the cases, they associated the term "something very personal" on a personal level and "the password and user name" when they applied it to social networks.
"I will not reveal my most personal secrets in a post," says Jorge, ten years old, when he tries to explain the meaning of the private term on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has owned an account for two years.
"These are very secret secrets, my mother can know them but not everyone," he says.
On FB, I post nice pictures or games.
I'm also talking to my friends.
"I won't share one of my pictures or someone who'll be stupid," he said.
The young boy admits that it is wrong to publish obscene photos, naked people, crimes or to write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge ensures that he knows his 35 friends on FB as well as his nine Twitter subscribers.
The majority are family members.
Her mother is part of it, she knows the password of one of the accounts.
I opened a Twitter account to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I just post them," he adds.
"Social networks are fun, I can talk to distant parents or friends quickly," he says.
He claims that he would never accept the request of an unknown person.
Nor will he trust anyone who would recommend a stranger to him.
The case of José, 14, is different.
The teenager has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, on the latter, he admits not knowing 20 of the people on his list of friends.
"It doesn't worry me because we have something in common, for example music," he says.
According to the boy, no one made advances to him or asked him for his address or telephone number.
"If they put pressure on me or demanded it, I would simply delete them from my account," he admits.
José subscribed to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The experiences known today as cyber-harassment are not foreign to the young boy.
A close friend of mine was raided on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who it was," he says.
The victim, according to José, did not close his account.
"He only passed it in private profile."
He then explains a series of manipulations to configure his account in a secure way.
Unlike Jorge, this young man would post photos of knowledge in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would if I was angry or angry.
"Even if I know it's cyber-harassment," he says.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, a professor of English and a graduate in Education and Learning, believes that, in order to guide children and adolescents, it is important to understand that the goal of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet has emerged as a means of searching for information but, with the emergence of these sites, the rule of the game has changed," she says.
Porras reports that academician Marc Prensky, who holds a master's degree in pedagogy from Yale University and author of the book "Natives and Digital Immigrants", uses these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital natives are the ones, children and young people who were born with technology.
"We are the digital immigrants who have to teach them, while we are learning ourselves," she says.
He adds that the theme is complex, "because we ask them to have a defined criterion on what is appropriate or not to disclose, publish or say at an age where they are not mature enough to do so".
"We also ask them to be selective while what matters most to them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," she adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach confidentiality to children and adolescents is to use questions that make them think.
"Their saying they don't do it is useless," she says.
Then Porras lists a few examples: there are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or would you like them to publish a picture of you like a friend you published?
Do you know what others publish about you?
When you identify party photos, do you ask other people for permission to identify them?
And also, does everyone need to know what you do every moment?
Another point is to make them understand that they have to act online as they do offline.
They're the same rules.
"Outside the Internet, everyone must act with respect, morality and other principles, it must be the same on social networks," she says.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, primary teacher and education advisor, said it was essential for parents to read carefully the conditions for using social networks.
By understanding each of the terms, they will have a solid basis for discussing with their children the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
"For example, age and what is allowed to be shared or published," he says.
According to Guardia, it is essential to remind children not to talk to strangers.
The Unasur Summit ended without the Lima Declaration being made public
The Sixth Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without the Lima Declaration being made public, although it was previously announced and theoretically adopted by the 7 representatives present.
Efe has repeatedly tried to access the document signed at the 6th Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidency initially reported that it would be released after the summit was closed, and then said that it would be published from time to time on the Peruvian government's website.
When asked about the text, they reported that its contents had been presented by the President of Peru, Ollante Humala, in brief statements to the press.
Journalists' access to information about the summit has been constantly limited.
During the day, only the video without the sound of the presidential assembly with the message "private session, restricted audio" was broadcast in the press room.
The lack of information among journalists was reported by press officers from some of the Unasur governments who attended the meeting, with the exception of the Peruvian spokesman.
The only document released during the day was the list of presidents present, which caused some discomfort among the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who demanded more important information.
Later, the Presidency of Peru sent an e-mail to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it was President Humala's speech and not the official document that concluded the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the 3rd Arab South American Summit (ASPA) and, on that occasion, although it was requested by the press, it had also not disseminated the statement also called the Lima Declaration, as previously announced.
On the official ASPA website, it can be verified that the document was published last March.
At the two international meetings, the Peruvian authorities tried to put in place secure transmission systems for all journalists, but they limited the maximum amount of information.
The summit also concluded with the joint agreement of Chile and Peru to accept a judgment of the Court of The Hague which decides a different border between the two countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and of Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met at the regional meeting and stated that they would respect the decision of the ICJ to hear the pleas of both parties in the trial that Lima brought against Santiago and that begins Monday in The Hague.
"We will respect and enforce the verdict that will resolve the disputes that we are bringing today before this international court," said President Humala, alongside his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile has always been, and will continue to be, a country that respects international law, the peaceful resolution of disputes, treaties and international tribunals," added President Piñera, giving a hand to President Humala, alongside the flags of both countries.
The confirmation of the two presidents that they would submit to the ICJ took place after Colombia denounced this week the Bogota Pact by which it had agreed to submit to the decisions of this international tribunal, after a decision on the maritime boundaries with Nicaragua which it considered to be gravely wrong.
The summit was held without the presence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011, after the dismissal of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was tasked with opening the deliberations in the morning and closing the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The representative read the final document in which he announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and that the lines of action of 31 projects had been set between South American countries for a total of $17 million in investment.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the Unasur countries would put in place "significant steps to achieve the goal of South American citizenship through the development of agreements on residence permits".
He informed that action would be taken to improve "cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and international organized crime, actions to improve access to medicines, low-cost Internet access in all of South America, and to jointly and effectively assess the risks of natural disasters".
With a Europe in crisis, "the economic consolidation (of Latin America) must not have a triumphalist matrix but must help to increase our productive matrix and to look forward to a better future for our populations," concluded President Humala.
"We have decided to focus on a group of 31 iconic projects that improve the connection of South American spaces, especially in rural and border areas... by uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits," said the Peruvian President in a speech.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five were concerned with Peru and were on the transversal axes of his territory, from the coast to Brazil, and that two were aimed at a more important connection with Ecuador, although he did not provide further details.
Similarly, the final document mentions the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that this country's electoral process will allow its reintegration into the Union of South American Nations", from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated and having good relations with its neighbours, is another theme addressed at the summit.
In this sense, the Colombian President, Juan Manuel Santos, said, before starting the regional meeting, that he hoped to meet his Nicaragua counterpart, Daniel Ortega, the following Saturday in Mexico City to discuss calmly the maritime dispute through a judgment of the ICJ requested by Bogota.
"It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday), I have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," said President Santos.
"We're going to review all these avenues, they're not exhaustive, including the treaty with Nicaragua that's going to ask for a discussion with that country," he said.
"I hope to be able to tell President Ortega that we are going to settle this in the most civilized and respectful way possible," said President Santos.
Presidents Santos and Ortega will meet Saturday in Mexico City where they plan to attend the inauguration of the new president of this country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Similarly, within the framework of the summit, the Defence Ministers of the bloc will meet in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus in terms of defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of Unasur, although the latter country is suspended.
Peru holds the pro tempore presidency of the regional bloc.
"South America needs to learn from Europe how to integrate citizenship," says Rafael Correa.
Ecuador's President, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship was an objective for which "South America, in this case, should take an example on Europe".
President Correa, who participated in the Sixth Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), located in Lima, said on state television, TV Péru, that Europeans "had been killed during the Second World War" and other conflicts, "but that they were now almost a homeland".
In this sense, he defended the plan to establish a South American citizenship promoted by the Unasur member countries.
"The free movement of citizens and workers must be achieved in any South American country, as is already the case for the members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary areas that we want to make belong to the past," he warned.
In addition, the President of Ecuador expressed his support for the re-establishment of the Organization of American States (OAS) with the aim of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account the signatories of the San José Pact on Human Rights.
Those who beat our ears never compromise anything, but we South Americans have all signed it.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under the funding of the United States," he said, referring to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa assures that he does not regret his decision, because he himself has not betrayed his principles, but on the contrary he has respected his "deep democratic values and human rights".
He concluded that at the time, "there were well-founded suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that his trial would not be respected."
In addition, he criticizes the Swedish justice system, which has demanded that he submit to an interrogation of an alleged sexual offence on its territory, while "Swedish legislation itself allows this to be done by videoconference, which could be done from the Embassy of Ecuador in London".
Correa stated that there was a risk that Assange's mental and physical health would deteriorate.
"I haven't spoken to him since he was in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem, but nothing serious," said the President of Ecuador.
It is possible that his physical and mental health deteriorates by being locked up in a small space without being able to exercise in the open air.
"It works on the health of anyone," he concludes.
Correa points out that the asylum solution granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, which would be the award of a safe-conduct that would allow him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities and stresses that he had discussions in London in order to find a solution to the confinement of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been ongoing discussions.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities, as Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, has launched a whole series of proceedings with different European bodies," he said.
And he thinks that "if Britain were to grant safe driving as of tomorrow, it would end."
And if Sweden, as its legislation allows, and as it has done in other cases, were to question Mr. Assange at the Embassy of Ecuador in London, or were to question him via Skype tomorrow, the problem would also be solved.
Correa took the opportunity to reaffirm himself as a defender of freedom of the press and stated that what he did not tolerate was "the mediocrity, the bad faith and the lies that undermine freedom of expression".
"The greatest enemies of press freedom are not malicious or perverse politicians, but the bad journalists who pay for greed, blackmail and extortion," he said.
From this point of view, he welcomed the fact that this is not the kind of journalist "neither the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate Ecuador" and, rather than highlighting his re-election, "he would deepen the revolution to continue the path and to chart the right path".
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto on Paraguay within Unasur at least until the next elections, arguing that the organization "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and disguised coup attempts", because in reality, "this destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
Moreover, the Ecuadorian President considers as "perfectly relevant" the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries through the judgment of the International Court of The Hague, which will strengthen Nicaragua's maritime sovereignty.
For the time being, this judgment is not being respected.
This is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to move forward together.
They must be solved as a whole in order to overcome them and move forward.
At the same time, he expressed his confidence in the proper resolution of the maritime boundary dispute between Peru and Chile in the same court and stated that it is "beneficiary for Latin America to refer to international bodies if both countries agree to accept such a firm judgment".
Referring to the possibility of his nomination as a candidate for the future presidential elections in Ecuador, in order to run for a third consecutive term, he pointed out that he saw this possibility "with great optimism and joy, although sometimes it is quite difficult".
Correa assured that if he lost the primary school in February 2013, he would withdraw from public life.
At the personal level, I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unfair as those of Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be solved through political power.
"My political movement believed that I was the one who guaranteed this eventual victory, but we must accept this responsibility," he said.
If I won, it would be my last presidential term and then I would withdraw from political life.
If we ever lose, I'll do it too.
"It's my decision," he said.
Correa also referred to the new medical treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro and he told me that routine medical treatment was already planned and that he was waiting for the end of the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean a relapse in President Chávez's state of health," he commented.
The Ecuadorian Head of State participated today in Lima at the Sixth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which ended with a call for better regional integration in order to support progress, equality and security.
AIDS-related deaths are now due to late detection.
Fabrizio was 21 when he was confirmed the test result: HIV positive.
"It was as if the sky had fallen on my head," he said, referring to the time of the announcement, that the doctor had tried to make "less painful", in vain.
The young man hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness on his own and began to inquire about it and his hard work was such that he had just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV unit of the Civil Hospital of Guadalajara (HCG), in which he met in 1994 after many battles.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine in the early 1990s, where there were many doubts, few treatment choices and more stigmas.
So even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye to him "because he was speechless."
At that time, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and to have a good quality of life.
However, ignoring their disease, many people still arrive when the virus has already caused damage, "exhaust" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the emergence of AIDS in the world, in any case after the first reported cases, "the great victory today is that the survival of a patient who started treatment at the right time and the survival of the general population is exactly the same," said the head of the HCG HIV Unit, Jaime Andrade Villanueva and he takes as a reference that this information was validated in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
The HIV/AIDS infectiologist and expert, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS is no longer a fatal disease, but that the number of years of survival and quality of life depend on the level of allocation of the immune system presented by patients at the time of diagnosis, with better prospects for those who do not use drugs: up to 30 years for a CD4 rate of 200 and up to 50 years for those who reach 500 CD4.
To speak simply, this means that for someone who would receive a positive HIV diagnosis at 25 years of age, "as long as he remains under control, he will be able to live without problems up to 75 years of age," said the scientist interviewed.
In order to put this progress in context, it is important to know that the life expectancy of Mexicans is now on average 76 years.
While mortality has decreased significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of AIDS-related deaths increased from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (according to the UNAIDS annual report), but it is also true that, since the onset of AIDS, 60% of the patients identified on the national data base have died.
Just in Jalisco, 255 people died in 2011, and there were 187 deaths until May of this year; however, we are assured that access to antiretroviral drugs has been universal since 2005.
Then why are there still deaths?
I don't think the problem is with access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's what happened in our hospital.
Over the past 12 years or so, we've never been without medicines, the problem is that patients get to very advanced stages because they don't know they're infected, or they learn it at advanced stages of the disease.
It gives us an indisputable fact "nine in ten patients arrive when they already have an opportunistic infection, what it takes to have a greater impact on overall mortality, is to make earlier diagnoses and, for this, it is necessary to offer screening tests in a massive way, to all those who request it".
The specialists and members of the Jalisco (Coesida) State AIDS Prevention Council agree on his proposal, as well as the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who had to take his screening test in a private laboratory, simply because a friend had done it and despite his young age, he was already carrying AIDS and suffering from Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancerous tumor that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you learn you have AIDS.
Some people think they're going to die and don't want to know anything.
"If I'm going to die, I'd better have a good three times a week," they say, "it's not my case.
Change has been beneficial, I eat well, I exercise, I take my medication.
To date, his parents only know that he has cancer.
I have a normal life, like anyone else.
"I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but co-responsible, I pay attention to myself and the other person," says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to help, thanks to his testimony, those who are afraid today, during the march of World AIDS Day.
Let them take the test, if they have taken risks, the sooner they will know if they are HIV-positive and the better it will be, and if they already have the diagnosis, they must know that we can live like everyone else, being responsible.
His message summarizes the slogan of the battle against AIDS in this year 2012.
Condoms on the counter
There are many gaps between health programmes and the ordinary citizen, says Ricardo Salazar, Guadalajara journalist who embraced the cause of HIV.
And the greatest is prevention.
In all places dedicated to this, "we have actually increased the distribution of condoms, before we were given one or two, now we are given a hundred packets, it is very good, but it results, that still today, some do not have access to condoms," he says.
Adolescents are among the most vulnerable to new infections.
The question: "What are you going to do with it?", posed with sarcasm and value judgments by social workers, guidance counselors, pharmacists and health professionals, is the question that teenagers do not want to hear, says the journalist.
It proposes to reorient this ineffective distribution; that condoms not only be sold at counters, but are found in public toilet dispensers and in places frequented by young people.
It is not about encouraging promiscuity.
Nor is it a question of paying for the girls and the motel, as Governor Emilio González had said when asked if there would be a distribution of condoms in his administration.
"It's not how sexuality works, it's best to provide condoms to people who are already sexually active," he said.
The figures in Jalisco
There are 13.435 cumulative cases (12.158 AIDS and 1.317 HIV).
The State is the 4th state of the country in number of new and cumulative AIDS cases and 13th in number of HIV patients.
92% of the contamination is by sex, 6% by blood and 2% by perinatal route.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV, since for each recorded case there are 4 or 5 people who do not know it.
A judgment ratified on appeal by a United States court ignores the restructuring of the Vitro Group's debt through commercial bankruptcy in Mexico. The scenario causes a bad precedent for all domestic companies with branches in the neighbouring country and with solvency problems.
It seems, therefore, that the procedures for the survival of companies authorized by Mexican laws are not valid in the country under the starry banner, contrary to international agreements.
From a practical point of view, the blow to the judgment rendered on 15 June by Judge Harlin Hale of the Court of Bankruptcy for the Northern District of Texas leaves Mexican companies defenceless in the face of the possibility of embargoing their properties beyond Bravo.
However, the resolution will allow Mexico's main glass manufacturer to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court based on three inconsistencies.
First, while the judge of the case points out that creditors must register under the United States Bankruptcy Act, the Fifth Circuit Appeal Court, sitting in New Orleans, claims that the main proceeding is formalized commercial bankruptcy in Mexico.
The first point would involve denouncing international procedural cooperation in insolvency cases involving companies with a transnational profile.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law for Uniform International Commercial Law had been created for that purpose by taking the American Law Institute as an arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment states that without the inter-company vote, recognised in the critical mass of commercial bankruptcy, the debts contracted by Vitro's subsidiaries to the parent company, the majority required for the approval of the restructuring could not have been obtained.
However, Mexican laws recognize this possibility.
In fact, Vitro's case is not the first to use this plan.
Here there are half a dozen examples, among them Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose Federal Institute of Commercial Bankruptcy had secured debts.
Moreover, what is certain is that, since the subsidiary votes remained, in all ways Vitro's creditors who fought against this in the US courts, i.e. the "value" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergence, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have obtained the majority.
The vote would have been 45 to 37.
Data omitted by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro was blamed for the difficult situation he had faced since 2008 without stopping at the severe economic crisis faced by the United States, affecting the country's costs.
For the time being, the Gonzalez Sada family company will appeal to the same appeal court for the vote to be held in its entirety, i.e. with the five magistrates, since only three had voted.
The insurance action will demand non-prosperity and require a review of the trial by a higher court, in this case the U.S. Supreme Court of Justice.
The most serious is that the court ignored a document sent by the Government of Mexico on behalf of the amicus curiae ("friend of the Court") in which Vitro's procedure under the Commercial Bankruptcy Act was detailed, noting that this freed him from the conventions signed by the two countries to bring it to the same level as paragraph 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Act.
In addition, he noted that the country had adhered to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules established for cross-border insolvency cases, which ensured fairness for debtors and creditors.
Two-part carambolage: they astonish Vitro and they astonish the country.
General overview
The complaints of the unions of the Mexican Aviation Society against the former employer of the company, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, were silenced for several months, the latter was accused of fraudulent administration, the Association Syndicale des Pilotes Aviatores has already encountered problems.
The court, headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau, has just filed a criminal application against the National Banking and Values Commission, which is accused of obstruction of justice.
According to him, the inspection authority systematically denied having provided information to the Attorney General of the Republic on an operation carried out by the contractor to withdraw from the trust F/589 of the bank IXE 198 million pesos on behalf of the Mexicana de Aviación.
The funds would have been used for the purchase of shares of the Professional Administration of Hotels.
As everyone knows, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
They besiege the Dragon Mart
Meeting on the weekend at an amphitheater at the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign ecologists, university professors, entrepreneurs and members of civil society approved the creation of a large opposition front to the inauguration of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
As you know, we are talking about a colossal sales and distribution centre in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products from the country of the Great Wall, with a residential area for employees of 150 companies.
Previously, the Canacintra (the National Chamber of Industry and Transformation) had succeeded in uniting the governors of the South-East Zone to oppose the monumental project, which is partly on protected areas and represents the largest of all threats to the industry.
ACTA's dead.
The government highlighted a Senate requirement to explain under which terms and circumstances the Mexican Ambassador to Japan had signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known under its English acronym ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property, this theme is already ancient history.
As everyone knows, it was good that the Senate itself condemned this possibility, as it was considered an infringement of freedom of expression on social networks.
Long-term homex
In order to pay long-term debts without affecting short-term debts, the Homex real estate developer launched the Stock Exchange market for 500 million pesos.

Hector "Hetin" Reyes "Basketball is my whole life"
The globe-trottor of the basketball "Hetin" Reyes spent more than 60 years of his life in relation to the field and, thanks to it, traveled all over the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a knowledge of the history of local basketball as big as Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
The reason for this is that before a brain hemorrhage sentenced him to wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in this sport for more than 60 years, whether as a lower league player, a national basketball team player, a national team manager and leader, the BSN, with the Bayamón Vaqueros or as president of the basketball federation.
"I wore several caps in basketball throughout my life, and even several at the same time, as when I was president of the BSN, director general of the national team and president of the federation during the 90s," Reyes recalls during a visit of Primera Hora to his home in Bayamón, where he resides with Isabel, his faithful wife for over 50 years.
"Basketball is my whole life."
Reyes does not exaggerate when he makes that statement.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memories that remind us of his extraordinary itinerary, testify to this.
Bayamón in the heart
Of all his memories, those he loves most are those who remind him of his passing as a player in the Vaqueros team in the mid-50s until 1982, after spending 15 years as a co-manager or manager of the team.
"It was my best years, the ones I enjoyed most because I had the chance to participate in eight Vaqueros championships from 1967, whether as manager, co-manager or leader.
This has been a great many years of satisfaction, including the five championships held from 1971 to 1975.
I then retired from the championship in 1981, the year Jerome Mincy joined the BSN team.
From there, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator, took the lead of the team," says Reyes.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had been a leader here and who was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me: "I have a strong player for you, he is two meters tall.
Do you want it?"
This is how to start Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has had.
Bartow then recommended me Raymond Gausse, who was naturalized and who was one of the best shooters.
I remember he said that if Mincy had allowed Bayamon to win a championship, Gausse would help us try to win another one.
He was delighted with the Vauqueros championship with Gausse, but only remotely since in 1988 he was already the great mannitou of the federation.
At that time, he preferred to take advantage of his duties and those of Mincy on the national team.
I remember when we won it for the first time in the United States during the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico City in 1989.
Then there was the 1990 World Cup, where we got 4th and where we should have won the bronze medal if that Canadian judge hadn't let us play the last game again, Reyes said.
Is the 1990 World Cup team the best national team you've ever seen?
She is one of the best, just like the one who beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympic Games.
But my favorite is that of the Cuban Pan American Games in 1991, when we won the gold and beat the United States team, which was quite similar to the one that won the bronze at the World Cup.
This team was not only composed of Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), there were also the young (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who had not been able to attend the 90th World Cup due to a knee problem.
A team that may not have been the best in terms of individuals, but it gave us a gold medal and great joy during the Neuquén pre-Olympic tournament in Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner replacing the players suspended by the imbroglio of the Pan American Games of Mar del Plata, we won the gold against all the prognostics.
What was Puerto Rico's best player?
Without a doubt, this is Piculín Ortiz.
His statistics at the international tournament level are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated this level as Piculin did.
And that doesn't take into account his trajectory in the different leagues he played for.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
It's very hard to say.
We had a good team composed of Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
In young people, I really like the work Leo Arill does.
For you, what is your greatest success in the federation?
To have been part of the most glorious time of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that in the early 1990s the BSN had up to 17 teams in one season.
What's left for you to do?
There are things I would have liked to put in place, such as the regionalization of the minor categories.
For example, Ponce's boys play only in their area and face only teams from other corners of the island during national playoffs.
Today, young people travel and play too much while this is not necessarily necessary.
At least I saw the advantage of mandatory certifications and courses for leaders, field staff and arbitrators.
It makes me happy.
What are you doing today?
In general, I listen to music, watch clips of my time on YouTube, take advantage of my grandchildren and, from time to time, watch basketball games.
And of course, I take advantage of the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been with me.
Death of actor Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, born on September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, became known worldwide for the leading role of John Ross Ewing, better known as J.R., in the television series "Dallas", in which he embodied an unscrupulous, fearsome and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as unscrupulous oil magnate J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who had returned this year in the role of J.R. in a new season of "Dallas", died Friday night from complications of a cancer, according to a family statement sent to The Associated Press for the Warner Bros., production house of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in her beloved home town of Dallas, playing again the ironic role he loved the most," the family said.
Larry's family and close friends were with him in Dallas on this Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who played her wife's role in the original series and later, was with Hagman when he died in a hospital in Dallas, said her press secretary, Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all those who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, affectionate and talented, and I'm going to miss him a lot.
"He was an exceptional person and he lived life to the full," Gray said in a statement.
The doctors had diagnosed Larry Hagman with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and he had recognized that he had been drinking a lot for many years.
In 1995, he had been diagnosed with a malignant liver tumor and had been transplanted.
Several years before "Dallas", Hagman had made himself known on television as an ordinary type in the series "Jinny of My Dreams" broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In this one, he interpreted the role of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life was transformed when he discovered an attractive genius, interpreted by Barbara Eden, and brought her home.
He also played in two short-lived comedies, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
Among his roles in cinema are roles well received by critics in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was thanks to his masterful interpretation of the deliciously detestable J.R. that Larry Hagman had his greatest success.
The CBS drama series on the Ewing clan and their relatives was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan "Who Killed J.R.?", invented to maintain the suspense around an episode full of emotions in which Hagman's character is almost murdered, generated speculations around the world and millions of dollars played in bets.
Thanks to this, among other things, the series reached a record audience at that time.
When the answer was revealed in an episode of November 1980, 41 million viewers were on average in front of their screen and made "Dallas" the second most watched entertainment program in the world, after the final episode of "MASH" in 1983, which had gathered 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law, Kristin (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. had her pregnant and then threatened to accuse her of prostitution if she did not leave the city, but others also had reason to assault her.
Hagman played the role of Ewing as a corrupt and insatiable man but with a charismatic smile: a dishonest entrepreneur and an unfaithful husband trying to get his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know what it would take as an epitaph for J.R," Hagman said in 1988.
We should write, "This is the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only part he's lost.
Victoria Principal, co-protagonist of the original series, remembered this Friday of Hagman as a man " immense, both on the small screen and in life".
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of fans around the world, and in the heart of each of us, who have had the chance to know and love it.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success on the TNT channel.
The recording of five episodes is already finished for the second season and a sixth is being realized, the channel informed.
For the time being, neither Warner nor TNT have reported on how Hagman's death will be integrated into the series.
Originally from Fort Worth, Texas, he is the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who met the celebrity with classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Mary Martin was still a teenager when she gave birth to her in 1931 when she was married to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He made his first steps on the theatre scene in New York in the early 1950s and then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
It was there that he met the young Swedish interior designer Maj Axelsson and married him.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for many years in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001, he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life" (in French: Hello Darlin': J.R.'s merciless memoirs)
"I didn't write anything in this book that could hurt someone or affect them in any way," he told the press at the time.
After his liver transplant, he became an active organ donation activist and volunteered in a hospital to assist worried patients.
"I advise them, I give them back confidence, I come with them when they come for surgery and then," he says in 1996.
I'm trying to give them some comfort, like, "Don't be afraid, it won't be easy for a little while, but it's gonna be okay."
He has also been a tobacco activist and has participated in several campaigns.
A course on the "End of the World" has just begun
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and global warming.
This semester, when the professor of religion Stuart Charmé decided to give a course on the end of the world, he knew that he was launching an irresistible hook there: the end of the "great count" of the Maya calendar, on December 21, to which many people refer as proof of the end of the imminent world.
But Professor Charmé had no idea what awaited him in the following months: the catastrophic hurricane Sandy, a fiscal gulf that some have nicknamed "the Armageddon of debt" and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where Christian theorists of the end times thought that the apocalypse would be triggered.
"I didn't realize it was going to be the most apocalyptic semester I've ever known," Professor Charmed told his students at Rutgers-Camden University, New Jersey, this week.
If we analyze what happened in the world today as if we were 30 days later and we were telling it, it was a very good time.
And it must be remembered that what is bad is good for those who believe in the apocalypse.
And he is not the only teacher to teach about "the end of the world" this semester, which will, in theory, be the last in history.
In Temple, Assistant Professor Barry Vacker gives the course "Media, Culture and End of the World".
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and global warming.
"We analyze this because these ideas proliferate over time," he said, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios guides a certain human behavior.
If nuclear weapons fell into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, students will analyze films with apocalyptic themes and study how they can be compared with examples of real life.
"I tried to inform my students about what was possible, probable, credible and impossible," Vacker said.
On the main campus of the State University of Pennsylvania, Latin American History Professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of Art History and Anthropology, teamed up to give a course, simply entitled "The End of the World".
"We add "2012" to have the opportunity to give the course again, in case the world does not disappear," said Professor Restall.
Despite the "imminent disaster", students must study, create projects and pass their final exams.
In the state of Pennsylvania, the final exam will be passed on the eve of the Apocalypse, which leaves students with no choice but to work "until the very night of the supposed end of the world," Restall said.
The courses proved to be quite popular.
"It was complete in two hours," Restall said about his course for high-level students, made up of 35 students.
We received e-mail messages several weeks before the beginning of the semester, from people asking if there was still room.
Students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It fascinates me to see what people are able to do to comfort themselves," says Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, Rutgers-Camden University.
For the fear of the Apocalypse, whether secular or religious, is only a matter of comfort, or lack of comfort.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old student in psychology and infirmary, claims to have watched all the apocalyptic films.
"I had never heard of a course that taught this subject," he said.
I appreciate it.
But none of the students interviewed, let alone a teacher, told us to believe in the end of the world date of December 21.
"Our first project dealt with the Mayan prophecy, and in a way we discredited it," says Julie zegle, a senior student in Temple, aged 21 and from West Chester.
The Maya never predicted the end of the world, it's only a key date on the calendar, Restall said.
But I concede that there is an anxiety related to the apocalypse in Western culture, dating back centuries, which causes people to react to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has sparked an upsurge in these speculations.
"In other places around the world, people don't think about it," he says.
This is mostly the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who teaches in the Philippines this year, responded quickly when asked if he knew that there were courses here on "the end of the world".
"The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world," he replied, as if it were an exception from a higher authority.
We have a grace from the Pope.
Restall points out that over the years, we have talked about the many supposed dates of the last judgment, and he says that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will immediately start thinking about the next date" or thinking about the fact that December 21 marks the beginning of a seven-year period at the end of which the world will disappear.
Students and teachers take the date lightly.
Many told us that they were thinking of going to "end of the world" parties.
"Sometimes I call friends and we laugh together," commented Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
