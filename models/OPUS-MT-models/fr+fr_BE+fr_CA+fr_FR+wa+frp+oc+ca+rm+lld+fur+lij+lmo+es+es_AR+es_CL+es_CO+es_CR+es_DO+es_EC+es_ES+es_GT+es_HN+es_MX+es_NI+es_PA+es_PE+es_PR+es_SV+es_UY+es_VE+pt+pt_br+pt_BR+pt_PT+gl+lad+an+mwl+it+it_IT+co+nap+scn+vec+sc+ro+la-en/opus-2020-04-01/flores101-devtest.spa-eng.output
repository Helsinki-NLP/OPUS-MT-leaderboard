In addition to confirming that at least some dinosaurs were plumbers, an already generalized theory, it also provides specific data that fossils usually do not offer, such as their color and three-dimensional structure.
According to specialists, this animal has a chestnut plumage in the upper area and a pale or carotenoid tonality in the lower part.
Also, the finding makes it possible to better understand the evolution of the feathers of birds.
Since the plumage of dinosaurs does not have a well developed axis, called raquis, but does have other features of the feathers (wines and barbules), researchers concluded that it is likely that the raquis is the result of a subsequent evolutionary development of these other characteristics.
The structure of the plumage suggests that its function was not related to the flight, but used it to regulate the temperature or as an indicator of the temperature. Researchers argue that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the analyzed sample has features of the plumage of an adult and not of a chick.
The experts' assessments were that, even when it comes to the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample illustrates more the plumage of an adult than that of a chick.

Candidates have the power to send representatives to control each stage of the process and, during the night, volunteers calculate the votes under strict supervision and in accordance with specific procedures.

When compared through the use of infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), it could be determined that the composition of the crystals coincides with that found in the urine of the affected pets.
I do not know whether they have realized this or not, but most of the products coming from Central America came to this country tax-free.
Even so, the Central American countries taxed 80% of the products we produce with tariffs. We treat you.
It seemed to me that that didn't make sense; it definitely wasn't fair.
All I'm saying to people is that you treat us the same way we treat you.
A bill was issued by California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, who does not allow the sale or rental of violent video games to minors.
The bill provides that violent video games sold in the state of California must be labelled with a decal with the legend "18" and penalizes their sale to minors with a fine of $1,000 for non-compliance.
Attorney General Kier Starmer QC made a statement this morning saying that Huhne and Pryce would be brought to trial.
Huhne has resigned, and Ed Davey MP will replace him in the cabinet. Norman Lamb MP is expected to assume the position of Minister of Business that Davey leaves vacant.
On 16 February, it was scheduled that Huhne and Pryce would appear before the Westminster Magistrates ' Court.
Nicholas Alden and Zachary Cuddeback, aged 25 and 21, respectively, died.
Edgar Veguilla suffered injuries to her arm and jaw, while Kristoffer Schneider needed facial reconstruction surgery.
Uka's gun stuck while pointing at the head of a fifth man. Schneider suffers permanent pain, does not see with one of his eyes, he lacks a part of his skull and his face must have been reconstructed with titanium.
Schneider testified through a virtual link from a U.S. Air Force base in his home country.
Carpanedo participated in two individual championship races apart from Wednesday's competition.
The first was the slalom, in which he obtained a "No Finished the first race", as well as 36 of the 116 participants in that race.
In his other race, the giant slalon, got the tenth place in the women's group sitting with a combined run time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes behind the first Austrian finalist, Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes below the ninth finalist, Gyöngyi Dani, of Hungary.
Four skiers in the seated category failed to complete their races and a total of 45 participants from 117 of the Giant Slalom did not reach the classification in the race.
Madhya Pradesh's police force was able to retrieve the stolen laptop and cell phone.
Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya said: "We have arrested five individuals who abused the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
Baba, Bhutha, Rampro, Gaza and Vishnu Kanjar are the accused.
According to the police superintendent, Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the accused appeared before the court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people inside the house at the time of the car's impact, none of them suffered injuries.
However, the driver suffered serious injuries to his head.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed as emergency services pulled the driver of the red Audi TT out of its interior.
He was initially transferred to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Then he was transferred to Addenbrooke Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been in the Edinburgh County Court, charged with the murder of her son.
While she is in custody pending prosecution and trial, any statement by an eyewitness may be questionable, as her image has been widely disseminated.
It is common practice in other regions of the United Kingdom, but since Scottish justice works otherwise, the courts considered the publication of photographs to be potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee University said: "It seems that journalists walk in dangerous terrain when they publish photos or other information about suspects."
The Crown Office, which is in charge of the prosecutions, told journalists that no further comments would be made at least until the indictment was issued.
According to the leaked information, the document will deal with the border conflict, which Palestine intends to resolve on the basis of the existing pre-war limits of the Middle East in 1967.
Other topics that were also addressed, as reported, include the future state of Jerusalem, which both nations consider sacred, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel requires a constant military presence in the valley for ten years once the agreement is signed, while PA accepts only five.
During the complementary pest control test, the rangers had to closely monitor the shooters, as they were monitored and evaluated for their effectiveness.
In a union between NPWS and the Association of Sport Shooters of Australia (NSW) Inc., suitable volunteers were recruited into the hunting program of the Association of Sport Shooters.
Mick O'Flynn, who is temporarily in charge of the NPWS Park Conservation and Heritage Office, noted that comprehensive security and training training was provided to the four shooters chosen for the shooting operation.
Yesterday, Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) of nine members.
In four years, it's Martelly's fifth CEP.
Last month, a presidential commission advised the previous CEP to resign, as part of a series of measures that seek to lead the country to new elections.
The commission was the way Martelly responded to the widespread demonstrations that started in October against the regime.
The demonstrations, sometimes violent, were provoked by the fact that no elections have taken place, in some cases since 2011.
Nearly 60 cases of iPods with problems of operation and excessive heating have been reported, resulting in six fires and minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) reported 27 accidents involving these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company classified as "non-serious".
The ministry spoke about the delay in Apple's report, saying it was something "truly regrettable."
Mariana was shaken by an earthquake at 7:19 h local time (21:19 h GMT) on Friday.
The Northern Mariana Emergency Management Agency indicated that there was no record of damage in the national territory.
The Pacific Tsunamis Alert Centre also reported the absence of tsunami indicators.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former police officer from that country kidnapped a bus and held tourists from Hong Kong captive.
Rolando Mendoza opened fire with his M16 against foreign visitors.
Several hostages have been rescued and, so far, it has been confirmed that at least six have died.
Both the six hostages, including children and elders, and Filipino photographers, were released early.
Later, the photographers occupied the place of an elderly woman because she needed to go to the bathroom. Mendoza was pinned down.
Liggins followed the same path as his father and began studying medicine.
He was trained in obstetrics and joined the National Women's Hospital in Auckland around 1959.
Liggins began his research on premature delivery in his spare time while working at the hospital.
His study showed that the fetal lung maturation of the baby could be accelerated through the administration of a hormone.
Xinhua reported that on Wednesday government investigators managed to recover flight recorders from the black box.
Luna's fellow fighters also paid tribute to him.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Moon was the first queen of the Extreme. The night of the two moons died, something unique, like her. A strong woman".
Dustin Gold at Polvo Runnels declared: "The moon was as rare as me; even more. I love it and I will miss it. I hope it is in a better place".
Since 2008, among the 1,400 respondents prior to the 2010 federal elections, there has been an 8% growth in opposition to Australia becoming a republic.
Julia Gillard, acting prime minister, held, during the 2010 federal election campaign, that Australia should become a republic after the end of Queen Elizabeth II's term.
34% of respondents share this view and want Elizabeth II to be the last queen in Australia.
At one end of the survey, 29% of people think that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible; at the other, 31% think that it should never do so.
The Olympic winner of the gold medal was to swim in the free style of 100 meters and 200 meters, and in three relays in the Commonwealth Games, but his physical condition has been put in doubt as a result of his complaints.
It has not been possible to take medicines to relieve pain, because their use in the Games is prohibited.
On 25 January, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number he had ever known.
Many people verified the finding by using various types of hardware and software and early February and made themselves known on Tuesday.
Comets may have served as a source of water supply for our planet, as well as organic matter, which has the ability to form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists' expectation is to understand how planets originate, particularly ours, since comets crashed on Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, assumed governorship at the beginning of last year and last month signed a bill that allows people of equal sex to marry.
He described rumors as "political talk and nonsense."
It is speculated that it will be presented to the presidential elections in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the Federal Aviation Administration, would reduce the distances of air routes, which would save millions of gallons of fuel per year, as well as carbon emissions.
It employs satellite technology, in contrast to the old ground radar technology, in order to enable air traffic controllers to detect aircraft more accurately and provide more accurate data to pilots.
No additional transport will be implemented and the trains will not stop at Wembley. Car parking and dissuasion will not be available.
Due to the concern generated by the possible lack of transportation, it was considered the possibility that the game would be performed behind closed doors, without the fans of the team.
On Thursday, Science magazine released an investigation that reported on the appearance of a new species of bird on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Experts from the University of Princeton, USA, and Uppsala, Sweden, reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, even though it was estimated to take much longer, due to the reproduction between an endemic Darwin finch, Geospiza forts, and a migrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can take all kinds of forms and roll into tiny figures.
Not only can it be hammered and rolled in sheets, but it is also possible to stretch it to achieve a very thin wire that can twist and braid.
It can become very thin and adhere to another metal. It is such thinness that it can be achieved that it was used to decorate the illustrations made by hand in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called pH of a chemical. You can develop a pH indicator using red cabbage juice.
The colour of the cabbage juice will be altered depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The number of hydrogen ions (H at pH) present in the chemical analysed determines its pH level.
Hydrogen atoms are formed by a proton and an electron. Therefore, a hydrogen ion is the result of stripping a proton from its electron.
Shake both dry powders together and, after doing so, with wet, hygienic hands, squeeze them out to form a ball.
A reaction will occur between the moisture in your hands and your outer layers, which will feel strange to the touch and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets with discharge in almost all houses, which connected with a sophisticated drainage system.
In some homes in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece, traces of sewage systems were found.
They also had toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, public toilets had toilets and some were shared by men and women.
When you communicate with someone who is thousands of miles away, you are making use of a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back almost instantly.
The satellite was sent to space through a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space, since the light of the Earth's atmosphere distorts part of the light and view we have.
It takes a giant rocket, over 100 feet high, to bring a satellite or telescope into outer space.
The wheel has changed the world in amazing ways. The most important thing it has done for us was to provide us with a much simpler and faster transport.
Thanks to it today we have many means of transport, such as railways or cars, among many others.
Below, there are more moderate-sized felines that feed on medium prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including independent domestic cats) that feed on small species that exist in much more quantity, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of niche: each feline has a particular function, which prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most socialized felines and their lives occur within large groups called herds.
The herds are made up of one to three adult males from the same family group, united with up to thirty females and their offspring.
Females usually relate closely to each other, making them a great family of sisters and daughters.
Lion herds have the same behavior as wolves or dogs, with whom they have a surprising similarity (as opposed to the other big cats) both in their conduct and in which they are highly lethal to their prey.
Integral athlete, the tiger has the ability to climb (but not too well), swim, make extensive jumps and pull five times stronger than a robust person.
The tiger is of the same genus (Panthera) as the lions, leopards and jaguars. These are the only four cats able to emit roars.
The one of the tiger is not a soundful roar like the one of the lion, but rather as a prayer of words spoken to grunts and screams.
The ocelots enjoy feeding on small creatures. As far as possible, they will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Almost all their prey will be much smaller than theirs.
Scientists believe that the ocelots track and find animals to eat (premises) through the smell, smelling the soil where they have passed.
They have very good night vision and in dark places and, in addition, they move very secretly. The ocelots hunt their prey mingling with their surroundings and then swing over them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) departs from the main one from which they come (for example, if they move to a mountain chain or river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily recede), they will often find themselves in a different environment than they used to be used to.
The new environment has different resources and competitors and therefore a new population will need different characteristics or adaptations than it had before to be a strong competitor.
There have been no changes in the original population, which still require the same adaptations as in the past.
As time passes, as the incipient population adapts to the new environment, it begins to resemble the other population less and less.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that it will not be possible to catalogue them as of the same species.
This process receives the name of speciation, which simply means the development of new species, and is an inescapable consequence and fundamental part of evolution.
Plants generate the oxygen that people breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that they exhale (that they fire).
The plants' food is generated with solar energy, thanks to photosynthesis. In addition, they offer us shade.
We build our houses from the plants and with them we also make clothes. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without them, the animals would not survive.
The Moosasaurus was the alpha predator of his time, so he feared nothing but others of his own kind.
His long jaws had embedded more than 70 sharp teeth like knives, in addition to another additional group on the palate, which means that anything that happened to him before, had no escape.
We don't have the security, but he could have had the viperine. His diet included turtles, large fish, other mossaurids and even it could have been a cannibal.
He also attacked any creature that entered the water: not even a dinosaur as huge as T. Rex was a threat to him.
While most of that food would be quite familiar to us, the Romans also ate certain unconventional items at banquets, such as boars, peacocks, snails and even a type of rodent, the lorion.
Another thing where they differed was that humble people and women ate sitting in a chair, while the wealthy enjoyed sharing banquets and throwing themselves aside while eating.
It is not possible that the recipes of ancient Rome included foods that arrived in Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
Verbigracia, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa and no ancient Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built for each of their gods a central temple considered their home.
People carried sacrifices for the gods and priests sought to meet the needs of those celebrating ceremonies and festivals.
The temples have an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary to which only priests could enter.
On occasion, special towers with pyramidal shape, called zigurats, were built to form part of the temples.
The upper part of the tower was a special sanctuary for his deity.
In the midst of the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was of no greater importance.
The Hebrew families spent most of their time outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard; the shops were only counters that gave to the street. The houses were built with stone.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests; therefore, wood was extremely expensive.
Very few inhabitants lived in Greenland. According to the Nordic saga, Erik el Rojo was exiled from Iceland for murder and, during a journey that he undertook further westward, discovered the island and gave it his name.
Even so, without prejudice to their discovery, the Eskimo tribes already inhabited the place by then.
While each country separately was 'Scandinavian', there were marked differences in relation to the people, monarchs, habits and history between Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have seen the National Treasure film, you may believe that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. While the reverse of the document contains something written, it is not a treasure map.
The Declaration of Independence has written in its reverse the phrase "Declaration of Original Independence of 4 July 1776". The text appears at the bottom of the document, face down.
Although it is not known to be true who wrote it, it is known that it was barely made, the huge scroll document (measured 293⁄4 inches per 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up to be saved.
Therefore, the annotation is likely to have been added just as a label.
Although the landings carried out during D-Day, as well as the subsequent clashes, had achieved the liberation of northern France, the southern side was still remaining.
His government was in the hands of the French of "Vichy", who were a group that, in 1940, had agreed peace with the Germans and worked with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the so-called "Operation Dragon" was deployed, through which the Allies invaded southern France.
In just two weeks, the American forces and those of Free France had achieved liberation from southern France and were on their way to Germany.
A civilization can be defined as a specific culture of which a large group of people who live and work together are part, that is, a society.
The term civilization derives from the Latin civilis, which means civilis, and relates both to the civil word, of the same language, which means citizen, as well as to citizens, whose meaning is city or city state and which, in addition, determines in some way the size of society.
State cities are the forerunners of nations. A culture of civilization involves a prolonged generational transmission of knowledge, a lasting cultural legacy and a homogeneous spread.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical traces, and fail to be recognized as civilizations themselves.
During the Revolution War, the thirteen states formed, at first, a weak central government under the Articles of the Confederation, in which the congress was its only component.
Congress had no power to set taxes and, given that it had a national executive or judicial power, such a function lay with the state authorities, which often did not cooperate in enforcing all their laws.
Nor was he empowered to annul tax laws or interstate tariffs.
The articles called for the unanimous approval of all states to proceed with their amendment, and the states gave so little importance to the central government that their representatives used to be absent.
The Italian national football team, together with the German team, is the second most successful team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the sports that are most practiced are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, skate jockey and Formula 1 races.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern areas, with athletes participating in international tournaments and Olympic events.
In Japan there are about 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making it the seventh largest archipelago in the globe.
Due to the conglomerate/group of islands it contains, Japan is often referred to as an ‘archipelago' from a geographical point of view.
Taiwan's history dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors sailing around the place recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, that is, beautiful island.
The establishment, in 1624, by the Dutch East India Company, of a base in southwestern Taiwan, began a transformation into the Aboriginal method of grain production, with the use of Chinese labour to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
The army of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the northern and western coastal region of Taiwan in 1683 and declared the latter a province dependent on the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after having been defeated during the First Sino-Japanese War, (1894-1895), the Qing government adhered to the Shimonoseki treaty, through which Taiwan's sovereignty was transferred to Japan, which retained its control over the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three capital buildings: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings have been rebuilt at the extremes of the complex so that tourists can visualize how they originally looked.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and the work continues today.
To illustrate, the most common fixed image format at a global level is 35 mm, which was the most widely used film size towards the end of the analog film era.
Today it continues to occur, but the most important thing is that its dimensional relationship was transferred to the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
In fact, the 35 mm format is somewhat confusing, as its measurements are 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
Therefore it is said that the dimensional ratio of this format (divide by twelve in order to calculate the simplest integer ratio) is equal to 3:2.
Many typical formats (verbigracia, the group of APS formats) are the same or very similar to this aspect ratio.
The third-party rule, which has been the subject of constant mockery and often ridiculed, is a simple pattern that generates dynamism while allowing some order to be given to the images.
It indicates that the most effective position where the central object is placed is the intersection that forms between horizontal and vertical lines dividing the image into thirds (see example).
During this phase of the history of Europe, the Catholic Church, which had accumulated wealth and power, was questioned.
For more than a millennium, Christianity had managed to unite the European states despite their different languages and customs.
His power, present everywhere, affected everyone, from the monarch to the people.
One of the most important principles of Christianity is that wealth must be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church funds are reserved for that specific function.
The church's central dome had remained in Rome for over a millennium and this concentration of power and money caused many to wonder if this principle was being respected.
Soon after hostilities broke out, the British began a naval blockade on Germany.
While the strategy, which involved the interruption of vital military and civilian supplies, was successful, it violated widely recognized international law and was covered by several international agreements of the past two centuries.
Britain extracted international waters in complete sectors of the ocean to block the entry of ships, even putting neutral vessels at risk.
Having received a reduced response against this tactic, Germany thought it would have a similar reaction to its unrestricted underwater war.
Throughout the 1920s, the attitude adopted by most citizens and nations was that of pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities that occurred during the First World War, countries wanted to prevent that situation from happening again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the U.S. to take a job with Edison in New York.
He arrived in the U.S. with 4 cents, a book of poems and a recommendation note made by Charles Batchelor (his manager in his last job) and addressed to Thomas Edison.
The ancient China had a unique way of delimiting the different periods of time. Each stage or each family in power constituted a different dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was also a period of instability, with divided provinces. The best known was that of the Three Kingdoms, which developed over 60 years, between the Hhan Dynasty and Jin.
During these stages, a bloody war broke out among many nobles who fought the throne.
One of the most bloody periods in ancient China's history was that of the Three Kingdoms, where thousands of people died in a struggle to occupy the throne of the great palace in Xi'an.
There are many its political and social consequences, such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the conviction that the country belongs to the people, not to a single sovereign.
Also, after the Revolution, the posts were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and prestigious to succeed.
The same is true of the military, since instead of basing military positions in class, they are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution was also a source of inspiration for many other people of the repressed working class in other countries to face their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this worldly life. He used to visit a cave that became known as "Hira" in the mountain of "Noor" (light) to reflect.
The cave itself, which lasted through time, realistically illustrates Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
At the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca lies a totally abstract cave on the rest of the planet.
In fact, it is very difficult to find, even if one was sure of its existence. Inside the cave, isolation is total.
Nothing can be seen more than the wonderful clear sky and the numerous surrounding mountains. From the inside of this cave, you can see or hear very little of this world.
Of the seven wonders, the only one still standing is the Great Pyramid of Guiza.
The Great Pyramid, erected by the Egyptian people in the third century B.C., is one of so many pyramidal and large-sized structures built to venerate the deceased Pharaoh.
The Meseta de Guiza, or "Necropolis de Guiza", in the Valley of the Dead, in Egypt, contains numerous pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many others of this kind, tombs and smaller temples rose up in honor of their wives and relatives.
The ‘arc upwards' mark resembles a V and the ‘arc downwards' mark is similar to a staple or square without its lower edge.
Above means that you must start at the tip and push the bow, and below means that you must start at the frog, where the hand holds the bow, and pull from it.
The ascending movement of the bow generates a smoother sound, while a descending one is stronger and sharper.
Feel free to make your own marks with pencil, but don't forget that the marks on the bow instruments have been printed in that place for a musical purpose and should therefore be respected.
On October 6, 1789, a crowd of women in the market forced the terrified monarch Louis XVI, Marie Antonieta, her two young children (Maria Teresa, eleven years old and Luis Carlos, four) and the king's sister, Madam Elizabeth, to return to Paris from Versailles.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd shouting and threatening the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to completely open the windows of their carriage.
At one point, a participant in the revolt shook the head of a royal guard executed in Versailles in front of the queen, who was panicking.
The Philippine people themselves paid the war expenses of U.S. imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime in order to pay most of the expenses and interest on the bonds that fluctuated on behalf of the Philippine government in the Wall Street banks.
From now on, the super gains from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would be the main gains of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars it is necessary to understand the context that gave rise to the establishment of order.
The European historical period in which these events take place is usually known as the High Middle Ages, between the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (i.e. between 1000 and 1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which, by convention, ended about 1500.
Technological determinism is a concept that understands, pragmatically, a wide range of ideas, from the impulse or technological imperative to a strict sense that there is an underlying logic that drives the destiny of humanity and that relates to the laws of science and how they are embodied in technology.
Almost all interpretations of technological determinism have in common two general ideas: that technological development in itself is unfolded by a path independent of any cultural or political influence and that, at the same time, technology has "effects" in societies that are inherent and not socially conditioned.
To give an example, one could argue that the existence of cars necessarily derives in the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for a reduced volume of cars and new manufacturing techniques are being designed to reduce the costs of owning a vehicle.
The massive use of cars also generates a higher incidence of traffic accidents, leading to the development of new techniques in the field of health to repair damaged bodies.
The element of cultural determinism was very present in romanticism, according to scholars such as Goether, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped people and, over time, customs and cultures related to that geography developed that, being in harmony with the localization of that society, were preferable to laws that were imposed arbitrarily.
Just as Paris is known as the city of fashion today, Constantinople was considered such in feudal Europe.
Its fame of being an epicenter of luxury began about 400 B.C. and extended to about 1100 B.C.
During the 12th century his status fell, mainly because, upon his return, the Crusaders brought gifts, such as silks and spices, to which they were given greater value than the goods offered in the Byzantine markets.
The title "Capital of fashion" was then transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The peak of the Gothic style took place in the period between the X-XI centuries and the XIV.
At first, the way of dress was greatly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to the slow communication channels, Western styles could lead to a delay of about 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most significant advances of that time was that, as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to fasten their garments.
Subsistence agriculture is defined as one whose objective is to produce sufficient food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family group exclusively.
Subsistence farming is a simple, generally organic practice that combines the use of stored seeds originating in the ecological region with crop rotation or other comparatively simple methods to maximize production.
Historically, much of the main activity of farmers was subsistence farming, which is still practised in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals with similar ideas and feelings of marginalization by social standards and give them the opportunity to generate a sense of identity.
There are many factors that can distinguish subcultures: age, ethnicity, class, location or gender of its members.
The features that distinguish a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, sexual, geographical, or related to religion or politics, or a mixture of factors.
It is common for members of a subculture to exhibit features of their belonging to it by resorting to the distinctive and symbolic use of style, such as fashions, gestures and slang.
One of the most commonly used mechanisms to graph the importance of socializing is to analyze the few unfortunate cases of children who, due to negligence, misfortune or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults during their growth.
These children are referred to as "savages". Some wild children are confined by people, in general their parents. In some cases, the abandonment of a child is due to the rejection of the parents of the severe intellectual or physical disability that the child has.
Wild children may have suffered traumatic situations or severe child abuse before they were abandoned or fled.
Others are said to have been reared by animals and some have lived on their own in the wild world.
When the wild child is raised exclusively by animals other than humans, he/she presents behaviors (within his/her physical possibilities) almost in a whole equal to those of the specific animal that cared for him/her, as well as his/her fear or indifference towards people.
Although project-based learning should facilitate this process and make it more interesting, scaffolding goes a little further.
Scattering is not a learning technique; rather, it is an assistance that provides support to those who are going through a new experience, such as the use of a new computer program or the start of a new project.
The scaffolding can be presented in both real and virtual format; to put it another way, a teacher is a type of scaffolding, but it is also the small animated clips of Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is embedded in the software and its function is to question, stimulate or explain procedures that may have been complex for the student alone.
Children are taken into foster care for a wide range of reasons, from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment where there is no affection, care and education; but it happens.
We can see that the family care system provides a safe environment for these children.
The goal of our foster care system is to provide safe homes, loving guardians, sustained education and reliable medical care.
The aim of family care is to meet all the needs that were not met in the home from which they were previously collected.
The Internet unites and mixes components of mass and people-to-people communication.
The different features of the Internet open up new dimensions from the perspective of the concept of uses and rewards.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are identified as significant incentives for the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995).
During a study of users' reactions to websites led by Eighmey and McCord (1998), "personal participation" and "durable relationships" were also identified as new motivational factors.
Through the recording of videos, there have been important findings in the interpretation of mycorepressions, which are movements in the face of only a few milliseconds of duration.
Specifically, it is argued that, by proper reading of their micro-expressions, it is possible to detect whether a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's speech, explained how those who cannot understand speech because of brain damage can, however, assess sincerity with precision.
It even suggests that the ability to interpret human behavior can be shared with animals, such as domestic dogs.
Through the research work of the 20th century it has been shown that there are two groups of genetic variation: the occult and the manifest.
The mutation process incorporates a new genetic variation; the selection process removes it from that set of variations.
Segregation and recombination balance the variation between one generation and another generation after generation.
In the savannah, it is not easy for a primate, whose digestive system is equal to the human, to meet its needs for amino acids with the plant resources available to it.
Moreover, not doing so brings serious problems: slowing growth, malnutrition and, ultimately, death.
Proteins in leaves and legumes would have been the most easily accessible source of plant resources, but they are not easily digestible for primates like us, except if cooked.
On the other hand, food derived from animals (hormies, termites, eggs) is easy to digest while providing a large number of proteins containing all essential amino acids.
In short, we should not be surprised if our own predecessors solved their "protein problems" in the same way as the chimpanzees of the savannah today.
Sleep interruption is to wake up intentionally during the normal sleep period and sleep after a while (10 to 60 minutes).
This can easily be achieved with a more or less soft alarm clock that will make you return to a conscious state, but without waking you up completely.
Registration is an additional requirement for the visa process. In some countries, you will have to register your presence and address of your accommodation with local authorities.
Other options that are based on biological rhythm consist of drinking plenty of liquid (especially water or tea, known as diuretic) before bedtime, which will force you to get up to urinate.
The level of inner peace enjoyed by a person relates in an opposite way to the amount of tension in his body and in his spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the force of life we count on. Each of us has the potential to find absolute peace and bliss.
We can all achieve enlightenment. The only thing that hinders the path is our tension and negativity.
While the foundations of Tibetan Buddhism are Buddha's teachings, they were extended by the path of Mahayana love and numerous techniques of Indian yoga.
In general terms, laism is very simple. It is based on kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of love that covers everything.
In Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (illumination) is activated with yoga positions, breathing practices, mantras or visualizations.
Tibetan meditation focuses on Devata Yoga. Through the visualization of different deities, energy channels can be debunked, chakras activated and the awareness of enlightenment developed.
The cooperation between the USSR and the USA was the result of confronting a common enemy, Germany, during World War II. After the war, the clashes of system, process and culture ended up distanced the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, those who were allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It would extend for the next 40 years and be truly fought, through substitute militias, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, among many other sites.
Because by 17 September 1939 the Polish defense was already broken, his only hope was to give the retreat and reorganize in the extension of the Romanian bridge head.
However, these plans fell into disuse almost overnight, when more than 800,000 Red Army fighters of the Soviet Union entered and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international, bilateral and multilateral agreements.
Using ships to transport goods is a much more effective way to move large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
The role of the navy has always been to ensure that its country retains the power to move its population and goods, while interfering with the enemy ' s ability to do the same.
The North Atlantic campaign in World War II offers one of the clearest and most recent examples of this. Americans were trying to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean in order to support Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, mainly using submersibles, tried to cancel this circulation.
If the Allies had not succeeded, Germany could have taken power in Britain, just as it did with the other European countries.
The goats were reportedly domesticated, for the first time, some 10,000 years ago, in the Zagro Mountains in Iran.
For the purpose of easily obtaining their milk, hair, flesh and leather, the ancient peoples and tribes began to stay with them.
Usually, domestic goats were gathered in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often cared for by goat herders who used to be children or adolescents, similar to the most popular shepherd. These grazing methods are still used today.
In England, the railways had already been installed by the 16th century.
Even though the rails of the carriages were made of simple parallel wooden boards, they allowed the horses pulling from them to achieve greater speed and drag heavier loads than on the dirtier roads of the day.
The incorporation of sleepers to keep the rails in place occurred quite early. However, gradually, they realized that the rails would be more efficient if they were coated with iron at their top.
This became a common practice, although iron caused greater wear on the wheels of the wooden wagons.
Eventually, the wooden wheels were replaced with other iron wheels and, in 1767, solid iron rails began to be used.
The first form of transportation that was known was walking. The human being began to do so in an upright position two million years ago with the appearance of the Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
His predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not have the habit of walking upright.
Although traces of bipedestation have been found in Australopitecos fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, the Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs 7 million years ago.
We can start living a more friendly life with the planet, be part of environmental movements, or even become activists and fight to alleviate, to some extent, future suffering.
It is, in many cases, like asymptomatic treatment. But if you are not looking for only a temporary situation, we should find the root of the problems and try to disable them.
It is clear that the world has undergone great changes, a product of the technological and scientific advances of humanity, and the problems have intensified because of people's overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle.
After being approved by Congress on July 4, a draft was sent by hand and signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson to John Dunlap's printing house a few blocks away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as the "Dunlap copies".
It was John Nixon who first read the document and did it in the courtyard of the Independence Hall on July 8.
On July 6, a copy was sent to George Washington, who ordered it to be read to his army in New York on July 9. On August 10, another copy arrived in London.
The 25 photographs of Dunlap, which are known to still exist, are the oldest preserved copies of the document. The original manuscript has been lost.
A lot of paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today. It's the birds.
Many people do not represent them as dinosaurs, as they have feathers and can fly.
However, there are many characteristics in birds that still resemble dinosaurs.
They have scavenged limbs with claws, lay eggs and move on their back legs just like the T-Rex.
Currently, almost all computers operate based on the manipulation of data encoded under the binary system.
A binary number can only have one of two values, they are 0 and 1 and, according to the computer jargon, these numbers are known as binary digits, or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be evident immediately. Its symptoms, such as vomiting, are too common to give an immediate diagnosis.
The clearest indicator of internal poisoning can be found with an open bottle of toxic chemicals or medicines.
Read the label for specific information on the first aid relevant to that specific poison.
Entomologists use the term parasitic insect in a formal sense to refer to this group of arthropods.
The word comes from its ancient relationship with the chinches, a species developed to parasitize humans.
Killer and bedbugs are nestlings; they are adapted to inhabit the nest or home of their host.
Registered cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the US amount to about 400 000, making it the most common neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
The central nervous system, the joint of the brain, the spinal cord and the optic nerve, is the object of attack of multiple sclerosis.
Studies indicated that women are twice as likely as men to have MS.
A couple might conclude that raising a baby would not be most convenient for them or the child.
These couples might choose to plan for the adoption of a baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents renounce their parental rights so that a different couple can take care of the child.
The main objective of science is to decipher the way the world works through the scientific method. Indeed, this method serves as a guide for most scientific research.
It is not, however, an experiment, it is a test that is used to rule out one or more of the possible hypotheses, asking questions and observations that guide scientific research.
The focus of both naturalists and philosophers was placed on classical works, especially in the Latin version of the biblical text.
Aristotle's thoughts, especially the questions of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As the rule of the Greek language declined, the West distanced itself from its philosophical and scientific Greek roots.
Often, many rhythms present in physiological processes and behavior depend decisively on internal cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not only reactions to regular external stimuli, have been recorded in almost all living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks oscillate self-sustainingly and have a period of free cyclic operation, even if there are no external stimuli.
One of the key indicators that DNA consisted of genetic material was the experiment conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase inserted their own DNA into a bacteria using phages, or viruses.
They conducted two experiments in which they marked the beech DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the DNA protein with radioactive sulfur.
Depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material and whether it involves germ cells, the mutation can have various effects.
Only mutations in germ cells can be transmitted to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism often attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including animal and vegetable wildlife.
Examples of possible activities on site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and park visits, and ecosystem information study.
One example is to visit, take photographs and learn about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small villages in their cars to go to their jobs and often cross paths with others whose jobs are in the place from which they have just left.
In this dynamic shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to a transportation system based on the use of private cars, and they support it.
Today, scientists argue that this massive carbon economy has deprived the biosphere of one of its regular states that has contributed to the evolution of humanity for the past two million years.
Everyone is part of society and makes use of transport systems; and almost everyone complains about them.
In developed countries, similar levels of claims about water quality or bridge collapse are uncommon.
What is the reason that transport systems give rise to complaints of such calibre and why do failures occur daily? Are transport engineers simply incapable? Or is there something more substantial that is happening?
The traffic flow is the study of the individual movement of drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them.
Unfortunately, it is not a simple task to study the flow of traffic, as it is not possible to make accurate predictions about the behavior of drivers.
Fortunately, there is a tendency for drivers to maintain relatively consistent behaviour, allowing traffic flows to have a logical consistency and may be subject to approximate mathematical representation.
In order to graph the flow of circulation more clearly, relations were established between the three most important elements: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships facilitate both the planning and design and operations of road devices.
The first species to fly were insects. This helped them escape their enemies more easily and find food and couple more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to bend the wings backwards, hitting them on the sides of the body.
This provides them with a wider range of possible small places to hide from predators.
Currently, anisopters and ephemeropters are the only insects unable to bend their wings.
Millennials ago, a man named Aristarco commented that the Solar System revolved around the Sun.
There were those who shared his theory, but many others believed the opposite: that the solar system orbited the Earth, even the Sun and other stars.
This seems to make sense, since on Earth you do not perceive your movement, right?
The Amazon River is the largest and second largest river on the planet. It contains 8 times more water than the river that follows it in size.
In addition, the Amazon is the widest river on the planet, at some points with an amplitude of up to six miles.
Of the total water coming from the rivers of the world that flows into the oceans, 20 percent comes from the Amazon.
The great Amazon River has an extension of 6387 km (3980 miles) and receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, they could never be surpassed by those of Guiza, neither in size nor in the sublime technique of their building.
The ancient Egyptian people of the New Empire were amazed by the monuments of their ancestors, which at that time were more than a millennium old.
With approximately 800 inhabitants, the Vatican City is the smallest independent country in the world and the smallest population.
Italian is used in Vatican City, both to draft its regulations and to issue its official communiqués.
The language spoken daily by the majority of those working within the state is also Italian and the use of Latin is generally reserved for religious ceremonies.
All citizens living in Vatican City adhere to the Roman Catholic religion.
Basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper have been known since ancient times, since they can all be found in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to extract with rudimentary tools.
The philosopher Aristotle developed the theory that everything consists of a combination of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
This kept greater similarity with the states of matter (with identical order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, only, at the same time, had the theory that they are transformed into new substances that make up the things we see.
Alloys are basically a combination of two or more metals. Remember that the periodic table has many elements.
Metals are considered to be elements such as calcium and potassium. From now on, there are also metals of the type of gold and silver.
There may also be alloys with small amounts of elements, such as carbon, that are not metallic.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter, composed of small particles called atoms.
The size of the atoms is so impressively small that the end point of this sentence could contain billions of them.
Therefore, when it was invented, the pencil gained many friends.
Unfortunately, as a result of the implementation of new writing methods, the pencil is used less and has lost its status.
Today, people write messages on their computer screens. They don't even need to approach a sacapuntas.
All you have to ask yourself is what will be on the keyboard when something new comes up.
The atomic pump operates based on the principle that energy is required to form a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons.
It's similar to what happens when you roll a heavy cart up a hill. By dividing the core once again, it releases part of that energy.
The nuclei of some atoms are unstable, i.e. they tend to decompose with a minimum or almost no push.
The surface of the moon is composed of rocks and dust and its outer layer is called bark.
The bark has a thickness of about 70 km on the nearby side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the lunar seas and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more seas on the nearby side because its bark is thinner, which facilitated the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on looking for what people are attracted to or like.
These doctrines hold that people have certain needs or desires that have been internalized as they grew to maturity.
These theories analyze what causes certain people to want the things they do and what factors in their environment force them to do certain things or not.
Two theories of well-known are that of the hierarchy of needs, of Maslow, and that of the two factors, of Hertzberg.
In general, two types of behavior can occur when managers begin to lead their former peers. On one side of the spectrum, there is an attempt to remain "one of the boys" (or girls).
Managers in this category find it difficult to make decisions that harm employees, impose disciplinary measures, perform performance evaluations, assign responsibilities and require accountability to staff.
At the other end of the spectrum, it mutates into an unrecognizable person who believes it is necessary to modify everything the group has been doing so far and to do so in its own way.
In the end, the ultimate leader of the team's success and failure is the leader.
This way of acting often ends up distancing the leaders from the other members of the team.
The same standards of excellence that conventional equipment handles apply to virtual ones, although there are small differences.
Often, members of a virtual team operate as a point of contact for their nearest physical group.
They usually enjoy greater autonomy than members of a traditional group, thanks to the fact that it is possible for their teams to meet according to different time zones that, for example, might not be understood by local management.
The existence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989 p. 109) is also an exclusive element of virtual equipment.
The ‘invisible team' is the management group to which each member reports. It sets the standards for each member.
What could an organization have reason to submit to the plaintiff process of establishing a learning organization? One of the purposes of applying the theoretical concepts of organizational learning is to promote innovation.
When all available resources are used appropriately in an organization's operational departments, space is created for creativity and ingenuity.
As a result, it is possible that the process of an organization that works in teams to overcome a difficulty of place to a new innovative process in order to meet the needs of customers.
For an organization to be innovative, leadership must first generate a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuous approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide factual evidence for a theoretical approach to cognition research. They therefore reduce the field of research and give it greater accuracy.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior contributes to the research of scientists.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injuries and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in mental functions.
Thanks to the culmination of new technologies, we have the opportunity to see and investigate structures and processes that occur in the brain that have never been seen before.
This provides us with abundant information and material to develop simulation models, which favor our understanding of mental processes.
Although artificial intelligence is closely associated with science fiction, it is a highly relevant specialty within computer science, which deals with behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in the field of AI involves the development of machines in order to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include monitoring, planning and programming, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and consultations, as well as facial recognition, writing and voice recognition.
These issues have become separate disciplines, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The Artificial Intelligence system is now often used in the economics, medicine, engineering and militia sectors, just as it was incorporated into various video game and personal computer software applications.
Study trips are an important part of any classroom. It is very common for a teacher to want to take her students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
The solution comes from the hands of technology, through virtual excursions. Students can observe objects displayed in a museum, visit an aquarium or contemplate beautiful works of art sitting with their class.
Sharing a virtual tour is also an excellent way to reflect on an exit and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, students at the Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital and each year the page is updated, but previous versions are kept online as in the form of souvenir albums.
Blogs can also help improve the writing of students. Even though students usually start their blog experience with a poorly cared grammar and spelling, this usually changes in the presence of an audience.
Because students are often the most critical readers, the blog writer begins to strive to improve his writing, in order to avoid criticism.
Also, the blog "requires students to be more understanding of the world than around them."The need to stimulate the audience's interest inspires them to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a resource that inspires collaboration and encourages students to deepen their learning beyond the typical school day.
The proper use of blogs "can empower students to be more analytical and critical, through the active response to internet content, can define their positions in the context of others' writings, as well as establish their perspectives on specific topics" (Oravez, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's captivating bilingual capital and has a variety of museums and art galleries that showcase Canada's history and current affairs.
Niagara Falls are further south and the north is home to the unexploded natural beauty of Muskoka and the extension that follows it.
All these aspects, among others, are those that highlight Ontario as intrinsically Canadian in the eyes of foreigners.
Large areas further north are sparsely populated and some are wild, almost uninhabited.
To make a population comparison that is a big surprise to many: in the United States they live more African-American than Canadian.
The location of the East African islands is on the east coast of that continent, in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is by far the largest and a continent in itself if we talk about wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or associated with France and are popular for their luxury beaches and resorts.
Islam was also taken to the land by the Arabs and was largely imposed in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The initial footstep of European influence and colonialism took place in the 15th century, following the discovery, by the Portuguese explorer, Vasco da Gama, of the route linking Cape Europe with India.
The region borders with the Sahel to the north, and with the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: All female visitors are advised to say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It will also be useful to use a ring (just make sure it doesn't look too expensive).
Women should realize that cultural differences can cause what they consider harassment, and that it is not uncommon for them to be followed, taken by the arm, etc.
Be blunt in rejecting men and do not fear defending their position (there are cultural differences or not, that is not right!).
The founders of the modern city of Casablanca were Berber fishermen during the 10th century BC and the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids used it as a strategic port, called Anfa.
It was destroyed and rebuilt by the Portuguese under the name of Casa Branca, but in 1755 they abandoned it after an earthquake.
The city was rebuilt by order of the Moroccan sultan with the name Daru l-Badya and the Spanish merchants who installed their businesses there called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most boring places in Morocco to go shopping.
In the vicinity of the ancient Medina, there are plenty of places where traditional Moroccan items are sold, such as clay pots, ceramics, leather products, water pipes and a whole range of bagatelas, although everything is prepared for tourists.
Goma is a tourist spot in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, on the eastern border, near Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma and left much of its submerged streets, especially in the city centre.
While Goma is quite safe, any overseas visit should be considered in order to be aware of the situation of ongoing clashes in North Kivu province.
In turn, the city is the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and its mountain gorillas sighting excursions are among the cheapest in Africa.
To move inside Goma, you can choose to take a wedding-boat (mototaxi). The regular (local) fare is CDF500 (Congolese francs) for a short trip.
This, in addition to being relatively inaccessible, has given 'Tombuktu' an exotic and distant image of land.
Although Timbuktu is a impoverished city today, it still has an airport and its reputation makes it a tourist attraction.
In 1990, it was incorporated into the list of sites of humanity's heritage at risk, a result of the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the most important stops of the special Wonders of the African world, by Henry Louis Gates, in PBS.
The city contrasts greatly with the rest of the country, as it has a more Arab-African style.
Kruger National Park (PNK) is located in northeastern South Africa and extends along the border with Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north and the Crocodile River in the south.
The park has an area of 19 500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, in each of which a different wildlife is developed.
This is one of South Africa's most important attractions and is recognized as the main icon of South Africa's National Parks (SANParks).
As with all nature reserves in South Africa, there are daily conservation and park access rates.
It may also be convenient to purchase a Wild Card that allows entry to selections of parks in South Africa or to all National Parks in the country.
The territory of Hong Kong takes the name of the homonymous island, which is the destination most tourists consider the main attraction.
The deployment of buildings that delimit the Hong Kong horizon has been compared with a luminous bar graph that is evidenced by the presence of the waters of the Victoria Port.
The way to enjoy the best views of Hong Kong is to leave the island and head to the Kowloon shore, located in front.
It is in the recovered lands of the northern coast of Hong Kong where its urban development is densely concentrated.
This is the place the British conquerors adopted as their own. Therefore, if you want to see evidence of the colonial past of this region, it is a convenient place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastal mangrove chain in the world, with a length of 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
UNESCO has declared the Sundarbans a World Heritage Site. The section of the forest within Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
Without prejudice to this, forests are not just mangroves, but possess some of the last remaining trees from the imposing jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
Sundarbans comprises an area of 3850 km2 and about a third of its area is covered by water or swampy areas.
The Sundarbans have been, since 1966, a temple of wildlife and it is estimated that there are currently 400 royal tigers in Bengal and some 30,000 mottled deer in the area.
Buses depart from the station between districts (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those traveling east and to Jakarta (also called Bumthang), leave between 6:30 and 7:30.
Because buses between districts are often full of passengers, it is advisable to purchase a ticket a few days in advance.
Almost all districts have the Japanese Coaster bus service, which are comfortable and resilient.
Sharing a taxi trip is an agile and comfortable way to move to nearby places, such as Paro (150 ngultrums) and Punakha (200 ngultrums).
The bridge of the Oyapock River is a steep structure that crosses it, connecting Oiapoque, a Brazilian city, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 m, with a length of 378 m and two lanes of 3.5 m wide.
Below the bridge there is a free space of 15 meters and, although its construction was completed in August 2011, it was not qualified for transit until March 2017.
The full operation of the bridge is estimated for September 2017, which is when Brazilian customs controls are expected to be completed.
The area that currently constitutes eastern Paraguay was inhabited by Guarani, who were the most important indigenous group in that region and who lived as semi-nomadic hunters, in addition to practicing subsistence farming.
The region each hosted other Aboriginal groups, such as the Guaycurú and Payagua, who hunted, collected and fished as a means of subsistence.
Paraguay, formerly known as "The Giant Province of Indias", was born in the 16th century, as a product of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and native indigenous peoples.
The Spanish began the colonization phase, which lasted three centuries.
Since Asunción was established in 1537, Paraguay has been able to preserve much of its idiosyncrasy and Aboriginal identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best teams and the best polo players worldwide.
The most important tournament of the year takes place in December in the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
Other tournaments and lower matches can also be seen in other parts of the year.
On the site of the Argentina Polo Association you will get information about the tournaments and where to buy tickets for the polo matches.
The value of the pound of the Malvinas (FKP), the official currency of the Malvinas Islands, is fixed in equivalence with the British pound (GBP).
There's only one bank on the islands, there you can change your money, it's in front of the FIC West store in Stanley.
Sterling pounds are usually accepted anywhere within the islands. In Stanley, you can also pay by credit cards or US dollars.
There are chances that credit cards will not be accepted on the islands on the periphery, but you could use British or American money. Ask the owners in advance to define the accepted payment method.
It is virtually impossible to change money from the Malvinas Islands outside the archipelago, so try to do so before leaving.
Because Montevideo is located south of Ecuador, there is summer when in the northern hemisphere it is winter and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics, with frequent temperatures above +30°C during the summer.
Winter cold can be misleading: although it is very rare that temperatures are below freezing point, wind and humidity interact to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no specific "rainy" or "dry" stations; the amount of rain remains almost the same throughout the year.
While many animals in the park are used to seeing people, wildlife does not cease to be wild, so there is no need to feed or interfere with it.
According to park authorities, it should be kept at least 100 yards/metres away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/metres away from the rest of wild animals.
Without prejudice to how meek they can look, the truth is that the bison, the uapatites, the moose, the bears and practically all large animals can become aggressive.
Dozens of visitors suffer injuries every year for not keeping an adequate distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially wild; therefore, respect their space.
Also, remember that the smells attract bears and other wild animals, so you should avoid having or cooking foods that release a lot of aroma and keep cleaning in the camp.
The capital of Samoa, Apia, is located on the island of Upolu and has just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and is the capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, the port was the scene of a disastrous naval confrontation when seven German, American and English ships refused to leave the port.
They sank all the boats, except a British cruiser, and nearly two hundred American and German individuals died.
During the war for independence faced by the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the city resulted in the murder of head of state Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are a large number of beaches, because Auckland has two ports. The best known are located in three areas.
In the North Harbour district, in the Pacific Ocean, there are North Shore beaches, which deploy from Long Bay, in the north, to Devonport, in the south.
The beaches are almost all sandy with safe places to swim and mostly have pohutukawa trees that offer shaded places.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive, in the extravagant districts of Mission Bay and St Heliers, in the central region of Auckland, are deployed in the port of Waitemataas.
These are family beaches, sometimes very crowded, with numerous and varied shops available on the thing. They are also safe to swim.
Number One is the most popular local beer and is not complex, but rather pleasant and refreshing. The other regional beer is the Manta.
While there is a wide variety of French wines, those in New Zealand and Australia could be considered better to transport.
The local tap water is completely safe for consumption, but if you are concerned, you can easily find bottled water.
Australians consider the notion of 'white flat' coffee to be foreign. A black coffee is called 'spresso', cappuccino is served with cream (rather than foam) and tea is not taken with milk.
Hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but delicious.
Numerous trips to the reef are made throughout the year and, there, injuries from any of these causes are rare.
However, accept the advice of the authorities, respect all signs and pay special attention to security alerts.
The cubedusas are located near the beaches and estuaries of the rivers from October to April, north of 1770. Sometimes, they can be found outside this period.
Sharks do exist, but they almost never attack people. Most of them fear them and would swim away.
The ocean is not the place where saltwater crocodiles actively reside. Its primary habitat is the estuaries of rivers located north of Rockhampton.
The booking of accommodation in advance of the trip gives you the peace of mind that you will have a place to sleep when you arrive at your destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, but through them it is also possible to reserve other accommodation, such as camp areas.
Usually, travel agents offer packages that include breakfast, transfers to and from the airport, and even combined flight and accommodation packages.
You can also save your reservation in case you need time to think more about the offer, or to get other documents for your destination (such as the visa).
However, any modification or request must be made through the travel agent in the first place, and not directly through the hotel.
