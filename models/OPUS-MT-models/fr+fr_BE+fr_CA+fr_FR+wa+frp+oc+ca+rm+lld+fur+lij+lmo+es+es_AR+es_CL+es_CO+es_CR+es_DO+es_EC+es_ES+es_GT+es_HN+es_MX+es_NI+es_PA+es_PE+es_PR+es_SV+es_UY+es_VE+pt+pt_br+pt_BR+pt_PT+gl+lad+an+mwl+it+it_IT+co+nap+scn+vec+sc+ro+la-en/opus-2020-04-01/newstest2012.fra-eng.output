Parliament has not ratified the amendment for the release of Tymosenko
The Ukrainian parliament rejected, as part of an amendment to criminal law, the draft annulment of the paragraph concerning the indictment of Julia Tymosenko, the leader of the opposition.
At second reading, MEPs rejected the proposed amendment to reduce the penalties for economic offences, which could have opened the door to freedom for the former Prime Minister currently imprisoned.
Tymosenko was sentenced in October to 7 years in prison for entering into an a priori disadvantaged agreement with Russia for the purchase of natural gas.
The judgement is not final and the court must rule on the appeal of the convicted woman in December.
Tymosenko describes the regime's political revenge judgment and has provoked a process of suspicion of bias of the court also to the west.
The draft repeal of paragraph 365 of criminal law, on the basis of which the former Prime Minister was convicted, was signed by 147 deputies.
It would have taken 226 votes to approve it.
Libyan victory
Libya's liberation or rebellion has already been defeated.
Muammar Qaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
The winners are still to be determined.
As is customary in the region, the winners in the elections are Islamists, but these are moderates or radicals.
The Provisional National Council has decreed the customary right of Sharia and we already know what this is about.
Libya becomes a country without crime because for a flight you cut off your hand.
Women can forget emancipation, women who do not respect their faith are subject to the death penalty...
It is the Qur'an that will unite in place of the dictator's personality the society composed of opposite tribes.
Such an order will prevail in Libya as we cannot represent it and as we would surely not like it.
But our way of life is not unique, is not objectively the best and would probably not be beneficial for Libyans.
It is particularly surprising that Islamist warriors have accepted help with gratitude from unfaithful dogs.
The only excuse is that it was not an American general who led the NATO strikes, but rather Allah whose greatness they celebrated at every attack.
So when it comes to looking for the winners in Libya, the West is not part of it.
We took part in the shootings, served Islam, and our peolitics turned away from the dictator as a political ally without any profit.
After the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not occupy Libya militarily.
Therefore, there is no problem for the premises to get rid of the "cruises".
Without land use, oil companies will have easily access to Libyan black gold.
Perhaps not so much, and the West will finally be able to boast of the protection of those interested in human rights.
As long as we stop these Sharia followers.
A new era of crisis is beginning.
France and the rest of Europe are in the investor's eye.
A tornado of statistics passed on Tuesday on Europe.
Each of the states published GDP-related information for the 3A.
The Czech economy has stagnated in the last quarter, while France and Germany are growing.
The bond market beats every record.
Investors look not only at Italy, but also at Spain, France, Austria and others.
Statistics offices in the euro area, Germany, Czech Republic and other European countries published their visions of economic development for the third quarter earlier.
Germany's GDP is expected to grow by 0.5%, while France's growth by 0.4%.
The two countries changed the data for the second quarter during which Germany was better placed than expected (increase of 0.3% instead of the expected 0.1%), however France reported a slight decrease of 0.1% (it was mentioned at the origin of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter.
But GDP has stagnated and according to the Czech Bureau of Statistics it is confirmed that we are moving towards a gradual decline in economic growth.
The results are worse than the analysts' forecasts.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter but stagnated during the last quarter.
In the third quarter, the German economy grew by 0.5% according to planned data and periodically recalculated.
The economy of the euro area and the European Union grew by 0.2% between July and September compared to the previous quarter, which corresponds to what analysts predicted.
The Greek economy fell by 5.2%.
Performance on ten-year bonds is 28.45%
The yields of the bonds of Spain and Italy are climbing towards critical limits.
Problems are beginning to feel in Austria, France, Belgium, etc...
The yields of Czech bonds remain below 4% while the situation in the region worsens.
There are voices in Germany saying that the ECB should be the guarantee of the last instance .
The Czechs qualified for EURO.
They won in Montenegro 1:0 and celebrate the qualification for 200 million
The performance of football has succeeded in its most difficult mission of the season!
In Montenegro, she also won thanks to the super Cech and the goalkeeper Petr Jiracek 1:0.
The Czech football team has also been very lucky in the second part to defend its qualification and won't miss the European championship.
Ihned.cz followed the qualifying match with a detailed report.
No special excitement during the first part and a great deal of luck for the second.
The Czech performance also won thanks to the super Cech and hero Petr Jiracek with 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates his qualification at the European championship.
Montenegrains were under pressure until the second part because of a precise Czech defence.
The vicissitudes of the game were Damjanovic and Vucinic who missed two chances of scoring a goal.
And thanks to the super Petr Cech the Czech representation will not be absent at the European championship next year, and in addition a reward of 200 million crowns in the Czech football caisse.
From the first few minutes we played a warrior football.
The two teams were difficult to assemble combinations and the game was concentrated mainly around the central line.
The pressure of national footballers did not break through the Czech defence, which responded precisely to the long shots even during the first half.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's nuclear program.
They've created a human shield.
A few hundred high school students have created a human shield around a nuclear site in Iran.
They want to support their country's nuclear programme in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
The students began to pray at noon in front of the site and then wished for the death of the US and Israel.
A few hundred students from the universities of Ispahan created a human shield on Tuesday around the nuclear technology center of Ispahan where uranium is transformed.
They openly stated that they would defend their country's nuclear programme at the risk of their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) noted in its latest information that Iran has consistently strengthened its nuclear weapons.
A possible attack on Iran's nuclear facilities is reported in Israel.
The students began to pray at noon in front of the site and then wished for the death of the US and Israel.
In the case of an attack, aimed at destroying Iran's nuclear programme, the targets would be not only Ispahan, but also the site of Natanz where uranium is enriched.
Feeding an obese child: do not take breakfast and take meat for dinner
Over a third of children aged 9-13 have overweight problems, 9% of schoolchildren are overweight and 5% are obese.
As current research shows, obese children come from families with unhealthy lifestyles.
This again shows how important is the environment in which the human being evolves and the models that surround him.
On the tables of obese children, for example, charcuterie is found 50% more often than in normal-weight children's families.
19% of obese people had fries at dinner according to the survey conducted with an awareness action "Obesity is not a coincidence"
In the families of the big kids sport is also not a habit, which is now the case for most schoolchildren today - only 15% answered that at least once a week parents found time for active movement.
Survey of 900 children
The survey was conducted during the last school year and 900 pupils from primary schools in Chechnya participated.
It was the second edition of "Obesity is not a coincidence", an action supported by the General Health Insurance and Unilever.
Since the beginning, more than 12,000 students from sixth to third have enrolled in this project.
One of the determining factors that causes a dramatic increase in the number of overweight and even obese children is the absence of proper nutrition and insufficient physical exercise.
"Only half of the children questioned indicate, for example, eating 5 times a day breakfast-in-case - lunch-tasting-dinner, which is a basic principle of a good diet," says one of the survey results.
No breakfast and cold cuts at dinner
Specialists draw attention to the fact that healthy development requires some basic details such as a family breakfast at the same time.
In the Czech Republic, only 23% of students' families eat at the same time.
In most families, everyone has breakfast alone.
And the worst thing that has been noted is that one tenth of the population doesn't eat breakfast at all.
Breakfast is, however, the basis for a good daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that in obese children's families, unhealthy fries are more often consumed.
Almost every student - not to mention the weight - drinks sweet drinks every day (70%).
More than 40% of the children questioned do sports regularly but for parents it is half, only 15%.
Get your food ready.
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to prepare their own diet based on options offered according to their own taste and personal opinion.
"The preferences of Czech children between the ages of 12 and 15 are far from ideal in terms of a healthy diet."
Among their favorite dishes there are many cakes, meats and sweets.
"The most alarming is in particular a high preference for sweet lemonades", is indicated in the results of the survey.
For lunch it is the pasta that took the first place right in front of the white meat.
Children did not want starch at all and the preference for fish and vegetable meals was very low.
Health heading
The survey also showed that children are ready to change their habits from the moment they receive the ad hoc information.
"During a review of a group of survey participants who had completed the questionnaire after the awareness session "Obesity is not a coincidence", there was a determined willingness to move towards a healthy diet," the results of the survey indicate.
For example, the most notable was sweet lemonades, as children began to give preference to drinking water.
The children most often checked on the questionnaire white meat and fish as main dish and would reduce sweet dishes and knedliky (Czech speciality of breadmeal or potato pellets).
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, says professionals
In a presentation article about how to learn for stylists, I got a little angry at the fact that there was a lot from the beginning.
I wasn't thinking about what was going to happen next.
The presentations of three professionals of the specialty, the clothing of the characters and a seminar on what is happening on the spot.
And it'll be worse.
The closer we get to the final exams, the more practical exercises and information await us.
And even when there are classes on Saturdays and Sundays, it's really "baked."
This time we have with Director Alenka (in the course there are no boys) how to dress the woman who does not have standard measurements.
And women of this type are the majority.
One has a small neck, the other a boy's body, without a particular curve, another overweight.
The stylist must know how optically to reduce wide arms, extend a neck or add necessary curves.
We have thus succeeded in highlighting the character nicely and also not to dress in too bright a way the types of women like Jennifer Lopez with a strong chest and pronounced hips and a fine size.
If, for example, there is a difference between the waist and the hips in such a way that the skirts or trousers do not pass at all, it is worth it to be made custom.
And you will not regret it because the clothing that falls impeccably is priceless.
In a custom skirt you will feel much better than in the one that slides continuously, curls and does not hold the belt and so on.
For those who have a masculine look they can afford a Tucker style dress, with pieces of sewn fabrics, or even embroidery.
There are obviously many examples of various appearances and I am glad that I have all week to sort out all the information received.
But I'm also afraid that with regard to what I have to do at home there are too many.
Each intern received a celebrity to dress for the day and the evening.
We must take into account the present appearance, the type of fashion of the personality as well as its appearance.
I'll have to "dress" Miranda Kerr, who maybe you know from the campaign the Secret of Victoria.
At the bottom of me, I am pleased because it is better than dressing Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera who has taken almost 100 kilos lately (don't take my statement, please, completely seriously) or the young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut and sew from magazines or search the internet, print and work graphics.
The Moodboard, as we say for the final result, expresses our personal style as well as our relationship with graphic creation.
Thinking also about the graphic part of styling is also important.
The stylist does not only dress physics but creates for example the productive pages in magazines (on given products trends for handbags, coats, etc.).
Mario Kamenik, stylist and graphic designer, told us all about this.
But this... until Sunday.
The stylist must have a general vision
Three guests of the specialty gave a diverse aspect to the Saturday session filled with information about the different types of characters.
Honza Pokorny, stylist, Jakub Polanka fashion designer and Ben Renc, fashion photographer.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to use it.
And a talented stylist knows how to work with a single garment in a different way.
Variability is a prime example.
Like for example this trench coat that must be worn in a classic way with a jeans and a t-shirt like a light coat but also it can also dress the naked body, with escarpments and take it as a photo as a dress.
Or just raise the sleeves or the collar and immediately have a new look.
"Play with it," he stressed.
But I especially appreciated the following advice: "For work you need to know the rules perfectly".
"You can then start breaking it," Jakub said.
Finally I understand why we try to learn these rules, what to do with, what to do, why, while in fashion magazines we sometimes see something else.
No statement on fashion shows.
I know again, thanks to the fashion photographer Ben that the stylist must have much more variations of clothing than those that are photographed.
That is, for fashion story that will have about ten pages (so about ten models) I must be ready to "cut" at least fifteen.
And also, a garment and its combination with other elements appear completely different than in reality.
We have to rely on this during the creation of a model.
The fact that image and style sometimes make half the success was confirmed by Honza Pokorny.
Just watch Madonna who is not a great singer but her image and marketing have made her a world star.
In the Czech Republic, the approach to the use of stylists' services is still chilly.
And known faces sometimes consider them useless (it's enough for me to know something but what I seem to pass in the second row).
And if someone gets a styling from us, then we have to rely on the fact that they dictate to us with great probability a completely different size (smaller) than the one they actually have.
Then we only have to navigate on google and make sure the boulevard news mentions the celebrity in question, whether it has leaned or enlarged etc...
Honza and Mario put us on Sunday on the heart that it is not enough for the stylist to orient himself in fashion and know how to assemble models.
He must communicate with the people he dresses and it is therefore important to be a good psychologist.
To know how to guess people, not flatter, to keep his opinion.
"When a manager asks you to sort his closet and fill it with new elements you can't throw everything away and tell him, "My God, what a horror."
"You'll find some things you'll find pretty and he'll advise you with what to wear them with," says Mario.
This one showed us concretely what everything should contain what is called the "placovka" or designer's bag.
It's the one you hang around the waist and you have on yourself for everything you need.
In addition to the clearly defined things such as scissors, hairdressing rollers or baby pins, there is also nylon thread (which the stylist uses to photograph products such as bags, or hats), special clips with which you close a garment in the back, if it is too large (the pin or other type of staple are not usable because they could damage the garment) or a sewing kit.
So that we weren't just people who listen but who tried something in a practical way they taught us how to properly resemble shoes.
And during the photo shoot in the workshop where the surface is equal, the sole could be damaged, fortiori on the outside.
And so we glued and glued.
We didn't have the right to touch the scissors so we wouldn't hurt ourselves inadvertently.
There is therefore a real need for skills.
Mario pleased me when he congratulated me on my creation.
The count I'm talking about is not for my girlfriend.
This is just a brief summary of what we learned during the second weekend of the course.
I'm beginning to understand more and more that styling a profession is not a walk in a rose garden, let everyone say what they want.
The need for speed The Run fights across America.
Revision
Originally a problem-free race is transformed because of a set of stupid mistakes of people who have nothing to do with a routine morning shift to work.
To a certain extent, this fills everyone's ambition, but it is useless if no one wants to do anything else.
The new subtitled The Run has produced high expectations before its release.
He promised to take a new lead with the already old Need for Speed racing series and to release a kind of game from the playable parts that would not only count with points.
So we were curious how the added passages will be in which the main hero gets out of his car and does what he wants.
As is already done in the NFS series, the result is completely different from what was achieved.
These are potentially arcade racing games but the whole pulls down because of some unnecessary mistakes that have already existed for several years.
These are not really mistakes, but rather the expression of incomprehensible idleness on the part of developers.
The adventure begins very well.
You are caught up in the adventure of which the main hero Jack has characteristic problems and to solve them starts to participate in illegal races throughout America.
You sit behind the wheel on the west coast in San Francisco and your mission is to arrive first in New York.
The idea has interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten stages and then more than 50 races.
As a result, each race takes place on another route and the stages planned in different environments that are quite distinct from each other and are interesting.
The player does not feel for a moment that the game offers him something identical.
Some environments are quite nice overcroft even though the technical level graphics is of the same type as the previous series.
Well, that's not the end of the world.
But driving through the desert, in autumn landscapes or in high snow mountains is very pleasant visually.
The tests are in addition to a time in which an atypical element is added.
For example, in the desert you find yourself in a sandstorm that significantly reduces your visibility.
Then in the mountains you must be careful that an avalanche does not fall on you.
Next to that the different races are well arranged behind each other.
There are only a few, but that is enough.
There are moments you try to exceed the number of opponents requested (as in a classic race) then you run against the watch (classical duel with the timer) and then another duel awaits you with an opponent.
From time to time you also have the police entering the game and trying to make the situation difficult for you.
The novelty is the out-of-vehicle crossings.
It's more of an interactive animation when most of the time Jack runs away in front of someone and you have to help him by typing the right button at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
What is surprising is that there are fewer moments of this type than what you expect (to be concrete there are only three).
The result is quite like this because this element is not likely to interfere and is placed, in the context described above, in the elements that enhance the game.
The driving model is in the tradition of previous games.
This means that at present there is nothing extraordinary but one cannot say that it is negative.
As far as realistic simulation is concerned, you'll have to go elsewhere.
But although one can find better in competition the driving model goes very well with the type of design of the races.
So everything's okay.
Problems begin to appear after some time.
At the difference of the driving model, the collision model is not yet in place.
We do not expect a complicated deformation and collisions from this game, but when you do not have, in a collision with any object, the slightest idea of how your car behaves, it is therefore not completely good.
During tight exceedances you sometimes touch each other slightly but otherwise your self shares in crazy volts.
Or it's in crumbs.
Thanks to the restart system this is not really a problem but it really annoys you.
The restart is done so that when you have broken the figure or you have come out in the setting the game will bring you back at the last point on the route.
But you only have 5 restarts.
When you have used the 5 restarts you must restart the game from the beginning.
So it's more a tool, in case something doesn't happen properly, than something you can really count on.
Sometimes restarts don't help and you have to find the solution by remembering the part of the route in question.
The big highlight of this game is that the same actions are found in the same places.
For example, there are some turns that need to be passed in a certain way or it doesn't.
Otherwise you meet in a given place "civil" vehicles always in the same configuration as you arrive first, fifth, 5 seconds in advance or a minute late.
What upsets you are situations when you see easily passing the opponent between two cars coming in the opposite direction and when you arrive, you either have to stand aside and bypass them or brake them.
It doesn't matter if you go to meet him because it's "calculated" in such a way that for the given situation he always comes close to your nose.
Opponents still have other advantages.
Throughout the game, you arrive in some places, again without worrying about time, and you always have the same opponent that precedes you in the same place.
This gets the most annoying at the end of the game when you ride on a long bridge in the opposite direction.
The opponent must at all costs pass before you.
When it passes in front of you it hides the view of other vehicles in the opposite direction and you come into collision a lot of times.
We can understand that the goal of this game is to do something exciting and full of adrenaline, but it is clear that you get bored quickly.
And that's too bad because through a simple driving model the game is interesting and places with so much action that you don't have time to follow everything that happens.
And it doesn't matter if it's because of the concept of 50 unique routes, that the order of races is such that there's no chance of getting bored or something else.
The original idea is the car change during the races.
You need to pay attention to gasoline pumps on the routes as you can change cars there however most of the time you have enough.
The cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are ideal for cities, large American cylinders for straight highways and super sports cars with exotic sights on very technical pipelines for example on laced roads in the mountains.
And the mode of challenges, which are races in particular places that you know of adventure, goes very well with the main regime of history.
You receive not only medals but also points of experience that add to your profile, which is common to challenges and adventure.
When you have reached the highest level of driver, different objects begin to unlock:
This one connects online with the Autolog function which, among other things, compares your results with those of other players and provides you with other functions in the community.
One of the most difficult blows to understand is the situation of the last race of the adventure.
You arrive with your car in the subway tunnel (it looks) where you drive in the dark on the tracks (it looks).
Your speed indicator tells you between 150 and 200 km/h (a priori) and behind you comes a subway train that sends you the car directly to the scrap yard.
In the writing we had a discussion for a few days as to whether someone really thought about the creation of this game or whether the authors really think we are idiots.
The technical part of the game is not extra, but the visual part is generally pleasant and in some cases really great.
What is disturbing is that in more extreme situations, imaging does not hold the level and in some cases tragically.
This is especially true of accidents with a large number of participants when fluid imaging is no longer useful to you.
The sound part is good and the track is the choice.
In order to please the greatest number and especially the most young audience a new soundtrack was created in the style "I mix everything", but one can expect that no one will buy the game for music.
General Impression of Need for Speed: The Run is therefore really confused.
If the game didn't have these stupid mistakes we could say without fear that this is the best NFS production in recent years.
But this game gives the impression that it is not finished.
The fun is really good but prepare for mistakes to hit you in the eyes with the force of an aerodrome reflector.
Velvet Students in concert with the choirs of Charles University

Vicenova, Ambassador to the European Union:
Czechs act like negativists and Eurosceptics
"The Lisbon Treaty has radically abolished the balance between the institutions"
"I didn't expect such a hard war."
"It will last 5.6 years before the situation calms down and all players get used to their new role", is how Milena Vicenova began her presentation at the Czech Ambassador's Faculty of Law near the European Union.
When she was able to describe the different EU bodies and their relations in such a comprehensible and visible way, to the point that many speakers at Charles University's Faculty of Law could envy her, she showed how she took her motto "understandable and openly about Europe" very seriously.
Mrs Vicenova paid tribute to the work of Herman Van Rompuye, the new permanent President of the European Council.
"From the beginning, the criticisms were that he is tired, that it is a round-of-leather, that he cannot fulfill any mission and I have to say that he has cut everyone's breath because he holds his role to perfection."
"He is a man who knows how to listen to 27 member states, communicate well with them and has a clear vision of the direction to take from Europe."
She explained the new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Defence Policy in the context of an answer to the question: "Who is who in the European Union?" "What telephone number should I call?", therefore as an important step towards the uniqueness and greater legibility of the Union's policy vis-à-vis the states, such as China or India.
No one wants to forbid us our syrecky (cooked cheese that smells very strong)
Mrs Vicenova also mentioned the agenda that the European Council has experienced, lives and will live in a short time.
She described the Czech Presidency two years ago as a success.
The Czechs resolved the rising financial crisis, the gas crisis or organized a summit for an Eastern Partnership.
She described the fall of the government as very negative and damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
Czech representation in the EU is currently very busy.
According to the words of the Ambassador, "the activity has beaten its full" not only for the Presidency but also for the financial crisis that continues to resolve itself now.
We must also approve the new septimal budget of the Union, which is becoming very complicated because of the current economic situation.
As it seems that the budget will be thin and for savings, which branch will have priority, which countries will be helped the most, the least, everything is to be solved in the context of future negotiations.
Madam Ambassador recalled her slogans with which she arrived in Brussels "For an understandable Europe".
"I really don't like abbreviations, foreign words, jargons that no one understands.
As the citizen must understand, it is true that in Brussels no one makes round or twisted pickles, bananas that are differently large or that no one has forbidden us to make syrecky."
It wants to make better use of the EU environment and see more Czechs in the European institutions.
A multi-speed Europe awaits us
According to the Ambassador the Czechs have the reputation of being Eurosceptics and people who see things only in their negative aspect more than positively.
Furthermore, she is sorry to see such a small Czech representation in the European institutions.
According to her, the fault results from several factors, such as the shyness of our candidates, their inability to write a letter of motivation and weak support from the Czech side.
In addition to a successful Czech Presidency, she then stressed the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me, when the Polish, the Magyar, the Slovak come to me, this Frenchman says to me: 'Hey, what are you doing there, what is this Visegrad group still doing?" and he is not at all happy."
According to Mrs Vicenova, in the near future, tough new fiscal policy rules are waiting for the Member States.
It is the concept of a two-speed Europe, if not a multi-speed one, that prevails rather than a "new European Federation".
"We have countries in the euro area and others outside the area."
"We have the Schengen area, we also have the enhanced cooperation institute".
In the first place it was said that the countries that want to cooperate with each other and those that do not want to remain in their corner."
"There will be many such institutes and there will be a truly two-speed Europe," says Vicenova.
From this point of view, it also appreciated the mission of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuye to determine the basis on which all issues having an impact on the EU should be discussed between all EU members and not just the members of the Eurozone.
History of a brand:
Innovative IBM begins the second century of its existence
If someone were to look for the word that expresses the IBM strategy as closely as possible, the closest would be "long-term".
For a large audience IBM is the symbol of the technological revolution, is a firm felt as very current and yet since its creation it has been a hundred years.
The basis of this long-term strategy was laid by the firm's first chief, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He left the slogan that many global problems can be solved if people are willing to think.
His slogan "PENSE'!" became the imprint around which the life of a giant future will develop (and also the title of the internal magazine that IBM began publishing in 1935).
It was the foundation of Watson's carefully crafted corporate culture.
For us IBM means a long-term thought of continuous movements directed towards the future.
IBM survived a hundred years thanks to the fact that it always remained faithful to its basic values and yet was not afraid to change all the others around it.
This has enabled us in our first century to transform technology, business and society.
We hope that in the second century we will reach even more"for the anniversary the current director of the firm Samuel J. Palmisano.
A well-prepared system
Watson, in the 1930s, began to take care of his employees like Bata in the Czech Republic - the people of IBM were the only ones among the first American employees to have paid vacations, an insurance paid by the employer plus an elegant employee uniform and a well-developed system of rewards for inventors and conmercials.
In the same way IBM has a system of relationships with the well-developed customer.
The company was at first brilliant in the discovery of talents- as one of the first firms to have abolished any form of discrimination and thus could have the choice.
The current plan is completely in the spirit of the anti-discrimination strategy since it will be a woman- Virginia Rometty - who should replace Palmisano at the head of IBM.
She has been working at IBM for 30 years and currently holds the position of Head of Sales, Marketing and Strategy.
IBM over the past few years has been doing so-called jamy, online brainstorming from which many future strategies and innovations have emerged.
No wonder he has a lot of ideas - in the firm there are nearly 500,000 people working.
An institution with a good name
It is the internal and external image of the company that assures it a secure position in the field of business.
"Since the beginning IBM had a concept of institution rather than a technological firm," said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Professor of Economics at Harvard School of Economics and author of the book on IBM.
"IBM is not a technology firm but a firm that helps solve business world problems using its technology," added Geogre Colony of Consulting Forrester Research.
As the firm itself says, there is a difference between entering the market and creating that market.
IBM - or the "Great Blue", as it is called familiarly in the United States with its slogan - in a hundred years it has grown to become one of the world's largest firms.
It is obviously the most versatile technology firm - it develops software, hardware, infrastructure, hosting, consulting services at the level of server products up to nanotechnology.
She holds numerous patents from all U.S. technology firms and five of her employees received a Nobel Prize.
Among his discoveries are the ticket distributor, the payment card, the financial swap, the bar code or the diskette.
IBM was this year with $220 billion, the second largest technology firm according to the capitalization of the market (the first is Apple), when for the first time it surpassed Microsoft in 1996.
Preview in advance
It is not all innovations and manufactures that have had the preference of the customer and of the time - IBM for example did not succeed the bet on an operating system own OS/2, of the service Prodige online or of the computer IBM PCjr:
"From the moment your business is built on the advance movement you cannot emotionally hang on to the past, "samuel J. Palmisano points out.
For this IBM has no problem building its bases on many platforms and when they do not work it goes away.
Unlike for example the competitor Microsoft which at the base stands and remains under the Windows operating system.
A Technology Perspective
In IBM revenues, services, which are trained for a fifth by software and hardware, have a prominent place.
However still in 1990 it was with more than one of the strongest participation motley hardware representative.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-yielding assets for $15 billion, and over the same period it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of future technologies.
It continues in investments and even from 2008, when for the first time it has overcome the new financial crisis .
IBM negotiates according to the precepts of its first leader Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis also increased his investment volume.
Does it now appear that IBM is going through the current crisis without being concerned?
The price of the IBM action has grown from 2008 in a rocket of 120 percent, the net profit of the firm continues to grow.
IBM's logo is to change everything but not its values.
This is why we can expect this flexible giant to master other crises.
History of IBM: From slices of cheese to flights in the cosmos.
IBM (International Business Machines) was born in New York a hundred years ago; it originally had the complicated name of Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
It took the name IBM in 1924 - initially it was a brand used by a branch of a firm in Canada and South America.
The basis of the future IBM was the merger of four firms whose history is linked to the 1980s of the nineteenth century.
They had technologies such as the old "pointers", the pendulums that recorded the arrival and departure of the employees.
The architect of the new company was Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 chaired the Company's Supervisory Board.
Flint hired the head of a competing firm Thomas J. Watson to help him run the company.
The leader then shadowed the founder of the firm - it is on Watson's ideas that society's identity and culture are based to date.
Watson ran the kusque firm in 1952.
IBM, as its name says, began with the production of all possible machines for business and commerce - from cheese and meat slicers to the cash register.
During the first four years of Watson's leadership, revenue grew to $9 million and the company's expansion began in all parts of the world.
Watson was for the firm so irreplaceable that after 40 years of leadership his son occupied the chair of director, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his direction IBM began the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s IBM's people and computers helped NASA guide flights in the cosmos - on Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the flight on the Moon.
Meanwhile in 1964 IBM developed the first computer family - the IBM System/360.
The classic PC that determines the computer standard of the time with the name of IBM 5150 arrived on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later IBM sold its computer factory to the Chinese company Lenovo, but bought the consulting company Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began to take care of advice and services with high added value.
The strategy that has succeeded in IBM over the past three years - is the Smarter Planet concept "a smarter planet".
Its objective is the intelligent use of technology in areas that have not yet been exploited, such as transport and city management.
As far as IBM trade is concerned, a "Smarter Commerce" platform has recently been developed which helps traders manage the entire business cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in our territory.
It established its branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932, the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, besides IBM RT, there is also Brno's strategic outsourcing centre.
The Central for Central and Eastern Europe is based in Prague and there is also the world-class research and development team responsible for the recognition of speech.
Rychtarova about her unfaithful husband:
Ivette, you can keep this donkey, I don't want any more!
Darina Rychtarova (53 years old) said, it's over!
After her husband Joseph Rychtar (53 years old) became a bodyguard and lover of d'Iveta Bartosova (45 years old), Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from his pink dream and come home.
Only she could not wait and set clear rules for future life.
"Pepa can come home, but not as my partner," Rychtarova explained.
When Darina Rychtarova gave Bartosova asylum in the summer in her home, she did not doubt that her couple would not hold.
When Iveta after 30 days insisted on moving from Ricany, Pepa did not repel the singer.
And he confessed in public that he loved her.
In time Darina resigned, accepted her husband's affair and ended up saying goodbye to him forever.
Rychtirova is not interested in who her husband is sleeping with.
If Rychtar and Bartosova separate, there will be no wife to welcome her to the door of the house.
"He is the biological father of my sons and if he wants to end his life in our common house, no one will put him out."
"He will no longer be my beloved and lost old donkey, but a man with whom I have a particular relationship," let Rychtarova filter out showing that she has separated from her husband but that they remain only in a decent relationship.
The fact that Darina shut the door on him is not a problem for Joseph.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'll stay with Iveta and I won't change."
"My wife set up a paper wedding and I respect it."
"Society continues, I take care of repairs, garden, real estate, I buy."
"With Darina we talk completely normal but we don't sleep together," Rychtar said for Blesk.
If Rychtarova finds a new love he won't stop it.
"We don't sleep together and I don't care where she's going, who she's having an affair with.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take all responsibility on myself," concluded Joseph.
Women's worst vices: Does this concern you as well?
If you ask men to determine typical vices of women, all, one as well as the other, are able to get them out of their sleeves.
Ladies and gentlemen, you will know in the following lines of female vices that can pump the blood from the veins of men.
Procurement
Does your half say you're dependent on purchases?
Do you have to buy at least one garment a week?
Are you happy to buy and in packages at the time of the sales?
In your case we can talk about shopping as a vice.
Some women think they should restrict their passion for shopping.
But you'll say, who would resist the window licking of clothing stores, to look for yourself nice clothes and then try them all in the cabin (the ideal of different colors)?
And although for most women buying is a hobby, it can become a real hell for man.
Just remember how many times you told your spouse he's waiting at the entrance...
Constant dissatisfaction
"I'm not too big"?
"I'd need to lose at least five kilos - should I start doing sports?"
"Do you like me?"
Don't those phrases remind you of something?
Yes?
So you are one of those women who are obsessed with their appearance.
This is not the question that you should stop caring for yourself but a large number of men are allergic to the fact that their partner is always complaining about his appearance.
Strong sex does not hesitate to say that the more the frequency of these complaints increases and the more women become poisonous.
Odre and cleanliness in first place
It's like an infinite ride.
Wash windows, vacuum, clean floors, dust, clean the bathroom - twice a week.
Do you make any remarks to your partner that he walks with dirty feet on the clean floor, to the children that they dirtyed the sink, crushed the living room window, and that it gives you a lot of work?
In case you suffer precisely from this obsession, try to keep in mind that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and cleanliness should not be the first place in the family.
This harmless desire for cleanliness can, however, spoil your relationships and even family peace.
The work of sape
"Put this worn overcoat in the trash."
"Are you going to put those old socks on again tomorrow?"
"A wet towel has nothing to do on the floor."
If you do this job on your partner this way several times a day, you will really break it down.
It's obvious that you don't think badly you want everything to be impeccable.
Maybe if the men knew, the women wouldn't have to do so much digging...
Defamation, persecution
Defamation, persecution, but also insults against someone, are also the property of some women.
Women are particularly drawn to relationships and are happy to deal with topics such as who, where, with whom, how and why.
Maybe each one of us lets escape a harmless little persiflage here and there.
The hand on the heart is, however, a peculiarity of women.
But the worst are those who counsel, persiflate, even despise others and are particularly dangerous to their surroundings - especially at work in a group of women.
Jagr and Voracek helped by their participation in the Philadelphia victory
Hockey attacker Jagr twice took part in Philadelphia's victory during the Monday NHL game on Caroline's ice and is again leading the productive Czech players for the contest.
From the point of view of the 39-year-old star Claude Giroux, who made one more pass and was named the best player in the game, he scored in both cases.
Jakub Voracek, who plays with Jagr also scored two goals during the game.
Jagr after the match told the journalists from overseas that he had warned Giroux that it would be a great evening.
"I told him before the game he'd give his hat-trick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes this feeling falls on you," explained Jagr after his action Giroux scored a goal for the first shot of the Flyers.
A moment later there was a second assault by the Czech team.
Voracek fought behind the Hurricanes' goals for the palette and presented it to the scorer Maxime Talbot.
A second before the first break, local player Patrick Dwyer made a descent, but the start of the second game belonged to the Flyers.
Specifically in Giroux.
In cooperation with Jagr he scored three goals, then Wayne Simmonds transformed a fourth goal.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't mean he's the best player in the league but he's really one of the top three," Jagr said about his center.
"I never thought I'd play at the end of my career with a hockey player like him."
"I'm really happy with that."
"I want to play on him."
"All these years at the NHL the other players on the team have tried to play on me, now it's my turn," added Jagr.
Caroline made a drama of this game because with a goal from Tuom Ruutu and again from Dwyer on a penalty shot she ends up with a difference of one goal.
Matt Read didn't rule out any other complications that ended in two versus one.
"Pronger has carried out excellent attacks in our area."
"He hit the pallet, I took speed and (Read) went to the furthest corner of the cage.
"I tried to hit him and I got there," describes the final goal of the game from his Voracek point of view.
Philadelphia arrived with this victory at the head of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal Jaroslav Spacek did not finish the match with Buffalo he came out in the second third because of an injury to the upper body.
The Candians did not stand up to an experienced defender their advance of two goals lost after a penalty shot by 2:3.
Tomas Plekanec has not transformed any of their attacks.
That's the fact that the back line was sick that mostly bothered the local coach rather than lost fists because they played the game only with 5 defenders.
"It sucks."
"We only played the game with an experienced player, the rest were young people."
"But there's nothing to do, it's like that," says Jacques Martin.
"Replacement on replacement wasn't enough and we couldn't resist."
"We just had to simplify the game, push the pallet out of our area."
For this we had limits," added one of the defenders P. K. Subban.
Ondrej Pavelec, a Czech defender, took part in the 30th Winnipeg attack and victory over Tampou Bay.
5 different shooters participated uax goals of the Jets, which stopped a series of 5 lost matches.
How travel prices have evolved since 1989
Until 1989 there were only 5 state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: Cedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourist.
Travel agencies at that time offered trips mainly to the countries of the socialist bloc, as trips to the west were very limited.
Czech tourists travelled for holidays in East Germany, Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea and Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A great exception for the period from 1962 to 1972 when he was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia then the regime began to have a western inclination and travel to Yugoslavia was very limited for Czech tourists.
The great paradox of the socialist era was that it was not allowed for the citizens of the socialist bloc (also for the Czechoslovaks) to travel individually even within the framework of the socialist countries.
If the Czechoslovak citizen wanted to travel individually, for example to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter, otherwise the individual travel was not allowed.
Travel agencies at that time also offered trips to the West, but it was necessary to queue up all night with a sleeping bag or to have a "good knowledge" within the travel agency.
And even after that it wasn't won yet.
The currency deal that was the condition for traveling west was denied to "politically incorrect" people who could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency, however, was not exchangeable and it was not possible to obtain financial resources without the currency agreement (Western currency) to travel to the west.
The Czechs most often spent their holidays in the country where there were therefore many country houses and chalets that the Czechs bought and this habit lasts until now.
The journeys of the Czechs have been a major revolution since 1989.
Although until 1989 holidays in Eastern Germany and Bulgaria were at most, Czechs spent last year abroad 4 million holiday days in countries around the world.
The great paradox that we are not aware of today is that the most popular country is Croatia where it was not possible to go freely until 1989 because part of Yugoslavia at the time.
The abolition of visas in the 1990s in the western neighbours led to a huge wave of short-term visits mainly to Austria in Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks could not travel for a long time by plane to the west that everyone wanted to see at least a moment.
For example, in Paris, travel organizations made Czechs sleep in tents in parks because our income did not allow us to pay the hotel or a pension.
The typical feature of a trip from Czechs was at that time to take with it its own preserved food, sausage, etc... to save.
Another important moment was also the interchangeability of the Czech crown which allowed our tourists finally after decades of being able to freely buy Western currency.
Our standard of living as well as the average wage have increased what has caused another important moment around 1997.
With increasing demand for travel, travel agencies have since 1997 begun to prepare tours with air charter connections which, thanks to contracts, have dramatically reduced costs compared to what was before.
At the end of the 90s of the last century the Czechs had visa-free connections with virtually most developed countries around the world apart from the US that later facilitated our travel.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolution tourism, when the first air charter was prepared to an exotic country, Thailand, from the Czech Republic.
From this year as every year direct air charters take Czech tourists to distant hot countries; this winter there will be 12 exotic destinations from the Czech Republic.
More than 100,000 Czechs visit exotic countries each year!
Another interesting moment in this period that symbolizes our post-revolutionary development came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the EU abolished visas for Czech tourists and allowed our country to fully join the group of developed countries.
In 2008, the Czechs also spent more than half of their holiday abroad (50.3%) for the first time in history, and for the first time in history they spent more than 15,000 crowns per person for a holiday abroad, including the associated expenses. Crowns per person.
The General Assembly must find its President but this could end in a situation without a solution "a pat"
About 5 months already Czech football is without President and it risks that Ivan Hasek's successor at the head of the Czech Football Association is not yet known after another General Assembly that is to take place Thursday in Nymburk.
However, there is still no agreement as to which voting rules should be followed.
Without this agreement it is not possible to start voting for one of the three candidates.
Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Paclik are interested in the leadership of Czech football.
Hasek resigned in June and during his departure called on his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality who will lead football in the future.
Only during the post-Hasek era did football go back to differences between the chambers of the Association that cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was completely demonstrated on 16 September when it was necessary to select a new president.
Delegates of the General Assembly met unnecessarily in the National House in Prague because the negotiation remained blocked and there was not even a discussion on how to elect.
There was no agreement as to who has the right to vote in the General Assembly - it seems only statutory representatives or even full powers.
In this single point there has been a partial agreement since that moment with the assistance of the Office for the State and the Law, according to which representation on the basis of full power is not possible.
Disagreements are still continuing with regard to the election settlement.
It is too clear that the Executive Committee, which in its planned or extraordinary negotiations did not bring anything to the situation either.
Opinions on the possibility of voting have changed several times, but the issue remains the same.
The question is: how to proceed for the third round so as not to fall into the pat.
"The problem lies in the following: either to proceed according to the statutes or to find another model," said one of the three vice-presidents of the Czech Football Association Dusan Svoboda, who represents professional football within the association.
According to the rules of the envisaged model, in the third round the number of candidates who received the highest percentage of votes in the Chamber for which he is a candidate is earned.
Moravia is ready according to what is said to retire to win the candidate who has received the highest percentage of votes of both chambers.
And the Czech side is studying the condition that the winner should have at least two-thirds of the votes.
"Only then would it lose the idea of two previous rounds and would it completely deny the bicameral concept," admits Svoboda, who understands the objections of the Moravian party and according to whom it would be best not to change the rules and vote according to the statutes in force.
It is surprising that Tomas Paclik also agrees even though he believes that the settlement of the elections established according to the most Pelta advantage statutes among all the candidates.
"I wish to see the maximum vote according to the statutes of the association."
"So that there aren't yet scathing ideas imagined by a representative like in the past General Assemblies," said Victoria Plzen's owner, who is a candidate for the first time and who in his presentations defined himself especially against Pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic.
According to him in Nymburk there will be a new President and believes that the candidates will cooperate in the future together and constructively.
"The qualification possible today in the European Championship should calm everyone down."
"Football will again be on a wave of happiness and there will be more training for cooperation" adds the Jablonec officer who among the three has the greatest experience in the management of both professional and regional football.
Rajchl is more pessimistic.
"I believe in this agreement but unfortunately the situation is very tense."
"It is not a problem between Czechs and Moravians, but there are trends in wanting to change the drawing regulations."
"This can again cause a blockage at the General Assembly."
"I hope, however, that sound reason will win," Rajchl said.
There is not much time left for a common agreement between all parties.
Some meetings should take place directly in Montenegro but who can tell if the entire football leadership will be complete for the game.
The specially chartered flight to Podgorice, among others Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, did not take off for technical reasons and a variant was being sought to take part of the executive committee to the field of reprisals.
In the end, the ministerial meeting, which could take place on Wednesday, should be decisive.
The Minister of Youth Education and Sports Joseph Dobes would be very pleased to receive the torn parts of the country's strongest sports association and bring them to an agreement.
In the game there are many: a state endowment, the credibility of football and also the General Assembly of the Czech Union of Sports which must determine the direction of Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclik is going to fight for the post of President because he sees no correct candidate.
If Plzen Tomas Paclik's head of football had seen before the General Assembly that his profile would have responded to everything he requested for a new President of the Czech Football Association (AFRT) he would not be campaigning for this high office.
"If such a candidate exists I support him, I fight for him and I do not run for election."
"But in the current situation it was not possible to find such a candidate," Paclik told the Czech Press Agency (CTK).
Paclik's motivation is to compete with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl to try to prevent Pelta from gaining access to the AFRT's head, which would a priori be given favor for this election.
Paclik also points out that in the event that he wins the elections, he will hold the post of President only until 2013 as the year for a General Assembly.
He would see in the function an experienced and high-level manager but who is not related to the world of football.
"I talked to people who would have the profile," he says.
"It was terrible for me when some people told me that they didn't want to be identified with Czech football right now."
"I'd like to change that picture," he added.
What is said to be particularly disturbing about Paclik is the relationship between Pelta and the President of the Regional Football Union of Plzen Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial reputation who is known behind the scenes as a lobbyist capable of influencing the voting of delegates ' the General Assembly.
For Paclik it is not acceptable for Pelta to take this position as President.
"If he won, the current state would remain and there would be nothing new in football."
"And with the support of Berbr, who is a high-flying merchant, it would be even less favorable to football," Paclik proclaimed.
What still shocks him is the fact that Pelta's name was pronounced a few years ago in the course of listening to an investigation into a corruption case, for which Pelta left without any pain.
"I don't know what prestige Pelta would bring to football."
"And how would we be considered in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclik, who said a while ago "if Pelta becomes President, I sell the Plzen club."
In the event that Paclik triumphed on Thursday's vote, he should prove that he could cooperate with Felta.
Rajchl, another candidate who had been supported by Paclik before the September General Assembly, who had ended up with a fiasco, thinks the same thing.
"He (Pelta) would be the first with whom I would go."
"He has great abilities"
"He would be able to present himself, for example, as head of the representation."
"But as manager of the Association he wouldn't be able."
"I don't put my nose in what I don't know," says Paclik, who in September attracted great attention when he declared himself for the annulment of the Board of Referees with Ludek Macela who replaced Dagmar Damkova.
Paclik says he'd be on the level to run the Association.
He takes as an example his ability to run private companies and that he also runs since last year the club of Plzen which celebrated with his support last May his triumph in the first division.
"I have the strength to make something change in the world of sport and to bring a certain culture to it."
"I would hold back the influence of some interested groups that tend to influence the Disciplinary and Appeal Commission, which leads to bad taste situations," added Paclik, who does not cast off his antipathy for Sparta chief Daniel Kretinsky.
It would also consider harmonizing relations with the Czech Olympic Committee, whose lobbying power with high-level policies would enable sport to receive more gambling tax money.
"This is one of the key points that the new President should address."
"If it is the gambling tax as stated by the political parties, I understand their arguments but they should also say where the money goes," he said.
Paclik does not take his current liaison with the Plzen club as something negative even though he himself claims that the president of AFRT should be "over the parties".
Pelta is again linked with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla of Prague.
"It's not ideal."
I see no reason to pass my Plzen club shares on to someone if I have to come back a year and a half later," Paclik said.
Pelta has promised new statutes for AFRT that should put an end to pat situations.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association one of the candidates for the Miroslav Pelta Presidency promised that if elected, AFRT will have new statutes that should put an end in the future to disputes over the settlement of the elections.
The Jablonec official is ahead of Thursday's meeting in Nymburk very optimistic and thinks that the success today of the football performance should calm this cheetah before the vote.
Pelta before the September election, which did not take place, promised to devote himself to national representation and to obtaining financial resources if he is elected.
He had decided to be a candidate at the last moment just before the General Assembly had passed, and the two-month delay might well enable him to defend his vision of football leadership and to present it in a broad context.
"People at all levels have been playing football for a long time and are waiting for a president on Thursday."
"They feel that this is the best time for someone to take the lead of the Association," he adds, but he is primarily linked to the Jablonec club, has worked for many years at Sparta and the Union's Executive Committee.
That is also why he has enough experience to lead Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the election lies a euphoria that prevailed at the time of Ivan Hasek.
"Unfortunately at the June General Assembly the statutes were approved which were not perfect as all saw."
"If there weren't all these different interpretations we would have had a President since September," says Pelta.
It is precisely the revision of the most important document of the civic association that has taken the full attention of delegates.
"If I become President, I take it as my personal mission and am prepared to take all responsibility for it in case it doesn't work."
"It is a principle without which we cannot exist," Pelta added.
Then he tries, it is said, not to confront his opponents.
He previously stated that he can cooperate with Jindrich Rajchl that he recognizes with respect to his legal training and that he knows very well that his opponent-candidate would be his first Vice-President.
He hasn't attacked Tonas Paclik for a long time, which, on the contrary, keeps criticizing Pelta.
"He's been in football for a year and he's already had a few hits."
"His attacks, however, were not most honorable and surprised many people during the campaign."
"This is also why some now have doubts about his character," Pelta said at the address of his opponent but remains, he says, faithful to the proclamations he made in September.
According to him, his strongest weapon is his knowledge of football from the competitions of the lowest level to the national representation.
It's supposed to be a football vitrine.
"And I would also try to finish all the cases that start with that of the Bohemians or the continuation of the corruption scandal."
"I would immediately enter into negotiations with the public and private sector so that we could get enough money for all football," CTK told the Czech Press Agency the 46th candidate two months ago.
He also added that his appointment to the head of football would not bring about any change in people.
"I should meet all the employees," he told Strahov where there has been an understandable nervousness since there is no direction.
Although there were catastrophic scenarios planned with the General Assembly, he believed that delegates would not go to Nymburk for nothing.
"If there is only one point of disagreement on how to vote in the third round we will get over it."
"Football needs credibility and it will only be achieved when a new leader is in its head," as Pelta optimistically states two days before the day probably decisive for his career as a civil servant.
Rajchl promises that under his leadership AFRT would start working hard
"If the current Vice-President Jindrich Rajchl is elected new President of the Czech Football Association at the General Assembly on Thursday it would not please many people," he said.
Rajchl promises, however, that in the event that he is elected, we will start working hard.
He wants systemic changes and makes Executive Committee members accountable for the various areas of football.
He also promised to settle the Bohemian affair, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and continue the work begun by the predecessor Ivan Hasek.
"As President, I want to take care of football as a whole."
"International contacts with UEFA and FIFA through national representation, professional football and youth-performing football."
"But I'm not saying I'll do all this alone," Rajchl said in an interview for CTK.
"I am a team player and want to distribute skills within the Executive Committee so that each member takes care of a specific area."
"And I will distribute difficult missions so that football takes a big step forward."
"Many people will not be happy because it will be about starting to work hard rather than criticizing others," he added.
He said that he would not represent himself as a candidate because of a critical atmosphere.
"About me, we know I work 20 hours a day."
"but I need to know if it's worth it and if I have people behind me who will constantly put sticks in my wheels and cast doubts on each of my actions," explaining why he hesitated.
"Many people have told me, however, that I must not give up because they would also give up."
"It's a trust I can't betray," he says.
What motivates him, it is said, is also to continue the work begun with Hasek.
"Since the last two years there's been a lot of hard work and I don't want to let it go."
"There are processes that have been launched that will have consequences in a few years and I would not like anyone to stop them.", he said with fear that in the case of Miroslav Pelta's election the situation within the Union will return as it was before Hasek.
"I believe in systematic work and that's something Mirek Pelta can't do."
"Behind him are people who would do football in such a way that it would be only for those who were chosen."
"I can be blamed for a number of things, but I'm sure I can't stand anyone."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to play football for all because everyone will be happy not only those who have been chosen
And he confirms once again that he would be only a President for the Czech Republic.
"And if anyone says otherwise, I'm ready to do my best for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider that the second division should be divided into two parts: one Czech and the other Moravian whose winners would be in the first division."
"There would be no situation like currently with only three Moravian teams in the division because the problem is currently finding young players.
As Tomas Paclik, president of the Plzen Club, entered the competition for the position of President, Rajchl cannot assess his own chances of winning.
"I always feel the support of the Czech Chamber, which elected me its Vice-President and knows that with me there will be successes," Rajchl said, who is considering saving tens of millions of crowns among his future successes on disadvantaged contracts, contracts negotiations with television and on the gaming law.
On the contrary, he says that the fact that the Association is not united is a common fault for all.
While he says about Pelta "he is disqualified because with him the Czech football would lose his credibility", he thinks that the second opponent Paclik is a strong candidate who has something to offer for football.
"No one can doubt Plzen that he did a great job this year."
"If he were elected he would surely continue in what was started by Hasek and would not make any notable change among the people in the Commissions."
"He wouldn't want to spoil his success," Rajchl said, who assessed his rivals.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
A jump in the blue
By Julia Stanek
Oven optic skaters, beautiful swimming pools in Budapest: Who travels across Europe can experience his blue miracle - and after turning the city or taking a long walk - can let his tired legs rest in soft water baths.
A book shows in which swimming pool one can experience the most well-being.
When Iris Meder was on a search trip for the last 18 months, there was an item that should not be missing in his luggage: his swimsuit.
Spreaded on her back in the water, she observed the artistically arranged cups, and swam against the Putten marbles that waited for her on the other side of the pool and did not miss to admire Art Nouveau meticulously restored from these converted pools.
If an indoor swimming pool would please her, she would note in her notebook without delay all the details worthy of interest on the type of construction and the history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools were surveyed in this way by the historian of architecture Meder and she presented them in her book already published: "Badefreuden (Joies du Bain". The municipal covered swimming pools of Münich, the historic bathing palaces in the black forest, "hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus.
She led her "most exceptional bathing trips in Central Europe" in 13 countries. Next to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia respectively.
The 46-year-old German is a real lover of bathing culture.
Meder, explains that she doesn't have much interest in sport but he feels attracted to the water in a completely different way.
It is irritating that swimmers should simply contemplate blue tiles and accommodate themselves with the stench of Javel's water while joggers breathe the scent of spruce forests or can listen to the park's joyous bird gasping.
"I once wondered why swimming pools should in fact always be so ugly," said the Viennese.
"So I started a collection of beautiful baths."
The surface of the water doubles the architecture
A dive in a swimming pool and the volatile sauna oils - well-being factor in the swimming rooms are huge because all the senses are awake, according to Meder.
And if the builders had given themselves a little more pain, the swimming rooms could be a real delight for the eyes: "Instead of a floor we have a water surface in the swimming rooms."
"It is on one side transparent, but reflects on the other side however the beauty of the whole building."
All surfaces are optically presented in a double way: high vaults, multicolored tiles, springboards.
The small-format image volume "Badefreuden" makes a 190-page interesting report on the history of architecture and culture on the oasis of historical well-being - it certainly makes you want to make a jump in the blue.
The collector Meder discovered remarkable copies during her research in Hungary.
Next to the splendid wellness baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, she found waters containing nitrate in a natural cave in the karst (cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a bath of baths whose pools are filled with water containing alkali and (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény) in a bottle-shaped building.
On the other hand, the heated outdoor pools of Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views. While a roof of the Zürich bath can be seen all over the city, you can admire the snowy Arlberg from an outdoor swimming pool of St. Anton: The Turkish bath is equipped with a window from which you can observe the animation on the ski slope.
Perhaps the most extraordinary swimming pool design awaits swimmers in Längenfeld: The Aqua Dome Ötztal looks like a UFO that has just landed on the Alps.
In winter, steam rises from the three open plateaus, while in the background the Ötztal mountains rise towards the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
the scent of Javel's water does not emanate from all the pools of the Meder collection.
Many thermal baths emanate a smell of sulphur, from the Árpád-spa in the Hungarian Bekescsaba emanate a strong smell of oil, which it is hard to believe, to be in a health spa.
The smell comes from the therapeutic alkaline waters containing carbon hydrogen that is almost black and its lemon glues you to the skin as soon as you slide into the pool - a special spa experience.
During her search for beautiful pools, Iris Meder also suffered disappointments: When she wanted to visit Bad Luhatschowitz, a free outdoor outdoor pool in Czechoslovakia, she found herself in front of barricaded terrain.
The bath designed by architect Dušan Jurkovic in 1902 was closed in the meantime.
By looking through the window of the Art Nouveau building in red-white-yellow, she observed the weeds blooming between the tiles.
She observed an opposite effect in a charming pool in the Black Forest: Bad Wildbad's spa palace.
This building has already survived three phases; it is possible to discover not only neo-Roman elements that come out from its design in 1844 but also a Moorish room in the Alhambra style that was added to it in 1900.
Since its careful modernization in 1995, the thermal palace remains the favourite bath of the pool expert, Iris Meder - and not only because it is native to Schwarzwald.
"It's already a great performance to merge such different construction styles into such a great unit," says Meder.
With such a palace, diving into the thermal pool is apparently only a minor question.
Agricultural speculation
The German bank examines in detail the speculation on raw materials
By Christian Teevs
Does the German bank abandon its speculation on raw materials?
According to information from SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann commissioned a working group to look for the consequences of speculation for the world's poor.
In January, the head of the group then wanted to draw consequences.
Hamburg -
For the citizens of the Federal Republic, this is clear: According to a study, 84% of Germans find it unacceptable that banks speculate on raw materials such as corn and wheat.
Two thirds of the respondents even demanded that the German bank and other credit institutions discontinue this avenue of business because it increases the problems of the world's poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa inquiry into the order of the Foodwatch consumer organization.
The study is based on a report submitted by Foodwatch in mid-October.
The author Harald Schumann points out in this article that the speculation of the Stock Exchanges on global raw materials, pushes prices up and that banks share an complicity in global famine.
The consumer protection campaign effectively aligns itself with Deutsche Bank leader Josef Ackermann, even though large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act in the same way.
Speculation on raw materials was initially introduced to protect traders from price fluctuations.
But the majority of experts in the meantime share the view that the gamblers have separated themselves from the offers and demand - and profit at the expense of the very poor.
Ackermann reacted to the criticism different from the American competitors: He promised to investigate the criticisms and said, "No case is worth putting into play the good reputation of the Deutsche Bank".
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently considering the charges of Foodwatch-Report.
The examination must be completed by the end of the year, then the results of the Deutsche Bank Board of Directors must be presented - with recommendation, usually.
At the end of January, the head of the Bank will indicate the consequences.
This could result in a reduction in the market for raw materials, or even a complete abandonment.
Ackermann builds his Image
Foodwatch leader Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time confirmed his criticisms of the financial sector: "The speculation about rising food prices shows in a particularly dramatic way, how much today's banks are damaging the general interest."
Ackermann is the first banking lobby to be under special obligation today.
"The Deutsche Bank must remove all investments from its portfolio, for which money has been invested in food speculations," Bode said.
"It doesn't matter, for Mr. Ackermann, whether it's about hungry people or whether the Deutsche Bank's reputation is at stake."
Ackermann's awareness may seem surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the group's CEO wants to present a perfect image, a few months before leaving his post.
Deutsche Bank announced on Monday that the Chairman of the Board of Directors will not change anything to what is planned in the Board of Directors.
It could improve its brand image with the abandonment of controversial agricultural speculation.
And with regard to possible losses, he has little to worry about - his successor will worry about it.
One in two would terminate commodity investments.
Foodwatch strives to maintain strong pressure on the Manager.
To date, more than 30,000 Internet users have already participated in the organization's campaign.
Bode published the Tuesday survey, with which on 7 and 8 November the Institute forsa conducted questionnaires with 1001 people.
Just eleven percent found it legitimate that Deutsche Bank offers investments for which bets on food prices are made.
Many of the bank's clients would also have personal consequences if they learned that their bank was involved in such transactions: one in two would terminate, following the survey, all investments for which money is injected into commodity speculation.
43% would advise against such a bank to their surroundings, 49% said that they would consider terminating their account in order to change the bank.
21st house in Vienna
The Pavilion that moved
D'Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with highs, lows and a Happy End: the Austrian pavilion for the world exhibitions in Brussels in 1958 won prizes, was a museum in Vienna, remained empty and then fell to ruin.
Now it is open again and takes place as an exhibition house.
If we are excited about a modern post-war architecture, its clear shapes, its glass hangars, its bold and lively appearances and its new building materials that are typical of belief in technical progress, then the Austrian architect Karl schwanzer's pavilion for the Brussels Universal Exhibition in 1958 is a good and famous example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion once received the "Grand Prix d'Architecture" for its steel and glass construction, light and suspended.
Construction is considered to be an important step in contemporary architecture.
He made the architects so famous, he also built the Pavilion for the following Austrian universal exhibition.
With its legendary BMW four-cylinder house and adjacent bowl-shaped construction in Munich, it finally became internationally famous in 1973.
His pavilion project as a temporary building had been exhibited after the universal exhibition in the Swiss Garden at Vienna's southern railway station, and in 1962 a museum of the 20th century opened -
But the building was neither physically nor technically suitable for a museum - no walls to hang the works of art, so not a good environment.
However, it has been used for so long, until contemporary art receives a new building in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and has become increasingly devastated.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has transformed the Pavilion, it now bears the name "House of the 21st century" and will be used in the future as a museum for contemporary art.
Tuesday night the Belvédère Museum opened, to which the house belongs, the first exhibition - a stroke of luck in any way.
The new start was completed by Agnès Husslein-Arco, who became the new director in 2007 of the Austrian Belvédère Gallery.
Husslein-Arco, promoted an art historian to a considerable career among others in her youth as an artistic skater, later at Sotheby's, at the Guggenheim Museum and as founding director of the Salzburg Museum of Modern Art, she carried out particularly the transformation work with politicians and the protection of monuments, obtained public funds and private sponsorship and established the exploitation of them.
Except for contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba whose foundation bears the same name have been exhibited there, a café and a bookstore are located there, and an office must be built there.
Strict monitoring, small budget
For the production Krischanitz was therefore the ideal interpreter.
Not only because he had transformed and sensibly expanded the secession of Joseph Olbracht and won the competition, but because he had studied at the Technical University of Vienna and for him the pavilion was "an extremely important place" where he had seen "practically every weekend" the exhibitions.
He knew the original project, and he knew the problems of the building, which lost in generosity and lightness as a result of its move to Vienna and its change of use.
During the current transformations, there were major problems: "the building was "an energy gulf," says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass facades were changed, fiberglass-reinforced insulation glass was laid and the roof replaced by a special safety glass.
Thermal bridge beams have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled coatings have been rehabilitated.
Two basements have made room for the new operation, a screened light panel between the house and the road ensures lighting, a bridge leads to the entrance - it is almost a new construction, but still the light Schwanzer Pavilion.
The original exterior doors have remained, the house is painted in a shade protection against rust of brown-red color.
And the cinema is even exactly the same as it used to be.
And all this under close supervision of the authorities competent for the monuments and with a small budget.
"Often materials that are good and inexpensive had to be found, and which also please the monument protection office," says Krischanitz and he draws attention to a raw ground in the basement.
Despite all the constraints, problems and transformations, the building remained flexible and light.
This would have been difficult with the Pavilion, "which came from Brussels", Krischanitz said recently, a typical story of "Drop-in-the-City".
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and nevertheless wants to "awaken the good conscience".
But in this case the House of the 21st century is not in the wrong place, because if it is a stroke of chance of urban construction: around the Swiss Garden stands precisely the "quarter of the central station" all newly planned, with offices and apartments.
And perhaps another stroke of luck will occur: the House of the 21st century could benefit from the reinforcement of another Krischanitz construction, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the Berlin temporary art center, and as it is said, it already negotiates with the city in order to obtain a site in the vicinity of the Swiss Garden.
Bahn plans a winter crisis package in millions.
The railway company has developed a crisis plan to avoid train accidents in winter.
The number of employees is expected to double.
It costs millions.
In the fight against train accidents related to the winter season and delays, the railway company "Deutsche Bahn" will spend more than 70 million more this year.
The daily "Bild"-Zeitung reported in advance by invoking an internal crisis plan of the group, that investments of about 300 million euros would be planned until 2015.
This should allow for better availability of vehicles and the rail network also in the event of extreme weather.
The number of internal and external employees for the snow clearing of railway facilities and docks is expected to double, among other things, to 16,000.
The objective is to clear the snow and ice docks until the beginning of the service phase and 90 per cent of the track equipment required for the service within four to five hours.
Two months ago the station chief Rüdiger Grube warned the government and industry at a conference at the top of the train accidents also occurred this winter.
Last winter the railway company had a lot of problems for the transport of users, because it lacks, among other things, reserves in case of difficult weather conditions.
For example, many new regional trains have been awaiting authorization from the Ministry of Railways for years.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway company has for years had to do something, since it must have the axles of ICE trains checked much more often at the workshop, after a break in axles took place on an ICE at Cologne Central Station.
The German bank "Deutsche Bank" pays millions of penalties in the USA.
After Chief Josef Ackermann's case there is news in the US: the German bank "Deutsche Bank" has to pay a fine of millions.
As if the problems of the Deutsche Bank were not enough already, the past of this giant in the sector also catch up with him in the USA: the Frankfurt Institute pays in comparison 145 million dollars (106 million euros), to settle a dispute due to the bankruptcy of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
This is about the sale of mortgage documents.
The NCUA Financial Market Regulator brings a whole series of accusations to the big banks about having co-operative banks make false promises about the purchase of financial products; they would have minimized the risks.
These documents lost enormous value during the financial crisis and led banks down.
"We are pleased that we have been able to find a solution to this issue, without the parties initiating proceedings in the court," said an interlocutor from Deutsche Bank in New York.
The Bank did not recognise any faults in comparison.
This also applies to the Citigroup, which has committed to a payment of $20.5 million.
NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed the concessions of the two banking institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for US cooperative banks and intervenes in the event of bankruptcy, in order to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA is trying to repair the damage of several billion dollars.
The comparisons concluded now are the first of their kind.
The regulator also took other large banks separately and in the summer he assigned to JP Morgan Chase Court, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
As far as the issue of mortgage documents is concerned, it is "Mortgage-backed Securities".
Credit houses are at the base.
When the U.S. real estate bubble broke out in 2007, this was fatal for a large number of banking companies.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Even if the events are already a few years old, at the moment there is a wind of storm on American banks.
Investors and supervisory authorities have made numerous appeals to obtain redress or to sanction defaults.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the largest wave of complaints.
She blames 18 major international banks, two US state real estate financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for having benefited in kind from mortgage deals of about $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank must also file an appeal with the FHFA, which is a number of transactions totalling $14.2 billion for the years 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authorities ask, that Frankfurter answer "substantial losses" but without mentioning a precise sum.
Deutsche Bank had rejected the applications as unjustified and stated that it wished to defend itself.
WARREN Buffett increases by 10 billion at IBM
Buffett, the guru of finance, invests huge sums in IBM's IT company.
Since March, he has bought stocks worth more than $10 billion.
Until then, the big American investor Warren Buffett explains constantly not to invest in IT companies, since the long-term evolution of companies only shows bad forecasts.
However, he read IBM's reports and changed his opinion on investment in this sector.
He had already had to understand much earlier that IBM mainly offers services and computer systems for the IT sectors of other companies.
Warren Buffett's investment is considered a knight's attack in the world of finance.
Therefore, the IBM IT activity is granted the right to now be called "Mr. IBM".
Because Buffett today revealed to the CNBC economic program, which he has purchased since March IBM shares worth $10.7 billion.
His investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway has thus become a major shareholder of IBM with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said IBM never knew anything about this commitment so far.
He congratulated management, which even during the economic crisis had provided reasonable benefits.
"You did a great job," Buffett said strategically.
IBM has for some time been focusing on IT lucrative services as the operation of accounting centres.
The computer pioneer, over 100 years old, offers both software and consulting as well as high-performance business calculators.
Buffett had so far rather avoided technology companies.
He says he only invests in businesses he understands business from.
But on the contrary Buffett attacks rather the railway fret, manufacturers of lubricants or machines.
His Holding Berkshire Hathaway owns almost 80 subsidiaries as well as shares with a whole series of major groups such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Munich Rück.
This 81-year-old 80-year-old had taken over the Berkshire Hathaway textile company in the 1960s and had made it one of the world's most prestigious companies, thanks to intelligent investment.
However, his lifestyle is modest.
That is why he is a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His almost infallible sense of making money earned him the nickname of "Omaha's Oracle".
After the announcement of Buffett's investment, IBM shares increased by one percent on the stock exchange.
"Big Blue", also known as IBM, has a market value of more than $220 billion and has Apple and Microsoft among the most valuable technology companies in the world.
At Microsoft, says Buffett, he doesn't want to participate.
The founder Bill Gates would be a very good friend.
The threat is palpable
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer cell" the Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
A newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology", which would now be reborn.
The assassinations of eight Turkish nationals and a small Greek enterprise in the years 2000 to 2006 had an extremist context.
Following this news, Turkey and the German-Turkish population reacted with fear and concern.
For many German-Turkish people, the spectre that had long been believed to have been dead has reappeared: since the incendiary attacks of Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no more violence comparable to this extremist right-wing context against the Turks.
However, there is no mention of xenophobia in Germany.
The right-wing extremist network that has been detected, however, reveals proportions that are far from predictable in size.
"Is this a return to the bloody ideology", "Tel was the title of the publication on the internet of the Turkish daily "Haberturk".
The newspaper "Sabah" points out, on the other hand, that one of the authors would have been a V-man of the Protection of the Constitution, and is concerned that the German authorities could be involved in the far-right quagmire.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted in a reasonable way: this weekend it called for a silent commemoration of the victims of racial violence outside the Brandenburg Gate.
It was only two weeks ago that the Turkish community in Berlin and German and Turkish politicians had thought of a ceremony on the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
It was with cheerful colors that cohabitation had been staged, symbolizing a success story.
Reports from some Turkish media have the effect of slapping: "Germany's gift for the fiftieth anniversary" is the title of an article in the Turkish platform- "Haber X", which refers to the context of the series of murders.
Thus the German publication of the "Hürriyet" does not deprive itself of the unique conditions.
This is the title of the chronicle of Ahmet Külahci.
He points out that people had been murdered, paid taxes and made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany through their work.
Police action was perceived as being very critical on the German-Turkish forums and they had subsequently discussed the success of their research.
Why it has not already come much earlier in the minds of the German authorities to do research in some extreme right-wing suspect circles, the authors wonder.
More than one is prepared for at least rhetorical or even drastic means: "If the case continues to be bogged down, there will be nothing left to migrants other than self-defence and armament."
"it will be the best self-defense."
"Inner peace in Germany depends heavily on the quality of information and the relevance of the punishment of the entire network," writes Selen.
What this means if the internal peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s have explained well.
The picture of the ruins after the Solingen fire is deeply rooted in the German and Turkish memory.
For no other event has shown more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat, and to the Germans, upon which mistrust and distance by acts of violence could lead.
The attacks, however, have sharpened the sense of ours in the Turkish community.
Never repeat the mistakes of the past
In the past it was mainly the failure of German politics after the attacks of which the Turkish press complained: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the Solingen fire he sent a telegram of condolences to the Head of State of Turkey, was represented at the funeral in Cologne by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel counted in his speech at the time, how much taxes the local Turkish population produced.
As if the value of a man could be estimated on the amount of his tax burden.
The current Turkish media report once again shows how deeply the mistrust of many German-Turks has been towards the rule of local law since then.
In addition to the efforts to further clarify and re-evaluate extreme right-wing terrorism in Germany, a clear message is needed this time.
The scandal bank of Lake Zürich
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not located in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS almost went bankrupt in the financial crisis and in the meantime skates from one crisis to the next.
He's a German who has to lead now.
This is certainly not what Axel Weber had imagined.
After his spectacular departure from the head of the Bundesbank, it became known in July that he would hold an almost as spectacular position in 2013: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the large Swiss bank UBS - a great step towards an unexpected and lucrative career.
Axel Weber publicly welcomed, welcomed, Switzerland for its beauty and the UBS for its recently achieved solidity and moved from friendly remarks about future colleagues.
"The UBS passed the turnaround."
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
And yet, as early as September it was clear that everything would change.
A UKS securities dealer in London had hijacked all of the Bank's security systems and had flung around €1.7 billion.
The head of the board of directors of the UBS Oswald Grübel, a well-known banker not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
the president of the board of directors of the UBS has since been considered as suffering - and all ask: When does Axel Weber finally come back?
We have already learned that Weber can be advised from the bank from February 2012.
And he will resume the administration presidency already in May - not in 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber this becomes difficult.
He is not a banker, much more professor of economics and president of the bank, and he would certainly have needed a period of adaptation.
All at once he assumed responsibility for a bank's strategy, which had just proved once again that it had long deserved the title "the biggest scandal bank in Europe".
Indeed, the UBS is on one side enormous - until recently, it was the largest asset manager in the world, and on the other, it has been skating for years from scandal to scandal.
Nothing, it seems, saves the so proud Swiss bank.
This began during the financial crisis.
Until 2007 the UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the Swiss manager of assets, quiet and solid, but also cunning, had combined it with ambitious objectives: she also wanted to become, in the field of banking investment, a very large bank.
So the UBS managed on one side in 2007 with $1.6 billion more money coming from an easy customer than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, she had advanced as an investment bank in the league of the world's largest banks.
That made an impression.
Former banker Hans Geiger and later bank professor for many years in Zurich tells: "I have always taken the UBS as a good bank model in front of my students."
"From the current point of view, one wonders: how could I simply be so wrong?"
He was deeply mistaken.
In 2007 it appeared that for the first time something was not going round at the UBS.
In the middle of the year, President Peter Wuffli retired in a surprising way, which until then had been regarded as a high intellectual and a great banker.
A few months later, we sensed why he had left.
The division of the bank had flamed with sub-prime documents and had to make a cross over billions.
To support this, the UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion francs and made a cross on it.
For this she did find investors, but who, a short time before, would have frowned on the eyebrows: a non-transparent Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund, which was passed under silence, to the point that it was never even known her name.
But it was only the first blow.
In April 2008, this worsened.
The bank was to announce again losses amounting to billions, the president of the board of directors Marcel Ospel, who was still in 2006 the second most paid board of directors in Switzerland, withdrew.
In October 2008 the disaster followed: the UBS was, in view of its investment errors, in the financial crisis before the bankruptcy and had to be saved by the state.
The national bank has bought tens of billions of problematic securities from the UBS, the Swiss Confederation has given six billion francs for bonds convertible into shares, for which it could become co-owner of the bank.
All Switzerland has been shaken - because it has noted how dramatic it can be for a small country to house such large banks.
Finally, the total balance sheet of the UBS 2007 amounted to more than five times Switzerland's economic performance (see graph).
"We couldn't save the UBS again," said bank researcher Geiger.
After the first disaster he followed the second.
Already a few months earlier, the UBS had capitulated due to a tax dispute with America and declared itself ready to publish the data of the easy customer, who had fraudulently taxed perhaps with the help of the Bank.
In addition, it has accepted a payment of $780 million - in repayment of unjustified profits from these transactions with an increased fine.
Thus, the UBS more or less published that it had helped tax fraud.
At the same time she lost something that has always been her capital in competition with the rich customers: the prestige of discretion.
After the scandal, Swiss banking secrecy was not the same.
He then withdrew the head of the board of directors and the chairman of the board of directors.
And the outflow of customers' money.
Thus, within a few months, the bank had lost its credibility in the two main business sectors: banking investment due to bad speculation and asset management due to aid for tax fraud.
And, as there was a bit of a return to calm, and as we thought, that the UBS would get out of it, it followed this unfortunate story of titular merchants: a single titular merchant flaming 1.7 billion euros, before the bank realized that something was not going round.
And it is published: with risk management in the investment bank it still does not seem to work.
"With the Adoboli case, it has been observed that the risk control has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, economist and professor of finance at the Banking Institute of the University of Zurich.
So the financial director of a large German bank is sure: "The problem with the UBS is that it does not have control of the risks in hand."
However, it was precisely the idea of prudence, with which Swiss bankers had long assumed their role, that of becoming guardian of the great fortune of the world: not too great risks, but security for money - and the world could well collapse beyond the Alpine republic.
The treasures of Swiss banks had become the symbol of unshakable reliability like Lindt and Sprüngli are for a particularly noble chocolate.
The UBS central office in Zurich is still paired with the solid cliché of the Swiss private bank - it is only a little bigger.
The situation is already classic.
The Bank has its seat at Zurich Central Station, which leads directly from the Central Station to Lake Zurich, which itself is surrounded by the snowy peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are prestigious, store rents are among the highest in Europe.
Jewellers like Tiffany's are found here among the shops of Swiss traditions as well as those of the Sprüngli Confectionery.
For centuries Swiss bankers have resided here: from the national bank to the palace of Credit Suisse to private elitist banks such as Julius Bär.
We arrive in the entrance hall of the UBS through a heavy door.
Inside, the walls are covered with marble, front are thick leather chairs, and next to the bank logo, a large label for "safe".
The UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has one day or the other left out of the market - or betrayed the two major Swiss banks, the UBS and the Credit Suisse, as the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He would rather not read his name in the newspaper, finally like all Swiss bankers he does business also with the two big banks.
The UBS would have become far too large, he finds - especially in banking investment, where the Anglo-Saxons would also have spread.
The Swiss would have nothing more to say.
"And yet, they have long adapted to Anglo-Saxon customs."
This was indeed the Anglo-Saxon investment bank that changed the UBS, it made high profits and then the debacle: no European financial institution has lost as much money in the sub-prime jungle as the large Swiss bank.
The disaster became apparent on October 15, 2008.
"This Wednesday the government coalition of the small country with seven million inhabitants undertook the largest rescue operation in the history of their nation," writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "The crash of the UBS".
With up to 68 billion francs, or 45 billion euros, politicians have agreed to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
How could this happen?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem especially at the size of the UBS.
In June 1998 two of the three major Swiss banks concluded a huge group together.
A bank was created, which was already too big for little Switzerland - and it has steadily increased.
What has helped is that the two different predecessor banks of the UBS have completed: a rich bank, but in lethargy with as a strong point the management of assets in Zurich and a poorer one, but certainly already more strongly internationalized.
All of a sudden, international investment banks have had favorable access to a lot of money, with which they have been able to turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with the rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 Head of the UBS Group, and Marcel Ospel, formerly Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," says bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the great, modest intellectual, who understands himself very well in models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive, who has paved a way to the top with the learning of the bank."
But Ospel would have trusted Wuffli to the end.
And wuffli would probably have made a decisive mistake in the end: "He thought his models were reality," Geiger said.
"It's a tragic fall."
Tragic, maybe.
One thing is clear: exuberance came before the fall.
The UBS staff clearly remembers the meetings of the leaders during which the leader of the Wuffli group always pronounced the same slogan: dethroning Goldman Sachs.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank on the planet.
She ordered the "League Tables" rankings, which at that time documented the success of the banks.
After all, the UBS wanted to climb all the way up.
Some steps have already succeeded him.
In the case of currency and securities transactions, it has played a very important role.
However, the business advisors, who were responsible for this, stressed a weakness: in international interest transactions, in the banking jargon "Fixed Income", there would be a huge difference from the larger banks.
The UBS would have gaps in US mortgage products.
To fill this gap, the UBS embarked on an adventure, which almost cost him his life.
Wanted to grow, it is both the bank itself and a management fund created before it in the U.S. sub-prime investments that have invested.
It has turned into a massive machine that has packaged and passed on valuable documents based on US mortgages - but has also retained risks.
Even when other banks had long sought to go down.
"Even in the summer of 2007, while the American real estate market was on fire, the UBS bought there," says Geiger, the banking expert.
The greater the euphoria, the more brutal the fall.
One manager after another had to leave, when putting an end to the attempts proved more difficult than we thought.
Posts at UBS have become ejectible and have so far been stunned.
Whoever runs the big bank has an almost impossible task.
He must find a strategy for a bank, for which all the suggested business models have disappeared.
The bank researcher, Geiger already has an idea: to put an end to the investment bank, concentration on the management of goods, return to the Swiss roots.
But the bank does not (yet) want to go that far.
But the investment bank must run over vigorously, as far as is clear so far.
Next Thursday the bank leader Sergio Ermotti wants to present to the world his future strategy.
The 51-year-old Italo-Suisse was only supposed to be on a transitional basis when the bank broke up with surprise with its predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he has imposed himself: he must conduct the affairs of the UBS on a lasting basis, the Bank of Zurich announced on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to the state of progress in the mid-1990s.
It cancels 3500 jobs.
But that won't be enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber has certainly already asked himself.
He said publicly so far only that he was going to look with his wife for an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
Fear of the recession in Europe weighs on the American stock exchange
The threat of a recession in Europe this weekend has discouraged American investors.
The change of government in Athens and Rome remained unaffected.
Industrial production on the continent has stifled hopes of stabilising the debt crisis in its germ.
The general relief on the change of government in Rome and Athens could not be imposed.
The euro has fallen from the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glass I still had last week only half filled, not half emptied - but now the problems are pressing once again in the foreground, said Mark Luschini von Janney Montgomery Scott.
Above all, the financial values were on the sales sheets.
The default values for the Dow-Jones-Index indicated a loss of approximately 0.6% to 12,078 points at the close of the markets.
During trade, the barometer of the market fluctuated between 12027 and 12170 points.

In Frankfurt, the Dax ended with a decrease of 1.2% to 5985 points.
Industry in the 17 euro area countries significantly reduced production and adjusted at the end of the recovery.
As announced by the Eurostat Statistics Office, companies produced 2% less in September than in the previous month.
American investors sceptically said: "We are not an island, but dependent," said Steve Goldman of Goldman management.
Europe will soon not be able to recover from a recession, there are also other signs of weakness from banks.
The legendary investor, Warren Buffett, only confirmed this caution: "it is not yet clear whether Europe would be strong enough to do something to put an end to the crisis," he said in an interview with CNBC.
Therefore, it was too early in his view to invest in bonds from European states and banks.
Instead, Warren Buffett threw a decades-old principle into the wind and entered the U.S. technology industry

Smart horns spread in cities
In many places, freux are considered "bird problem" but experts claim that these very intelligent animals have not been driven out of cities for a long time.
Some like them, some want to get rid of them as quickly as possible. The crows have been in the city for centuries, but in many communities the complaints of the residents are multiplying because of the dirt and noise of the animals.
An antidote to the "bird problem " is not yet in sight.
During the first ostfriesisch symposium on corneals, experts said that it is no longer possible to chase the freux from the cities.
Experts from all over Germany discussed possible solutions.
They're looking for alternatives in the cities.
The protectionists of nature based the problems of cities also on the exodus of particularly protected strawberries: The use of chemicals in agriculture increasingly destroys traditional vital spaces.
The hunting, development and slaughter of typical brooding trees made life difficult for birds.
The crows are under the protection of nature.
There are large colonies with more than 600 brooding pairs in westfälischen Soest, in the north-west including Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen as well as in Leer.
In 2005, a controversial project gained negative publicity due to the slaughter of the crows in that region.
Critics have found the capture of birds in traps and their killing with particularly brutal gourds.
"Normal expulsion, eviction, is of no use," noted Leer's planner Werner Klöver.
The destruction of nests with pressure water or the felling of trees, often produces undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser de Lahr at Baden-Württemberg.
"Animals move away, large colonies divide and disperse in other places."
Eviction can only be imagined in exceptional cases, such as hospitals, retirement homes or schools.
"We are forced to live with them, we can no longer exterminate them."
The problem is not solved in the cities without the inclusion of the periphery, according to Mayor Wolfgang Kellner of Leer.
Conceivable is a combination of the removal of animals from an aversive packaging and catchy offers, in order to allow them to relocate elsewhere.
Psychologist and ethnologist, Uta Maria Jürgens was looking for "info panels instead of chainsaws" to establish completely different relationships with them: "We can finally better support a button in the face with a dose of self-confidence."
Jürgens co-founded the Ascheberger-roading-educational baskets at Schleswig-Holstein, road signs informing the lives of these very intelligent friezes.
This project has been adopted by tourists in the meantime.
Jürgen gave his own opinion on the criticism of the noise caused by birds: "Here are a lot of communication, these birds have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of animals are legendary: Freux not only use working instruments to get to a treat but they themselves manufacture their tools as working instruments.
Ethologists from the University of Cambridge recently tested four freux, at which point the intelligence of birds comes.
In one experiment, birds quickly learned that they had to sink a scaffolding with stones to reach a larva.
Without much training, they definitely recognized that a stone had to have some size and shape to cause the platform to collapse.
In a second test, the cunning horns then had to solve a more trappy problem.
In a cylinder placed vertically, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a larva.
Birds could not reach their prey with their beaks.
However, the researchers had put pieces of iron wire at their disposal.
All four animals formed a hook with the help of which they fished the small bucket of the small pipe.
Three of the four friezes are successful even from the beginning.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal at the 2012 European Championship
The hopes of a blow by the Bosnians and the Turks remained unsuccessful.
Favorite Portugal, Croatia, Czech Republic and also Ireland will participate in the 2012 European Championship.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland bought the last tickets in the playoffs at the 2012 European Championship in Poland and then eliminated Ukraine.
Led by superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53rd), Portugal misled Bosnia and Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made perfect, after the 0:0 of the match, his fifth appearance in the European championship.
The Czechs reached the playback game by Montenegro 1:0 (0:0), while the first round (2:0) had already been an obvious thing.
Nothing was even more burning in the zero 0:0 match between Turkey and Croatia, Ireland took a 1:1 (1:0) break against Estonia.
Nani (24), Helder Postiga (72nd, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) scored the other shots for Portugal.
Former Bundesliga player Wolfsburg, Zvjezdan Misimovic, with a hand-played 11 metre-penality (41th) and Captain Emir Spahic (65th) twice made a shortcut for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic was confronted by a red-yellow card (54th).
Bosnia had already failed in the playoffs for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa in Portugal.
At Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal had a well-measured start.
Ronaldo sent a free kick 30 meters in advance into the mesh.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his remote shooting qualities and fired at a distance of 25 meters to make 2:0.
The Bosnians, who did nothing in the first half hour, had their first clear chance thanks to the attacker Edin Dzeko.
Former Wolfsburger, the leader of the Manchester City English Championship, initiated a headball directed to the bottom of the crossbar, the ball did not cross the goal line (33e).
Jiracek scored a goal for Czech
Finally, Ergolding's arbiter Wolfgang Stark at the centre of all attention.
After an attack on Helder Postiga during the Bosnian penalty, Stark decided for Schwalbe and showed the yellow card to the Portuguese (36th).
On the other hand, Stark granted a penalty of 11 meters played in controversial hand after an action by Fabio Coentrao that Misimovic surely diverged.
But after the break, the 2004 European Vice-Champion made four hits and everything became clear.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek also ended the last doubts during the 81st minute.
Thus, the 1976 European champion will go for a fifth time to the EM.
Coach Michal Bilek's team with the legionnaires Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg) were also lucky and had to survive a moment of shock in the initial phase.
Goalkeeper Petr Cech prevented with a reflex a last minute goal by potential Tomas Sivok (9th).
Montenegro had its greatest potential when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic scored at the 40th minute of rotation on the repair surface right next to Cech's shot.
After the break, the crossing had to come to the rescue of the Czech world-class guard already shot down, once again, the CF Seoul attacker had been replaced (50th).
The goal shortly before the end finally clarified everything.
Turkey missed Zagreb's football miracle during that time.
Four days after 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb could not go beyond a 0:0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink also had to give up his seat on the 2002 EM third bench, the Croats were able to rejoice in their fourth round at the end of the European championship.
In the presence of 31,000 spectators at Maksimir Stadium, the Turks had almost caught up with a dream start.
Selcuk Inan scored at the seventh minute with a long range shot only the pole, attacker Kazim Kazim could not even bury the ball in the goal.
After the moment of fear, Croatia has gained more and more control.
Even after the break, the Croats didn't let anything burn.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic of the VfL Wolfsburg, who was replaced by Ivan Perisic of Dortmund at the 62nd minute, the legionnaires of the Bundesliga Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) remained on the ground.
Trapattoni participates in the EM
In Dublin, the Irish celebrate their first participation in the MS since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward took coach Giovanni Trapattoni's team, who had already taken over with a success of 4:0 the first stage for a preliminary decision, 32nd Minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57th) equalized for visitors.
Ireland pushed ahead from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute, before Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy received the first good opportunity.
Only at the last moment that Estonia's defence was able to prevent a possible goal for the first striker.
In the 32nd minute, it happened.
After unsuccessful defense of goaltender Pavel Londak, Ward was within reach and tightened the ball on the line for 1:0.

SAP wants to double the number of its employees in China
Europe's largest software company, SAP, intends to invest billions in China in the coming years and will almost double the number of its employees in the country.
Until 2015, approximately $2 billion (€1.5 billion) will be allocated, Dax Group said on Tuesday.
"We will create additional research facilities and development centres and hire employees accordingly," said CEO Bill McDermott to his clients on an equitable basis in Beijing.
The workforce will grow from about 2,500 to 4,500 employees.
The number of branches of the world leader in enterprise software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP has a presence in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
About 4000 of the 176,000 global SAP clients are located in this expanding country.
Growth plans in China are also an important part of the Dax Group's 2015 Strategy.

Last year, Walldorfer recorded an income of almost €12.5 billion.
Currently the business management of the software provider, which employs 55,000 people, has never worked this well.
SAP has been active in China for more than 20 years.
"Now we want to expand our activities...," said McDermott.
"Our goal is to promote sustainable growth in China, supported by comprehensive information."
Personal mass slaughter
Peter Englund's new book offers depth and generosity. titled "The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War", it begins with a long list of characters that strengthens your heart.
A hint to start with: carefully tear this page apart and make it your brand.
You will learn to know these people in detail. In this novel by Peter Englund, this list of characters will be your GPS, a beacon during these few moments where, like one of his men or women, you will be troubled and desperate in the haze of war.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which issues the Nobel Prize in Literature.
He wrote here an unusual book that he accurately describes as "an anti-history book."
It has some well-known names, important treaties or famous battles; almost no ambassadors or discussions on strategies and materials are found.
It is not so much a book about what happened, he explains, as a "book describing what it might look like." It contains the "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods."
"Beauty and grief" summarizes the wartime experiences of 20 more or less ordinary men and women, on both sides of the war, from young schoolgirls and botanists to climbers, doctors, ambulances and sellers.
Some will become heroes.
Some of the prisoners of war will lose their limbs, go crazy, or lose their lives.
Their lives vacillate here like the candles of a church: while some are dying, new ones are being lit up.
Peter Englund's book deviates from traditional history books.
He denies the idea that the First World War is only summed up by the terrible trench war on the western front.
"Beauty and grief" skillfully describes other theatres of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia and East Africa.
The soldiers present in this book are under hives; a Christmas pass in Egypt under the pyramids; the tsetse flies are an intractable problem.
This book is moving from the first page.
The war invades the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like a hurricane Katrina that stinks the cordite.
When the cannon blows in the distance, and you are a mother in the home, do you stay or run away?
Who's going to come anyway?
Almost no one can understand what happened, or even the reasons for this war.
According to Peter Englund, "the lack of facts has been exacerbated by assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"Beauty and grief" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor of the German high seas fleet.
Their stories are mainly from memoirs, letters and other documents already published.
The versions of their lives can be terrifying or exciting, but are most preserved thanks to the accumulation of small moments and isolated details.
Most approach deprivation and the ability to cope.
In telling the story of a German schoolgirl, Peter Englund writes: "Ersatz, everywhere ersatz. "
"Replacement coffee, fake aluminum, rubber imitation, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He continues on alternative food in Germany.
He describes "meat made of cooked rice crushed in sheep fat (and finished with a fake wooden bone); tobacco made with dry roots and dried potato skin; wooden shoe soles."
He states that "837 authorized substitute meats are registered in the production of sausages. There are also 511 substitute coffees."
Some stories address honor and courage.
An American recognizes his own drive towards savagery and says about the war: "You feel that after all, this is what men were meant for, rather than sitting in a comfortable chair, a cigarette and a whisky in your hand, reading a newspaper or a best-seller, and rather than pretending that such a varnish is synonymous with civilization, and that there is no barbaric behind your stuffed and nailed shirt.
Conversely, a British soldier realizes that he is at high risk of death, and that no one will notice or pay attention to it.
"When we are resigned to sacrifice, we hope to have an audience," he writes.
Unfortunately, this is rather like "a convicted man strangled in secret."
Other observations concern the decline of an old Europe and new types of terror.
"The conflict is increasingly becoming a history of economic competition," writes Peter Englund, "a war between factories."
He grasps the arrival of what he calls "a new species within the bestiary of the beginning of the century: the mass murderer well articulated and ideologically convinced, in well-cut clothes, who executes his butchery while sitting behind a counter."
People act unexpectedly; there are as many basic behaviors as there are heroism.
Peter Englund talks about soldiers who tried at all costs to catch a venereal disease in prostitutes in order to avoid service at the front.
"We find the most grotesque expression in the pus trade due to gonorrhea, which soldiers buy and spread on the genitals in the hope of ending up in the hospital," he writes.
"The most desperate apply it to the eyes, which translates into a life-long blindness."
In this translation of Swedish by Peter Graves, Peter Englund's prose is flexible but not ostentatious, perfectly suited to his human task.
In dozens of short scenes, he grasps the way in which war "has unleashed exclusively uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, a social revolution, an aversion to religion. "
People are beginning to wonder why their leaders are making war with them.
The best works dealing with the First World War are often indirect, such as "Great War and Modern Memory" by Paul Fussel, or "To the west nothing new", by Erich Maria Remark, rather than complete.
Peter Englund's work is an unconventional pantheon.
The end of the book is the most overwhelming I have read in a non-fictional work.
I won't reveal it.
But it's as if he came out of his book, seized with your hands this page where the list of people appears and burned with a match.
After a first false step, a carefully planned operation
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some wearing riot helmets.
The night from Monday to Tuesday was chosen as Zuccotti Park would be the most empty.
The operation remained secret from all but a few high-ranking officers and others informed from the outset that they were going to carry out an exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the heart of the operation, his presence highlighting the risks and challenges for the Police Department.
There could not be repetitions of episodes in recent weeks, such as the use of pepper gas against demonstrators, which went against the department's regulations and created a storm of public solidarity for demonstrators.
The operation to clean Zuccotti Park of its demonstrators was deployed after two weeks of planning and training.
The police had prepared themselves by observing the progress of the occupations in other cities.
A capital exercise was organized on the island of Randall for the operation at Zuccotti Park.
Police officers receive better training against riots - anti-terrorist measures that involve rapidly moving a large number of police officers - to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session took place on Monday evening on the Manhattan side of the East River.
Orders to travel in the park came "at the last minute, " said a regular, referring to the operation as "a simple exercise. "
"The few policemen I know who were called didn't know they would go to Zuccotti Park," the person said anonymously.
"The only ones who know they're going there are at the top of the police department hierarchy."
The city has learned a lesson, hence the secret of the operation.
On 14 October, police officers wanted to clean the park but were repelled by hundreds of protesters informed of the plans.
The Tuesday operation involved officers from various police units, including operational forces from all over the neighbourhood - from dozens of officers used to the particularly criminal quarters.
Mr. Kelly said that many people were going to and from the park during the day, like migrants, so one hour in the morning was a good time.
"It was appropriate to proceed when the park had the least number of people," he said.
Emergency service vehicles equipped with spots and speakers gathered on Pipe Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before intervening.
The loudspeakers' recorded lights and messages seemed to intimidate the protesters.
While community affairs officers entered the park with their light blue windshields, many protesters simply gathered their business and left.
No tent was hit before 1:45 a.m. said the police, which left time for the occupants to gather their belongings.
Other police teams were spotted on the perimeter, ready to intervene if arrests were necessary.
Journalists inside the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, the spokesman for the head of the police department, stated that this measure had been taken solely for security purposes.
But according to many journalists, the police reportedly prevented them from observing the intervention inside the park, harshly retained by the officers.
Mr. Browne stated that the television camera trucks on Church Street, along the west side of the park, were able to capture images.
While the police were moving west through the thick business searches of protesters, including luggage, plastic grass and clothing-filled leaf bags, teams from the sanitation department were following, cleaning up everything the occupants left behind.
The few protesters who refused to leave were dragged away. The images were broadcast on the Internet shortly afterwards.
The main group of protesters took place near the camp kitchen, not far from the center of the park.
Some have formed a barrier that the police have moved to stop methodically.
About ten people at the epicentre of the camp hung together.
Finally, two people chained themselves to trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Emergency services have been called to shut down the locks.
No arrests took place in the park before 3:30 said Mr. Kelly.
According to the police, the clean-up operation ended about an hour and a quarter later.
According to Mr. Browne, nearly 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of them for "disrupting public order and rebellion. "
Joseph J. Esposito, head of the Police Department, is the most senior officer on the scene.
Phil T. Pulaski, the head of the detective department, was also present.
Mr. Kelly, although now, "didn't lead operations," said Mr. Browne.
A second group of police were waiting along the east side of the park, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case of necessary intervention.
Barricades were laid on Cortlandt Street, a block of houses north of the park, as well as on Pine Street, south.
We saw the police expand the perimeter far beyond Zuccotti Park.
Several officers, most of them equipped with shields, were even seen pushing people away.
Nearly 28 people were on the north side.
One of the most lively actions of the night took place south of the park.
At approximately 5:00 a.m., south of Pine Street, a protester jumped on the hood of a police car. Others were spotted tearing down the tires of a police truck.
At one point, a piece of plywood came up flying from the crowd.
Finally, a police officer and a protestor were hospitalized.
The school aid union sues the city for redundancies
The union, which represents hundreds of school aids who lost their jobs last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday for unnecessary and discriminatory dismissals. The impact is disproportionate on schools hosting disadvantaged schoolchildren.
The lawsuits are probably the ultimate weapon of the union, Council of the 37th District, to try to get the layoffs cancelled.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, parents' coordinators and other employees, who were among the lowest paid in the city, lost their jobs on October 7th. Trade union leaders compared these redundancies to political revenge for not allowing the city to access a health care fund led by workers' groups, which would have closed the budget gap last spring.
The municipal authorities categorically denied this accusation.
At a municipal council hearing last month, Chancellor Dennis M. Walcott stated that layoffs were part of the budget closed in June.
A member of the Council replied, stating that the dismissals of school aid were not specified in the budget.
Council officers from the 37th District stated that they would complete a notice of complaint, warning the Department of Education that it would be prosecuted; a press conference will be held on Wednesday to officially announce the prosecutions to the Manhattan Supreme Court of State.
Dennis M. Walcott and the city's education department will be the defendant. The complainants will be represented by eight dismissed workers, all of black or Latin American origin, like most school assistants who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokesperson for the city's legal department, stated that the municipality has not yet been able to see the reasons for the trial and therefore cannot comment on the allegations.
According to a draft of complaints obtained by the New York Times, the union would rely on the number of redundancies in schools in the city's most disadvantaged neighbourhoods to support its complaint against unfair treatment, stating that the poorest schools would lose the most support due to regular underfunding.
While there are no redundancies on Staten Island, and only a few in Upper East Side or TriBeCa institutions, 17 school assistants have lost their jobs in Brownsville 23rd District, and 46 in the 8th and 9th Districts of the southern Bronx neighbourhoods.
Noting the loss of five out of eight female school assistants at public school 36 in Harlem, where 68% of schoolchildren live in poverty, the prosecution says that "It is not a neighbourhood of wealthy parents who can bring money to fill the budget gap."
Public school budget 36 was reduced by 3.26% this year. Funds were also lost when the city changed its calculation of additional funding for each underprivileged student registration.
The union also states that school principals may have been misled by some terms in a memo authorizing the dismissal of parents' coordinators.
The memo used the term "excess" to describe the action, although "excess" more generally describes the action of moving a teacher from a school to a group of available workers whose salaries are paid by the central office.
According to the complaint project, "sixteen parents' coordinators were dismissed" and "not just because they were overtaken".
Mission completed: Congress reached agreement on Libya's issue
It would appear that the Republicans and Democrats finally reached agreement in the Capitol on the issue of the uprising in Libya.
It will have taken a successful uprising, the capture and death of long-time dictator Muammar Gadhafi and American involvement.
The Senate's Foreign Relations Committee will have to take a decision next Tuesday, supported by President John Kerry (Democrat - Massachussetts), with Senators John McCain (Republican - Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent - Connecticut), applauding the Libyan people for their revolt and the American troops for their "courage".
"This resolution is about honouring the courage of Libyans as they begin to rebuild their country," said John Kerry.
"This is bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations."
Language may be harmless, but the debate on Libya has never been simple so far.
This summer, legislators from both parties came into conflict, as well as with the White House, on the formulation of several resolutions aimed at approving or not the military role of the United States in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution authorizing the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated by a broad bipartisan margin and was never voted in the Senate.
But on the same day as the bill failed, the Chamber of Deputies also rejected a measure aimed at reducing the financing of US operations in Libya.
The American mission therefore remained in a form of legislative purgatory - Congress upset enough to criticize Obama's management of the mission, but not enough to cut the grass under his foot.
The indecision of the Congress was overcome by events.
Tripoli fell under the insurgents in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
NATO's mission officially ended on 31 October.
The Senate can now act.
The Foreign Relations Committee resolution "congratulates the Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and determination for freedom" and "congratulates the men and women of the American armed forces and their coalition partners engaged in military operations to protect the Libyan people, for their fantastic courage and professionalism."
The resolution also affirms "the national interest of the United States in achieving an irreversible and successful transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new measure win the full support of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee or will it divide the legislators as last June?
The Honourable Richard D. Lugar (Independent) opposed the last version.
His spokesman said last Monday that Richard D. Lugar had not yet read the very latest version of the new project.
Within the Capitol, the House must vote this week on an amendment to the Constitution in order to obtain a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republicans of Congress, and some Democrats.
The measure, supported by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment to the budget, or any other matter, to obtain a floor vote in the House or Senate.
Other legislators have so far failed to get their amendments approved, but this is not without trying.
Goodlatte's amendment is one of the 68 constitutional amendments that have been presented to Congress on a wide range of subjects.
Some are recurrent - the same bill proposed both in the House and in the Senate - and others are slight variations from a precedent.
There are at least 15 versions in the House only of the amendment for a balanced budget, and another handful that would "control federal spending. "
Some of these bills are identical, but give their supporters - especially the new Republicans who want to gold their CV - the chance to boast of being the "author" of such a measure.
The Budget Control Act (Budget Control Act) approved last August called for the House and the Senate to vote on the amendment of a balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators were voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members wish to limit the number of terms during which members of Congress can serve, while José E. Serrano (Democrat - New York) wishes to lift the limit of two terms for presidents.
Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat - Illinois) proposed a multitude of amendments guaranteeing the right to quality education and health care, among others.
An amendment prohibiting same-sex marriage is perpetually proposed, as is the amendment prohibiting the desecration of the flag.
Some legislators also wish to authorize the cancellation of federal laws if two thirds of states object.
As eager as members have been to offer amendments, they are not as quick as they were in the past.
At the 111th Congress, the legislators proposed 77 amendments, and introduced 66 at the 110th Congress.
The pace slowed compared to the early 1990s when members generally proposed more than 150 amendments every two years, based on figures provided by the Senate Library.
But these amendments were not much more successful than they are today.
The last amendment to have been added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992 but proposed to Congress in 1789.
"Massacree but not beaten" says Gabrielle Giffords during her first television interview since the shooting
Ten months after an armed man shot her in Tucson, Representative Gabrielle Giffords (Democrat - Arizona) appeared on a television show on Monday night, sang "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" from Broadway and said she wanted to recover first rather than go back to Congress.
When she appeared in the television newspaper "20/20" on ABC, alongside Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords struggled to form sentences and needed help to walk.
The show approached his difficult return following the bullet that fractured his skull and pierced the left side of the brain, crossing the head.
Three months ago, she had made a surprising return to the House of Representatives to vote on the debt ceiling text.
In her first television interview since the January shooting, which killed six people and injured thirteen others, Gabrielle Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and described her recovery as "difficult".
After Diane Sawyer asked her how she felt, her 41-year-old Gabrielle Giffords responded "rather well."
The interview with Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, took place during a one-hour special edition of "20/20", broadcast the day before the couple's new book entitled "Gabby: a story of courage and hope" was released.
The special show has traced Gabrielle Giffords' recovery since the January 8 shooting.
In videos filmed by Mark Kelly in the first few weeks, he was seen on his hospital bed, shaved head and a large scar on the forehead.
She manages to use only one or two fingers, with the encouragement of her husband.
A few months later, Gabrielle Giffords sat in a wheelchair while doctors taught her how to perform simple actions.
A sign of the head.
A movement of the lips.
And finally, his first word, "What."
A few days later, Gabrielle Giffords whispered another word ("Toast") asking to change her breakfast menu.
The videos broadcast by ABC show the important role of music in the recovery of Gabrielle Giffords: we see the Representative singing with doctors the air of Cyndi Lauper "Girls Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty "Free Fallin"?
During the interview with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords, who spends two hours with the doctors every day, said she did not remember the shooting.
According to her husband, he was reading him an article about the shooting on March 12 when she stopped him and asked for the first time about the six people killed during the incident.
The armed man, Jared Lee Loughner, is detained in a Missouri prison and vigorously treated pending trial.
"There were many deaths," Gabrielle Giffords told Diane Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard."
When she recovered, Mark Kelly told Diane Sawyer, she said, "I was beaten."
"So I'd say, "Gabby, you weren't beaten," said Mark Kelly.
You've just been slaughtered.
And you're gonna get away with it, get better and come back stronger than ever.
More pity than respect for the troops
Event: Wall Street gala to raise millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about impotence, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and Marines around him.
The crowd in a tie suit stood at his feet to cheer him up.
"The military, men and women, are considered heroes," said David Saltzman, organizer of the spring fundraiser.
A high-ranking military presence at the gala, also attended by Admiral Mike Mullen, Chief of the United States Army Staff, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They were presented as some sort of orphan," the military high-ranking man wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know that.
But it wasn't respect, just pity.
The absolutely contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relations that have developed between the military and a passionate but often distant American public.
Praises are given to the troops for their sacrifices.
But they have a certain price, say some military.
The public is acting more and more like they're sorry for men and women in uniform.
"We are not the victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who led the troops in Iraq and will soon leave for Afghanistan.
"But it would seem that the only way to support us is to lock us in the role of evil spirits."
This is a very sensitive subject for military leaders, who do not wish to appear unrecognized or disagree with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger of the troops returning from the Vietnam war has been much worse.
Thus, most conversations about mercy take place in complete confidentiality among veterans.
After the return of his two sons from combat with the Marines, retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that the public would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with respect because they were confronted with insurgents and traveled to distant lands.
Others would wonder if "an angry and violent veteran is hiding under the surface " said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and came back to work in the government in Washington.
When he was looking for a job, he said, he felt that a few people who put him through the interviews were subtly asking if he would be able to cope with the stress of a demanding job in Washington immediately after his return from the fight.
"When you address the subject of service, you face negative impressions," recalls Colonel Cancian when he speaks to his sons.
The military's difficulties arise, in part, from American indifference to wars.
Victories are rarely congratulated by a country so unfamiliar with the army and seeing little direct benefits from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"As a nation, we no longer value heroism in the same way as for the Second World War," said retired Lieutenant General David Barno, who led the troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the congratulations of politicians and the people are largely focused on the depth of a soldier's suffering.
Troops are recognized for the number of service periods endured, the number of friends lost or the extent of injuries.
The army in the face of increasing pressure against rapists
This week, a capital hearing will decide whether 28 men and women will go to trial against the army for alleged inaction on rape.
If necessary, hundreds of complainants will prepare the next one.
First-class soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant the night she claimed to have been raped by a soldier.
It was in October 2008. She was returning to her barracks at Miramar Air Station, north of San Diego, after having dinner with a friend, when she met a colleague carrying a pack of beers.
He asked her if he could join her in her room for a drink.
"It was an alarm signal," says Elizabeth Lyman.
But Texane has put aside her concern.
I thought, no, he's 19.
"He's from Texas," she says.
"I should have followed my intuition."
A few minutes after entering Elizabeth Lyman's room, the man caught her from behind, thrown to the ground and raped, she claims.
This week, on November 18, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 other military personnel, some still in service and others not, will eagerly await the decision of the court in a historic trial that will take place in Arlington, Virginia, and which will decide whether a trial against former defence secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will take place.
The latter are accused of not stopping the generalization of rape within the army, thus violating the constitutional rights of soldiers.
In February by Susan Burke, a Washington lawyer, the trial initially involved 17 complainants. This number amounted to 28 in the following months - 25 women and 3 men, all claiming to have been sexually raped or abused by fellow soldiers. They also claim that the army did not investigate, prosecute or provide adequate justice after the alleged attacks.
Susan Burke says she's attacking the gallant military, because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a vertical structure," she says.
"Who are the individuals in a position to eradicate the culture of reprisals? Leaders."
Counsel also states that since February, she has been contacted by nearly 400 other survivors, most of whom could be part of future legal proceedings.
Its strategy: instead of bringing all the complainants together in this case - thus placing all its eggs in the same basket - it will try several trials, if necessary, to maintain pressure.
The defence team, for the Department of Defense, led by American lawyer Neil MacBride, filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The judicial documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defence strategy, and essentially the fact that the army cannot be prosecuted by soldiers on duty or not for injuries caused in the armed forces.
According to a 1950 Supreme Court decision, the Feres Doctrine, the Federal Government is not responsible for injuries sustained by active staff.
"The alleged harm is inherent in the military service of the complainants" indicate the documents.
The Department of Defense refused to make any comments.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women still do not officially have the right to go to combat, this distinction is written only on paper: the front lines of recent wars are rarely only masculine.
In Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of women soldiers are playing an increasingly important role, especially in reaching out to local women.
As a result, 150 women soldiers lost their lives - two thirds in combat situations.
It's time for the army to modernize, says Susan Burke.
She is not alone in this fight: three more trials are under way in addition to her own.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Service Centre is preparing a case against the four major military academies for allegedly encouraging a misogynistic atmosphere.
On the other hand, the non-profit foundation Vietnam Veterans of America is preparing a trial against the army, focusing on the diagnoses of "personality disorders " attributed to rape victims in order to give them leave - a relatively ordinary fact, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwaru of the Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
His group filed a lawsuit with the Veterans Administration in December, accusing them of discriminatory practices in dealing with claims for benefits for persons claiming to have been victims of sexual assault in the service.
Nine independent bills were presented to Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing various solutions.
In 2010, 3,158 sexual assaults were recorded according to the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office of the Department of Defense.
But it is well known that the number of sexual assaults is underestimated. Indeed, according to the Pentagon's own estimate, this figure represents about 13.5% of the 19,000 incidents that year.
The report published in March also examines the percentage of prosecutions: in 2010, 20% of cases registered in the army were prosecuted - half the percentage of the civil justice system.
The complainants in Susan Burke's case describe their aggression as the first in a series of traumas.
In Lyman's case, she informed the military police of the rape less than an hour after the incident.
That night, she said, she was asked to tell 11 times in detail about her rape to various police officers, doctors and commanders.
She suffered a "rape kit" (literally a rape kit), and her attacker's blood - due to a cut in her arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Elizabeth Lyman sat before a judge at a trial in which she was questioned about her sexual relations with her boyfriend earlier on the day of her assault.
Six persons testified as witnesses of morality for the perpetrator, who eventually was acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was delivered," says Elizabeth Lyman.
"I thought I was going to start having contractions. I started screaming after the court."
"I was placed in a psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember saying to my commander, "It wasn't his trial, it was mine."
Elizabeth Lyman was forced to consult a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed a personality disorder, making her unfit for duty.
In January 2010, she was dismissed under less than honourable terms, preventing her from receiving any benefit.
Whether or not the Lyman case and the other complainants will move forward is a long story, says John Turley, Professor of Law at the University of Washington's Faculty of Law.
However, he points out, "In my opinion, they should be able to move forward."
Only this doctrine criticized since its introduction lies between them and a verdict.
I've always criticized the Feres doctrine.
The army is decades behind because it does not have the same advantages and means of deterrence as responsibility.
"The odds are heavy against them... but it is important that they try," he adds.
These things change only when the good ones have the will to fight.
If the trial does not turn in their favor, Susan Burke, the plaintiffs' lawyer, will gather her hundreds of other complainants for further trials.
"We will continue to fight the army on this issue until there is reform," she says.
Where until we die, either of the two options.
Walls have eyes: researchers study you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the far right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was a simple guy reporting his anti-immigration opinions online.
Monday, Breivik, who admitted to having been taken from a deadly madness in Norway in July leaving 77 victims, was confronted with his first trial.
While Breivik acted alone, he was far from being on cyberspace: he had spent much of the time before the attack on his computer, talking with some of the millions of nationalists who support extreme right-wing groups on social media sites.
After this summer's tragedy, researchers want to know more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easy... sign in to Facebook.
"We realized that it wasn't so hard to find them," says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a report recently published by the DEMOS think tank on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook is full of personal information, says Jamie Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the site's advertising tool to find the people they're looking for with scientific precision - the way marketers have been doing it for years.
Jamie Bartlett's team discovered that half a million members are fans of extreme right-wing groups in Europe. She targeted them with ads, but instead of linking them to a new group or product, the ads invited users to answer an inquiry. The questions asked concerned their level of education, attitudes to violence and optimism about their own future.
By coming into contact with these people through Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview 10,000 supporters of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries - without leaving the office.
"It's a new way of doing research," says Jamie Bartlett.
Some results are not surprising at all: online supporters of right-wing groups are rather men, young people and against immigration.
But surprisingly, "those who associate online and offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who remain behind their computer screen."
DEMOS's study is just one example of how Facebook has become the new tool in the hands of scientists.
Reflection groups, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study all topics that affect health issues such as social trends, thanks to "I love", wall publications and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding on average three content per day, the "data supernova" generates an explosion in research, increasing the number of research works whose site name appears in the title by almost 800% compared to the last five years.
For some researchers, the advantage of Facebook is that it allows you to study people you couldn't approach on the street.
"Before, when you tried to investigate the people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You were supposed to go to the party, but they would never have let you in," says Jamie Bartlett.
"Facebook avoids all this - you have direct access to their information."
Others say that the site could provide a way to identify and address health and social problems.
According to a recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and his colleagues, young students who spoke on Facebook about their drunken exploits were far more likely to be alcoholic than discreet students in this regard.
Megan Moreno suggests that students' colleagues, such as counselors, could monitor the site and intervene to eventually help a student whose status would all too often speak of alcohol.
"You can't deal with a problem if you don't diagnose it," Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Megan Moreno and director of the Centre for Children's Health, Behaviour and Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle, says the Washington Post.
"We know how to identify children at risk, and who would otherwise not be recognized."
Facebook also constantly accesses the information of its users.
The data team of the site studied statistics on Valentine's Day and Valentine's Day, the participation rate in the 2010 mid-term elections, and a national happiness index (thanks to information only available - digital freedom champions have long argued that the site could make its data treasure available to other people for research purposes).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not - in exchange for being able to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of kilometers away, the site is allowed to access your information.
But what happens when Facebook users are part of a survey they haven't even heard about?
While researchers have well-defined instructions on how to collect information other than via the Internet, there is something else online.
"I don't think a lot of users have ever thought about whether a researcher can study their profile," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, according to a 2006 study he conducted by observing the Facebook walls of his students.
"As far as they know, the exchanges were only seen by their friends."
Then comes the question of methodology.
Even without going through the Internet, there is no guarantee that the subject of a study is completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know the degree of truth of a profile or on a user's wall.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do in reality are two totally different things," says Neil Selwyn.
That is why, despite his experience as a technology researcher, Neil Selwyn believes that a notepad and a pen remain the best tools that can be used.
"Nothing can replace the real world and contact with people," he says.
"Social studies are supposed to address the social aspect - and social is not in front of a computer."
"Froid and inhumane": first appearance of Anders Behring Breivik
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who admitted having organized the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a "resistance" fighter during his first appearance at the trial in Oslo.
"I am a military commander of the Norwegian resistance movement and the Norwegian Templars," he explains in front of a courtroom filled with 500 people.
"As far as the jurisdiction of the court is concerned, I reject it, because you hold your mandate as organizations supporting an ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I recognize the facts, but I don't plead guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he "did not want to give him the opportunity to use this trial to express his views."
For the same reason, he refused to leave Breivik, who brought with him a paper speech, talking to the victims' parents at the end of the hearing.
Judge Nesheim also asked the police to keep Breivik in detention for another 12 weeks, forbade him to talk to the media for four weeks and warned him that the authorities would closely monitor all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
Some 30 parents of survivors and victims were present at the hearing.
Some came hoping to look Breivik in the eyes, others to make sure he would be placed behind bars.
All participated in the hearing in order to see the end of the trial.
"I found it cold and inhuman" declared a survivor of Utoya on Norwegian television channel NRK.
"I wasn't comfortable, but I personally made some progress after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Dressed in a dark suit and a blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the trial. He looked journalists and survivors in the eyes as he came in and out of court.
Despite the strange idea that Breivik belongs to a vast movement of "resistance", the judge determined that he was not crazy. He also stated that there is no evidence that he acted with accomplices.
The attacks of July 22 therefore seem to be the work of an extremist rather than an entire group of radicals, which may comfort some of them.
But this does not reduce the grief or confusion felt by the whole nation.
"I would have preferred him to look like a monster, but that's not the case," said a relative of a victim.
"It would have been a lot easier."
7 lessons from Steve Jobs's lost interview at the cinema this week
After Steve Jobs died on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford - distinguished by the technical genius and inventor of modern computing.
But what Apple fans can find most revealing in a recently found Steve Jobs interview and which will be broadcast this week as the first part of a film in the major markets, is how much this creative spirit had understood the processes and workflows of the products.
He was undoubtedly a creator and a dreamer. He identified himself with a hippie but was also very meticulous and organized, as well as an organigramme enhancer - a man who believed that many business leaders suffered from a "disease letting them think that a brilliant idea makes 90% of the work... [but] a considerable amount of manual work separates a brilliant idea from an exceptional product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely was developing the television series "Triumph of the Nerds". This series traces the birth of the computer, and he sits for more than an hour with Steve Jobs for a long and rare conversation.
At that time, Steve Jobs had had to leave Apple for about 10 years. He was already working hard on his new NeXT computer company, aimed at popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of the interview with Cringely is used in Nerds, he states that the main copies have disappeared in the transport.
It was only after Steve Jobs died that a full video was found in the director's garage.
This video, slightly reassembled, is the basis of the 68-minute film Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which will be broadcast at the cinema next Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known to hate in-depth interviews, Steve Jobs here seems surprisingly excited to expose technological philosophies and his business strategies.
And incredibly attentive.
On four different points during the interview, the answers come a long time after the questions - between 10 and 15 seconds of reflection, during which Steve Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts, in order to provide a precise answer.
There are also moments when Steve Jobs' perfectionism is resurfacing, where he seems eager to hear Cringely's questions, giving him elbow strokes to speed him up and move on to more important questions or subjects.
Filmed before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone, we find a strangely prescient aspect on Lost Interview. Steve Jobs evaluates what he considers to be good or bad in other companies and shares his own vision on the future of computer science.
It's one thing to read the posthumous assessments of Steve Jobs' career, but there's something raw and inspiring about the man we see here, the anxious dreamer on the eve of greatness.
He has a vision of how things can and should be.
He explains them and then implements them.
Here is a quick summary of seven remarkable sequences of Lost Interview:
How he learned to run a business:
"During all these years, I have always asked: 'Why do you do things?' and the answers are constantly the same: 'oh, just because you have to do them.'"
No one knows why, no one is thinking deeply about things in a company.
That's what I found out.
Steve Jobs continues to provide details on his efforts to simplify accounting at Apple.
Perplexed as to how the costs were recorded - we often start with a "standard cost" assessed at the sight of the nose, then adjusted with a "variation" - he developed an automated plant that guaranteed the precise calculation of the commercial costs.
On the opportunity to play a tour of the Pope:
Steve Jobs tells the anecdote of the "Blue Box" he created with Steve Wozniak - a device that was used to hack telephone networks and telephone for free in long distance.
The aircraft was the subject of many prior writings, but Steve Jobs' euphoria here in his description of the Blue Box as an act of appropriation is contagious.
He describes how he and Wozniak tested the box using a public telephone, making a call and then connecting from one AT&T network to another while bypassing as many satellites as possible.
"We wrapped the ball of different things half a dozen times and you screamed in the pay phone and it happened to you a minute later on the pay phone next door," explains Jobs laughing.
"We were young and thanks to this Blue Box, we learned that we could create something ourselves that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world."
We didn't know much about each other, but we did invent a little thing that could control great things. It was an incredible lesson, and I don't think that Apple would ever have existed without it.
Steve Jobs continues by telling a wonderful tour that he and Wozniak have developed: he telephoned the Vatican with the Blue Box in the middle of the night by posing as Henry Kissinger and asked to speak to the Pope.
While several members of the Catholic hierarchy are summoned in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two accomplices go mad laughing just before the Pope himself is awakened.
About his love of technology (and the distinction of Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, when hunting for spare parts to produce a frequency meter, he looked for Bill Hewlett's number in the directory and phoned him.
Shortly after their 20-minute conversation, Steve Jobs obtained a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"It had a remarkable influence on me. It was the only company I had seen at that age and it formed my definition of a company and how employees are treated."
Steve Jobs later became one of the HP employees to visit the company's research laboratories in Palo Alto, where he discovered the "first desktop ever designed."
He was as big as a suitcase, he had a little cathodic tube, and I fell in love with him.
The teenager I was went back to HP and started writing programs for this machine.
On the improvisation of innovation:
At several moments in the interview, Steve Jobs talks about inventing new products on a head start.
At the beginning of his career, while he settled in to sell some printed circuit boards, a client asked him to assemble a complete computer.
Working only 30 days' credit, he had to take care of the assembly as well as the delivery of finished appliances.
Later, at Apple, he remembers the difficulties encountered in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember some big fights... they yelled at me saying it would take me five years [to make a mouse that would cost $300]. I had enough, I went out and went to see a designer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could make for $15 and that was incredibly reliable.
On large firms that are short of breath:
Long before he revived Apple, Steve Jobs had anticipated how many industrial leaders would be wrong and lose control of their market share.
"Let's say you work at IBM or Xerox, you make a better copier or a better printer, and then?"
You have the monopoly of the market, so the company is no more successful.
Sales and marketing can change it, so [it is these types of people] who end up leading companies and the specialized personnel in product are put away from decision-making.
The product genius that led to this monopoly position is completely rotten by people who can't imagine designing a good product compared to a bad product - the required manual work.
That's what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
She could have made ten times her current size. Xerox would have been the Microsoft of the 90s...
They took the defeat out of victory.
On innovation as an artistic form:
"A huge part of manual work separates a brilliant idea from an exceptional product... as you develop this idea, it changes and grows."
You learn a lot about his subtleties.
There are compromises to make... some things you can't do, the electrons can, the glass, the robots, the factories can.
You have to keep thousands of things in mind (these concepts) by putting them together.
Finally, the decisions are made by personal taste. It is about trying to expose you to the best products that men have created, and trying to bring these things to the product you create.
Picasso once said that good artists copy and that great artists steal.
We are always ashamed to steal excellent ideas.
This is partly what makes Macintosh exceptional. The people who worked on it were musicians, poets, zoologists, historians, who simply proved to be the best computer scientists in the world.
If it wasn't for computer science, they would have done extraordinary things in another field.
Scalia and Thomas have dinner with health law opponents as the court meets
The day when the Supreme Court met in private to discuss the issue of political discord, whether the opposition to President Obama's health law would be heard, two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were observed at a dinner sponsored by the law firm that would defend the case before the High Court.
The event was held last Thursday, when the nine judges met for a conference to discuss petitions for consideration.
One of the cases in question concerned a trial by 26 states challenging the ambitious health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that has been a rallying point for conservative activists at the national level.
The judges agreed to hear the complaint, in fact, a monumental argument of 5:30 am is expected in March, and the result will probably be such as to promote the destabilization of the 2012 presidential race, which will be in full swing at the time the court's decision is rendered.
The lawyer who will stand before the court and argue against the denial of the law is likely to be Paul Clement, who served as Solicitor General of the United States during the administration of George W. Bush.
Clément's law firm, PLLC Bancroft, was one of two dozen firms that helped sponsor the Federalist Society's annual dinner, a long-standing group dedicated to upholding conservative legal principles.
Another firm that sponsored dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another promoter was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, which presents a huge financial stake in the outcome of the dispute.
Dinner was held at a Washington hotel a few hours after the court conference on the case.
Among other things, Mitch McConnell, the Senate's top Republican and declared opponent of the health law.
Star guests at dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is not new: the two judges were present at the events of the Federalist Society for years.
And there's nothing against the rules of ethics.
In fact, judges are exempted from the code of conduct that governs the actions of federal judges.
If they were, they would no doubt argue by the Code of Canon 4C, which states: "A judge may attend fund-raising of law-related and other organizations even though the judge cannot be an intervener, a guest of honor, or appear on the agenda of such an event".
Nevertheless, the mere presence of Scalia and Thomas close to two of the law firms in the case, as well as a company with a massive financial interest, was enough to alarm government ethics activists.
"This breach of ethics and superb indifference to the Code contradicts the statements of several judges that the Court respects the same rules applicable to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of Common Cause.
"The judges drank and had dinner and a gala fundraiser with lawyers who have cases pending before the court."
Their presence and participation in the fund-raising of this event disassembly any claims of impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas showed little respect for critics claiming that they too easily mix court affairs with the agenda of groups such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife, Ginni, is a conservative high-profile activist.
In addition, the Conservatives claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was a solicitor general for Obama's administration when the first objections to the law were brought to the court of first instance.
Her critics pressured Kagan to refuse to hear the case, saying that she had been too busy defending the law to be impartial.
Kagan gave no indication that she would.
Boeing records record order of $18 billion for line aircraft
The airline Emirates orders 50 Boeing 777, two-way aircraft, with the possibility to buy 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, an estimated market of over $1 billion.
There is nothing extraordinary about a company receiving an order covering 50 of its products.
However, it is quite a business when the company in question is the Boeing aircraft manufacturer and the amount of these 50 aircraft reaches the record amount of $18 billion.
Just as incredible is from whom Boeing received this order: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In forecasts published on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that the airlines in the Middle East will need in the next 20 years 2,520 aircraft with a total value of $450 billion.
During the weekend, Boeing informed about the most expensive commercial aircraft order in its history - 50 Boeing 777 bi-corrillos.
It was the Emirates airline based in Dubai that placed this pharaonic order.
Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Air Show that the airline is also likely to purchase 20 more aircraft, which would increase the total order amount to $26 billion.
On the other hand, Boeing indicated Monday that Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8, nicknamed Dreamliners, a model that flatters itself with significant fuel savings and amenities for passengers.
These six aircraft amount to more than $1 billion.
"This is clearly very positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, an analyst at Morningstar.
"These customers in particular have immense value."
In the Middle East, oil-producing countries have many of their airlines.
They therefore have not only the means to pay for these aircraft, but a rise in the price of fuel - usually detrimental to airlines because it represents their most important costs - would not be so harmful to them as the country would earn money with the rise in the price of oil.
This is an important point because these companies will be less likely than others to cancel or postpone their aircraft orders when oil prices rise, Dihora said.
"They have a natural risk cover," he said.
The Emirates command reinforces Boeing's dominance in the wholesale aircraft market and helps to curb the competitor's attempt to encroach on Airbus with its A350 aircraft.
Boeing's victory at the aircraft show comes four months after Airbus' announcement to postpone the beginnings of the biggest version of the A350, which competes directly with the Boeing 777-300ER.
Airbus is pushing back its beginnings to increase its momentum as customers demand it to increase its load capacity and autonomy.
Boeing's shares increased by 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexican President's sister clearly beaten in the election of Michoacán
Luisa Maria Calderon states that drug traffickers helped her opponent Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in the race for governorship.
President Felipe Calderon's sister seems to have lost her attempt to gain access to the governorship of Michoacán during violent elections, and she said Monday that drug traffickers favored one of her opponents.
The first results indicated that Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, was at the head of the race for the post of governor of this western state.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the voting process and in particular yesterday is an alarming fact, not only for the Michoacán but for the whole country," Luisa Maria Calderon reported on the radio during an interview on Monday following the elections.
"They threatened our candidates, our election agents... they took the ballot boxes, set up roadblocks... and forced people to vote" for the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seventy years until it lost the presidency in 2000.
But he organizes his return, and a victory in the Michoacán is an important step in this effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have distinguished only a few from Calderon, who was at the top of the polls before election day.
Calderon, candidate of his brother's Conservative Party, the National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as a winner.
Silvano Aureoles, left-wing candidate of the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, who currently holds the post of governor, came third, a painful defeat before the 2012 presidential elections for this divided and unhappy left.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the first results.
Vallejo, former mayor of Morelia, the state capital, denied any connection with drug traffickers and strongly advised other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in the trafficking of marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine.
This is President Calderon's home state, and he chose the Michoacán to launch a military offensive against the traffickers in December 2006.
Yet violence persisted.
A week before the elections a mayor of the PAN was murdered while campaigning for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates gave up the campaign locally for fear.
However, for the PRI, as corrupt as the election of the Michoacán looks, a victory will help the party in its momentum.
The man expected to represent the PRI in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think this victory is very encouraging in view of next year."
BASD strongly encourages Asia to support the euro area
The Asian Development Bank has asked India and China to prepare to help the euro area emerge from the sovereign debt crisis in order to avoid a long-term decline that would prevent the development of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, the Managing Director of the Manila-based BASD, said that the two fastest growing economic powers in the world had to "do everything in their power" to accelerate the recovery of the monetary zone through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He advised the BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India, China) not to look at Europe's difficulties with an "indifferent eye" and pointed out that Asian financial support alongside Europe's leaders and resources would avoid a long-term collapse of the world economy.
"We are all in this crisis together."
"Therefore anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis is useful," he told the Financial Times during an interview at the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asia can be protected to a certain extent, but it is not safe."
"So if China and India can help, there's nothing to stop them."
In recent months, the euro area has been seriously shaken by a sovereign debt crisis.
Recently, the cost of Italian borrowing was dangerously high and the Prime Ministers of Italy and Greece resigned.
The booming sovereign debt crisis in Europe has sparked fear that the world economy will return to recession, and has prompted the major emerging economies to come together to help the euro area find a solution.
Mr Nag took the position that the IMF would deliver all Asian aid, but he also said that this bilateral assistance - such as buying the obligations of the US financial rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Fund - offered greater bargaining power to Asia's partners in Europe.
Anand Sharma, Indian Minister of Trade and Industry, said that "India will do everything it can" to help the euro area as its own economy is now suffering from a decline in exports and a slowdown in foreign capital inflows.
"No one wants the euro area to remain unstable and agitated," he said.
"We have monumental challenges to face and we must maintain a high level of growth."
"It is not a choice, it is an imperative, because where would we find work for the tens of millions of our young men and women?"
Others argue that developing economies such as India should not help Europe's rich while facing their own major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said that it would be politically very difficult to get the 1.2 billion Indian people to accept aid to Europe, at least 800,000 of whom live on $2 a day or less.
"One day, they will discover that the Greeks retire at age 50 and go on vacation in the sun and they will have trouble swallowing it," he said.
Lee Howell, President of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India's reserves should be used to keep many well-paid Greek officials in poorly managed jobs that generate losses, as in the railway sector.
Mr Nag said that the euro area crisis was likely to cause "significant repercussions" across Asia.
BASD's forecasts of 7.5% economic growth in Asia in 2011/2012 now face "risks of loss" due to the European threat.
He noted that vulnerable emerging markets needed to "develop relief plans" to protect themselves from economic reversal and major capital flight.
Severe Pentagon Warnings on Potential Defence Reductions
The Secretary of Defense, Leon Panetta, put pressure on Congress on Monday, warning that the impending automatic budget cuts would undermine national security. He triggered a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon corridors to the battlefields of Afghanistan, through the gatherings of civilians.
The Pentagon is already making $450 billion in reductions for the next decade, but is now concerned that an additional $600 or more cuts will be imminent if Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending.
"The impacts of these reductions would be devastating to the department," Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, R-Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina.
He said that the failure of Congress to reach a resultant budgetary agreement in what is called sequestration would result in 23% reductions and the freezing of many new projects.
"Such a significant reduction, applied without discernment, would render most of our ships and construction projects unenforceable - you cannot buy three-quarters of a ship or building - and seriously undermine other modernization efforts," writes Panetta to senators.
"We would also be forced to separate from a number of our civilian personnel and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, we should almost certainly send civilians on unpaid leave to achieve the goal."
"These changes would shake the faith of those who support our military and seriously damage our preparation."
The reductions would eventually affect the combatant troops, continues Panetta.
"Although the wartime financing of foreign contingency accounts is not directly affected by the seizure, war efforts would be negatively affected by serious disruptions in the core budgets," Panetta warned.
"Contracting personnel would be reduced, leading to delays in contracts and supervision of contracts that support war."
"The staff managing wages would be reduced, leading to delays in payment to war suppliers, and legal and political support would be disrupted."
Both senators had written to Panetta 10 days earlier, asking for details on the potential impact of automatic compressions on the Ministry of Defence.
"The consequence of a seizure of the Department of Defense would have triggered a rapid decline of the United States as the undisputed world leader of military power."
"We are fiercely opposed to this draconian action," Senators said in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when Panetta's letter was published.
"It's not a consequence that we can live with, and it's certainly not what we should impose on ourselves."
"Sequestration is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and it should not have to happen."
Whether Panetta's letter and recent warnings from senators increase the pressure for a budget compromise or a call to exempt the Pentagon from reductions, remains to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly virulent about possible compressions, even though he himself has reached the Pentagon's highest post with years of budget expertise at Congress and the White House and knowing that he was faced with difficult choices.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defense painted a dark picture of what might happen - a soldier with a shell, but no nucleus.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a bulletless brigade."
"It's a fighter plane, without enough trained pilots."
"It is a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs that do not have enough trained soldiers capable of carrying out the mission," Panetta said in his preliminary remarks to the Pentagon.
"It is a depressed, poorly prepared and unable to deal with potential opponents."
"Indeed, she calls for aggression."
In an addendum to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta specifically stated how further reductions could "create significant operational risks: time to respond to crises, conflicts and disasters; severe limitations on our ability to deploy and engage in the world; and assumed unacceptable risk in future combat operations."
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defence projects could go to the cut-off, including those already tested and some just in the early stages of planning.
This list included the Fighter F35 Joint Strike, a new planned bomber, the new generation ballistic submarine, the new coastal combat ship and the new field vehicle, which would replace the Army and Navy Humvee.
Ending the development and testing of the F35 could generate $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but its supporters say it is an essential step in improving and responding to potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to detect a lie
A look at recent headlines indicates how much deception and lies are omnipresent in everyday life.
The Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging allegations of sexual harassment with several women; each side accusing the other of lying.
The Penn State administrators were accused of perjury for allegedly covering reports that a retired football coach sexually assaulted boys.
Last week French President Nicolas Sarkozy was taken by an open microphone stating to US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
The lie destroyed careers and convulsed countries.
Congressman Anthony Weiner of New York and Internet celebrity Anthony Weiner went for an idiot by quickly emitting denials contradicted by irrefutable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards was charged with violations of the funding of campaigns related to the coverage of an extramarital relationship.
And then, none of the people who have lived through history will ever forget the media circus that President Bill Clinton set up when he lied during his second term about his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky.
The stories of cheating at school and university tests are legion.
There have been cases where teachers gave the test answers to students in order to get a good look at their performance evaluations.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send the message that lying and cheating are acceptable.
How much deception do we encounter?
On a given day, studies show that you can hear 10 to 200 lies.
In fact, many of these are godly lies.
Another study showed that foreigners lie three times in the first 10 minutes of their encounter.
Detection or detection of lies is an essential competence that everyone must acquire, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a social game similar to, say, charades, where the goal is to cry out: "I had you", the detection of deception is a serious branch of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades in prestigious universities that have conducted in-depth research of such projects, especially in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the research is that the oldest myths about the lie have been demystified.
The liars look you in the eye.
They don't stutter, blush, or get agitated all the time.
Do not conclude that liars are difficult to detect and difficult to uncover.
A qualified lie detector can discover the truth by examining the structure of the statement, facial micro-expressions, question formation and response time.
I have spent several years examining scientific results in the vast body and always emerging from knowledge about deception, and it is clear that the detection of deception is a modern skill that is easy to learn and useful to navigate in our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring, interviews, negotiation or management.
Good liars are able to read well others, making them comfortable, managing their own emotions and intuitively detecting how others perceive them.
We know from research that extraverts lie more than introverts, that men tell more lies "centered on them" while women tell more lies "centered on others" - usually to protect someone's feelings - than married people lie less often to their partners than unmarried people (but the lies they tell tend to be huge).
We also know that if you are perceived as an unbeliever, others will feel less guilty of lying to you.
How can you tell if someone's lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of your subject.
That's what we call "setting the benchmark data."
This helps to provide a benchmark for measuring future changes.
Observe the posture of your subject, laughter, voice quality.
You need to know if someone normally shakes his feet permanently so as not to make unfair accusations when you see him shaking his feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for clues of verbal and nonverbal misleading behaviors.
Consider these clues red flags, not evidence of deception.
Deceptive people can immobilize the top of the body when they try to remember their story, they can point their feet towards the door, lean towards an exit, change posture significantly or present a relief of "post-interview" - an exaggerated sigh of relief, a change of posture when all difficult questions have passed.
Interrogators often falsely indicate that the interview is completed just to try to trigger the post-interview reaction.
Also, pay attention to the vocabulary of your subject.
The famous Scott Peterson slipped past while claiming that his murdered wife was alive, triggering a national search to find her.
Deceptive individuals can also use distanced language: "I have not had sex with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or completely repeat a difficult question.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "wood tongue" when answering a difficult question: "Well... to tell you the truth... if I remember correctly... to my knowledge."
This makes the answer perceptual rather than factual and is often a red flag.
There is no magic formula for the detection of lies, but the development of skills to recognize deception is possible.
These skills will improve the chances of anyone avoiding victimization by scammers in their professional and personal lives.
The controversial pipeline plan will be diverted after the threat of late US approval
A few days after Obama's administration threatened to delay the approval of an oil pipeline project between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico - raising the anger of the unions while at the same time calming the environmentalists - the company seeking to build the oil pipeline says it is ready to redirect the project to the rails.
TransCanada said Monday evening that it will move the projected pipeline out of the ecologically sensitive area of the Nebraska dunes, and is confident that the project will still gain its approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Nebraska Capitol.
TransCanada's official, Alex Pourbax, says the company remains confident that it will eventually get approval from an oil pipeline, but with a different route.
This follows the announcement by the State Department last week that it would delay its decision to grant a federal permit for the project until it receives further studies of potential routes to avoid the areas of the Nebraska dunes and the Ogallala aquifer, large groundwater sources.
"It's a real way forward," says Lee Terry, a Nebraska Republican at Fox News.
The new environmental review commissioned by the State Department would probably have rejected any decision until 2013, after next year's elections, although officials deny the involvement of policy in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the State Department's decision, and expressed his support for it.
The 2,735 km pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would transport 700,000 barrels a day from the province of Alberta to the refineries in Texas.
To do so, it would need to cross six States.
He is hated by ecologists, but loved by working groups, who have put their money on the estimated 20,000 jobs linked to the pipeline.
But the Nebraska legislators opposed this plan put pressure on a law to force the removal of the Sand Hills area and the Ogallala aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The Department of State's ongoing environmental impact study found that the project would only pose limited negative environmental impacts, but the energy industry stated that the Department's Inspector General ordered a separate investigation of the review process, focused on two issues.
One is that a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a campaign advisor to Hillary Clinton in 2008, would be a conflict of interest to the program.
The other is whether a company that was hired to conduct the initial study was an inappropriate choice because of its relationship with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle prosecuted for allegedly causing a young child to vomit out of fear
A family in New York City claim that the Disco Patti LaBelle Diva launched in a violent outburst in the lobby of their Manhattan building, terrified their little girl to the point where she threw up in fear.
The "Lady Marmalade" singer's career frightened little 18-month-old Geneviève Monk, to the extent that she suffered "changes of personality, sleep disorders" and "increased fear of strangers," her family said during the Manhattan Supreme Court trial.
It was November 10th of last year when stage technician Kevin Monk, his wife in kindergarten, Roseanna, and Geneviève were preparing to go on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was picking up the car, Roseanna Monk went down into the lobby of their Riverside Boulevard building with their luggage, carrying Geneviève in her arms.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped by the door and laid her daughter for a while.
"Someone came behind me and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said "yes" and I went to get her," she said.
LaBelle admonished the pregnant woman with anger.
"She said to me in an aggressive tone, "You shouldn't leave your daughter by the door," says Roseanna Monk.
"I said, "What you say or think I'm not interested in."
She became angry and began to use vows - the word "" and the word "" in a loud voice...
She had a bottle of water and started spraying me with water from the bottle.
She said that at this point, Geneviève became hysterical.
"I said to this woman, "Look what you did to my daughter," said the child's mother.
LaBelle threw herself at the mother - who was still holding Geneviève in her arms - and had to be held by her entourage who drove her to a car waiting for them, says Roseanna Monk.
The little girl was crying so hard that she started throwing up, she adds.
Later, the family sent a note asking for LaBelle's apology, but did not get any answers.
The lawyer and LaBelle representatives did not return our calls to comment.
The complaint claims unspecified damages, but family lawyer Sam Davis stated that he took the case free of charge and that the family is considering donating all the money received to a charity work against cancer for children.
"The goal is to hold Patti LaBelle responsible for his conduct," said Mr. Davis.
"This kind of behavior is totally unacceptable, especially to a kindergarten teacher with an 18-month-old child."
Climate adversity has slowed the economy
In the first year of management of Mario López Valdez, in Sinaloa unemployment and informality have increased, foreign investment has declined and the economy has contracted
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of government of Mario López Valdez, self-called of change, which has generated great expectations regarding the advances of the economy, but given the climate adversity of the beginning of the year, the increase is not observed, in exchange there is a deterioration of the main indicators of economic development.
The low temperatures of February, apart from causing losses of billions for the agricultural sector, limited the possibilities of the state economy for growth, caused a contraction in economic activity in general by 3.6 per cent in the first half of the year, mainly justified by the historic 31.16 per cent decline in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of the other economic sectors.
According to the gelatin allocation report from the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, there were 582 million 835 hectares of crop damage, 78.03 per cent of which suffered total damage and the rest 21.07 per cent suffered partial damage, while the main crops affected were vegetables, corn and chickpeas.
The decline in economic activity has led to a steady increase in unemployment in the State until November, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the rate of unemployment of the State during the first three quarters of the year has been observed an accelerated increase, because during January to March 55 thousand 053 Signoons were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 per cent of the Active Economic Population, in the second quarter the rate has become 5.28 per cent and from July to September the average has continued to rise to 6.19 per cent, a rate that represents more than 74 thousand Signoons unemployed, an increase from the first half of 18 thousand 969 persons.
Less liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, according to economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly according to the actions carried out by public policy.
"What we see is an increase in unemployment that is due to various factors, among which the loss of liquidity in the market due to a restriction of resources by the legislation approved in Congress to combat money laundering, because for people who earn dollars illegally it is not easy for them to work to earn them, to invest them and use them in something," he says.
Migration in detention
López Cervantes reported that the rise in unemployment is also due to a demographic factor.
"The number of people leaving the state to work abroad in the United States has been limited, first because of the difficulties of entry and secondly because when they enter the state they already have a lot of difficulties in finding work, these people stay here and ask for sources of work, which means that unemployment is rising," he said.
Lack of seriousness
The analysis of the Danish labour market is aggravated by the high level of lack of seriousness which predominates between working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 per cent of the population employed in this state work there without contributing as a worker to any social insurance institution.
Apart from unemployment and lack of seriousness, another reason for the state's shift is low wages, the entity has the lowest wages in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Institute of Social Insurance and the Secretariat of Labour and Social Planning.
The average monthly earnings of the workers in Denmark were, until September, 5 thousand 352 pesos, well below the national average, which is 7 thousand 375 pesos.
FDI contraction
Apart from the decline in economic activity and the rise in unemployment, in 2011 there was the largest reduction in Foreign Direct Investment over the past 10 years, according to the Economy Secretariat from January to June, the State's FDI reached $630 thousand,697, a decrease of 87.74 per cent from the $5,143,312 recorded in the same period of the previous year.
In turn, the Secretariat for Economic Development of the Government of the State accounts for a total investment of 17,280 trillion pesos per year, registered mainly by companies in the tertiary sector.
Debt
Given the economic contraction scenario, in July the Government of the State requested the approval of a 3 trillion peso credit for investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, with the aim of reactivating the economy, the approval of the State Congress was 2,600 trillion peso, and until November no debt benefits were observed in any sector of the State economy.
Reactions
For representatives of the employers' sector, Mario López Valdés' first year of government demonstrates a lack of management capacity of the Government.
Miguel Loredo López, President of the National Chamber of Transformation Industry, said that in 2011 there was no harmonization of the will of the various sectors, including the Government of the State.
"The return on Sinaloa's economy this year was really very poor, we have to work hard to get back the ground we lost this year, in 2012 we have to double our efforts, we have to align the effort of everyone and above all the already synchronised good work of this new government team, hopefully next year will be much better," he said.
Economic slowness
Loredo López stated that events such as the frosts of the beginning of the year have retained the state economy and restricted its performance and growth.
"The low economic flow is produced by several events, including frost, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that does not turn fast enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows to have an acceptable level of flow in trials, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year we close much below the expectations we had," he says.
Redefine vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confederation of Patrons of the Mexican Republic of Sinaloa said that we want to channel the state towards productive activities of more dynamism.
"In general terms we have observed that we have worked, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term programme that redefines the vocation and economic direction of the State, because it is important that we detonate the full potential of Sinaloa's material and human resources," he says.
A lot to do
The President of the Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision of the future that better channels the efforts of the Government.
"In general terms, I would say that the Government has made efforts to deliver good results in different areas, in terms of economic development there are some advances, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown progress in the management of public policy.
"There are elements that allow us to say that the Government is more inclusive, what I can say is that a lot of work has been done and the Government is aware of the fact that there is still a lot to do," he says.
Sentenced for 8 kilos of marijuana
One person residing in Novolato was sentenced to five years' imprisonment and 100 days' fine for possession of eight kilos of marihuana.
The Attorney General of the Republic has informed that the small dealer convicted is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for an offence against health, in his variant of possession of marihuana for sale.
According to file AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by Mexican Army agents on 7 June 2010 during a surveillance operation on Cipriano Valdez Street, in front of number 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The small dealer was circulating in a white pick-up truck, in which he carried a black bag in the trunk of the vehicle and on the co-pilot's place a small backpack where the soldiers found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the confiscated elements were made available to the Second Judge of the District and the convicted person is still in the Centre for the Execution of Legal Consequences of Crimes.
Debts towards contributions to works
Social works included in programmes such as Habitat, Rescue of Public Spaces and 3x1 paramigrants may not be completed where there are serious delays due to lack of economic resources, reported Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The Director of Municipal Social Development said that although construction programmes have progressed so far, they are at risk because the Government of the State has not fulfilled its obligations to provide contributions that exceed 11 million pesos in all three programmes.
He noted that in total, the investment of these three programmes is approximately 50 million pesos, of which the State must provide 25 per cent and so far only the Federation and the Municipality have provided resources for the works, therefore there is the possibility of a delay in their finalization.
"They have to make a contribution of 12 million and despite the fact that the year will soon end they have given us nothing, even if since July they had to give us a part of it," he says, "and we, in order not to record delays, have started the works and we have made a lot of progress, but we need money".
He mentioned that last year, during the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the state had not paid the corresponding contributions, therefore at the beginning of the administration the municipality had to apply for a credit to cover the 7 million that the state administration had not provided on that occasion.
"We had already experienced this in the previous six-year period because the state had not had the economic capacity to participate and the programs continue to work and this year we, in order to have access to these programs, had to obtain the resources to cover what the state had not paid for," he said.
Despite the fact that there was a commitment on the part of the State authorities to provide these resources, he stated that they had requested the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to activate management so that the corresponding percentages would arrive as soon as possible.
"They have to provide almost 12 million and despite the fact that the year is coming to an end, they have given us nothing."
The Court validates "analogue cut" in Mexico in 2015
Substitution of analog signals with digital is one of the most important changes the world has experienced in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) rejected the constitutional controversies that the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies have formulated against the presidential decree that advances the so-called "analogue coupure" from 2021 to 2015, because the eight votes necessary to invalidate it have not been gathered.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his responsibilities when he issued the decree detailing the actions to be taken to implement the transition to digital terrestrial television.
With this result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic was rejected for failing to reach a qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to rule on the constitutionality or non-constitutionality of the decree, and this continues to be in force.
The draft sentence, prepared by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed the declaration of the decree as non-constitutional, because the regulation of radio and television is a statutory assignment to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of hierarchical subordination and reservation of law.
In favour of the draft voted only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero themselves.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies have promoted two constitutional controversies to challenge the decree and by admitting the complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero has suspended the application of the decree and all the actions planned by it for the digital transition.
The plenary session of the Ministers also decided to reject the complaint made by the Chamber of Deputies, without discussing the project for which Minister Sánchez Cordero is also responsible.
In his intervention, the Minister-President said that he disagreed with the project's arguments, in the sense that the federal executive cannot structure measures through general standards for the public administration to prepare for them.
"I do not consider that this would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body", and he recalled that public policy planning in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the Federal Executive, which has as its constitutional mandate the management of the State.
Substitution of analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has undergone in recent years and this results in better exploitation of the radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
To postpone change, he said, would be to postpone the benefits of digitisation, which implies a decision of public interest that does not only have a technical dimension, "because it also includes economic, social, political and national security issues".
These questions, he stressed, "requires the operation of an entire system to establish, in accordance with the principle of economic direction of the State, a group of attributions that the Constitution grants to the State Executive".
He recalled that many countries around the world have already completed the digital transition and have done so through the Executive, despite the fact that they have highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, by issuing the contested decree, has in a form invaded the sphere of competence of the Congress, because it ensures in the administrative sphere the respect of the laws issued by the Legislature, he asserts.
Analysis of the possibility of a "vote by vote" count in Michoacán
According to the data shown by PREP, the difference between first and second place in the governor's election is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to the 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total minutes.
The possibility of the "vote-by-vote" count is a reality with regard to the electoral process this year in Michoacán, where according to the data evidenced by the Preliminary Electoral Results Program (PREP) the difference between the first and second places of the governor's election is only 27 percent, even without accounting for the votes corresponding to the 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total minutes.
In this sense, the president of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on 9 November, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines to harmonize local standards with the federal electoral reform.
It will be recalled that Michoacán did not approve his Political Constitution or Electoral Code of State or Electoral Justice Act, while the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the end of the legal period for this electoral process to enter into force and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel failed to publish it within the time limits provided for in the Law of the Official Journal of the State, with the argument that he had some objections.
On the same 9th November, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional controversy promoted by the Local Legislature and qualified as "invalid and illegal" the vote of the state representative for constitutional reforms, because he does not have the right to "sanction or challenge them".
Interviewed on the possibility of "vote by vote", María de los Ángeles Llanderal said that thanks to the approval of the corresponding guidelines by the General Council of IEM it will be possible to realize the partial and total counts of the votes by the local electoral body.
Thus, the partial counting of votes, of one or more electoral packages, it may be that: the results of the minutes do not coincide; there is no record of the vote and there is no record of the vote in the ballot box; or there are obvious errors or alterations in the minutes.
In addition, the total count of the votes received in all ballot boxes of the election may be made when there is an indication that the difference between the candidate who is supposed to be the winner of the election and the candidate who obtained the second place in the election is equal to or below a percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the session there is an express petition from the representative of the party and/or coalition who submitted the second of the nominated candidates.
The total count of the ballot may also be made if at the end of the common count it follows that the difference between the candidate presumed to be the winner and the candidate in second place is equal to or less than one percentage point, provided that there is an express petition from the representative of the political party whose candidate has emerged second, in which case electoral packages which have been the subject of the partial count will be excluded.
It should be mentioned that this is the situation of the election of Morelia, where according to the PREP, the difference between first and second place is only 0.16 percent, even without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total minutes.
His last will
Its ashes will be spread in the mountain range of Zapalinamé, the family confirms.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés will arrive in Saltillo, his hometown, this Sunday night, and on Monday people will present their tributes and there will be a mass of requiem.
According to his family, the last wish of the lieutenant colonel was for his ashes to be poured into the mountain range of Zapalinamé.
After receiving the tributes next to the other people died in the accident, the family of Bacio Cortés returned to the capital of Coahuila on board an aircraft of the Mexican Air Force, the closest ones attended the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At noon the lieutenant colonel's ashes arrived at the vigil chapel on Nazario Ortiz Garza Boulevard, where family and friends surrendered.
At 5:30 p.m., he was presented with tributes to the Saltillo Institute of Technology organized by his former colleagues in the Bachelor of Technology and the American football team of which Felipe Bacio was part when he was preparing for the Bachelor of Technology.
"He wanted to go back to Saltillo and that his ashes be poured into the mountain range of Zapalinamé, he always said this to his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, sister of the pilot.
For her, the Lieutenant-Colonel had realized all her dreams, she considers that he was at the fullness of his life, "he was successful, he was a father and son, extraordinary, a loving brother and cared much for his family".
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the city of Saltillo very young to register for the College of Air in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some people couldn't believe it, because they said he even had a truck; but he always followed his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio recalls that he was a very good person, "when he was in Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him, as was the occasion when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo".
The young man even remembers that when he was 7 years old he traveled to Zapopán for his parent's graduation, so he knows that his uncle died doing what he loved most in life: flying an aircraft.
His last farewell
With honors it was said goodbye to the Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, who led Governor Jorge Torres López, presented by the people and the Government of the State, the Mexican Army, through the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force, directors and students of the Technological Institute of Saltillo, where he studied in 1985 and distinguished himself both in studies and in sport.
Bacio Cortés died recently when the helicopter he was flying crashed, alongside the Secretary of the Government, José Francisco Blake Mora and another six people, all officials of this service.
The remains of the pilot Bacio Cortés born in Saltillo arrived (incinerated) at 18:05 hours to be handed over by the funeral to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, on the esplanade of the group, where he was expected by his family, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, brothers and other parents, students and teachers.
Three abandoned corpses, located in the property of Caderoyta NL
A few hours before being found, the military authority had brought before the media eleven persons who had been arrested in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crimes.
Three men were found shot to death in different parts of the body and with the coup de grace, in an abandoned property in the municipality of Caderoyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The discovery took place on the 1.5 km road from Caderoyta to Santiago, in the community known as El Castillo.
Some people who went through this place observed that in the property, whose fence has beige color and coffee the portal was wide open.
Looking inside, about three metres away, they located the bodies of three people, which is why they immediately informed the corresponding authorities.
One of the individuals wore a yellow T-shirt with dark jeans, without shoes; next to him there was another with a white T-shirt, with straps.
One metre away there was another individual's body with a red T-shirt and blue jeans.
The three were lying on the belly.
According to in situ data, the three people had been murdered in another location because no in situ casings were found.
In the closing of the property there were legends directed by a group of organized delinquency towards the other, apart from some bullet holes in it and in the portal.
11 captured in Cadereyta
The Secretary of National Defence introduced 11 persons, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group operating mainly in the municipality of Caderoyta and who are considered to be related to kidnappings, homicides, "halconeo" (surveillance) and clandestine burials.
According to published reports, in a first act on 11 November in the Los Alveros settlement, eight people were arrested and one person who had been deprived of liberty was saved.
They were confiscated three buildings and a cell phone; they claimed they were part of the criminal group called "Los Zetas".
In another fact that took place on November 12 at 06:00 hours, military personnel took a surveillance course in Rancho Viejo, Caderoyta, detecting a car without a license plate with two subjects on board.
By arresting them and carrying out an inspection, the military found a long weapon, a charger and 18 cartridges.
Later and after these statements, on 13 November at 2 p.m. one of his accomplices was arrested in La Frauda, when he tried to escape when he saw the military.
They are attributed clandestine burials in the municipalities of General Terán, China and Caderoyta.
The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday
The Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put this country on the brink of economic disaster
The Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet on Wednesday with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of economic disaster and put the entire Eurozone at risk.
A communiqué from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed Sunday, would meet Wednesday with the president, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that he can form the Government.
He is expected to present a majority cabinet composed of technocrats, even if it is not clear when the new executive will take office.
Monti said he was going to present to the president the outcome of his conversations with the political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," the former European Commissioner told journalists.
Monti did not say explicitly that he could form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles were overcome.
"The frame is now well mapped out," he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, in a shorter time than normal, while Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has pushed the costs of its debt to levels that cannot be sustained.
The new administration led by the former European Commissioner Monti must approve a tough package of austerity demanded by the European leaders to regain the confidence in Italy that had been affected.
By stressing the pressure on Monti to hurry, the instability of markets has placed the yield of Italian BTP bonds at 10 years above 7 per cent, the level at which Greece and Ireland have had to be saved.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian employer Confindustria, told the media after her meeting with Monti: "We said that we would support this government a lot".
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy to emerge from this emergency situation.
Monti's chances of success were greatly stimulated by the support of Silvio Berlusconi's PDL party, to which the crisis forced to resign last Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts will have a good result," Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party, told the press.
The support of PDL, the largest Italian party, is significant because so far many of its members had opposed the technocratic majority government that Monti forms.
Parliamentary support
Monti's new government must have strong parliamentary support to implement what is likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockage or delay in its efforts could provoke a new and devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks added itself to the pressure by observing that a bankruptcy of Monti would be a disaster.
Monti began his consultations with political parties, trade unions and employers' groups and youth and women's organizations on Monday.
He'll finish his meeting tour Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by Napolitano, who authorized an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief respite at the end of last week, when it was clear that Berlusconi was going to resign, Italian debt costs have now returned to critical levels between uncertainty about the success of the new Prime Minister.
Saving Italy, with a public debt of EUR 1.9 trillion, would be too much for the current financial defenses of Eurozone.
Monti said that his Government should persist until the upcoming elections, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians would only give it time to implement reforms before advancing the elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist that it should be formed only by specialists, an indication of their objections to a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources have reported that mutual mistrust and disagreement between parties complicates the attempt to include political figures.
The experience of the Spaniards is superior to that of the Costa Ricans
Of the 22 footballers called from Spain, ten participated in more than 50 international games.
On behalf of Costa Rica, only one of the 22 convoked participated in 50 meetings.
A huge contrast to that of Costa Rica, if we compare the 22 convoked by the two countries for today's friend, at 3:05 p.m., at Stade National de San José.
While the national and European champions, the number one in FIFA's monthly ranking, record a large register of class A inter-selection games, the Tricolore only has defender Michael Humana as the only one to have the 50 international matches.
This figure was reached last Friday in the match against Panama (0-2) on Rommel Fernández.
Spanish footballers who play in the League of Stars and in powerful clubs of the First League of England maintain an intense activity in the year in national league and cup championships and disputes in European Cups such as the Champions League.
To all this we must add the experience with Furia Espanola during the complicated playoffs of the European Cup and the World Cup.
Costa Rican footballers, on the contrary, have an international experience limited to an area, such as the Concacaf, which is considered to be a lower level in FIFA.
We see that the highest record of the Spanish Selection is that of goalkeeper Íker Casillas, who on the previous Saturday against England (defence 0-1 in London) equalled the record of former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international meetings.
Casillas will play against the Tricolore today and they will impose a new record for Spain, of 120 international games.
Xavi Hernandez, a brain-flying man from Barcelona, has 106.
Casillas and Xavi were even recognized the previous week by UEFA alongside the other centenaries of the Iberian team, Zubizarrata mentioned above with 126 and the Schalke's avant-centre, Raúl González, with 102.
Ready for the centenary figure is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
It is followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61; and David Silva, with 53.
On the Costa Rican side, and near Michael Umana are the left side Junior Díaz, with 48 presences and the beater Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five have exceeded the 30 matches: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least.
Those with less. With more than 30 presentations in Spain include Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 presences, Roy Miller appears with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest doesn't even reach 20.
While Nacho Moreal only has four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar only has one and Olman Vargas and Edder Nelson are still starting.
The historical scorer of Spain is David Villa, with 50 flies, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one who records the most, with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto has included the country in its turn to celebrate two decades of trajectory
"Going to Costa Rica is a dream that has become a reality"
In the exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament, from Pearl Jam, said the band is ready to offer one of its best concerts next Sunday on the National Stadium.
They have waited more than 20 years, but the group assures that for them it will also be a dream come true to occur in this country.
It is that bassist and founding member Jeff Ament assured, speaking exclusively with Viva, from Brazil, last week.
The group is on the South American wing of its two-decade work tour and Sunday 20 will make its only stopover in Central America.
That day they will present themselves on the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 pm, next to the Los Angeles group The X and the nationals of Las Robertas.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, the complete transcript of which is found in La Nación on the Internet.
For Costa Rican fans, the fact that Pearl Jam will happen in Costa Rica is a dream come true. Are you aware of what your fans are living?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream that has come true for us too.
This is our second time in South and Central America and so far it has been great.
I only spent in Costa Rica once the holidays; it's such a beautiful country and I think we can spend a few days there.
So we're excited to wear our music there.
I ask you, because there is a kind of devotion to the group, fans live intensely in the days before.
What is your message for your most fervent followers?
Thank you for staying with us for all these years.
It took 21 years for us to arrive in Costa Rica; thank you for waiting so long and we are sorry that so much time had to go through this concert.
Some people already say that his concert is the biggest show of the year.
Does this add some pressure to your visit.
Some of the biggest shows we've offered over the last 21 years have been held in the last two weeks.
We have offered Sao Paolo a huge two shows and we hope that this has put us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
We're really looking forward to it.
We love this country, we love surfing and the jungle; for both things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you discover Costa Rica and its waves to surf?
We have a lot of surfers friends and I have a very good friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves are amazing there.
My friends were always going surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, next to Mexico, are great places to surf; that's how we learned, through the people who love surfing.
When you saw the tour, you had offered huge shows, with lots of songs.
What have you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we never happened there, we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to make the best show possible, with a wide variety of songs; we will try to play two songs of each album and offer our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
What is the reason for this?
I think it's partly because we have nine records and we can play over 120 songs and everyone loves different songs, which is why it's very difficult to choose which songs to play each evening.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we haven't performed in a very long time, it helps us stay focused and surprises us because it reminds us of the reasons why we love these songs and that we may have forgotten.
It makes the show more interesting for us and therefore I think it also becomes more interesting for people.
With this tour, you celebrate 20 years of trajectory.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you've accomplished?
Yes, absolutely.
First of all, I don't think any of us imagined that we were going to form a big rock band, and the fact that we did it for more than 20 years makes it look like a dream.
We continue to tell our blessings and the fact that we can continue to make music together gives us a lot of emotion.
We love each other and love to create music.
We're lucky to go to places in the world we've always wanted to go to.
Things couldn't be better for us.
What does it mean for you to have been a fundamental element in the creation of the grunge?
It has always been an honour for us to form part of this group of large groups.
We are very friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
This is surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends and is uncommon.
From time to time, a group emerges from a city, but it is much more strange when five or ten groups come out of the same city at the same time.
We are proud and it is an honour for us to be part of the Seattle group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we participated in a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw in Soundgarden on their tour, so we're lucky to be friends with all of them again and it's an honor for us to be part of that Seattle sound that came out.
It is also very strange that a group like yours remains united and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, and only this is much longer than many groups normally last.
Firstly, I believe that we are all lucky to be still alive and, secondly, we are all concerned about others.
We are all close friends and thanks to this there are musical boulevards that give everyone freedom to experiment.
We have confidence in each other with each other's music and it couldn't be better.
Your relationship with the word celebrity has not been easy; however, thanks to your success, you have been able to do what you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we grew up, it was easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure that we don't spend too much time on tour because it's easy to fall into this game of great crowds and people who love your music.
If we don't forget that people are there for music, it helps us not to forget that we have to respect music and what has brought it, without thinking about the fact that we are famous and a rock star, which is not really interesting to any of us.
How do you remember your other project, Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote good songs and at first it was great.
We were a band for almost three years and did not release a record before Andy's death (Andrew Woods).
There was a lot of frustration about the fact that it lasted so little and the most important thing is the fact that we are still very close with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in the band with us and when I listen to a song or I see a picture I think of the incredible person Andy was and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to work, laugh, talk about music, football and many other things with him.
He was a surprising human being and we miss him.
The national group Las Robertas will open the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose her for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos with different proposals and that was the group we liked the most, so we look forward to seeing what Las Robertas can offer live and it has to be very entertaining.
Why do you always change the words of Yello Ledbetter live?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He sings it and I think he does it with the first words he imagines.
As a bassist, what are his influences?
There are so many...
Among the first ones I remember are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many influences, I could talk all afternoon about bassists that I love.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep the grunge up despite the fact that it is no longer fashionable?
I think we all feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the bands I have just mentioned, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those that have emerged at the same time and, if it is relevant now, I think it is wonderful, because it is a music that is worth listening to and the bands like Mudhoney now make the best music ever.
At first, his music had a darker content and now it has become more positive.
What is the reason for this change?
It's interesting, because I think there are songs in the new album that look lighter, but there are also songs, like The End or Just Breathe qualified as very obscure songs, even though they may sound a little positive.
With both of them, when Ed played them for me, I cried when I listened to them and these are deeply obscure songs.
I think that if you grow up and there's a trauma in your life and you lose to a relative or friend, these things start to influence your art and your music and these songs probably represent that to me.
I also think we can be happy and even so we can make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori hospitalized again for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized Tuesday in a public hospital to be evaluated for the loss of muscle strength he presents in the feet, informed his family doctor.
Fujimori, 72 years old, who is serving a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed during his government (1990-2000), suffers from various conditions, including a four-time, controlled language cancer.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, his personal doctor, said for Channel N of television that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the reason for pain and loss of strength in its lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate to obtain the benefit of the remission of the sentence for humanitarian reasons, no doubt he said that he did not want it because he felt innocent.
He has been operated on four times from tongue cancer, he has a weight loss of 18 kilos, and other conditions, such as severe erosive gastritis, a cyst of pancreas, kidney stones, high blood pressure and circulation problems in the feet, the doctor enumerated.
Fujimori has been incarcerated since September 2007 in the National Directorate of Special Police Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people because of an army annihilation squad that operated clandestinely during the first years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to consolidate political ties
An official procession, headed by Uruguayan President José Mujica and composed of various ministers and bosses, will launch a visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two nations and address political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with its Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, the highest point of a long agenda of meetings with political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the Uruguayan community resident in Mexico, according to the agenda circulated by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara will be "a propitious forum for the exchange of information in political affairs between the two nations", according to the information published by the Presidency of the South American country on its web page.
According to the local media, Mujica tries to convince Calderón to support Uruguay in the incident with France that took place when the French representative, Nicolas Sarkozy, included the South American country on the list of tax havens, in the meeting of the G20 in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that continue to be tax havens, a statement that provoked Uruguay's rejection and the call for consultations of its ambassador from this European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November, a group of the world's strongest emerging and developed countries, and has been in force with the South American country since January this year to exchange tax information to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan government has tried in recent years to speed up the implementation of tax exchange agreements to emerge from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) "grey list", which is integrated by countries that do not implement all international standards of tax cooperation.
In terms of trade, Mexico and Uruguay have in force since 2004 a Free Trade Treaty (FTA) which has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The moustachu plumber passes to the three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario fought, tirelessly, for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the claws of the wicked Bowser, but he had never done it in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of the youngster in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which comes this month to the stores of everyone, was designed from the beginning to fully exploit the features of the Nintendo 3DS mobile console, which allows to play in three dimensions without using glasses.
"Mario is the character who has to say how stereocopy without glasses should work," said Nintendo Spain's specialist press officer Omar Álvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "Nintendo's first video game originally designed for this support", because so far successes such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
Nintendo's spokesperson argued that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "accessible" video game that allows a fast and fluid part.
Álvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to hang less skilled users.
Once overcome, the most expert will be able to make a "second tour" at the levels of the game, which this time are more difficult.
In addition, users will be able to choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it would be necessary to play in three dimensions in order to be able to overcome the different challenges and "successfully succumb to optical illusions".
This incursion of Super Mario into all three dimensions also implies the return of the character to a mobile console, which had not happened since 2005.
In these video games Nintendo takes a look at the followers of the saga and repeats the formula of success of the previous games, which consists in the fact that the mustache plumber must go through rigged platforms to free Princess Peach.
Even if I player finds new things in movements, environments, costumes and enemies and also in the cases of Luigi "playable".
Colom backs Portillo's extradition to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced last Tuesday that he had given orders for the extradition of former Governor Alfonso Portillo to respond to the United States for the conspiracy for the laundering of 70 million US dollars.
Thus the trial ends so that Guatemala responds to the demand of the northern country that Portillo to try it.
At a press conference, Colom stated that his decision was based on the independence of the judiciary and the executive, taking into account the fact that a court of first instance had already ordered his extradition.
He claimed that during his term of office "he did not assist" in any judicial resolution and he had brought to justice all the extraditions he had experienced.
Apart from Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will also be extradited for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes will be extradited for drug trafficking.
What Colom has done requires an executive approach after exhausting all judicial and constitutional bodies to try the former agent of the 2004-2004 interval.
According to the resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Court of Constitutionality (CC), Portillo should be extradited after having resolved his legal situation in Guatemala and after guaranteeing his human rights.
Portillo was absolute for misappropriation of Q120 million funds to the Ministry of Defence when he was president, which was the trial that preceded extradition, but the Public Prosecutor's Office appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove helped 6,000 youth at risk
The entity was born to avoid the marginalization of young people without training
The record of the first 25 years of life of the social support entity Trinijove is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have been assisted to overcome a difficult situation during this quarter of a century.
This is in addition to the hundred-year-long workstations currently obtained by this social group.
The anniversary served yesterday to take stock in an act celebrated in a former industrial complex of Fabra i Coats which more than 300 people attended.
Trinijove was born in the Trinitat Vella district in 1986 with the aim of helping people who are untrained, without work, with drug problems or marginalized.
Yesterday's celebration in Sant Andreu concentrated a large number of leaders of entities and institutions who in these 25 years collaborated with the association.
The varied political representation during the election season showed the unitary nature of the work done by Trinijove.
Alongside the president of the Catalan Regional Government (Generalitat), Artur Mas and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, attended the act the former Minister of Socialist Education, Ernest Maragall and the former mayor deputy mayor and current municipal councillor eco-socialist Ricard Goma.
The current Minister of Social Welfare and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries and the General Director of Charity of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa, were also present in the grand hall of Fabra i Coats.
Mas claimed that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and the current one is also, but he added that the work done so far "is a good basis".
The president gave Trinijove as an example of how to fight against bad circumstances and to give hope to people in difficulty.
"The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it does," he said.
Property invaded by squatters for micro-fests, evacuated
The invaders had appropriated 11 of the building's 13 apartments in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants abandoned the property at noon yesterday without any resistance.
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare that the residents of number 51 of Balmes Street lived has ended.
Twelve people voluntarily abandoned at noon yesterday the building they were illegally occupying and where they were organizing micro-fests that desperated the neighbors, by judicial order and without the need for police intervention.
At the end of the operation, the door lock was changed to prevent the situation from repeating itself.
"From this day on there will be access control," said the administrator.
The squatters, who had invaded 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - the rest were inhabited - took away the electrical installation and part of the water installation, apart from painting the walls and leaving residues of all kinds, especially from boxes of alcoholic beverages.
The first three apartments were the scene of mass parties, which lasted up to two days and despaired the tenants.
Next to the building there is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which was also affected.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat, explained for Europa Press that as soon as the building was occupied, his business fell by 80%.
The owner of the discotheque mentioned that the invaders of the property made it unfair jurisdiction, because they sold the glasses at three euros, while in the discotheque they were worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the recreational space had had to respond to complaints from neighbors about noise, while according to the latter, the trouble was not caused by the clients of the discotheque, but by the inhabitants of the occupied house and especially the participants in the parties organized there, which were more frequent and intense in recent weeks, according to the angry neighbors of the area.
The head of the discotheque explained that the trouble was so great that it even led to an agreement with the owner of the building and it has been nine months since the building "forgave him" the rent.
The Guardia Urbana (municipal police) also confirmed that in recent weeks they had received more complaints from neighbors about this situation.
Alberto Fernández Díaz, president of the municipality's PP group, called last week for "the immediate evacuation of the building to end the problems of common and civic life that it caused to the residents and the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that before summer only one floor of the building was occupied, but the last few months the squatters had occupied all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments and that in some apartments there were also flights.
It is in this sense that he added that "it is necessary to end impunity and to be relentless against the antisocial behavior generated in the property".
Yesterday, the Mossos (the local Catalan police) evacuated a building in Nou Barris.
At 3.30 p.m. the police moved to number 35 at Rue Mont-ral, after receiving a call from a neighbour who had observed that four people were accessing the building.
All four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
The architects coincide on the opportunity of the convocation beyond the polemic on the fees
The municipal competition on the 16 doors opens again the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, at the height of Barcelona's already extinct Metropolitan Corporation (CMB), this Administration printed promotional posters for Collserola.
The brochure defined the mountain as the large park of metropolitan Barcelona.
In addition, it also contained a comparison, in numbers, with the Central Park of New York.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park became again, in the imagination of many people, the upper limit of Barcelona, the Catalan capital being the only one that is not oriented on the north-south axis, if not high (mountain) - low (sea).
Collserola's qualification as a natural park is to the advantage of this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park except Yellowstone, with wild boars in the role of Yogi bear.
This was the situation until, in September, the city council convened a mega-competition composed of 16 competitions for all access doors to Collserola.
A door goes back to the idea of a park, no doubt.
That's it, or someone wants to put doors in the field.
The question arises on its own: Collserola: park or mountain?
The competition, both with regard to its organization and with regard to the reflection on the city, is a topic of conversation of all the architects of Barcelona.
It's almost a recurring theme that two members of this former caste of elect talk about when they recognize each other in an elevator.
And this is precisely one of the few opinions on which three architects from Barcelona, university professors, who have presented themselves.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the competition is timely.
For Roldán, after approaching the coastal front "it is necessary" to debate on "the mountain front" because the speech of Ildefons Cerda, that of the blocks of green houses has not been completed.
"It is necessary to start from the base that the largest park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things for its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex", gave the verdict the architect for whom the title of "Collserola gates" contains a "lexic trap": these should not be thought of as "access to a park, but the delimitation of certain areas in which to act".
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urbanistic world, describes the proposal as "intellectual challenge" with "some perils".
The perils that derive from "the uncertainty of the projection of public space" after the experience lived in the 1980s and that had in the Forum area "his swan song".
The first fear is the very delimitation of the borders on which one can build.
"Limiting something means already establishing the next step", that is, its exceedance.
"We need to think about new urban planning instruments, because the current ones [in reference to the Metropolitan General Plan (MGP)] can cause real disasters."
By sticking to the question, Modol feels that, by simplifying, the slope of the El Valles de Collserola region "can be heard as a park, that of Barcelona, no".
Modol recalls that there is already a work done by the Collserola Patronage that "should not be lost", thanking for the opportunity that the city council offers to its corporation to intervene in this project "from the first moment".
Moreover, he hears that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the safe-conduct that allows architects to enter the debate, but "doubts" whether this technical profile should lead the multidisciplinary teams ("every success", he says) that we had to create: "We architects should be only an instrument".
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gives the title of this piece is complex, because from the bases of the competition there is a lack of a global vision of Collserola: "We have convened 16 transversal competitions - he says - in the mountain-sea sense, but there is no longitudinal reading that sees and understands the area as a whole".
This means, at least in this case, that he chose to participate in the 16 competitions.
In another way, a project so that one of the doors can shock in the program and definition with that of the architect of the nearby door.
In its opinion, yes, the city hall should ensure that the band immediately superior to Ronda de Dalt should provide, throughout its extension, an area of equipment that makes a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonás Larrazábal and he will be released
After 72 days of provisional arrest, the founder of the legal power of the Casino Red granted forgiveness to the brother of the mayor of Monterrey for the trial initiated against him for alleged blackmail
After spending 72 years in detention, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the founder of the legal power of Casino Red grants him forgiveness before the Second District Criminal Court, which follows a trial for blackmail against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
After the attack on Casino Royale, Casino Red's owner, Sergio Gil García, published a series of photos and videos in which Manuel Jonás allegedly required him to pay an economic fee so that the mayor of Monterrey would allow the underground operation of the gambling house.
After the public denunciation, the Prosecutor's Office opened a criminal trial against the brother of Mayor PANiste and on 2 September he was arrested and held in provisional detention for 30 days.
After four hours in front of the Public Prosecutor's Office 3 of Heritage Crimes, he was transferred to Detention Centre 1, located in the Old District of the State Capital.
He remained there for the next 49 days when a second arrest warrant was issued after the Public Prosecutor's Office rejected the offences of corruption and organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to the penal center of Caderoyta allegedly for having blackmailed the owners of Casino Red with a million and a half pesos; but he spent only a few hours in the medium security detention center because there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to continue the trial in the municipal cells of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On 25 October, a capture order was issued by the Clerk of the Second District Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who said that after almost two months of investigation there was sufficient confirmed evidence to determine Jonás' guilt, such as that relating to the collection of 1.5 million pesos of the representatives of the gambling house in exchange for its operation.
On Monday, the founder of the legal power of the Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, presented himself to the judge José Luis Pecina to ask for forgiveness for the brother of the mayor of the region; therefore he could regain his freedom in the following hours.
During the legal proceedings, the Public Prosecutor attached to the Tribunal, Ramiro Arias, questioned García Gómez if the damage had been recovered and who was the one who granted forgiveness from the gambling association, but the lawyer tried not to communicate the name.
According to case 197/2011 Jonás Larrazábal was granted legal pardon and subsequently no claim could be made concerning the trial against him; no compensation for the damage and no punishment would be sought either.
After the hearing of the founder of the legal power of the gambling house, at 15:50 hours the immediate freedom of Larrazabal Bretón was ordered.
The Registrar of the Tribunal, Jorge Yánez, travelled to the prison in the municipality of San Nicolás de los Garza to inform Jonás that he had been legally pardoned and his file would be filed.
He will also communicate the immediate release order issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the air accident in which the Secretary of the Government, Francisco Blake and seven other people lost their lives
The Secretariat for Communications and Transport (SCT) informed that the results of the accident in which the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora and seven other persons lost his life indicate that the helicopter had shocked the ground directly in complete structural integrity, without the pilot being able to attempt a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that prior to the take-off of the aircraft, the pilot found that the weather conditions were adequate to fly.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had various contacts with the ground, the blades had contact with the trees at 25 meters where the unit lost the fuselage."
He also informed that the unit was designed for 19 people, so the unit met the requirements for transporting staff.
In addition, he said that investigations in the impact zone do not report the appearance of pieces on the ground.
"In one search it was reported that there are no parts or components of the aircraft in another location, the impact was presented structurally.
"The helicopter was designed for 19 passengers and met the requirements to transport them.
The soil had a slope of seven to 30 degrees of inclination.
For the moment, the secretary has assured that a priority is to have the results as soon as possible; but the investigation can last a few months, it can even last a year.
In turn, Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Aeroports and Auxiliary Services assured that at the time of the impact, the helicopter of the Presidential Major State was operating at cruising speed and it happened on a soft ascending ground.
"This information supports the hypothesis of a normal cruise operation at the time of impact," he says.
During the press conference, TBS incumbent Pérez Jácome listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual theft:
According to aeronautical regulations, the flight was conducted according to visual flight rules, which means that the crew must have visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The reports in the AICM indicated adequate take-off conditions, and as the aircraft advanced to the border area between DF and the State of Mexico, there were layers of low-heavy nebulosity.
Selected routes:
It is likely that due to the nebulosity conditions the crew sought a lower height area and more visibility towards the Cuernavaca Valley.
Localization of impact.
The coordinates of the impact and the last recording of the aircraft on the radar coincide, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or alteration of the flight path.
Dispersion of aircraft remains in a reduced area:
The information available so far suggests that the impact has taken place on a straight and lateral path.
The aircraft remains dispersal model suggests that the helicopter struck the ground under structural integrity conditions.
No traces of fire or explosion were detected:
At the scene of the disaster there is always no trace in the remains of the aircraft of any type of explosion or fire.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that the aircraft had had multiple contacts with the ground.
During the field work, parts of the aircraft were found at a height of 9 thousand 200 feet above the average sea level, with a slope ranging from seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which he possibly disarticulated along his journey.
The information provides elements that suggest that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts with the ground.
After careful search in a larger area than the surrounding area, around the accident, scattered parts of the aircraft were not found, which supports the presumption that the impact took place under structural integrity conditions.
MSS announces protocol to find the obesity gene
Social Insurance leads an investigation to discover the obesity gene for children and young people; this is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Insurance (IMSS) has announced that it is conducting an investigation to discover the gene of obesity in the case of children and young people, called the 'Genetics of Obesity of Children and Adolescents' protocol that will allow to have the markers associated with overweight.
In a statement, the head of the Biochemistry Medical Investigation Unit of the Specialty Hospital of the 20th Century National Medical Centre, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers had been formed.
This team is supported by specialists and graduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Advanced Research and Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
In the investigation, the population with or without rights is invited to participate, to present themselves to the participating sports units of IMSS in Valle de México, where the evidence to minors is made every Saturday from 8:00 a.m.
He stressed that the protocol began in the Cuauhtémoc Sports Unit (Estado de México Poniente) and that from October 8, the activity takes place in the Sports Unit of Nezahualcoyolt (Estado de México Oriente).
After reaching the goal of bringing together 500 or 600 minors, the study will continue in the Sportive Independence Unit (south of Distrito Federal) and finally in the Sportive Morelos Unit (north of Distrito Federal).
He explained that the objective of this investigation and that of knowing the components and importance of genetics in the development of obesity and identifying risk factors in Mexican children and young people to prevent the emergence of chronic degenerative diseases.
As World Diabetes Day will be celebrated on November 14, he mentioned that the goal is to bring together three thousand children and young people between the ages of six and 14, with the consent and under the supervision of their parents, for the application of the specific food questionnaires.
They will also be asked about their physical activity and family history of their diseases, to avoid risk factors that trigger conditions such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He explained that on Saturdays, anthropometric measurements (weight, size, waist circumference), blood pressure, determination of glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol, and insulin and genetics will be applied to all participants (an attempt is made to identify people associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz López reported that this investigation is the result of the concern of health professionals for the alarming weight gain in the case of minors.
'The 1999 and 2006 health surveys indicated that in just six years there was a 77 per cent increase in obesity for boys and 47 per cent for girls; there was also a dramatic increase in overweight,' said IMSS.
He indicated that the rationale for the search for markers is based on the fact that the country's population is different from the others by its genetic history.
He reported that, on average, Mexicans have 65 percent Indo-American inheritance, 30 percent European and five percent African, and this condition is reflected in people associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity results in the inability to burn the excess energy that is consumed (calories), which is deposited in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for the participants is the full assessment of children, which makes it possible to detect whether they are overweight or obese.
It even says that the presence of dark coloured folds (acanthosis) on the neck and forearm indicate the probability of suffering from metabolic and even pre-diabetes alterations.
The information is managed in a confidential manner, and the doctors hand it over in writing to the parents, who explain each of the measures and changes in their lifestyles to prevent disease.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: sedentary lifestyle, which is the lack of daily physical activity, stay most of the day sitting in front of TV and use means of transport instead of walking on short distances.
Another cause is the high calorie intake, i.e. the highest consumption of sweet drinks, carbohydrates (tamales - corn meal paste wrapped in corn leaves -, bread, pizza, burgers, etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins and the genetics analyzed in this protocol.
UNAM asphalt would avoid cassis
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry at UNAM, develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with better efficiency, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions
If the reports were resolved, it would no longer be necessary to repair approximately 200 thousand cassis every rainy season in the Metropolitan Area of Valle de México, warns Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of UNAM, who assured that if the process of construction and maintenance of the bituminous pavement is adequate, the cassis could be reduced or even eliminated completely.
During his conference A technological opinion on cassis, organized as part of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory for which he is responsible develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture having characteristics similar to those of asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance, both at high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera considered that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve efficiency, and therefore the formation of cassis.
He explained that asphalt, the heavier part of oil, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, molecules with a heavier molecular weight, called asphaltenes, and molecules with a low molecular weight, called maltenes, which together give the pavement its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behaviour of asphalt consists in the fact that at high temperatures, about 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees C its viscosity is very high and at 50 degrees C it has an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, asphalt becomes brittle, he added.
This means that in the streets the resistance of asphalt is not uniform and changes during the day according to environmental and temperature conditions, warns the specialist in chemical engineering.
The FQ researcher observed that the streets of Ciudad de México were mostly covered by a flexible pavement, composed of six layers of materials, the last three of which involved asphalt.
Among the more superficial layers is the asphalt layer, formed by small stones bathed in asphalt and subsequently compacted.
Each of the small stones that form the layer, he pointed out, is bathed an asphalt.
When vehicles pass through it by generating effort, it allows the forces to spread very well in the pavement.
If we had modified asphalt, they would spread better, the chemical engineer said.
On the asphalt layer, he said, we put a last layer called a rolling layer, made of fine stone, that is, sand that is also bathed in asphalt.
As this is the layer in contact with the wheels of the vehicles, it must have more mechanical force than the asphalt layer and provide adhesion in the street.
Being the part of the pavement that receives and distributes the forces, the rolling layer also requires that it has an adequate thickness and the material it is made of must be treated.
The climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially water, he says, because they significantly affect the efficiency of the asphalt layer.
When the soil is wet, the water spills inside the layer it is difficult for it to come out, which softens all the layers of the pavement and therefore causes the cassis.
In the process of forming a cassis, he said, the first one to spoil is the rolling film and only later is the asphalt layer affected, but the damage does not take place immediately, but it is a process that must be treated at the first signals with adequate maintenance programs.
The member of the National System of Researchers explained that the load of vehicles is another important factor for the formation of cassis and therefore the thickness of each layer of the pavement must always be linked to the load of vehicles and ensure its satisfaction, in order to avoid frequent formation of cassis.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still a lot to investigate and work on asphalt, for example, bituminous emulsions, which in other countries already exist on the market and allow to repair the cassis easily and without having to use high temperatures.
What did Valle's candidate miss to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that caused Melina Ramírez Serna not to obtain the crown of Miss Colombia.
Valle receives her title number 14 of princess.
Once again Valle del Cauca remained with the desire to win the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to be content with being on the winners' podium, wearing the silver crown and the band that credited her as the new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico is mounted with the crown and the sceptre, the department already summates 14 titles of Princess and Melina joins a legion of women of Valle del Cauca who found themselves near the crown but were proclaimed princesses, among which Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
Today the big question that many people ask themselves is:
What did he miss? Because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite that in each presentation showed that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, because she had not been elected in vain Queen of Police and Best Face Pretty Vogue, titles obtained by queens Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor considered key in the juror's decision to appoint her First Princess is the fact that she did not convince with her answer to the question "?What was the book that marked you and why? posed by Martín Murillo Gómez of Carreta Literaria Leamos.
Here is the answer of the candidate of Valle to this question:
"I read a lot, I believe enough in literature, I believe it is a form of culturalization, I definitely believe that the book that marked my childhood is "The Little Prince", it is a rather deep book.
Now I'm reading "Crime and Punishment", it's a book of universal literature that we should all read; and now I'm reading the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a very beautiful book called "The Ardour of Blood".
This response was not pleasant at first because of the term "culturalize" and secondly not to explain in concrete terms how each cited book had marked it.
But at the end of the Melina ceremony she said she felt calm and happy with the result "the universe is wise, what must happen.
And for everyone, please read a little, "The Little Prince" is a great book"
Among the assumptions made is that Valle was destroyed by favouritism.
A journalist from Bogota insinuated that being the favorite, the ovationated and the candidate who received all the preliminary prizes (the challenge of gastronomy Oster, the public vote for the best artisan costume, and Queen Mother), "it awakened the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and that's why she did not shine on the stage".
And we noted this in his first swimsuit presentation at Hilton Beach and his two parades on the eve of the coronation.
Although she had appeared confident about herself at both parades, it was noted that she did not have the strength and energy of the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the "Como en casa" (Comme en la casa) program, of the RCN Canal said that the fact that Melina had been named princess "confirms the fact that the candidate who won most of the prizes during the competition does not receive the crown of queen".
In addition, Valle avoided the press at the end, and it was a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury of its interest in social initiatives, which is in fact the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
That's why two days before the election international juror Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman engaged in the social needs of her country.
"Only beauty is not enough in a Miss Colombia, you have to look beyond physics and focus on its social sensitivity, that before starting the Contest are already involved in projects," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned because of her defects in her back and the fibrosis that was observed in her abdomen, but this is contradictory, because precisely the jury elected her as the candidate 'Natural Beauty' with the healthier body, good nutrition and responsible physical work.
The queen preparer Jorge Hernán Orozco admits that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better ones, "but her problem of fibrosis on the abdomen, which in fact for me had not been too well known, left her points on the last day".
Meanwhile journalist Guido Hoyos of Cromos magazine considers that the error of the candidate of Valle was the surgery she had undergone.
"Surgeries are good, but Valle couldn't do them.
Her body has never been her asset and she has lost because of this aspect".
For this prize, which the National Beauty Competition will return for the first time, after the swimsuit parade came a cruel prediction that was fulfilled last night, it was said that it was a small gift that Raymundo made to Melina not to give her the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that today Melina begins a year of reign, not as a sovereign, but as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions by designating the National Competition.
However, she will pass through history as one of the queens who, despite her dazzling passage through Cartagena, did not get the crown.
So it was the work of the person of Cali who identified the corpse of Alfonso Cano
A typewriter from Cali came to history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano'.
The work of these officials is crucial.
Last November 4, a CTI typewriter from Cali passed to history as the person who confirmed the identity of the supreme leader of the FARC: "Alfonso Cano", comparing his fingerprints.
Of the seven typists who work in the local offices of the CTI, this week it was the turn of "availability" of Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working for 21 years in the field of judicial investigation.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in the municipalities of Chocó, where many times he had to spend more than five days in the forest to get to the place where the bodies were to be identified.
In 2000 he was transferred to the capital of Valle and after taking appropriate courses, he specialized in typing, which is the study of friction skin, i.e. palms and feet.
During the week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was warned to take clothes with him for at least three days.
Something very big was waiting for him.
On Friday night he left for Cauca in a Palmira helicopter.
He knew that he had to identify two corpses and that one of them was suspected of being the man who was leading the world's oldest guerrilla, so he was asked to take the card with the ten fingerprints of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
But when he arrived with the investigation team at the body, he did not recognize it by its physical appearance, because it was very different from the one he had seen in the media.
He had no beard, he was dressed like a peasant in the area, without glasses and much thinner.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Accompanied by a galtonian magnifying glass, ink, a harvester and a lantern, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse with those of the map.
His eye did not deceive him: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was responsible for confirming to the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón that yes, he was the supreme leader of the FARC.
Looking for the fingerprint
For a typewriter from Sijín de Cali the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos made to Eliazar González, in a press conference for the operation against "Cano", is very significant.
A lot of people don't know our work.
Typyloscopying is an accurate science, without any margin of error, which can be crucial in solving crimes.
Apart from identifying the bodies, the typists support investigations for crimes such as theft and homicide and confirm the identity of the captured persons.
When captured, many offenders present false identity cards or do not have documents.
We take their fingerprints and search the database.
The researcher said that in a case of theft he had to remove part of a wall from a house, because in that place the thief had held his hand to get out a safe full of jewelry and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not adequate surfaces to draw a fingerprint, but in this case we were able to get the fingerprint from all hands and identify the offender who had participated in various thefts," he recalls.
Fingerprints can also remove or confirm suspects in homicide cases.
Recently we found a dead man, with bottles of booze around him.
Through the investigation it was determined that a parent may be a suspect in the crime and indeed a print on the bottle coincided.
Even if it doesn't guarantee that he's the killer, it puts him at the crime scene.
A CTI typist explained that "the fingerprints of objects with chemical or physical reagents are extracted".
When they appear, a harvester or a band is used to harvest them.
Later, fingerprints are sent to Asif, the database of declines, or to the National Civil Registry.
"The problem is that there are still a lot of undocumented Colombians," said the CTI expert.
He explained that not everything is how it is shown in the CSI television program.
As all that shines is not gold, everything that is touched does not necessarily become a footprint.
However, it can be used if the necessary confrontation is achieved.
The "indignant" defies the authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters were buzzing in front of Zuccotti Square to camp there.
A large part of the population accessed the evacuation order and moved to a nearby park.
The members of the Occupy Wall Street movement defied the New York authorities this Tuesday by trying to re-enter, thanks to a court order, the place of Manhattan, where they were evacuated at dawn and when they tried to occupy another park of the Great Apple.
Hundreds of protesters were shaking in front of Zuccotti Square, where they wanted access through a court order that allowed the 'indignant' to camp again in that place, while the other side of the movement responded to the evacuation by occupying a park further north of the city, where there were new stops.
"Our idea is that if the court doesn't allow us to camp again in the square, we will move to another place and continue the legal struggle to return to Zuccotti, and through sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations," says one of the spokespersons of the Occupy Wall Street movement, Mark Bray.
Bray explained that the "indignant" response to the evacuation of their camp personally dictated by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, reached the courts, where Justice Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the forced evacuation of the site and allowing protesters to remain in the camp.
In addition, the 'indignant' occupied a new park located at the confluence of Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which unites New York and New Jersey, owned by the Trinity Church parish.
At least for an hour they managed to occupy the place, but after the police moved there and arrested some protesters, even though Bray could not confirm the concrete figure, assuring Efe that he saw some journalists who had also been handcuffed.
The organization assures that there are hundreds of people who had settled in this place, where a delegation of religious leaders moved as a sign of support to the members of the movement and tried to intervene in their favor before the police.
Meanwhile, the Zuccotti Square - which is a private property enclosure - remains closed pending the holding of a judicial hearing scheduled for this Tuesday during which we must analyse the legality of this morning's evacuation.
Some protesters who had been displaced until then were carrying and distributing copies of this court order at that time, and they were even handing it over to the officers who were monitoring the place, which caused 'some small clashes', said Bray, who denounced the fact that some officials hit the protesters.
The judicial order prohibits the authorities from evacuating Occupy Wall Street members or applying 'laws published after the beginning of the occupation or from denying demonstrators access to the park again with tents or other properties they used to use'.
Mayor Bloomberg told the press that, because of this judicial order, the city had suspended the reopening of space to the public and demonstrators, but warned that local laws did not allow them to settle with tents and sleeping bags.
The city councillor personally defended the evacuation carried out at dawn at Zuccotti Square, an operation during which 200 people were arrested and which was decided because the demonstrators 'violate the law'.
Bloomberg explained that he had given the order to evacuate the place because it became "a place where people did not come to protest, but to violate the laws and in some cases, to hurt other people", because "some shops had received threats" and residents were afraid "for their quality of life".
"This morning's evacuation at dawn was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is more interested in defending the financial interests than those of American workers," added the spokesman for the movement, who accused the mayor of "not respecting freedom of expression."
Officials of Occupy Wall Street also indicated that they do not plan to organize "great actions" for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and trade unions to commemorate the two months of protests, which began on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas TV program
Next to Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, she will be on the TV show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" next December 1
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", rescuer in "Baywatch", rabbit in "Playboy", wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a special Canadian television Christmas program.
The private television channel CTV announced today that Anderson, next to the "crooner" (baladin) Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, will be released in the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" next December 1 performing a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed images of the television program in which Anderson, also known for the wide-ranging broadcast on the Internet of a private pornographic video in which she appeared with her husband of that time, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, appeared dressed as the Virgin Mary by supporting in a nursery a doll that represents Jesus.
On stage, Peters, a famous Indian-born Canadian actor who recently featured a part of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth", appears as Joseph.
Next to Anderson and Peters, CTV's special Christmas program also features Canadian singer Bublé, who at the end of March married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires, and who is not far from the controversy.
Recently, Bublé called American Kim Kardashian 'pute' during one of her concerts in New York.
Japan resurrects after the earthquake
GDP increases by 1.5% due to domestic consumption and puts an end to the downward spiral in early March
Since March the Japanese economy has been paralysed, convalescent even after the devastating earthquake that has become a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster in the Japanese country since the Second World War.
The first estimates of the Tokyo Government have calculated the material losses at $300,000 million, a blow that, despite the difficult global environment, seems to have diminished.
After three consecutive quarters of falls, data from the Gross Domestic Product between July and September were used to turn the page definitively: GDP rose by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% in annualised rates.
The second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year starts in March 2012 - also implies the highest rate of increase from January to March 2010.
The recovery is partly due to the resumption of acquisitions of equipment to restore areas devastated by the earthquake and the aftermath of the tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1%, compared to the 0.9% decrease in capital expenditure observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of continuous increase.
However, the real stimulus of the Japanese economy is not based exclusively on the Keynesian impulse that invites us to take advantage of the crisis to consolidate - or rebuild - the infrastructure, to use the deficiencies to grow from zero.
Japan has woken up mainly thanks to the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan's GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, driven by increased spending on vehicles, travel and entertainment activities.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo returned to the internal market when the yen - the Japanese currency - became one of the "refugee values" elected by investors fleeing the eurozone debt crisis and the expected turmoil of the United States, a privilege that weighs like a slab in the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger divide, products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose economic flotation line is determined by the health of major technological groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, were responsible for their low performance between July and September for the Yen's contribution.
While the markets continue to sit in the peripheral EU countries, Yoshihiko Noda's Government does not decrease its guard.
"We must follow the risks that persist, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen," said the Secretary of State for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa yesterday.
Indeed, the prospects are not encouraging at all.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) mentioned that the majority of member countries presented clearer signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that anticipates the inflection points of the world economy has highlighted that the main powers are being held back.
Because it dropped four decimals to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 in August.
Eurozone was even below the average, which is in level 100, falling by eight decimals to 99.13 points.
Athens re-energizes doubts
Papadimos says the adjustments will be approved, but the Conservatives will not sign any written commitment
With the peripheral risk premiums triggered and the uncertainty re-installed in the parks, Greece continues to entangle itself in the maze that leads to the exit of the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new Greek Transitional Government is being imposed rather by the Brussels demands than by a real conviction of the political forces is beginning to be confirmed by the facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos pointed out yesterday that there is no alternative for structural reforms and that the 100-day period set in his appointment may be short to apply, the leader of the Conservative party New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would not support the new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his demand for new elections for the scheduled date, that of 19 February.
"The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions of the 26 October summit," Papadimos said when he opened a parliamentary debate yesterday that will end tomorrow with a vote of confidence for the new Executive.
A package of 24 programmes to stimulate employment, reform of the civil servants' disciplinary code and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras' message does not cast doubt on his position: "We have committed ourselves to helping the Transitional Government, but we have committed ourselves to nothing more".
The conservative leader has gone a step further in his pulse than the EU and IMF, the bodies that must unlock the 8,000 million that Athens urgently requires, and has made it clear that he will not approve any letter of commitment to implement the adjustments.
But the European Commission, still irritated by the impact caused by the va-t-tout of the referendum in Papandreu, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will not unlock aid if the new Government and the leaders of the main Hellenic parties do not sign "a written commitment without ambiguity as soon as possible".
The spokesman for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the Troika inspectors would return "very quickly" to Athens to discuss with the new Government "the elements necessary to pay the sixth instalment" of 8,000 million, even if there is no final date either.
The Greeks still have a lot to do.
Queen Sofia: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen underlines Spain's "preponderant" role in this type of finance
Spain "has reached a world-leading place in the role of Microfinance".
Queen Sofia recalled that in the last two decades the country has become the world's second largest donor in terms of this instrument of cooperation, the essence of which lies in the fact that it is an "instrument for social progress, justice and hope in a better future for all humanity, based on trust in the human being".
Yesterday, the Queen inaugurated the Fifth World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid with the certainty that "there is no doubt" that these types of operations are "absolutely indispensable" to achieve the Millennium Development Goals set by the United Nations for 2015, and, "very specifically, in the one that aims to halve the volume of people living on incomes below one dollar a day, to which is set the "poverty threshold".
Spain "continues to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "in all corners of the planet, and assumes this task with "responsibility", said Queen Sofia, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions originating during the Summit, which will extend until Thursday, "guarantee the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest and especially for women", the main beneficiaries of these loans.
We have "achieved many goals" and "we face many challenges".
The Microcredit Summit is seen not only as a forum for debate, but also as the platform from which to drive "two basic goals".
Thus, Her Majesty explained that the goal is that at the end of 2015 there are 175 million poor families who have accessed these financial services and that one hundred million of these families are emerging from the poverty line in which they now live.
The impulse in the design of microcredits in Spain and the rest of the world "followed the path initiated a few years ago in a pioneering way" by Muhammad Yunus, emphasized Queen Sofia as an "act of justice and recognition due".
And she described the father of this instrument as an "admirable idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty", the work she has known for 15 years, when the Queen travelled to Bangladesh to learn about her loan policy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "at each meeting I was able to see a continuous evolution", explained Her Majesty, whose relationship with this project brought yesterday the term "head of the family" gathered in Valladolid by the "banking of the poor".
Finally, Queen Sofia ended her intervention by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and in seeking solutions to progress in the fight against poverty.
"Ethic imperative"
The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for any democratic state.
In this sense, she stated that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to times of economic prosperity, because it is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez considered that microcredits presuppose "a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to the eradication of poverty", and now "more than ever" the governments of developed countries must work on criteria of solidarity and not let it be the victim of the cuts.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, applauded "the success" of giving "trust" to "excluded persons to whom all close the door"; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed people present in a city that "opens its contaminated doors of the spirit of solidarity".
CDU proposes to elect the European President by universal suffrage
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), Monday 14 November, in Leipzig, took place without real difficulty for Angela Merkel, Chancellor but also President of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not originally foreseen in the programme but was imposed in the autumn, in particular to satisfy the activists who consider the government's policy too lax with regard to the Greeks today and perhaps Italians tomorrow.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by management, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
The standing ovation of several minutes to which they were entitled, after their interventions, Angela Merkel then, a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, the very Europhile Minister of Finance, left no room for doubt.
The master idea of the Chancellor - and of the motion - stands in a slogan: the answer to the crisis "is no less of Europe but more of Europe".
Not only because Europe is peace, but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
For the Chancellor, "the time has come from a breakthrough in Europe".
This could result in amendments to the Lisbon Treaty to strengthen the EU's control over the fiscal policies of the euro area countries, but it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage "in order to give Europe a face".
This is in any case one of the motion's proposals adopted by the Congress whose inspiration is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble.
Of course, it is unlikely that the Twenty-Seven will agree quickly on this revolution: Britain is hostile to it and the CDU leaders believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is also hostile.
But the milestone is set.
Similarly, the delegates rejected, by an overwhelming majority, the proposal to weight each country's weight in the European Central Bank's Executive Board according to the weight of each economy, which obviously meant strengthening Germany's weight.
In an effort to calm the climate within her party, the Chancellor multiplied the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but she also did not seek to win her congress on the back of the "small" European countries or countries in difficulty that were quick to criticize the arrogant Germany.
While the motion on Europe devotes a paragraph to the importance of "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Except in the hollow.
Remembering that two centuries ago, Leipzig had been at the heart of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What does fraud at sick stops mean?
After the allowances, the UMP and the government launch the strike on the disease stops.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday 15 November to visit a family allowance fund, and to deliver a speech on the recurring theme - since 2007 - of the fight against social fraud and assistance.
And to accompany this offensive, which starts from a desire to make savings in a context of rigour, but is no less heralding an axis of the presidential campaign to the right, the majority wants to focus on the sick stops.
Firstly, with a view to budgetary savings: the government plans to impose on private employees a fourth day of deficiency before taking over a work stoppage.
Clearly, without a specific company agreement, an employee who falls ill would lose four days' wages, so at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that could provoke anger, but would bring back 280 million euros, according to Les Echos.
And that would be accompanied by another measure, more symbolic in scope: to impose on civil servants a day of non-compensation in the event of a stoppage of work (they do not have until now a period of absence, compared to three days in the private sector).
While these issues are under discussion, the majority also revives the issue of fraud, this time targeting abuses related to work stoppages.
"The controls will be much more important and, in addition, if you are caught, you will refund," Xavier Bertrand warned RTL's microphone on Sunday, November 13.
As in other cases, the advertising effects appear to be somewhat disproportionate to the reality of work stoppage fraud.
Since 2002, it has been the subject of constant monitoring and political offensives, most of which have borne fruit.
The French are no sicker than elsewhere in Europe.
Let us first look at the national figures.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than €237 million of daily allowances were issued in 2006.
According to the Institute for Health Economics Research and Documentation, daily allowances accounted for 5% of health expenditure in 2008, with EUR 11.3 billion.
Of this amount, 46% concerned maternity leave and accidents at work, and 54% concerned sick leave, or €6.2 billion.
And therefore 2.5% of health expenditure.
In 2010, the French experienced an average of 14.5 days off work, compared to 17.8 days in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
An average that hides some discrepancies: another survey, published in 2007 by the Monster.com career management site, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees interviewed said they had not taken any sick leave.
Another study, this time of the Health Insurance , specifies that in 2010, 37% of the sickness breaks were of a duration of less than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to one month, 15% from one to three months and 11% beyond.
When compared with their European neighbours, French employees are no more inclined than elsewhere to stop working.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001, the overall absence rate (for health reasons or not) in France ranged from 10% to 11%, compared to 20% to 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Sickness fraud represents very little in the face of work in the dark.
As for fraud, it is only of a small scale.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 means that controls are systematic on sick leave for more than 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million controls, CNAM found that 13 per cent of 285 000 cases for short-term stops were "unjustified or too long", or 37,050 cases.
In the case of systematically controlled arrests of more than 45 days, there were 11% "unadapted or unwarranted" cases out of 1.2 million, or 132,000.
A total of 169,000 "unwarranted" cases, out of several million employees who have had a sick leave.
A figure that represents very little compared, for example, to that of black work.
According to MP UMP Dominique Tian, author of a report on the issue in June, it would represent 9 to 15 billion euros of tax loss per year, more than the total cost of daily allowances, and therefore infinitely more than the fraud against them.
Papadémos: Greece will have to implement a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment programme to restore its economy.
That is what the Prime Minister, Lucas Papadémos, told Parliament on Monday 14 November, adding that the one hundred days given to his union government would not be enough to accomplish this task.
"To continue efforts to restore the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new fiscal adjustment programme," said the head of government, who was delivering his first public speech at the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the euro area summit on 27 October will be the "main task" of the new government, as the country's participation in the euro area "is at stake", he added.
As a result, Mr Papadémos has forecast that the country's public deficit will be reduced to "about 9%" of GDP by the end of the year, after being 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The Right Refuses New Austerity Measures
Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right, gave his support on Monday to the measures already approved to try to get out of the debt crisis but warned that his party would not commit to additional austerity.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said at a meeting with the MPs of his party, New Democracy.
He agreed with the objectives of reducing deficit and debt, and combating waste but hostile to any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
In Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not release the necessary EUR 8 billion loan without a written guarantee from all parties that they would support the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his word was sufficient and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
Euthanasia and assisted suicide must be legalized, says a committee of experts
Canadians live in denial of death, according to the Royal Society of Canada report
In palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions, and physicians to work together to ensure better palliative care, beyond cancer.
Canadian society lives in denial of death.
Only 9% of Canadians agree to talk to their doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and make arrangements to do so.
This is one of the findings of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, in which six experts from diverse fields, including ethics, law and medicine, participated.
This committee recommends that the government amend the Criminal Code to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, where appropriate, to a patient deemed competent to make such a decision.
From the outset, experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
While Canada ranked 10th, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has engendered a culture in which people are afraid to address the subject of death."
Medicalization or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, we report experts mandated by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the desire of most Canadians to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying in hospital.
Overall, in Quebec, this rate is highest, with 86% of hospital deaths.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that run counter to the position of the federal government, which has already stated that it does not want to change anything in the Criminal Code regarding euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to the experts, who have also reviewed all countries where these approaches are legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that this decriminalization leads to abuse in the application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or suicide assisted by persons who are not competent or consenting.
On the contrary, yesterday, Jocelyn Downie, co-signator of the report, said in teleconference, there would be more cases of these overflows precisely in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized.
"Euthanasia is practised in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"Assisted suicide is practised in Canada, where it is clearly illegal," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians in favour of euthanasia
Recall that 85% of Canadians have already spoken in favour of euthanasia because they believe that it would help end-of-life people alleviate their suffering, according to an Angus Reid poll conducted in 2010.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not send the message that the lives of elderly or disabled people are less valuable.
As for those who committed assisted suicide, the respondents estimate that 41% should not be prosecuted.
In terms of maintaining or ceasing care for a patient, the situation is less clear, the authors say.
Therefore, in the list of their recommendations, they suggest that the Criminal Code should indicate that the withdrawal of care for which there has been a legally valid refusal is not criminal.
The Committee of Experts also calls for health professionals to be trained to respect a refusal of end-of-life care without fear of criminal prosecution.
In palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions, and physicians to work together to ensure better palliative care, beyond cancer.
Finally, regarding palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the Committee requests that it be considered when it is not used to reduce physical pain, such as euthanasia, and subject to the same procedures.
Reservations of other experts
Some health law experts have already expressed reservations about the findings of the Royal Society of Canada experts' report.
Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, described as "extreme" the position of the experts who signed the report, among other things because it does not limit the practice of euthanasia to patients in the terminal phase.
"It opens the door to a situation where everyone who is tired of life and who is over 18 years old could ask for help in committing suicide," says Mr. Deschamps, who had consulted a summary of the report yesterday.
Deschamps also points out that the authors of the report seem to place the autonomy of the person above all other values that participate in the social fabric of society.
But "in society, he says, there are beacons and constraints."
Health Law Specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed "a strong opposition" to the report's findings, which she described as "pro-euthanasia demonstration".
Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, particularly challenges the report's data on the absence of abuse in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls on President Assad to leave power
Damas denounces a "complot"
Syria is increasingly isolated
Supporters of Bashar al-Assad demonstrated yesterday in front of the Foreign Ministry.
Diplomatic pressure intensified yesterday on Syria by Bashar al-Assad, who, with the support of Russia, resists them and denounces a "complot" against the country.
Two days after the Arab League's suspension of Syria, the European Union reinforced its sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, neighbouring Syria, took a stand in favour of President Assad's departure.
Jordan's King Abdallah II was yesterday the first Arab leader to call President Bashar al-Assad to "remove power" in Syria where some forty civilians and members of the regime's forces were still killed.
"If Bashar had his country's interest at heart, he should resign, but he should also create the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life," said the king of Jordan, a neighbouring country of Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
For his part, the head of Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu, regretted that the Turkish mediation efforts undertaken since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime had failed.
"Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot satisfy them will leave," he said, referring to Syria, a neighbouring country in which Turkey is adopting an increasingly harsh line.
The United States, for its part, welcomed a "strengthening of consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime" following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League, countries like Turkey are adopting an increasingly harsh tone" in the face of repression in Syria, observed Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime's forces perished in the region of Deraa, in southern Syria, announced the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH).
Two other civilians died "when gunfire and heavy machine guns were exchanged in Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs, according to this NGO.
At a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mouallem, however, felt that the country was "going towards the end of the crisis".
He reacted strongly to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damascus from its work, which he said was "a dangerous step".
Syria "will not bend," he added, assuring that "ourdied plots against Syria will fail."
After its decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now studying a "civil protection mechanism" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé also supported the sending of UN observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime, which he said is locked in "paranoia".
A new extraordinary meeting of the League is scheduled tomorrow in Rabat to take stock of the implementation of the crisis exit plan decided on 2 November, including the withdrawal of the armed forces from the cities under challenge and the release of the arrested demonstrators.
The Russian Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov, judged yesterday "incorrect" the decision of the Arab League, while China urged Syria to implement the plan of exit from the crisis, while refraining from supporting possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti asks for time in markets and sacrifices to Italians
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked for some time in the markets to form his team and implement a program, which will contain "sacrifices", in order to regain the credibility lost in the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner was in discussion with the political parties yesterday before meeting trade unions and employers today.
It should set up a relatively small cabinet composed of technocrats outside Parliament.
"Monti spoke of an important program with many sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, MP for one of the many small parliamentary groups involved in the talks, after meeting with the President of the Designated Council.
For his part, the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, said he expected Mario Monti to call for a vote of confidence in Parliament by Friday to ensure that the new government had sufficient support.
The consultations will end with Mr Monti presenting a limited list, probably from a dozen ministers, to the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr Monti commented on the nervousness of stock and bond markets yesterday, asking for time.
In "democracy, there are precise deadlines" for preparing a government and its program, he stressed, saying "certain that markets will be patient and understand".
Its appointment by the President had initially been welcomed by the markets, but the concern resumed particularly after an unexpected fall in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The Prime Minister-designate should be a team consisting primarily of technocrats, although he stressed that he would like to include "policies".
The new government is expected to last until 2013, the date of the upcoming legislation, he said.
According to the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will gain the confidence of Parliament by Friday.
Mr Monti has committed himself, once he has taken office, to working with the urgency and with the aim of making Italy "re-starring" in Europe.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change".
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its budgetary balance objective in 2013 despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, has called in particular for further rigorous measures.
The Italian "patron of bosses" Emma Marcegaglia, who will see him on Tuesday, also insisted on the need to revive the economy, "because a country that has no growth cannot respect deficit parameters".
Mr Monti, known for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "change of era" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism", the "professor" symbolizing "the challenge of seriousness" and an "other Italy", according to the editorialists.
The great unknown will be the longevity of her team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, because Italy must place by April 2012 200 billion euros of state bonds.
Russian scientist helped Iran's nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, helped Iran develop a detonator that can be used with a nuclear weapon, said an American nuclear risk NGO on Monday.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) is based on the recent report of the International Atomic Security Agency (IAEA) and other documents from this United Nations agency to identify this researcher.
Last week, the IAEA expressed its "serious concerns" about a "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear programme.
According to ISIS, based largely on IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko, born in 1934, had worked for three decades since the 1960s in a Soviet military nuclear centre in Cheliabinsk, Ural, and had been involved in the manufacture of synthetic explosive diamonds.
In 1989 or 1991, he reportedly left the centre to set up a company producing "nano-diamonds" in Kiev.
The economic difficulties of his company would have led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He then allegedly cooperated with the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its last report, the IAEA mentions "strong indications that the development by Iran" of a nuclear detonation system "has been assisted by the work of a foreign expert, who not only knew this technique well, but who, as a Member State has informed the Agency, has worked for most of his career on this technology within the military nuclear programme of his country of origin".
Anti-Muslim crimes and crimes increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims increased by nearly 50% from 2009 to 2010, while other racial and religious violence, according to FBI statistics released on Monday, declined slightly or little progress.
According to these figures, the total number of violence against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, a 49% increase, compared with a 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in crimes against Jews and an overall 14% increase in anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of "hate crimes" increased very slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% were motivated by race differences and 20% by religion differences, according to the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and crimes increase again," said Human Rights First, "the increase in anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant," added the organization in a statement.
"Human Rights First has long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, must be considered a serious violation of human rights," adds one of the organization's leaders, Paul Legendre.
"The U.S. government can and must do more to tackle these abuses," he adds, believing that this could involve improving police reports on "hate crimes."
The "hate crime" in U.S. federal law is a legacy of the time of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation had been passed after Martin Luther King's death to punish violence related to race, skin color, religion, origin and now sex.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
The Twitter micro-blogging site introduced changes in the presentation of its platform on Monday, to allow its users to observe the activity of those they follow, which makes its service a little more similar to that of Facebook.
A new tab "activity" and another "name" allow you to follow more legibly, live the activity of the other "Twittos", the netizens who follow the messages ("tweets") and those who follow you.
This allows you to know if they send messages, if they subscribe to new accounts, if they have favorite messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested "on a small percentage of users in August" before being broadcast across the network on Monday, Twitter spokesperson Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its uninstinctive operation, with somewhat esoteric terms (RT to rebroadcast a message from someone else, #followfriday to recommend following another user) making the happiness of the initiates, thus opens up to a wider audience with a handling more comparable to that of the Facebook and Google+ general public networks.
On the network, users were discussing "tweets" that were decided on the value of this innovation.
"It's useless, invasive, and it looks too Facebook-like," writes @jemb123.
"The Activity feature will help me better track some elements of my Twitter feed," @dannykronstrom said.
Austria
inclusion of a budgetary "golden rule" in the constitution
The government of Austria's major ruling social-democratic/Christian coalition decided on Tuesday to include in the constitution a budgetary "golden rule" in order to reduce public deficits and thus avoid any deterioration by the rating agencies of the sovereign note of Austria (triple A).
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann himself who announced this decision after a Council of Ministers, whereas the Austrian public debt was 74.6%, well above the 60% ceiling set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly below the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece and Spain.
"If Austria's solvency was reduced by only one cranium, from AAA to AA+, we should pay three billion euros more in interest each year," said Vice-Chancellor and Christian-Democratic Foreign Minister Michael Spindelegger.
Austria thus responds to a request from the Eurozone summit in Brussels on 26 October: the Heads of State and Government had then called for the inclusion by the end of 2012 of the reduction of public deficits and a return to the balance of public accounts in the constitution or in a law of the same value.
The scheme adopted by the Austrian Government is close to the "German model", since Germany was the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
By 2017, the structural government deficit will have to decrease by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year and, as of 2017, the federal government's structural government deficit will not have to exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while regional states and municipalities will have to present balanced budgets.
The objective is to bring public debt to 2020/21 under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty.
Strong Yen
Noda threatens new intervention in the foreign exchange market
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would intervene again in the foreign exchange market if the yen continued to rise.
"We will intervene as we did last time if we see excessive volatility" in the yen exchange rate, Mr. Noda explained in the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen rose not far from the historical levels that prompted the Japanese authorities to intervene on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo sold massive yen against dollars in order to lower the value of the Japanese currency that had just set a new record of vigor since 1945 in the face of the green bill.
But the yen has been steadily rising since then, fueled by purchases of investors who consider it a "safe haven" in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar was passed on Tuesday under the 77 yen and the euro descended under the symbolic bar of the 105 yen, close to the levels that triggered the last intervention.
Prior to the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar stood at around 120 yen and the euro at more than 160 yen.
This surge in the Japanese currency undermines the exports of the archipelago as it increases the cost of Made in Japan products and reduces the value of foreign earnings by Japanese firms, when they convert them into national currency.
"Japan has been struggling to rebuild itself" since the earthquake and tsunami of 11 March that devastated the region of Tohoku (north-east), stressed Mr. Noda who fears that this increase in the yen will kill the fragile recovery in the egg.
The third world economic power renewed with growth in the third quarter -1.5% compared to the previous quarter - for the first time in a year, thanks to a rebound in exports and consumption of households hit by the disaster.
But the Prime Minister considered that the cost of the yen did not reflect "the economic fundamentals of Japan".
The Minister of Finance, Jun Azumi, for his part called the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened Tuesday a two-day meeting of its monetary policy council, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
But the deputy governor of the institution, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken "the appropriate measures", suggesting that no further monetary easing was to be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the issuing institution increased its purchases of Treasury bills by 5,000 billion yen (€47 billion) to 55,000 billion yen (€519 billion) to increase the ceiling on its purchases of various financial instruments to flood the liquidity market.
Eurozone:
Rates go up, stock exchanges go up
The risk of contagion of the debt crisis still undermines European indices.
Despite the designation of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of the fragile countries continue to rise.
Still concerned about the stability of the euro area, the European Stock Exchanges are sinking a little further into negative territory, this Tuesday 15 November.
In Paris, at 10 am, CAC 40 loses 1.4% at 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt yields 0.4% and London 0.1%.
"With the new tensions on the yields of euro area countries in difficulty, stock markets around the world continue to make part of their recent gains. "
" Investors, nervous, are just too aware of the risk of contagion, " explains Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange has closed down by 0.7%, suffering in turn from renewed fears from market players about Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
" Japan, like the rest of the world, has eyes on Europe, and trade will continue in a narrow fluctuation corridor until investors have proof that the situation is stabilized, " says Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This renewed concern about the future of the euro area penalises the single currency, which continues to decline on Tuesday.
The euro has been evolving at its lowest level for a month and a half.
Around 10 a.m., the European currency is worth $1,3570, falling by 0.4%.
According to the brokers, it withdrew after the party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, the CDU, meeting in Congress on Monday, adopted a motion providing in particular the possibility for a country in difficulty to leave the euro area without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates well above 6%
The borrowing rates of Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
This Tuesday morning, the yield of Italian bonds at 10 years reached 6.85%, that of Spanish bonds of the same maturity 6.2%.
These tensions over the interest rates of the southern countries, but also in France, continue to fuel the fears of the interveners.
The leader of the future Italian government Mario Monti demanded time from the markets to restore the situation in Italy, threatened with asphyxiation by the weight of his debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos said that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on 27 October would be the " main task" of his government.
Spain is in the forefront of the markets, while legislative elections are held on Sunday in the country.
The spread rate gap between the 10-year bonds of Germany and Spain has reached a new, higher historical level.
Pending growth figures for the euro area
On the statistical side, France recorded an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, a little better than the expected 0.3%, driven by household consumption.
However, INSEE revised the second quarter figure downwards, with a 0.1% decline in gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
And, it's really the fourth one that worries economists the most.
Germany, for its part, recorded a growth of 0.5% over the same period.
A first estimate for the euro area as a whole is expected at 11 a.m., while the European Commission has just warned against the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
the facts must prevail over the dogmas
If it is a subject that cannot be dealt with on short-term or emotional grounds, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affects the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is good that an election meeting is an opportunity to reflect on such issues and the place nuclear power holds in them.
The debate will be fruitful only if it explores the full range of economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
While we are 7 billion people on the planet, demographic change will lead to a doubling of electricity demand by 2050, unless we deprive a huge part of the world's population of a vital element.
At the same time, the scarcity of fossil resources will have to be addressed in order to continue to generate electricity on an ongoing basis, not to mention the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate change, a subject that has disappeared from the environmental debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains isolated in its decision to renounce nuclear power.
It is not the case either of Belgium, which submits its own to the need to be able to find a substitute source capable of replacing itself, nor of Switzerland, which just intends to build only last generation power stations.
Conversely, the Czech Republic, Finland, Poland, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to name but a few, are pursuing their projects with determination.
The United States decided after Fukushima to add a unit to their park by restarting the construction of a power plant interrupted after the Three Mile Island accident.
If the German model, focused on renewable energies, is sometimes presented as an example, reality contradicts speech.
Berlin's choice will result in higher electricity prices, an energy dependence aggravated by the increased use of imported gas, in particular from Russia, a rise in CO2 emissions caused by the construction of gas and coal plants.
In a few months, all these unfortunate effects are already being felt.
The case of Denmark should be considered.
He is also one of the largest users of coal and gas due to wind intermittence, from which he draws 30% of his electricity; according to which his CO2 emissions and the price of his electricity are 65% and 50% higher, respectively, than the European average.
On the other hand, thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity bill than those of French households.
While in a globalised economy the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a pledge to maintain the industrial tool in the national territory, French companies benefit from Europe's cheapest electricity.
As a result, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear power would result in a sharp rise in the price of electricity, which would make the beautiful declarations on the reindustrialisation of our country and the defence of purchasing power illusory.
A price that a large majority of French people refuse to pay, especially since they do not show any opposition in principle to this energy, the polls show this.
Let us remember that our country's energy policy has built an industrial sector of 125,000 direct and 410,000 induced jobs.
Highly exportative, it leads to a galaxy of SMEs specialized in international markets and makes them very job-creating non-localizable.
If France were to decide to get out of nuclear power, it would be to sacrifice many of these SMEs by reducing the annual €6 billion in French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
Which electrician would command an EPR designed to run sixty years while the decline of its manufacturer would be programmed?
To solve the energy equation, it must be admitted that there is no source of miracle electricity production, nor is there any diabolical one.
Areva's development of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable solutions demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
For nuclear, maintaining the highest level of safety is an absolute imperative.
We have in France a security authority that exercises intransigent and transparent control over existing power plants as well as the Flamanville yard.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, are inhabited by the same safety obsession.
In half a century, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious accidents.
Only one, Three Mile Island, intervened under normal operating conditions; it remained without human or environmental consequences.
In Chernobyl, the design of the reactor and the unforgivable human faults caused the drama.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident resulted from two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude that killed tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn from this accident, as it had for the previous two.
As a result of this approach and cooperation between the security authorities, the operators and the French and German manufacturers, the EPR presents a concept that makes it able to resist such phenomena.
While it is considered by all electricians willing to build a power plant, the stop of its construction in Flamanville would be a magnificent gift offered to the competitors of Areva and EDF by leaving them the freeway to seize the leadership in the inevitable development of nuclear power.
It is essential and legitimate to seek the best energy mix for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let the emotion, dogmas and partisan maneuvers dominate such a crucial debate for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various angles - the involvement of the police, judicial and administrative services subject to the policy of the figure, compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of "countries of human rights" of France.
More recently, it was the administrative harassment of foreign students that was the subject of the news, the Minister of the Interior (read Liberation of May 23rd) proclaiming in the passage that France "does not need foreign talents, masons and restaurant servers".
But it is rarely analysed from an economic point of view.
There is a fairly broad consensus between the left and the right on this subject.
To the right, the tone was given by Jacques Chirac who declared in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country with nearly 2 million immigrant workers", and to the left, by Michel Rocard explaining that France "can't accept all the misery of the world" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, the fear of the invasion of the national territory by hordes of Polish plumbers was shared to the left as well as to the right.
On both sides, immigrants are seen as a burden for the French economy and society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity that will be given to immigrants.
In his programme, François Hollande confines himself to trivialities, indicating that co-development will solve our "migration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, is perhaps paid electorally; but it is economically very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron recall in a recent book summarizing the latest knowledge about immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among specialists on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries receiving immigrants.
Restricting anemia immigration growth and harming employment.
Concerns about the impact of migrants are based on the idea that migrants may replace national workers, especially the low-skilled, by putting downward pressure on their wages.
But experience shows that, in reality, immigrants are much more complementary than substitutes to national employees, mostly in occupations in sectors with a shortage of employment.
Low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national employees, and the most skilled in dynamic sectors in which training does not follow job supply.
A positive effect on wages
In the same way that a surgeon will find it difficult to work in a country with a shortage of anesthesiologists, these complementarities between nationals and migrants make immigrants' arrivals have a positive effect on the salaries and employment of nationals.
Giovanni Peri thus calculated that an increase of 1% in migration flows leads to an increase of between 0.6 and 0.9% in real long-term wages.
And this does not take into account the fact that the diversity brought by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (a high proportion of naturalized immigrants among the American Nobel Prizes; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems, on average up to 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The World Labour Organisation estimates, for example, that in Germany, an immigrant who reaches the age of 30 will make a net contribution (revenues less expenditure) of EUR 150,000 to public budgets on average throughout his life.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted, at the beginning of his term, to go and look for the missing growth points "with teeth".
The teeth in question, by being used to deter immigrants, had the exact opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, European democracy remains to be thought of
Democracy is a precious asset; it is also a fragile asset.
The European continent should be able to remember him who, for having invented it in Athens more than two thousand years ago, experienced throughout the twentieth century the tragedies of the Great War, totalitarianisms, the Holocaust, the gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some may have believed that it would be sufficient, for democracy to triumph definitively with its enemies, to exercise the vote, and to exercise it in the most direct way possible.
We know from Napoleon "the Little", that this was an ease of thought.
Universal suffrage, to be the necessary condition of democracy, is not the sufficient condition and can even become an "instrument of oppression" as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a separation and control of powers, an education, the Lights, economic and social solidarity, a justice.
The crisis in Europe we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it is just as much and first of all a crisis of politics and democracy.
The palinody of the true Greek referendum will have had the value of double revealing: that of the necessity of a powerful return of politics, but also of the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, of its incongruity.
This ambivalence must be thought to be overcome.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have now shifted, and that, for many of them, Republican soldiers are no longer shooting in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain from demanding a succession of national referendums, organized according to needs and in scattered order.
A whitewash to the absolute European monarch or a leap on foot attached in the void of the nationalist retreat: what a choice for the citizen!
No, we do not want cutbacks, but a common, full-fledged, serene and continuous exercise of choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - we cannot stop the list anymore - because there is only one crisis, and it is in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe that is bowing to the diktats of markets and rating agencies, which suffer from its powerlessness and lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is humiliated on the international stage.
We are concerned about transfers of sovereignty to Europe - but it is the whole of Europe that slowly loses its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
The urgency is to give back to popular sovereignty the leadership of the European project.
For it is together that Europeans will be able to reduce the burden of their debts, free themselves from markets and prepare for the future by investing.
The exit from crisis will require decisions at European level that cannot be taken without total democratic legitimacy, except of course to lead us to disaster.
After a long fight against this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone is now calling for the European economic government.
That's it.
But thinking about it without stronger political and democratic integration, and lived as such by citizens, would be a new madness and a new impasse.
We must assume a new stage in European construction.
To make the Republic in France, it was necessary to "make" republicans.
The Revolution in the interests could not be enough.
This lesson remains valid.
We need to build a more economically integrated Europe.
This can only be done by building a more democratic Europe politically, a genuine European popular sovereignty.
To make Europe, let's make Europeans.
"No contact" smart cards become widespread
The world smart card fair opens Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, in an optimistic climate.
The year 2011 is expected to end with an increase of 11% in worldwide sales of microprocessor cards (bank card, phone with SIM card...), to more than 6 billion units, according to Eurosmart.
The most important segment is the contactless technology that allows you to pay for public transportation or pay for your purchases by simply approaching a reader's card.
This year, 460 million contactless smart cards are expected to be sold worldwide, compared to 320 million a year earlier!
Their share is expected to increase further in 2012 (580 million units expected) and represent almost 10% of the global smart card market (6,925 million cards).
For a long time behind the Asia-Pacific region, Europe is gaining ground for contactless payment.
Some 26 million Visa cards are already equipped with this feature and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 Visa contactless cards have been deployed.
But the large surfaces put the bites double.
This year, Carrefour issued 2.5 million MasterCard Pass cards without contact.
To move to higher speed, banks now need to equip their customers.
"Two large French institutions have committed themselves to systematically distributing bank cards equipped for the contactless to their customers in the future," announces Gérard Nébouy, Director General Visa Europe France.
Banks Test Mobile Payment
But this is only a first step towards the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
Few devices are now equipped with the NFC (Near Field Communication) technology that is essential for transactions.
"They're late."
"But they should finally have a real boom next year."
"We are counting on the sale of 80 to 120 million units in 2012 worldwide," explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks are taking the lead.
The Farm Credit announced yesterday the launch of a test from December to June next in Caen.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and collaborators will be equipped with a case allowing the payment without contact.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the General Society, too, said yesterday to prepare for the placing on the market of an offer allowing its customers to pay without contact with their mobile.
From Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front extends
Paris is concerned about the links between al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
Long suspected, the links between the al-Qaida terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram are confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Abdelkader Messahel, even said that Algiers has now "acquired the certainty".
"The way the two organizations operate and intelligence reports show that there is good cooperation," he explained without further clarification.
Paris seems to be doing a similar analysis.
The investigation into the abduction of two Frenchmen in Niger last January would have uncovered the gateways.
Kidnapped in a Niamey restaurant by relatives of Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the next day at the same time as several of their kidnappers during an operation launched by the French Special Forces.
In the rubble of the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators had to find several telephone chips belonging to the terrorists.
Terrorist axis
The analysis of the calls made leads to several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two issues are of particular interest to the investigators: one leads to a Nigerian who has long stayed in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram and the other to a man who claims to be close to Aqmi and the sect.
"This is a step forward, but we probably need to wait for more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"It has been known for years that the sect has benefited from external financial and intellectual support and is increasingly active," says Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months these "supports" had been increasingly evident in the evolution and speeches of Boko Haram or in his modus operandi, which now involve the use of increasingly complex kamikazes or explosive devices and the same invoice as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has therefore put pressure on Abuja to take into account the problems posed by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have long regarded the group as a community of illumined people of little interest.
A Fast Success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist magnet Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which means in haussa "Western education is a sin" - advocates the establishment of an Islamic emirate in northern Muslim Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association has a rapid success.
It politicizes itself and demands strict respect for the sharia while its militants engage in the struggle against the ungodly central government.
The latter are aimed primarily at churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram activists were particularly active, increasing attacks on police stations.
Abuja's reaction is, as usual, without nuances.
The army is investing in the city, there are 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested alive, is killed in prison.
From then on the sect will radicalize and leave its fiefs from the north.
Last Christmas, she claimed an attack that killed 80 in Jos, then another in Abuja.
In June, it was again in Abuja that Boko Haram attacked the police's secure headquarters during a suicide attack, his first.
In August, the United Nations headquarters will be its first international target.
The establishment of a terrorist axis in Africa that would travel from Mauritania to Somalia and through Nigeria is now a matter of concern to all security experts.
While Aqmi has invested Mali and Niger, and al-Chebab Somalis operate in Kenya, Boko Haram appears to be a new threat to the heart of the continent.
Last week, during an interview in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned against Boko Haram and said he was ready to "share all the information".
The world according to Republican presidential candidates
On China, Iran, aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry compete for simplicity and ignorance.
Can an America weakened by the crisis manage a complex world with simple or even simplistic ideas?
Listening to Republican presidential candidates, voters might believe that.
For the past few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the others have been multiplying the number of toning statements and short cuts in foreign policy, traditionally a strong republican point.
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, the slogans - often unsupported - fuse.
Mitt Romney, the best placed in the race for the nomination of the "Grand Old Party", threatened to drag the Chinese before the WTO and challenge them "for the manipulation of their currency", a theme bearing in an America exasperated by the migration of entire parts of its industry to Asia.
Too bad if it has to involve the outbreak of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, Obama's former Chinese ambassador and only candidate for a sophisticated foreign policy vision, almost strangled himself in the face of an attitude that "flatters" emotions.
He called for a muscular but constructive dialogue with Beijing (Obama's current position).
But Huntsman, who stagnates in the depths of the polls, remains inaudible.
Like Reagan.
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to stop its nuclear program.
"If I'm elected, I'll stop Iran," he boasted.
"If Obama is re-elected, they'll have the bomb."
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing to meet his obligations to this partner.
Contractor Herman Cain, the second best-placed candidate, shows an embarrassing lack of knowledge of the files.
Recently, he called to counter the Chinese military threat because Beijing "tryes to develop a nuclear capability" - apparently ignorant of the fact that China has held the military atom since 1964!
Texan Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to strike against Iran, says he is ready to engage the US army in Mexico against drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
We're a long way from the 2008 Republican candidate, John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign policy.
The opponents of the current president replied that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the cold war.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to put water in his wine in terms of anti-terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, on the too hasty departure of the "boys" of Iraq, on his misrepresentations in Libya, thus sticking a weak label to him.
But the attack isn't that easy.
The population is rather positive about Obama's national security record, which eliminated Ben Laden.
Since Iraq, she has been wary of military interventions leading to embezzlement.
And, arguing that it is necessary to rebuild America economically to resurrect its leadership, Obama strikes more justly.
North Stream, new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream pipeline, directly connecting Western Europe to Russia through the Baltic Sea, has entered into service.
It must provide gas for the equivalent of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with brilliance.
More than 500 guests including four heads of state and government participated, last Tuesday, on the shores of the Baltic, between orchestra and fine buffet, to the inauguration of the North Stream, this new pipeline that directly connects, under the sea, Russia to Germany.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte turned together the steering wheel of the valve controlling the entry of Russian gas into the western European network.
With this new pipeline, an additional 27.5 billion cubic metres of Russian gas will arrive each year in Western Europe by a first 1224 km tube connecting the Saint Petersburg region with the Land of Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
A second tube is to be completed at the end of 2012, allowing a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas to be delivered, the equivalent of all French consumption.
And we are already talking about the possibility of building a third on the same route.
For Gazprom, the completion in time and time of this huge construction site looks like victory.
The project had been strongly contested by Poland and the Baltic countries.
The North Stream will in fact allow the delivery of gas directly to Germany, avoiding any overland passage through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
As a result, these two countries lose some of their power: it becomes more difficult for them to weigh Russia by threatening to close its access to Western European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw had not hesitated to compare the North Stream with a "new German-Soviet pact", referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That is, whether the subject is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, by supporting this Russian project, has gained greater security of supply.
But it is at the cost of a weakening of the energy Europe, since the project has created a gap between Eastern and Western Europeans.
In just five years Russia has been able to triumph over its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, which are heavily gas-consuming, and whose deposits are declining.
" This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that binds us organically, " confirmed François Fillon by inaugurating this pipeline, demonstrating how political and economic large gas contracts are.
All this explains the wide smiles displayed by the leaders of Gazprom, present in number in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical feat.
The underwater tube is made of concrete-coated steel to protect it from ship anchors.
It rests on the bottom of the sea, at an average of 200 m.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating back to the Second World War.
" A hundred had to be removed or destroyed, as a precaution," says Jens Müller, spokesman for Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to increase the number of measures to protect fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake, as heavy as 242 Eiffel towers, which nothing interrupts over its entire length: neither valve nor maintenance station.
A monitoring platform was planned off the coast of Sweden, but the project leaders gave up while the Swedes were unwilling to see a Russian state-owned company permanently set up off their coasts.
" In case of damage, we stop the gas passage in less than a minute, " says Jens Müller.
In the event of a leak, the gas contained in the pipeline is leaked into the air.
But this case is considered unlikely by the manufacturers who planned the welds to leak every 100,000 years.
Monitoring of the pipeline condition is carried out by a submarine robot, dragged by a ship, for external observation, as well as by an apparatus circulating inside the pipeline.
Of the shape of a cigar, it is introduced inside the tube, one metre in diameter, and it is pushed by the gas.
Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at a speed of 3 metres per second, he delivers accurate information on possible metal deformations.
The pipeline was designed to operate for 50 years without having to undergo any repair.
Gas circulation is simply ensured by pressure.
It's 200 bars from the start, and 100 bars from the finish line.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leader remains Gazprom, who holds 51% of the shares.
The German E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each) joined.
These five companies have established a joint venture, called Nord Stream, to build and operate the pipeline.
It has its headquarters in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased the entire gas transport capacity to Gazprom for twenty renewable years.
" Gazprom will pay for total capacity regardless of the amount of gas actually transported, " says Jens Müller.
The financing of the construction of the pipeline was provided to 30% by shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of the works is expected to be EUR 7.4 billion for both tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment amounted to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure to return to their costs, since only Gazprom assumes the risk.
The pipeline emerges from the Baltic in Lubmin, on a sandy coastline planted with pine trees.
Valves, 4.5 metres high, form the gas outlet door.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specificities of the gas that arrives, before it is transferred to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has received a million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
At full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and in 2012, 6 million.
Moleskine, a notebook.
Created about fifteen years ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to give back the taste of writing.
He has a scent of adventures, of hours spent writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognizable, with its black rectangular cover, its elastic, its leaves of a broken white colour, as aged by time.
However, the Moleskine notebook as we know it today was born... in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided at the time to launch a notebook of design notes but distinguished.
Maria Sebregondi, then consultant for the company, is responsible for launching the new product.
The notebook is inspired by an old production technique, the mole skin (tupe skin), which refers to a varnished cotton used to cover banquets, for example.
This type of notebook was very popular with writers and travellers.
" Moleskine has restored to the taste of the day an old and forgotten object, which was an icon of avant-garde artists, until the 20th century " , says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become responsible for the brand at Modo Modo.
Success is there.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% to 12.7 million pieces.
We are far from the confidential production of the first years, where only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine crosses Italian borders and exports to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to draw a portrait-robot of the buyer, because the notebook of notes attracts both the businessman and the student and the professionals.
Like Moleskine, its consumers are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cultured.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees at its inception, now has almost 100 employees and has two offices since 2008, one in Milan and the other in New York.
She distributes her books in bookstores, from the Fnac to small downtown shops and has been able to impose her identity.
"We have followed the air of time and this new need for writing, despite the rise of emails," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanies the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand launched an exhibition "Detour" where architects or artists exhibit their own notebook.
In August, she also launched a leopard cover on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and this cultural aura, Moleskine has been able to diversify its products: bags, calendar, pens, computer covers... The brand is available on a wide range of media.
A success that made envious: in the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was bought by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, today Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled workers so high?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for a job.
The 15th week for the employment of disabled people opens today.
Despite a proactive public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate for persons with disabilities is still twice as high as the average: 19%, compared with 9% for the entire population.
Disturbing?
" No, " notes Éric Blanchet, Director General of Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of the disabled. "
" The progress made over the past 15 years is considerable. "
" At the time, the unemployment rate was not two but three times higher. "
" Nevertheless, much remains to be done. "
It must be said that for the unemployed with disabilities, there are still many obstacles before they enter employment.
They are rather old: 37% are over 50 years of age (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% do not have a bachelor's degree and of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is widespread: 53% for the disabled, compared to an average of 38%.
In short, these are criteria that make it particularly difficult to return to work, and that are "the node of the problem", according to Christian Grapen, CEO of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help companies recruit disabled workers.
That's for objective restraints.
It remains the unsaid, the mentality that is evolving, certainly, but too slowly.
A study carried out in April by the IMS-Entreprendre pour la Cité association indicated that the managers interviewed had "a low level of knowledge of disability", with "overrepresentation of persons in wheelchairs, mentally or intellectually deficient".
As a result, private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from achieving the employment target of 6% of disabled workers, set out in a law of... 1987.
The latest known figures, dating back to 2008, show a ratio of 2.6%.
" We are now around 3%, " says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, the agency responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not comply with this law.
The evidence: the number of "taxed" establishments, as well as the amounts paid, decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
" The 2005 law, which increased contributions, created strong pressure on companies, " explains Pierre Blanc. "
" But this improvement also reflects real awareness, especially in large groups. "
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59% of establishments with 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers, compared to 82% of enterprises with 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: "Happy"
Before facing the Blues Tuesday night (20:45) Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure of this friendly match.
We won't go until we write that there was connivance between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting side by side on the stage of the auditorium of the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard did indeed make peace.
Five months after the mood of his attacker against Turkey, the Belgian breeder has nothing but praise for him.
"I'm very happy with Eden, his progress and his being Belgian."
"I want to move forward," says the Lillois.
As for the contrast between his services in club and in selection, "it's a whole, has he justified himself."
"In Lille, I'm there all year, which is not the case with Belgium."
"I have to take my marks."
Menaced against Romania Friday night in view of this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally "briller".
However, the notion of "pleasantness" was not omitted.
The Blues, he has encouraged them since the age of 7 and the victorious campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been a supporter," he says.
This must contribute to further strengthening the "particular" character of this meeting.
All the more so, "there is Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)," he said.
"We ran into each other earlier."
"To be able to play against them is only happiness!"
Leekens spoke of "happiness" in good words.
"Fierté" to play "a gala game."
"Pride" also to note - as "neighbour" - that France has "become a very high-level team" a little more than a year after Knysna's trauma.
"Laurent Blanc did a thunderous job," he was excited.
While Belgium will miss the next Euro, the technician would be happy to share the plane with the Blue Directions... Brazil in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are getting big," he said.
"We're building something, the players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You will see it in the next games." The one against France included.
Portugal very confident
Paulo Bento's Portugal starts with a lot of optimism its dam back in front of Bosnia (22:00), this Tuesday in Lisbon.
On the way, the two teams lacked realism.
" At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country. "
Paulo Bento is already there, in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no shadow of a doubt, the Selecçao, of which he has been in charge since September 2010, will qualify for Euro 2012.
Portugal is in fact only 90 minutes away from happiness.
But there's a game to be played, and an opponent, Bosnia, is to be played.
In view of the match going (0-0), Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seems obvious that the games are not done.
Portugal dominated the game for more than an hour, of course, but it was unable to mark this precious goal, which would have relieved it.
" It's a good result, but there's a certain risk that we haven't scored a goal outside. "
But at home, in their bright Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to pass, in front of an audience that should be there as boiling, even if the party is obviously "very tight", said an optimistic but lucid Bento.
" We're expecting a very tight match, but we're absolutely convinced that we can take the lead, " said the 42 - year - old Portuguese coach.
" We continue to have a 50% chance of being at Euro 2012, " said Carlos Queiroz's successor.
The zero reported on Friday in Bosnia obliges Portuguese to score and win.
A zero can be enough for the Bosnians, who also need to score.
" This is a good result, but there is a certain risk that we have not scored a goal on the outside, " regrets Bento.
"We're going to play against a team that has a lot of technical qualities and has players with a lot of individual qualities," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will intend to put maximum pressure on the Bosnians to "not give them time to think."
A good idea, provided it's realistic this time.
