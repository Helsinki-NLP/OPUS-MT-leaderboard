Looks like there's no way out.
We fell asleep.

Why should we help you?
I put the plan into practice.
He made a list.
For a while I was really addicted to Coca-Cola, and I drank it every day.

I might be wrong.
You're afraid to sleep, aren't you?

Keep looking.
When the results are made public, I'll let you know.

Tom is pleased with his success.
You're reliable.
I didn't even consider it.

You can only smoke on the terrace.
I agree with 100%.
These flowers besides being beautiful also have a good scent.
He's in college now, isn't he?
We should call him.
It's interesting how it happened.
You should remember that.
Tom said he likes to teach French.
He pulled a coin out of his pocket.
Are you related to her?
Who broke this window?
I'll go tell them.
If you heard him speak French, you'd trade him for a Frenchman.
He came ten minutes later.
We waited for him yesterday.
Tom said Mary was low.
Where's the exit?
If I remember correctly, Tom sold his car to Mary for just $500.
I'll call you after lunch.
We didn't agree on anything!
It's very unlikely.
No doctor can explain it.
I have to try it.
You're depressed.
You're wasting my time.
Aren't you Mary's husband?

She bought a tea service.
We're all gonna die.
Tom kept crying.
I can't do it yet.
George was out of his mind from anger!

Tom doesn't think he'll win.
Maybe you should listen.
He's a brilliant artist.
Make a move, guys.
I like your painting.
I waited an hour and a half.
I'm not good at math.
Tom refused to say what he did.
I don't like his hat.
I can't be happy when Tom is so sad.
I want to share this with you.
I study at Hyogo University.
We'll take part in the marathon.
Maybe you should tell her.
I know what to study.
His life went smoothly.
Nobody wants to help us.

He's from Sweden.
He didn't have the money to buy the farm.
Did you really believe that?

I feel protected.
You're the tallest.
Isn't that funny, Tom?

That's what Tom was looking for.
What did you do to her?

Don't break my heart.
I don't have any plans for tonight.
Stop being sarcastic all the time!
She was crying.
I wish I could be as rich as you.
We had fun.
It's dishonest.
I often read books.
Tom and I want to talk to you about something.
I can meet you at 2:30.
Tom got angry.
I'm already old.
I have a dirty criminal record.
Good night, my friends.
I bought a book in English from a bookstore.
I'm going to the bookstore tomorrow to buy books.
What would the world be without women?
They tell us funny stories.
Can you hear what Tom is saying?
What's your favorite historical movie?
We can't see her.
Tom and I still love each other.
Tom needs to eat.
All of you, go.
Giant pandas live only in China.
I'm being followed.
Don't say things like that.
Worse and worse!

Stop babbling.
I know her.
The real heroes are us.
We're waiting for Tom.
Unfortunately, my birthday is only once a year.
Put your bike away.
I understood that as a compliment.
They called President Roosevelt a pirate.
I could go to the movies.
It's not a date.
It makes me nervous.
Who do you think told them?
Why did Tom give it to Mary?
Listen to her!
You're good at this game, aren't you?
Take care of them.
I live in the Fiji Islands.
You want to eat with us?
Doesn't sound too surprised.
I don't go to school on Saturdays.

I'm very disappointed.
Tom wants more coffee.
Who do you think is the author of this novel?
I wish you'd called me.
You don't want a job?

Can he write Braille?
I don't know what happened to him.
I'm free today.
Why do you want to kill us?
He ate an apple.
I caught him.
He adopted the orphan.
I guess they speak French.
Step forward.
You need to get more active.
Tom and Mary are joking?
She broke out of the smoke.
I don't have any alternatives.
I think Tom knows who lives in that house.
He's smarter than he is.
What will this summer do?
He got irritated.
Can you speak Shanghaiese?
It narrowed down because I washed it.
Tom was wearing an old pair of shoes.
Tom wondered what happened to Mary.
Something bad happened to them.
How much has he been paid?
They didn't touch anything.
Do you like horror movies?
I know a lot about animals.
Don't hold your breath.
Am I in London?
You're still there with her, aren't you?
This will make a big difference.
Tom didn't have much money with him.
Tom doesn't have a great appetite.
Were you with them that night?
I was running.
The village was dead after sunset.
What's your favorite rapper woman?
Say hello to Tom for me.
It's nice to see you so happy.
I usually swim in summer.
Why is he leaving early?
I'm pretty proud of it.

Here's his picture.
I can depend on my friends.
The experiment confirmed his theory.
Tom is lucky.
Give me the ketchup, please.
It happened that I sat next to her at a convention.
There's no furniture left in the room.
Tom showed up early for the lesson.
He's a little overweight, isn't he?
Who's the man who's playing the piano?
I decided not to do it again.
No, I haven't written it yet.
You have to listen to Tom.
He slept in the car.
Tom and I are going to Boston with Mary.
He spends all his income drinking.
Search harder on Google!
It's not the only problem with your idea.
You talk like you're the boss.
You want me to go with you?
I came to see you.
Does it look familiar?
I'll check your game tomorrow.
So, what am I supposed to tell him?
It's starting to rain.
Are you playing any instruments?
Will they die?
I really like it.
Are you guys coming in?
Tom picked her up.
I don't have feelings.
She's incredibly stupid.
We landed on a lonely island.
It takes patience.
She convinced the teacher.
When's your new novel coming out?
I would never betray her.
Are you aware of any problems?
The mystery remains unresolved.
I will never forget Germany.
Why didn't you call a doctor?
You're good.
How would you like to change it?
It's snowing today.

I can't raise our son on my own.
Go get some milk.
Tom seemed surprised.
I love being right.
Tom married a rich Boston girl.
I forgot whether you drink wine or not.
Who tipped them off?
Have faith in God.
"I'll give 50 grand for this statue. "Who will offer more?"
Why would anyone want to kiss her?
He should have bought a used car.
I'm going to be in the hotel.
I didn't grow up that way.
You can park here.
Please tell him to hurry.
Tom hated her.
I shave almost every day.
I won't apologize.
We really like picnics.
I haven't talked to him yet.
It was a hot summer night.
I walk all the time.
It's decisive.
You're not much fun at parties, are you?
He looked in his bag for the car keys.
I really don't want to talk.
So it must be Argentinian.
I really like my job.
I'd suggest you be more careful.
She's shaken.
He should have done it yesterday.
I'm a big fan of American cuisine.
Tom is dancing with Mary.
Your destiny is in my hands.
No, you don't have to go now.
No one wants to help you.

Tom loves fly fishing.
We have no choice but to risk it.
I don't want to play chess.

You agree with Tom, right?
Tom didn't take much money.

Fear of failure is one of the most widespread fears in the world.
Why are you so jealous?
Do you think Tom killed Mary?
How come you don't have anything to say?
You scoundrels!
Come on, Tom, aren't you curious?
Keep your tongue shut.
I drank the wine.
He's more popular than I am.
When can I get out of here?
You're early again.
We left this.
All I want is to go fishing.
