At the end of the trade, the Prague stock exchange is in the negative
After the fall of Tuesday morning, the Prague Stock Exchange rectified its losses.
Transactions with the ČEZ shares reached almost half of the usual daily trade.
On Tuesday, from the beginning of the trade, the Prague Stock Exchange returned with its fall the previous day, when it lost almost six percent.
This time, the decline is due to the fall in shares on Wall Street.
The reaction of the market to the result of the vote of the American House of Representatives, which refused to adopt the plan of stabilization of the American financial sector, is also noticeable in our country.
Falling stock in Asia
The Asian stock exchanges experienced a dramatic fall on Tuesday, even if the signs succeeded, during the day, in erasing some of the losses.
The Hong Kong Stock Exchange Hang Seng index lost four percent during trade, but later it erased some of the losses and reduced the decline to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index following the Chinese stock market movement in Hong Kong lost 3.8 percent, with markets closed in Shanghai.
The Sydney stock market lost more than five percent, but eventually the losses were reduced to 4.3 percent.
According to its index, the Taiwan Stock Exchange lost 3.6 percent.
"The hesitation about the rescue action in the US will affect the financial markets around the world," observed Joseph Yam, the head of the Hong Kong Monetary Office.
Although Hong Kong is part of China, it establishes its own monetary policy, i.e. independent of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are at the same level as in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, US legislators should quickly resume negotiations and adopt the proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, there would be a risk that other countries would be affected.
The bloodbath of American actions
On Monday, the US House of Representatives rejected the financial system support project, to which it should have devoted up to $700 billion (nearly 12 billion Kč).
Legislators thus renegotiate the call for support of President George Bush's project.
According to Bush, the project should address the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
On Monday, U.S. actions experienced a bloodbath and the major evidence of actions experienced the greatest fall in the last 20 years.
The Dow Jones index lost nearly seven percent, with a fall of such magnitude for the last time in 1987.
The index was already losing during the vote, but when it appeared that the proposal was not adopted, it was in free fall.
Congress gives way: US government can inject $700 billion into banks
The leaders of the U.S. Congress and the government of President George W. Bush agreed on a broader form of the financial assistance agreement to the U.S. financial system.
It will be put to the vote at the beginning of next week.
U.S. legislators made a turning point in the talks on the adoption of a bailout plan in the form of financial assistance of $700 billion (about 12 trillion kroner) granted to the U.S. financial system.
Success is not certain, however.
Before the final version of the Act can be published and put to the vote, Congressmen must complete a number of details of the agreement.
The financial system support plan will be reviewed in the House of Representatives on Monday.
Says Sunday to Reuters Barney Frank, the chairman of the House's Banking and Financial Regulation Committee.
According to sources, on Wednesday at the earliest, the plan should a priori be put to the vote in the Senate.
According to economists, the announcement that the rescue plan will be adopted should be a major psychological factor in reinvigorating financial markets.
Given the complexity of the mechanisms by which market aid can be effective, it will follow a "disillusionment".
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made great progress.
We have settled our differing views on the form the market stabilization package should take," democrat Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg Agency.
According to her, the final vote could be taken as early as Sunday.
On the night of Saturday to Sunday, representatives of the legislators met with US finance minister Henry Paulson, in order to give the government a final form.
It should buy back from financial corporations the unsoldable real estate assets that result in considerable losses to financial enterprises and threaten the stability of the system as a whole.
"We are about to agree on a plan that will work and that must also be effective in the market.
We still have to continue this market recovery plan, but I think we are there," says Paulson.
A signal for Asian exchanges
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on the declining stock markets.
According to the Democratic Senator, do not escape Harry Reid, the legislators are making sure that Congress reaches a final agreement on Sunday.
They want to calm investors before the start of trade in Asian financial markets, which are located in the first time zone, where the Congress' decision could influence trade on Monday.
At the moment, however, it is impossible to specify with certainty when the two Chambers of the American Congress will proceed to the vote, or if the negotiations are not likely to be blocked, at the last moment, by a particular problem.
Legislators hope that it will be adopted in the coming days.
Nevertheless, there will be many amendments to the law.
The total amount allocated to the system shall be divided into two parts.
The first $350 billion, as President George Bush wanted, must be available as soon as possible.
But, if Congress feels that the program is not fulfilling its function, it has the possibility to block the remaining amount by two steps: first, an additional $100 billion, and then, finally, $350 billion.
Bush hailed progress in negotiations
Although the President can veto this decision, the Congress has the opportunity to put it as a minority.
Despite these changes, the main idea of the program, which was to obtain finance for the purchase of bad real estate securities, whose value fell, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to pay their mortgages, was maintained.
"All work is done.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the bill on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
US President George Bush himself is pleased with the progress in the negotiations.
His spokesman Tony Fratto said that Mr. Bush was pleased with the progress made on Saturday and appreciated "the bipartite effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy."
Limitation of golden parachutes
Chair of the Senate Banking Committee Christopher Dodd, Chief Negotiator, said that legislators agreed on the responsibility of the financial program, the protection of contributors against losses, the discount agreement, and the progress of the plan on the axis of time.
The new law also provides for the limitation of such golden parachutes for directors of the companies participating in the program and establishes a committee, which will oversee the fund.
The latter should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on this issue and made significant progress towards an agreement that will work and be effective for the market and for all Americans," said Paulson.
The plan also provides assistance for real estate owners, who have problems paying.
The government should negotiate new advances in the case of mortgages that it will buy back, while reducing the monthly payments of the debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological Aid
According to Patria Finance Chief Economist David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but its realization will be very difficult.
"And this is due to the fact that we don't know what the mechanism and price of buying back problematic assets will be.
This point will be decisive in deciding on the sharing of losses between the financial sector and the government," Marek said this week to the iHNed.cz server.
If the plan is adopted now, or at the beginning of next week, it is not, according to Marek, as important as that.
"It is much more important that the congressmen agree this week that they support this plan and that we dedicate it as soon as possible.
This psychological significance of the agreement, providing for the adoption of the plan, matters most at the moment," Marek stressed.
An extreme struggle: MP3 players against mobiles.
We'll advise you, how to choose
While virtually all mobiles can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can call.
It seems clear that it is better to buy only one phone.
However, there are sufficient reasons to obtain an independent reader.
The choice depends entirely on the method of use and the requirements of the future owner.
It would be absurd to buy a high-end expensive gramophone for the house to put on Maxim Turbulenc's new album.
On the one hand, such musical products do not come out on vinyl disc, and, from the point of view of quality, there is no objective reason for this to happen.
Now, if there's vinyl discs in your shelves packed together, with rock art, jazz or blues, you're probably dreaming of such a gramophone.
The same is true of music during the journeys, that is, compressed music, to say it in a simplified way - music in MP3.
There, too, there are categories depending on price and quality.
For one, it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a player, just as a Pink Floyd fan would have trouble supporting earphones purchased for twenty crowns at the market.
These are two extremes, between which there is enough room for everyone.
The choice is wide.
Battery life is also decisive
Some high-end music players are capable of much more than just playing music, but these are functions that are, of course, unknown to most mobiles.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
Alongside the primary functions, phone calls and texting, he is able to read music and movies, record them, he has a camera of varying quality and can, for example, even be used for navigation.
And if you take Smartphones and communicators into account, you'll have a small computer in your pocket.
Since no refrigerator knows how to grill meat and no television will take photographs, we are witnessing a miracle.
However, the universal character of the mobile is not without disadvantages.
The greater the number of functions you use, the shorter the interval between two recharges.
And music reading is one of the most important energy gophs.
There are few mobiles that are able to play music for ten to twelve hours, in most cases this figure is significantly lower.
In this regard, music players (especially the rudimentary ones) are significantly more performing.
In the case of cheap mobiles, count that they will only play music for a few hours.
If, in addition, you sometimes call from time to time, get, to be sure, a second refill for work - this being valid even for the most expensive devices.
The problem will not arise for MP3 players, who are capable of continuous operation of at least 9 hours, including the least performing, after reloading.
Another problem occurs when recording music in the mobile.
Unfortunately, a limited part of the devices has a universal USB connector, especially since not all can be directly connected to the computer without special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but few card readers know how to do it without reduction, given the tiny dimensions of memory cards used in mobile phones.
As far as players are concerned, you don't need any software, except (iPod).
Simply fill, through the USB connector, the music device from the computer.
Most mobiles and readers will create a media library themselves classified according to the name of the performer, the title of the album, the style, or then according to the user's judgment.
Some devices only display an index with a tree structure, like Windows Explorer, others are capable of both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Readers are easier to handle, mobiles have more know-how
In the choice of a concrete device, you are particularly interested in the life of the accumulator, the capacity of memory, the quality and type of sound output and, of course, the ease of ordering.
If the music is for you, essentially, a background noise and if in the day you will listen to it that for a limited time, for example by taking the tram, you just need any mobile reading the MP3s.
Practically all mobiles are capable of this today.
You don't even have to pay too much attention to the music formats that the mobile or the player is able to read.
Everyone gets to read the MP3s and the vast majority of the music that will reach you will just have this format.
It is one of the most common formats, and apart from it, the vast majority of devices can also play WMA format music.
The AAC (format used by Apple and its iPods) is less common.
High-end mobiles also allow, for example, the purchase of online music.
Simply visit, from the mobile phone, the corresponding operator's web pages (or those of another provider) and buy the song or album in question.
This service alone should be a compelling reason to obtain a musical motive.
The offer of operators is unfortunately miserable and is limited in most cases to fast-made radio tubes.
Prices are not the lowest either.
However, it is generally considered that this way of buying music (whether via GSM, the Internet or even the wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always wear their mobiles on themselves.
Every time you want to listen to something, you just need to get the mobile out of your pocket, while you forgot your MP3 player at home.
However, it is also important if you still have headphones on you or a handsfree with connection.
If not, you can use built-in speakers, which have virtually all mobiles, but a minimum of MP3 players.
For many, the main advantage of musical mobiles is their price.
The cheapest ones normally cost less than three thousand.
For a price of three four thousand crowns, you can have a walkman already very suitable.
However, in most cases, you will be limited by the absence of an output for ordinary headphones.
The price of the best telephones and the best equipped, also equipped with an entrance for ordinary headphones, does not exceed fifteen thousand.
Readers, on the other hand, have the advantage of having an easy command.
Really anyone can ensure the order of the rudimentary readers - who do not necessarily correspond to the less expensive (cf. our choice).
A minimum of functions; and the similarity of the command with that of a cassette station, commonly used in the past, or of a gramophone, is obvious.
There is no risk of collision in the form of a mobile internet that is randomly connected, followed by a huge data transmission invoice.
Which device to choose
Even the cheapest mobiles (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable memory cards (type M2, microSD, and so on).
Even taking into account the additional purchase of such a card, you will not exceed two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
The basic models support in principle only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive ones even come out with 8GB memory cards.
If you already own a mobile phone and still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take a Cowon, a Creative, a Sony, a Samsung, an Emgeton, or an irivar.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you should not spend more than 1,100 kroner.
If you are one of the most demanding listeners, choose more specialized mobile-walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices are equipped with independent control keys for MP3, and thus the ease of the control is close to that of an independent MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, whose walkman series mobiles have the same user menu as MP3 players sold separately, is the one that went the most in this field.
The same service, in the same price category, but with a memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and a battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours) higher, is provided by an MP3 player produced by one of the above mentioned brands.
A first virtual operator will win the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe.
The mobile market in Chechnya is relatively advanced, with our operators offering virtually the same services as their partners in Western Europe.
Despite this, we still lack something - a virtual operator, which would force conventional operators to lower prices.
Maybe he won't be missing for a long time.
We have already mentioned, on many occasions, Mobil.cz that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
ČTÚ (Czech Telecommunications Office), which reported that the price of an SMS was higher in our country than in the rest of the Union, confirmed this.
Thus, following the European Commission's latest steps in the area of roaming charges regulation, a paradoxical situation may occur - SMS sent from abroad will be for some customers of cheaper Czech mobile operators than in the country.
How is it possible that prices in Chechnya remain so high, in comparison with Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition that would really like to enter the fight.
This may seem paradoxical, given that we still have three mobile networks and a penetration that is well above 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this, Pavel Dvořák, the President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTÚ), who has stated on several occasions that there is no room for another operator in the Czech Republic, is chorus with the operators.
It is probably true that a conventional operator with its own network is apparently no longer very lucky (in fact, now it would find only frequencies difficult).
However, there is still a possibility - a virtual operator.
It was precisely the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market that led to a considerable fall in prices, to which the traditional operators had to react.
However, even before the riots such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile entered the market, voices similar to those heard today at home were heard in Britain.
However, it appeared that there was still room for such operators and that they could have a real success.
We do not have to go too far to find examples.
In February we informed you of the launch in Poland of the virtual operator Mobilking.
In just six months, this operator managed to earn more than 100 thousand customers and become the fifth operator in the country.
Let's add that behind Mobilking there is the financial group Penta, which owns, among other things, the U:fon in Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual operators is the possibility of focusing on a much more concrete target group.
For their operation to be effective, they need far fewer customers than a conventional operator.
They are, in fact, exempt from the relatively high costs of construction, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
For example, in the world, virtual operators profile themselves as low-cost operators - they offer cheap calls and SMS, which is often counterbalanced by a limited service offer.
For example, Tesco Mobile offers text messages in Britain at least twice as expensive as its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, betting on an unusual target group can also be a good publicity hit.
Indeed, this operator specifically targets men.
"The real men choose Mobilking - an operator they like and can trust," says David Seibert, the CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, who operates this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say, if such a concept would be likely to work at home as well.
Miroslav Čepický, Vodafone's spokesperson, in doubt: "The Czech market is relatively small for a segmental approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
Especially since it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the provision of services."
In the Czech Republic, no chance, say mobile operators
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual operator in Chechnya, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are discussing the expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations are not very encouraging.
The Mobilking launch will instead take place in other countries in our area," said in a telephone interview for Mobil.cz Jana Studničková, spokesperson for the financial group Penta.
It thus indirectly confirmed that the operators in the Czech Republic were, in any case, not in favour of this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do everything possible to prevent a potential competitor from appearing.
The GTS Novera group, which would like to take a new step in order to become a real competitor of Telefonika in the field of customers company, has not, for a long time, hidden its intention to launch a virtual mobile operator.
"We very much want to be able to offer our customers not only fixed telecommunications services, but also mobile.
And the sooner the better.
We have already conducted negotiations on this possibility on several occasions with all Czech mobile operators.
With some, we have managed to move forward in the negotiations," said Pavel Kaidl.
So the future may be promising.
According to unofficial information, it seems that perhaps we could accommodate the first virtual operator already by the end of the year.
But for the moment, his creation is accompanied by total silence.
"At the moment, we do not believe that there is room in the Czech market for a virtual operator as such.
The Czech market is in comparison with other very specific ones.
For the time being, no subject with a complex and serious project in this field has contacted us," said Vlastimil Sršeň of the press department of Telefonika O2, in his statement for Mobil.cz.
Other operators also refer to the specific nature of the Czech market.
T-Mobile spokesman Martina Kemrová states in a rare agreement with O2's statement: "We have not yet registered a viable and bilaterally advantageous project, which could serve as a basis."
She adds: "It is virtually impossible for a virtual operator to appear in the T-Mobile network by the end of the year.
To operate in such a limited period of time, we should now have a concrete agreement."
Vodafone instead directs its attention to the completion of requests to obtain its own 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický said: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, especially in the area of shared costs and infrastructure.
This, in our view, means the most input from the customer's point of view.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is the discovery of a partner to set up a common network for a fast mobile internet."
Responsible authorities: in line with operators
The approach of mobile operators is easily understandable, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would have led to a decrease in prices and therefore to a decrease in their profit.
What is the point of facilitating the arrival of such a competitor?
When it comes to their interests, the operators know how to agree to themselves as larrons at fairs. The chicane accompanying the creation of the U:fon also bears witness to this.
The greatest apparent pressure on ČTÚ during the creation of U:fon was exerted by T-Mobile.
This is demonstrated by the information available to the public from the ČTÚ web pages.
Today, the U:fon lends itself as an argument not to accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová noted: "Competition in the mobile market has also recently been amplified by the entry into the market of a fourth mobile operator.
Given the character of the mobile market in RT, it is obvious that the entry of an additional player would subject him, and especially his services, to high demands."
But given the attitude of the mobile operators here, the indifference of the Czech regulatory bodies seems disconcerting.
However, this is not just the attitude of ČTÚ, which, unlike Britain and other developed countries, unfortunately does not have the power to intervene in economic competition in Chechnya.
The latter belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (ÚOHS).
However, in the face of this problem, the latter adopted its typical position.
"The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible following the conclusion of an agreement between a mobile operator and the virtual operator concerned concerning the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
No such agreement has been concluded at this time, as the offer of potential stakeholders has previously not presented sufficient interest for conventional operators," said Kristián Chalupa of the UOHS Department of External Relations in response to our question.
Such a statement would not surprise operators' representatives.
But on the part of an Office, which must represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, take care that no one benefits from its position on the market, such a declaration is more than confusing.
All the more so as Kristián Chalupa adds: "Across the country, where virtual operators are normally present, it can be seen that their entry into the market has contributed to a decrease in the prices of mobile telephone services."
However, pressure for an honest functioning of the market and a fall in prices does not appear to be part of UOHS's interests.
What is indeed shocking is the almost touching agreement of the three mobile operators, which stems from their reactions.
The question, if it really is a coincidence, arises quite naturally.
In the same way, a price of gasoline strictly identical to all service stations is probably due to chance and the tough fight of competition.
"The Office has not identified any signs of anticompetitive behaviour in this regard, so there is no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators has a dominant position, therefore none has a corresponding increased responsibility for its behaviour on the market.
The tools needed to open the mobile market to virtual operators are probably missing even from the telecommunications regulator," said Chaloupa in his statement.
One of the many points of disagreement is the interpretation of the dominant position on the market.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by ČTÚ, according to which telecommunications constitutes, from the point of view of economic competition, a single market.
None of the Czech operators has a dominant position in such a market.
However, some legal experts suggest another view of things: for the creation of a virtual operator to be possible, the consent of the network operator must be obtained at each time.
And the mobile operator has quite logically monopoly over its network.
This is how he necessarily plays a dominant role in a certain segment of his activity.
However, even without accepting this argument, it should be at least worrying for the UOHS that three mobile operators are proceeding visibly in a similar way.
However, complaints from many interested parties (including GTS Novera, already mentioned) show that they face similar constraints in negotiations with all operators.
Bringing responsibility back to the ČTÚ is a fairly common turn in communications, through which the ÚOHS washes its hands of the case.
We have already encountered this type of attitude in several similar cases.
Regrettably, the recently adopted new telecommunications law has not succeeded in extending ČTÚ's powers in the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although many specialists have promised to improve the situation.
The representatives of UOHS must know this very well, but their interests seem to be elsewhere.
When no one looks, it can work.
However, the operation of a kind of virtual pseudo operators, many in Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
These are companies that publish their own price lists for mobile telephone services, but the latter are only partially public.
In most cases, there are companies dealing with multi-level marketing.
For example, private mobile telephone services are offered by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others.
The price lists of these firms usually reach only elected officials.
The magic trick consists in the fact that the company does before the operator is a classic company customer, who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, she obtains special price offers (and others).
What is problematic is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such a resale.
"If this were to happen, it could be a breach of the contractual conditions that we would examine and that could lead to a cessation of cooperation with the company in question," answered our question on this issue Martina Kemrová.
However, it is quite unlikely that an echo of such an activity has not reached the managers of mobile operators.
Particularly in the case of the three companies mentioned there may be thousands of customers.
An operator, however, does not rule against such a procedure.
Indeed, the activities of these companies bring them non-negligible profits, and at the same time, as opposed to the real virtual operators, they do not threaten them at all with their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický states the possible problems: "The law allows such speculations, however, the services of these companies are only used by a negligible percentage of customers.
In addition, they are forced to admit that the SIM card in their phone is not registered under their name, so they cannot fully dispose of it, in the way of ordinary customers of mobile operators."
That is precisely what should seem strange at ČTÚ.
In addition, another question arises in the UOHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes to such a procedure, why do they block the creation of a virtual operator?
It should be added that the UOHS has relatively broad powers to disclose such an activity, and if it does not wish to content itself with the explanations of the operators, who claim to have no idea that this would happen, their contractual conditions prohibit it.
When we're no longer the most expensive country
As we have already mentioned on several occasions, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has led to a considerable fall in the price of services.
In virtually all the countries where virtual operators appeared, conventional operators were sometimes trying harder, sometimes less, to prevent their creation.
The arguments used by the latter were virtually the same - a market too small or even too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
It was precisely at this level, however, that regulators in developed countries intervened, which defended not the interests of mobile operators but those of their customers.
Both through formal measures and informal pressure, they eventually got the creation of a first virtual operator, followed by others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies treat this issue in the same way as a hot potato that is disposed of by passing it on to a nearby target.
As a result of the experiences we have, we cannot get rid of the impression that confusion in skills is more than beneficial to them in these cases.
But let's not throw the handle after the punch.
If the behind-the-scenes information is true and a virtual operator will soon appear in our home, the Czech mobile market may be back on the move.
If one of the operators has accepted the creation of a virtual mobile operator, the ÚOHS will hardly be able to remain unfettered in the face of the rejection (discrimination) of other interested parties.
And perhaps we will stop calling more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four achievements of the new version of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, on the occasion of Czech Citizenship Day, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek solemnly presented the new recordings of the national anthem Kde Domov můj (Where is my homeland?).
The anthem was again recorded by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
We have four versions - with a male or female solo song, an interpretation with chorus and an instrumental version.
The song is performed by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček are the authors of the anthem arrangements.
You can listen to the four new versions on the iHNed.cz server.
Bělohlávek considers Czech national singing as one of the most beautiful hymns.
As he had previously entrusted to Český rozhlas (the Czech public radio), he chose for the interpretation of solo versions of singers with young and representative voices, which are marked and appreciated.
"From the beginning, I was trying to make sure that the two singers, as well as the choir, had a good diction, so that we could understand the words, which they sing simultaneously," he said.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde domov můj played for the first time in 1834 on the boards of Stavovské divadlo (the Theatre of States) in Fidlovačka (Kermesse of Saveters), original Czech play by Josef Kajetán Tyl, accompanied by the music of František Škroup.
It became popular and people spontaneously appropriated it.
After the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, the first couple became naturally an integral part of the national anthem.
It remained one of the seven national symbols even after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
How the "new" anthem sounds
Pragian public transport (MHD) will introduce the chip into their ticketing system on Wednesday
On Wednesday 1 October 2008 will be inscribed in the history of the Pražský Dopravní podnik (the Prague Transport Agency) as the date on which the first passengers will board the metro, trams and buses, which, instead of having a paper ticket, will have an electronic coupon in their pocket.
At the moment, it is accessible to about 100 thousand people, owners of the Opencard smart card.
Passengers can purchase a coupon 30 days or 90 days (this will be valid from 1 January 2009) and at the same time have it recorded on their smart card at the information points and offices of the Dopravní podnik (the Transport Agency), located at the metro stations Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
From yesterday, there is also the possibility to buy coupons via internet on the Dopravní podnik web pages: www.dpp.cz.
Over four hundred people took advantage of the service during the morning.
Those who will start using the online store can permanently forget the counters in the subway stations, where they had to trample impatience in long queues to get paper tickets.
In fact, they will buy their coupon online and will be recorded on their Opencard card in one of the thirteen Městská knihovna (municipal libraries).
"At these points of contact, there is a desk available to passengers with trained staff, who will help interested people with the purchase by internet and, in addition, will record the coupon they have bought on their card," says the spokesperson for the Martin Opatrný project.
Next to the libraries, it will also be possible to record the electronic coupons on the Opencard in vending machines installed in the vestibule of several metro stations.
What do these distributors look like?
They are red, remind the machines to compose the tickets and the passengers have perhaps already noticed them in the metro stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Today, the city has five, but by the end of the year, there should be eighty," said Opatrný.
An automatic will control the coupon instead of the driver
The automatics that will work from tomorrow, are easy to use.
Simply enter the Opencard smart card and the coupon previously purchased will register itself on the card.
The electronic coupons are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in the surroundings of the city.
In the peri-urban trains and bus lines 300 to 499, which are mainly used by the inhabitants of the communes of the Central Bohemia to access the capital.
"In integrated trains in Pražská integurovaná doprava (integrated transports from Prague), controllers are equipped with card readers, using which they establish the temporary and zonal validity of coupons;" explained the control of Filip Drápal tickets of the Ropid organization, which designs the schedules of the Prague public transports.
Peri-urban buses are equipped with card readers integrated into the driver's body.
When boarding it is therefore necessary not only to show the smart card to the driver, but also to place the Opencard at the place indicated on the side of the body.
This is how the driver checks the validity of the registered coupons.
"In case the passenger needs to verify the validity of the registered coupons, there is nothing simpler than asking the driver for this information," Drápal completed.
Passengers who do not take peri-urban buses and will not remember the date on which their coupon expires, can again join the vending machines, originally used to save coupons on the map.
This is where, on the device screen, the information about the validity of their document will be displayed.
The Sudetens demanded a referendum in the USA
The Germans of the Sudeten asked in 1945 for Šumava to be integrated into the United States.
This stems from a letter deposited in the collections of the Jihočeská vědecká knihovna (The Scientific Library of the South Bohemian).
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
In 1945, some Sudeten German groups allegedly addressed the President of the United States with such a desire.
This stems, among other things, from a preserved letter in a private archive, which is now deposited in the collections of the Jihočeská vědecká knihovna.
Germans from Český Krumlov in the letter ask the US President not to allow "šumavská župa" (forest region south of Bohemia) - annexed by Hitler under the Munich Agreement - to be returned to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation well and want to be sure that the words proclaiming that American troops come into German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," is written in the letter, "People, to whom the fate of Šumava is dear."
Since the accession to Czechoslovakia is supposedly promising - knowing the Czech national character - only of brutality, attitude without regard, misunderstanding, oppression and servitude, the authors of the letter ask the American President to take over the Šumava protectorate for now and forever.
"We cannot believe, that you would grant this territory to a foreign state to us, that oppresses and destroys minorities and that in no way contributed to the victory of the Allies without taking into account the opinion of the quarter of a million inhabitants," is written in the letter.
The alleged reason why the authors cannot sign the letter is the fear of the desire for revenge of the "Czech oppressors".
If the president of the United States doubted the opinion of the Germans of Šumava, he would have only to organize, according to the authors of the letter, a referendum in the region to establish whether its inhabitants wanted to be part of the United States, or live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text contained in the letter may, given the current knowledge of post-war history, seem somewhat naive, according to some survivors, it illustrates well the expectations of the Germans of the Sudetenians of the time.
While the Czech Germans had at least to see that the question of their expulsion from the Republic would arise, very few of them admitted such a possibility.
Some were waiting for the United States and Great Britain to gain some kind of autonomy for the Sudeten.
Others believed that they would simply remain in Czechoslovakia.
The famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice, confirms this.
During the war, he was, as a German of České Budějovice, engaged in the navy in the Baltic countries.
When he was captured by the English at the end of the war and placed in the capture camp of the Holstein region, dozens of Czech Germans came to him to learn Czech.
"They believed that once they returned home, the Czech would benefit them," said Chalupa.
None of the captured Germans who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war believed that, following the Beneš Decrees, he would be expelled from the republic.
You don't think - you pay!
An emotional campaign will attack the drivers
The most expensive road safety action in Czech history.
A way to characterize the emotional media campaign that the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday.
Minister Aleš ňebíček's office believes that it will discourage drivers from dangerous driving behaviour.
This 150 million-dollar campaign will appear on television, radio, cinema, the Internet, but also on leaflets.
It should discourage drivers of fast driving and driving alcohol.
But also remind them to take the belt before starting.
Above all, it wants to reach the consciousness of young drivers, bikers, pedestrians, not to mention professional drivers.
What will appear in the spots?
Especially personal stories that will attack emotions.
It also bears witness to the "bloody" slogan of the whole campaign:
You don't think - you pay!
The phrase "You don't think about it" is inscribed in capital letters on the registration plate.
Then, in a pool of blood, there is the phrase "You will pay".
Which must symbolize that you can pay for life a moment of inattention.
The spots will "haunt" viewers until 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where images with drastic images of accident victims can be seen commonly.
It estimates that this will lead to a decrease in the accident rate and the number of deaths on Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
The strategy of sugar and whip against drivers
"What works with drivers is the sugar and whip system.
For them, sugar is represented, for example, by saving time when they grill a red light.
The whip is the threat of a fine or an accident.
The risks must be reminded of the drivers," said Martin Kořán, transport psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital.
This is how we need information campaigns in the press and, above all, negative publicity, says the psychologist.
In his view, the signs indicating the danger to drivers are already less effective.
"When a static panel warns against danger, it will probably soon merge with the environment and drivers will not notice," Kořán said.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
Ehud Olmert, President of the Israeli Provisional Government, called for the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He made this statement in an interview published on Monday by the daily Yedioth Ahronoth.
"We have to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to make almost all the territories (occupied), if not all," Olmert said daily.
"We will keep a certain percentage of the territory, but we will have to hand over to the Palestinians a similar percentage (of the Israeli territory), since without that, peace will not be made," he added.
He admitted that the possible restitution would include East Jerusalem.
"He who desires security in Jerusalem, and above all does not want tractors and bulldozers to crush his feet, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up parts of Jerusalem," Olmert noted, referring to the two attacks in the city in July, in which several people were killed and dozens of people injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Mount, the sacred and historical places" located inside the Old City.
"He who wishes to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will be forced to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It won't work," he said later.
Retreat of the Golan Heights
Olmert also supported Israel's retreat from the Golan Heights, which he believed was an indispensable condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
That would also require some effort from Damascus.
"I do not propose to conclude peace with Syria solely on the basis of a retreat from the Golan," he said.
"The Syrians know very well what they will have to give up to get the Golan.
They will have to give up their current relations with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with Hezbollah (Shiite movement); they will have to give up the constant support they give to the terrorism of Hamas (Shiite movement), Al-Kaïda (terrorist network), as well as that of the Jihad (Holy War) in Iraq," the Prime Minister said.
Questions that arise after the accident: Are stewards in the bus illegal?
The law ignores them; walking in a long distance bus is forbidden
In the context of the tragic accident of the bus company Student Agency near Padua, Italy, the question arises whether stewards and passengers can travel within the bus during the journey.
"If the law is to be strictly and formally respected, the activity of a steward is contrary to the road traffic law," said the spokesman for the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
The accident in question, during which a 22-year-old hostess died, was apparently caused by the driver of a truck that crossed the bus path.
The girl was, unfortunately, sitting next to the driver in the most dangerous seat of the vehicle, although she had two other seats at her disposal.
However, the coach may have an accident or even suddenly brake, also when the steward serves the coffee or distributes the newspapers.
What matters is whether the bus is under its technical specification equipped with standing or not seats.
If this standing seating equipment is not approved, passengers must remain seated.
The long distance buses Student Agency do not have standing seats; this was confirmed in Aktuálně.cz by the director of the company Radim Jančura.
"This is a matter that we discussed with the Department and, at first, it prohibits any movement of passengers.
Then they cancelled it and we got that passengers can go to the toilet during the ride provided they have their own seat," he revealed his position.
The law ignores stewards
"There is no one-size-fits-all legal interpretation of the role of steward - no legal requirement deals with this role.
On the other hand, no legal requirement also prohibits the carrier from offering services.
The law on road transport knows only the term of vehicle receiver; it does not define its rights and duties," added the spokesman, Hanzelka, more ambiguously.
Josef Pokorný, director of the Road Traffic Department, believes, on the contrary, that the law sufficiently addresses the issue.
"It all depends on whether the coach has permission in its approval to offer standing seats.
Everything resides in it," he says.
The buses are divided into urban ones, where there are standing places and a limited maximum speed, tolls with standing places and a higher permissible speed and long distance buses without standing places with the highest permissible maximum speed and seats equipped with safety belts.
As on the plane, says an expert
Jaroslav Hořín, expert at BESIP (road traffic safety) in transport safety, does not see the movement of stewards on board as a major problem.
"In regular traffic, there is no danger. The situation can be compared to that of service in aircraft.
Nor is it safe when turbulence occurs and the hostess of the air can hit her head."
"But in the event that the bus would have stopped abruptly, the laws of physics would obviously be valid.
In the same way as on an urban bus or tram.
The carrier must manage the safety of stewards by means of internal requirements," he says and also believes that from the point of view of the law, the problem is not solved.
Jančura is ready to delete these services
Student Agency is the only bus carrier to offer steward services.
He's hiring two hundred.
Even after this accident, the director does not consider their profession to be a risky one.
"However, as soon as I get the impression that it's a risky trade, I'll delete it.
Passengers can receive their coffee and newspaper at boarding.
It would also reduce costs," he said.
The safety concern is the reason given to the absence of stewards in his vehicles by the director of the Asiana Alexei Litvine, who ensures, in comparison with SA, a very small number of lines.
"We don't have a hostess, we've been opposed from the beginning.
Sooner or later this will end in a fatal accident," he said, a year ago, at Týden.cz.
A huge tragedy has arrived
A young hostess from the Plzeň region, who had been working for the company for two years, died during the accident on the Naples line.
A Slovenian truck probably left the emergency stop strip without using a flasher and blocked the way to the bus.
The driver of the latter tried to avoid it by means of a sudden maneuver, but he strove on his right side.
Jančura refuses that the two seats reserved for the stewards' rest were sold.
"In the case of long distance lines, it is not possible to reserve these places, they are blocked."
The company intends to file a complaint against the truck driver.
For the compensation of the girl's family, the agency will not wait for the court's judgment, but with regard to financial compensation, it also relies on the culprit.
An amendment to the law?
Not in view
An amendment to the Act, which has been being prepared for more than a year by a group of thirty experts from the Ministry of Transport, could provide details on the journey of stewards on board the coach.
"But it did not come to any conclusion on this point.
In fact, she is not too interested in buses, but rather in the point system, the maximum speed on the motorway and the use of the mobile at the wheel," said expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider stewards' activity to be something that would fundamentally endanger passenger safety," concludes Spokesman Hanzelka, stating that the control of the safety of buses is under the authority of the police and the Office for Safety at Work.
The hopes of the Düsseldorfers rest on Frankfurt.
The key words were not lacking in the letter from the WestLB steering committee to the employees of the house.
By a union of the entities of the Düsseldorf Financial Institute with the Frankfurt Deka-Bank, "the central financial market institution of the Sparkasse Financial Group" could be established, according to the letter published on Monday.
WestLB would bring a "competence block" coupled with sustainable productivity in such a case.
In short, such a relationship could be the decisive start to other mergers in the Länder banking sector.
This is what it looks like when a steering committee wants to demonstrate its ability to act in difficult times.
Because WestLB, injured, is still under heavy pressure.
It is not only the European Commission, but also the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Authority that has only recently made it clear to the government of North Rhine-Westphalia that time was available for the search for a future solution.
However, for some time now - also on the side of Frankfurt - there has been a connection of some form between Deka Bank, which knows Sparkasse's customers through their investment funds, and WestLB.
It is true that the head of the Deta-Bank Franz Waas announced at the presentation of the figures for the semester end of August that he saw no meaning in the merger of the house of the Mainzer Landstrasse with a bank of Land, be it the Helaba or the WestLB.
However, the board of directors of the Deka, each of which is supported by the banks of the Länder and the savings banks groups, instructed the steering committee to conduct talks with WestLB for joint commercial activities.
It could then be the flow of the financial market, or parts of it.
However, the talks have only just begun, it is said in the financial place.
This is not the first time that the Deta-Bank, which, together with its 3000 employees, counts for one of the largest employers in the financial place of Frankfurt, comes into play when it comes to consolidating the savings banks sector.
In 2003 it was believed for a while that the Deta-Bank could merge with the Bank of the Land of Rhineland Palatinat and the Halbab.
Yet nothing emerged from this ternary bouquet.
The plans had barely been made public that the Hesse Land Government was ruling against any Hellaba participation in them.
Later, the other two houses did not join.
The Bank of the Land of Rhineland Palatinat was attached to the Bank of the Land of Baden-Wuttenberg in Stuttgart.
But there have always been new negotiations on the consolidation of the Deka-Bank with banks in the Länder.
Finally, however, Günther Merl, chairman of the Hellaba Steering Committee, had spoken out against any commercial merger strategy with his bank.
Regardless of this, there seems to be a feeling that the consolidation of the various public sector institutions is particularly urgent.
Now that the election to the Bavarian Land Parliament has passed, a union of BayernLB with the Baden-Wuttenberg Land Bank could take place in the first place.
For the Helaba, this is not particularly good news.
If the pressure for new mergers were to increase, the potential partners gradually escaped.
In the South, it would now be a junior partner, although it has so far resisted the crisis better than the banks of Munich and Stuttgart.
The grouping of Hesse-Thuringe savings banks and transfers, which owns 85 per cent of Helaba's capital, did, however, lock down the entire union with WestLB at the beginning of the year.
The NordLB would remain strict.
Such geo-strategic reflections, however, reflect only one facet.
Another aspect raises the question of how the different business models of each of these banks can be combined.
In June, Merl stated that the decisive question, namely what business model should ensure the future capacity of the banks in the Länder, had not been resolved until then by the German grouping of savings banks and transfers.
In the end, a WestLb scrapping could take place, which is obviously not desired here.
This is also discussed in the letter of the current Executive Committee: in any event, a `global solution' would be envisaged for the institution.
How all this will be put in the same basket with the union of certain entities with the Deta-Bank still remains to be seen.
The second weekend of the beer festival is also known as the Italian weekend.
For Elena, this is the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth time.
But this time, Elena accompanies him as a girlfriend, and so nothing is the same, he says.
Behind them, close to a five-litre barrel of beer from the Kaiser brand, stands a well-built bearded bearded man who shows about 200 beer party visitors what deep sounds his gosier can produce.
Elena first taps Luca, then kisses her.
From Bologna, they came all the way to Verona.
From there, from the bus station near Puorta nouvelle station, four buses take the departure tonight at 11:45 pm, `destinazione Monaco, festivity della birra', expected arrival at 6:30 am.
Three buses are reserved above all for Italians, in one of the buses travelling exclusively from Brazil.
In a corner of the parking lot, South Americans sing gold and already next to their flag, they already celebrated last night.
And also noisy, explains Marco Guarda, it is not for Italians.
The buses belong to Marco, who wears a long coat lined with fake fur and glasses with large silver frames.
For five years, they've been going to the beer party, already three fired just this year.
They go there at night, stay the day at the party, and come home at 10:30.
Spending the night there would entail unnecessary costs, Marco explains.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the welcome pot with a Kaiser beer, brewed in accordance with Bavarian purity law, health insurance and a head of the German speaking group - Marco took a language course in Frankfurt.
And already buses run in the night on the motorway direction `Brennero'.
There's no beer, not yet.
Quickly, everything becomes calm in the bus, travelers sleep.
It's better this way, they'll still need their strength.
Breaks will be made in Bressanone, and Holzkirchen, while many other buses with Italian registration plates once again take a break shortly before Munich, on Highway 8.
When in the early morning, Marco's group finally arrives at six thirty hours as planned on the parking lot near Place Thérèse, nearly 50 other buses from all over Europe are already there.
Elena, Luca and the others gather together, Marco makes one last speech, explains the plan of attack.
First: put on the little yellow cap.
The above is written to the left `Beer Day', in Gothic, and next to the internet address of the travel agency of Marco `conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second: `When the doors of the beer hat open, we run,' shouts Marco in the early morning.
`Run!' Run and book the seats at the bottom of the tent.
'Not in front, otherwise we block, and not all yellow caps on the same benches, you have to distribute them in the room!'
The cup, Marco shouts, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget the order!
Show the security officers that we're doing well!
As soon as you leave your seats, they're gone!'
Third: `Tonight, to be back here at ten and a half hours!' Understood?
And that's it, it's gone to the beer party.
On the way, someone ties yellow hats to trees to find the way, to signs and even to an electoral poster of a large Bavarian popular party.
We want to be ready for the return.
This is the second weekend of the beer festival, known as the 'weekend of the Italians'.
There are no precise figures; 50,000 people are talking about going on their way through the Alps and falling into the beer stand, 10 percent of the visitors are said to have come from Italy on purpose this weekend.
The Munich police force is reinforced by seven South Tyrolean police officers, by Italian volunteer rescuers who support the Bavarian Red Cross, which compiles statistics on the countries where Italians take first place in front of the British (60 interventions) and Austrians (about 80) with nearly 200 medical interventions.
The one that is particularly appreciated by the Italians is the tent of the brewery Hofbräu.
Nights of insomnia for the shareholders of Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stable, the Federal Minister of Finance insisted only a few weeks ago.
What a chance the politician used the word 'relatively' and slipped that the German banking sector would not be spared by the crisis movements.
This has indeed happened this weekend.
The Bavarian real estate financier Hypo Real Estate (HRE), on the side of the DAX, obtains from a consortium of German banks a credit of one billion to protect themselves from market turbulence.
One person in confidence told Reuters Monday that aid credits are issued up to EUR 35 billion.
The Hypo Real Estate should now pay interest on the fraction to which it would be entitled.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
In the background, Depfa's daughter-society bears the losses.
According to a newspaper article, the state financier had been re-financed in the very short term for long-term projects for which he had borrowed money - which has since become impossible due to mistrust of the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's liquidity reserve had been reduced from 95 per cent to EUR 2.37 million, while the equity ratio had also slightly decreased from 1.6 per cent to 1.45 per cent.
Current and net profits from financial transactions were, compared to the same period in the previous year, zero profits from the allocation of specified receivables and securities and the cancellation of provisions in credit operations had fallen from more than 70 per cent to 5 million euros.
And it is only thanks to the large profits from the reimbursement of downstream accounting costs resulting from the restructuring of the former Depfa Group, as well as from the repayment of interest according to the book of tax procedures and commercial purchases for Konzern companies that the shortfall in earnings of about 16 per cent proved to be moderate.
After its privatization in 1990, the former state financier had initially mis speculated on industrial real estate credits, which had subsequently been affiliated with Aareal Bank.
Because conventional state financing was not profitable enough, Depfa had then become more involved in infrastructure projects and in the financing of joint projects between private and state investors (Private-Public-Partnership, PPP) and internationally diversified.
On the value of the daughter company, the Hypo Real Estate must make depreciations that should have an essential material effect on the calculation of the group's gains and losses, which still remains unclear.
The fact is that the dividends have been amputated.
Already by 2007, they had been truncated to two-thirds.
Since the acquisition of Depfa, the Hypo Real Estate has been a highly important state and infrastructure investor.
It is stronger than other institutes dependent on refinancing on the interbank market since it has no customer deposits.
With the bankruptcy of the Lehman Brothers investment bank two weeks ago, the allocation of loans between banks again went down considerably, with banks having accumulated their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate needs a short-term medium of refinancing for some 50 billion euros each year.
According to a statement from the Hypo Real Estate, the group's need for financing is covered with medium-term credit and the company protected from the influence of international financial markets that are currently largely out of business.
Other sources say that refinancing would be provided through the funds until the end of 2009.
The Chairman of the HRE Executive Committee Georg Funke explained, however, that the Hypo Real Estate Group should no longer have to resort to medium-term financial markets.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Establishment for the Supervision of Financial Services (Bafin) assume that the capacity of the Hypo Real Group in the market is now assured.
The shareholders and creditors of the bank have only to hope for it.
However, in view of the dynamics and unweightability of the crisis, there is no certainty.
It is not unthinkable, however, that funding should not be used in all its scope.
But the opposite cannot be ruled out either.
After the bank is, according to the latest press releases, still at the door of insolvency on Sunday at the end of the evening, this rescue for at least temporary will not succeed in reassuring the spirits either.
The price of the action has collapsed from 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
The prices of obligations, on the other hand, are particularly good.
While debts in the first place have barely moved, the prices of second-tier loans are falling.
The most affected are mainly the investment funds of the former daughter-society Württemberg Hypo and of course those that have a life span beyond 2009.
The obligations of the bank Hypo Real Estate seemed to have been an alternative speculation investment, now their value must be considered as dependent on the stability of the international banking system after the net tightening of the banking crisis and the crisis of the institution itself that brought the crisis into the establishment by the buy-back of the bank Depfa.
As long as emission institutes, governments and less affected commercial banks are still ready to support the system, it can be assumed that the backlogs will be resorptioned over time.
Or what will happen that no one dares hope at this time - that the financial crisis can be overcome within the next 15 months.
But in the face of the renewed noises of partial nationalization, the likelihood that safety was approaching has now become a simple hope founded.
This should allow sleepless nights primarily for long-term creditors to decide whether to separate themselves from their commitments.
Short-term investors can always use what they have drawn a line to carry forward losses for the next few years on the next capital income tax of the automatically collected stock gains.
Sylvana and the secrets of the box in Bento
When Silvana Hiltrop, 16 years old, has to show up for the first day at Tachibana Highschool, the girls start to laugh: the German is so "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows this word thanks to the Mangas - in her new Log of exchanges, she talks about Japan.
"The first day of class in Japan.
How excited I was.
I was afraid of the way to school.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and take the train 40 minutes to Tachibana Highschool.
I had to find my way by myself, fortunately I didn't get lost.
The beginning of the courses does not seem to be fixed as strictly as at our home in Lower Saxony.
The students appear one after the other from eight hours, until at nine hours minus twenty, a round table begins with the teacher, the "home room".
But before the class started, it was up to me to introduce myself.
I'm not the type to like to talk in front of people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I didn't have the school uniform yet, I put on an old skirt from my foster mother, as well as a shirt, blue upper socks and black leather shoes.
In this outfit, I presented myself in front of the desk, and tried to pronounce everything correctly: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - My name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and my birthday is in a week.
At that time, I was very happy to have started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class all made low Masses, puffed up with laughter and made signs, and I constantly heard the word "Kawaii".
I already knew him because of my mangas.
It belongs to the vocabulary indispensable to the survival of Japanese teenagers and means "sweet, sweet".
Then I quickly slipped in my place.
The girl next to me made me a big ironic smile, she thought it was an honor for the correspondent to sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was quite calm, but when the gong resonated, I was attacked in the rules.
Everyone talked to who was better, smelled of laughter and asked me a lot of questions - in this case, it's quite difficult to understand English Japanese.
During the break, they all took out their Bento.
My host mother had also made me this kind of lunchbox - it's really something other than the miserable German en-cas.
I had rice with aromatic herbs, small sausages, a cucumber and seaweed salad, fruits and some kind of meat surrounded by Tofu.
Most of the time, I have no idea what I eat right here in Japan.
Things have a strange appearance and a completely new taste.
What's certain is that everything is really good.
Well, except maybe the salty plums candied, brrrr!
Bentos are not just lunches in Japanese schools.
Sometimes a girl offers a boy a Bento which she has prepared herself, and which is then prepared particularly carefully - in the hope of getting a little better acquainted with the boy during the break.
I read that in my manga.
I'm curious to know if I could observe it here too.
"Why Japan in particular?" my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to spend a year at school in Tokyo.
Then I always said:
"Because it fascinates me, what"
In the end, reading manga, that's what I've preferred for years.
And in order to better understand the mangaes and culture there, at one point, I also started learning Japanese.
For me, it was very clear that I had to travel there one day.
Because I also have a weakness for traditions, customs and customs.
And here, we give them a lot of importance.
On the one hand, Japan is the country of the most recent technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is severe, disciplined and traditional.
And since everything is so well organized, I've never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen."
Rats also have sensations
A rat or a cockroach escapes from danger, does that mean he also feels fear?
The neurophysicist Joseph LeDoux is convinced of this: many animals also have sensations.
But how can we verify that he feels the same way when he behaves in the same way as we do?
In the online magazine "Edge", contributions have been published for several years by famous scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series of articles the answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to have proof of it?"
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else having so far been able to prove it just as one cannot prove that other human beings have a consciousness.
But in this case, one can at least hope that all human brains have the same configuration.
As soon as we turn to other species and address the issues of feeling or in general consciousness, we enter hard-to-practice terrain because the Hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same thing as many other animals: it does death, flees or attacks.
Human beings behave in the same way, so some scientists deduce a comparable subjective experience.
However, I don't believe it.
Two aspects of the structure of the brain make the transposition of our subjective experience to that of animals difficult.
One aspect is that circuits associated almost always with human consciousness include the Cortex lateral prefrontal (because of its participation in the short-term memory and in the functions of direction and execution).
This vast region is much more developed in humans than in other primates and appears to be entirely absent in other beings.
At least for these aspects of our consciousness that depend on the Cortex prefrontal, among which the consciousness of who we are, and the ability to predict and decide, it is reasonable to assume that the human being is even different from the other primates.
Another significant feature could be the linguistic nature of Man: much of his existence is related to language, which often means that his consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if the consciousness were not to depend on the language, it would surely influence it, so that the animal consciousness, whatever the way it is produced, would probably differentiate much from most of our states of consciousness.
This is why it is also difficult to determine what consciousness can look like in other animals.
If this, internal and subjective, does not allow itself to be measured nor, because of this particular Hardware, to analyze based on our own experience, then its observation poses major problems.
Most of my developments refer to the content of conscious experience, but there is another aspect of consciousness that should be more easily accessible scientifically.
We could examine the processes of animal consciousness without considering their content, and this is exactly what happened in studies on the short-term memory of primates, especially with the example of visualization.
But in this approach followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, one focuses more on the nervous correlations of consciousness than on causal mechanisms: both can be identical or not.
Curiously, this approach also highlights the importance of the Cortex prefrontal in the realization of visualization.
But what then results for emotions?
I conclude that an emotional system such as that of fear is activated in a brain conscious of its own activity.
What we call "fear" is therefore the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defence system located in the brain (or its sequences, like the reactions of the body) grabs living memory.
Thus observed, emotions are closely related to the cortex regions that characterize primates and especially humans.
Subtle degrees of feeling, associated with our volubile nature, emerge, because we can, with the help of words and grammar, differentiate and categorize states to impute them to others than ourselves.
In contrast, Antonio Damasio, for example, thinks that the sensations from primitive activities arise in the regions of the cortex body sensation and brain stem, as Jaak Pankseep, who, however, focuses more on the brain stem.
As this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it could quite participate in transversal sensations of any kind.
From a purely theoretical point of view, I cannot contradict it, but I believe that is undisputed.
Pankseep argues that what appears as fear in humans and rats is probably also felt as such in both cases: how, however, can one verify whether rats and humans feel the same when they behave in a similar way?
A cockroach runs away from danger, but what if he feels afraid?
In my view, similar behaviours are not enough to prove identical experiences.
Of course, the nerve comparison helps: rats and men have similar brain trunks, but cockroaches do not even have a brain.
But is the brain stem at the origin of the sensations?
And even if we could prove this for man: how could we prove it in rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even cockroaches (who knows?) have sensations.
But I wouldn't know how to prove it.
And because their sensations are probably completely different from ours (since human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore emotional behavior than the emotional sensations of rats.
In all cases, nervous progress is evident in that the same is found in rats and humans.
Since I don't explore the language and consciousness in rats, or the sensations, I don't know if they exist.
One might judge this as short-term, but I prefer to move forward rather than constantly hit myself against a wall.
I am indeed a pragmatic emotional.
Platini, President of UEFA: a grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik explained that preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and Prime Minister.
"The government considers the UEFA decision in Bordeaux to be a proof of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organise, in collaboration with Poland, the European championships," said Wasjunik.
"But it's not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun, and there is still much to be done in both countries."
In the calendar of the construction or destruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, the two hosts run after the deadlines.
The number of stadiums for the European championship could possibly be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must work at maximum speed," said the President of the Ukrainian League Grigorij Surkis.
"UEFA is constantly watching us."
An even more radical measure has been decided in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish football league PZPN was suspended by the National Olympic Committee after many scandals and replaced by Robert Zawlocki, independent director.
The committee had met at the request of the Minister of Sports Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There would be "a real danger that the PZPN will not be able to act in the rules," said Drzewiecki of the Polish PAP news agency.
"We assured in a letter to the UEFA President that the preparations for the 2012 European Championship would not suffer."
Several members of the First Division League have already been convicted in the previous season for compulsory relegation manipulation; ultimately, the beginning of the League even had to be shifted to the last minute.
Dennis Quaid indignant counterattack
She wanted to promote a new movie, talked about her privacy in an interview - and now she's in trouble with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan lifted the veil on her ex-adulter Dennis Quaid.
He spades - and counterattacks.
A late Rose War for former couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors engage in a disgraceful battle - in the sight and knowledge of everyone.
Last week, Meg Ryan had spoken in an interview with the American newspaper InStyle about the causes of marriage failure: "Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, and it was very painful."
She would have been aware of the extent of the deception only after the divorce.
The reason for this striptease of thought lies in Ryan's press relations for his new film "The Women" - it tells the story of adultery.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his qualification as an unfaithful husband fell clearly: it would be "Monsterly," he said to the 54-year-old "New York Daily News" that "Meg retakes the history of our relationship and manipulates it."
It would also be "regrettable," that "the pain and upheavals of a divorce for each child be revived in public again" for their 16-year-old common son Jack."
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid remarried and soon became the father of twins.
So was his answer to the cricket: "In any case, my life continues.
I think I'm happy to have a wonderful family that is doing its best."
Prices for airline tickets and hotels fall
In the first half of 2008, hotel flights and nights were cheaper than the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would even be reduced to 50 per cent.
Flights and hotel nights would be profitable again - this is the result of a study by the American Express financial and travel service provider.
The company analysed its reservation data for the first half of 2008 and established, after a price increase in the first quarter, a sharp decline in profits in the second quarter.
After prices on the hotel market have increased for years, hotel nights have already reduced in many places.
From January to March, prices rose in 41 of the 48 European cities examined by an average of 6.9 per cent compared to 2007 in 41 of the 48 European cities examined.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than the previous year.
The trend was clear especially in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
The causes of all this would lie for American Express in the low price of the dollar that led to a "descending travel envy of American tourists".
Financial places such as Frankfurt or London would also be more affected by lower hotel prices than industrial sites such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Swedish city, hotel prices stand at an increase of 26.3 per cent, the record in Europe.
Also in terms of flight prices, the trend was up in the first quarter:
As a result of the increase in the price of kerosene, economic class passengers had to pay an average of 7.1 per cent more than in 2007, long-haul flights, which were highly fuel consuming, even increased to 29.2 per cent.
From April to June, economic class ticket prices fell by an average of 12.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter, in business class and first class, however, price variations were much less pronounced.
In Germany, prices fell even more than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices had increased by 11.9 per cent, and in the second quarter they fell by 23.6 per cent.
German domestic flights were even divided by two according to this study.
The reasons for this fall in prices would, on the one hand, be sluggish economic growth, explains the firm.
Demand would subside in many segments of the air travel market.
On the other hand, there would be increased competition pressure from the Open Skies Treaty, which liberalises air traffic between the United States and Europe.
Sign of the tense situation is the removal by the airlines of the non-returnable routes, as well as the high number of airlines that would have filed the balance sheet during the first half of 2008 - they were 24 companies only in Europe.
HSV beat Gladbach 1:0
With a simple purpose and methods, the SV Hamburg becomes first in the ranking.
In Borussia, Luhukay has still not managed to find a functional eleven.
From Kristoffer Klein. Enlarge. Disaster landing for international player Marko Marin.
Gladbach's player only came back late in the game and his high shot failed against the goal frame.
His message was precisely formulated, he had come out of his lips persuasively.
He just knew he was right.
"We need this second goal," said Hermann Rieger in the hall of the changing rooms in the Hamburg arena.
There was not much going on in the locker rooms, the half-time was over and most had sat down in their place.
Rieger has been the physiotherapist of the HSV for nearly three decades, enjoying a great reputation as a former protagonist.
And that's why his application was received at the strategic places.
Assistant Coach Cornelius Jol acquiesced and lifted his thumb to approve.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg's chief coach Martin Jol.
Whose orders seem to have been similar: and let it jump with this second goal!
The practice has been missed.
"Everything wasn't very beautiful to see today," Marcel Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhard would have "sweetened also to be more relaxed".
This 1:0 (1:0 in the middle), the Hamburg team owes it to a hit of the head successful by Mladen Petric (at the 11th minute); and the fact that the very weak Gladbach players could not harm the weak Hamburg players.
"It was a bad win," Marin Jol summed up.
The SV of Hamburg will celebrate its 121th birthday on Monday.
Already Saturday afternoon, the fans celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the provisional classification tables on the giant screen that indicated their club as first in the class.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We can take a step back," said Marcell Jansen.
It is doubtful that the intermediate result of the table reflects more the unpredictable character of the first League than the domination of its HSV.
The team with its late arrivals - Brazilians Neves and Silva, goaltender Petric as well as Jansen debauched from FC Bayern - is certainly forming slowly, but it is not yet shining.
"We need more charm and more dribbles," Jol demanded.
After the failure of the vote
On Wall Street, fear circulates.
The first news of the failure of the rescue plan dropped the Dow Jones temporarily by 700 points.
It was the biggest loss of points in the space of a day in all history.
Later, the Dow Jones caught up a little bit.
At around 8:30 p.m., the world's largest stock market index was 10,579 points with a decline of well five percent.
The Nasdaq technology stock exchange index was at 1548 points with a drop of more than seven points.
The most losers of the Dow Jones were at that time American Express, which lost almost 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of about 12 percent.
No title could bring any more benefits.
Bank Goldman Sachs' shares accounted for a decline of almost ten percent.
Just a few days ago, the big investor Warren Buffet had joined the company.
As part of the rescue plan, resources must be mobilized for the purchase of so-called spoiled mortgage papers.
However, the amount should not be paid at once, but gradually.
In return, the State should recover options on the shares of the financial company that may be exchanged in conjunction with the course's evolution in order to reduce the burden on the Public Treasury.
The courses of the aspirational actions in the whirlwind in Europe and the United States
The billions of aid for banks in Europe and the United States do not alleviate investor concerns.
The course of action of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate collapses and pulls the Dax to the bottom.
The U.S. Dow Jones Index collapses despite the state-planned bailout of the financial market.
Spectacular declines in the prices of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank led to a deep deficit in the German index (Dax).
The action of the Bavarian real estate financier has lost at the moment three quarters of its value despite the rescue operation of the federal government and private banks, the Commerzbank has recorded a decrease of more than 20 percent.
The Dax slid clearly below the important psychological bar of the 6000 points and stood at 5,839 points with a deficit of 3.7 percent.
Worldwide, stock markets have fallen to their knees.
In New York City, Wall Street opened with significant losses.
Investors feared that the US Government's $700 Billion heavy bailout plan could not be sufficient to restart the financial markets.
The Dow Jones at 10.809.25 points lost in the first hour of opening 334 points or 3.3 percent.
The United States House of Representatives intended to vote on the rescue plan, and the vote in the Senate is scheduled to follow on October 1.
The other European exchanges also experienced only one direction: in London, the FTSE 100 index fell by 3.2 per cent for the time being, the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 per cent.
In Asia, the main Japanese Nikkei index fell to 11,743.61 points after an initial rise of 1.26 per cent.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index slipped from 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the main Sensex index lost 506.43 points or 3.9 per cent and closed to 12.595.75 points.
In MDAX, Arcandor's shares fell after the announcement of an increase in capital.
The private bank Sal. Oppenheim has subscribed to the 23 million new shares.
The commercial and tourism multinational also announced that the shares will not be sold to Thomas Cook.
Dark matter influences the theft of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has left researchers in perplexity: dark matter influences the speed of space probes during what is called gravitational support maneuvers.
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity is not entirely correct.
For almost 18 years, the space probe "Ulysses" has been flying in space.
Due to soon frozen fuel lines, cryogenic death threatens it.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has been causing trouble among researchers - the anomaly of gravitational support.
Gravitational support is a manoeuvring of space probes, by which they gain additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, for example, the Earth.
Thus, probes can save a lot of fuel.
The Cassini-Huygens American-European research probe used this physical trick, as did the Ulysses solar probe.
This has been surprising to researchers for years: flying objects do not always behave at 100% of the way they are expected according to the venerable laws of gravitation.
Moreover, irregularities in speed appear.
The probes become unexpectedly faster or slower.
So far, physicists could not explain this effect.
They named it the anomaly of gravitational support.
Some experts feared that Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, which describes the force of attraction of matter due to the curvature of space, might not be entirely correct.
The American physicist Stephen Adler of Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study still believes hard as an iron that Einstein was not mistaken and tries to explain the anomaly of gravitational support by using what is called the black matter that astronomers have identified in the universe.
"Black matter could be responsible for this anomaly, which is also close to the Earth," he writes.
Space researchers have only known the existence of black matter for about ten years.
It apparently emanates from it an attraction force whose effect is observable on other celestial bodies.
On the other hand, it is completely invisible, that is, it does not send or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially any visible light.
According to scientists' calculations, black matter would still represent a good fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
Tourists abducted in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, the kidnapped tourists in Egypt should be released, as confirmed by the Italian Foreign Minister.
The Sudanese kidnappers demanded a ransom of several million euros.
During the pre-liberation shooting, six hostage-takers were reportedly killed.
In southern Egypt, five Germans were abducted.
The ransom negotiations would already be under way.
The Germans are constantly in the kidnapper collimator.
WELT ONLINE depicts the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are visibly free.
This is what Egyptian state television, the Arab television channel Al-Arabija and the Italian media have communicated in concert.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the bulletins of the Italian television channel Sky TG 24: "Our citizens and other hostages have been released.
We are checking their state of health," said Frattini.
The five Germans, the five Italians and the Romanian, as well as their eight Egyptian companions, are doing well and are safe, announced Egyptian national television.
The 19 participants of the desert tour should already be on their way to Cairo.
The circumstances surrounding a shooting before the release of the hostages remain unclear: thus, the kidnappers would have been close to putting an end to the kidnapping, according to an Egyptian security officer, before the Sudanese army killed six of the kidnappers without shouting station.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with a ransom," said the agent.
All that remained was to collect the hostages", when suddenly, "this surprise" occurred.
Sudanese soldiers killed six of the kidnappers in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt on Sunday and arrested two of them.
The hostage-takers had demanded a ransom of EUR 6 million from Germany; the money had to be handed over by the German woman from one of the hostages.
The daily "El Masri El Jom" stated that, according to a German mediator, the release of the hostages was delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the article, the kidnappers wanted to release the female hostages after payment of the ransom.
The men had to be held until the kidnappers found a safe route to escape.
The German Embassy in Cairo refused to comment on this story.
Abuse of a father-in-law who led to suicide"
A court was informed that years of abuse by his father-in-law led a woman to commit suicide.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stitians, Cornwall, was imprisoned for six years after he admitted eight counts of indecent assault.
Truro High Court reported that he regularly linked his daughter-in-law, Stéphanie Randle, between the ages of 5 and 7.
Trerise wrote in a confession letter: "I feel responsible for his death".
The court was informed that Ms. Randle, 34, committed suicide at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007.
When she was a child living in Coventry, Trerise had tied her up and banded her before forcing her into sex while her mother worked at the pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to live in Cornwall.
His daughter-in-law went to Plymouth.
But the court was informed that Ms. Randle, a volunteer assistant of the National Trust, was haunted by the abuses that had been inflicted twice a week.
The Attorney General, Ramsey Quaife told the court that friends had told that Miss Randle, who was a good surfer and cyclist, appeared since 2006 "emotionally dead", and "lost all hope for life."
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
We think she killed herself by suffocating with a plastic bag.
Mr.Randle faced his daughter's father-in-law, who had also written a letter of confession, which ended up as follows: "I attacked her and banded her regularly."
"I didn't sexually abuse her.
"I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: "You are really weird as a fetishist, your victim must certainly be terrified, especially at the age of 7.
"This unpleasant saga ended with the victim's suicide.
And what's even more surprising is the fact that if she hadn't done that, her story would certainly never be over in court."
He added: "I stress in particular, as his father and mother describe, the effects of your crime on Stephanie for years.
"Without them, she would probably be a happy, promising, successful young woman today."
Conviction for loss of official data.
The Cabinet Office's ministerial officer who had forgotten top secret documents in June on a train will be convicted by the Official Secrets Act, informed the BBC.
The Ministry of Defence man was on the move when he forgot two highly classified documents, on a train heading for Waterloo.
The documents passed into the BBC's hands before being handed over to the police.
This is the least serious condemnation of this act, without any insinuation of criminal intent.
BBC correspondent Frank Gardner said this episode had a lot of Whitehall people.
"They will have thought that this case would have remained between the walls of the Ministry of Defence and the Cabinet Office," he said.
The employee who cannot be appointed is charged with a violation of section 8.1 of the act, i.e. the clause dealing with the safeguarding of information.
.The Crown Prosecution Service suggested that the ministerial officer be placed under the supervision of the Metropolitan Police, given the very sensitive nature of his work related to the Associate Committee of Secret Services
The documents he lost contained assessments of Al-Qaeda and the resources of the security forces in Iraq.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was then transported from his home to a secret location.
Building companies against B&B invoice.
British building companies may have to pay a bill of over £80 million to cover the rescue of Bradford & Bingley Bank.
The Government has provided £14 billion to protect the deposits of the 2.6 million Bradford & Bingleys savers.
The interest on this loan will be paid by all the companies that raise the money from the savers, including 59 construction companies.
The Managing Director of Building Societies Association (BSA), Adrian Coles said it is "irritating" to know that companies and their members will have to pay for broken pots...
The £14 billion loan will be repaid when Bradford & Bingleys mortgages are cleared.
But the interest that will increase at the same time, will be debited, each year, to the 700 financial companies that collect the deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 building companies are included in this list.
It is irritating to see that institutions that have behaved prudently... now have to pay some of the bills of institutions that were much less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It is stated that each company must pay an amount proportional to the deposits it holds, and that the intermediary companies must pay approximately 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will be £450 million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find £81 million to settle the interests of the first year.
Adrian Coles, Director General of the Building Companies Trade Committee, told the BBC that this decision seemed unfair to him.
It is "irritating" to see that institutions that have behaved cautiously in the recovery of the real estate market must now pay for institutions much less cautiously.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since 1945, the date of the first years.
"We need to look at all aspects of this case over the next few weeks, to assess the options to be adopted to prevent the construction companies and their members from paying this salty bill," said Mr Cole.
Interest for 2009 covers seven months, from the end of September of this year to the end of March.
In 2010, interest will have to be paid for the entire year, which could double.
Since the building companies are non-shareholders' organizations, their members end up paying the bill either by higher charges, or by lower interest rates for savings accounts.
Milk increases up to five pennies per litre
Jersey people have to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy announced that it will increase the wholesale price of its milk, from five penny a litre, starting Monday.
This is the second increase in the price that follows an increase of two pennies in February, and comes as a result of a research carried out by a consulting company.
Retailers must decide whether they will in turn increase the price to consumers.
. Prior to the February increase, the wholesale price of Jersey's milk had been changed for the last time in 2002.
An ex-Pm from Bangladesh was denied bail
A court in Bangladesh rejected a bail request from former PM Sheikh Hasina, which could be arrested upon her return to the country.
His lawyers said that the court refused to grant him bail because of his indictment for extorting a businessman, $50 million from Taka ($729.000.00) when she was a PM.
This case is one of the many charges brought against him.
Khaleda Zia, the always rival of Sheikh Hasina, was relaxed on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return to Bangladesh within a few weeks, but his party, the Awani League, demanded that the country's provisional military government first give him full freedom.
Correspondents stressed that the terms of her release were contradictory because if she was allowed to leave the country for medical reasons, they did not see why she could not remain free upon her return to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers have announced that she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the Supreme Court's order.
"The Supreme Court rejected Sheikh Hasina's claim that she does not require bail since she was allowed to go abroad for medical reasons," said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will file an appeal against the order of the Supreme Court"
Her lawyers argued that she needed this bail to return to the country in order to prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return after October 17, a former leader of the Awami party said.
She was detained last year after the interim military government assumed power, but was released in June to take care of herself abroad.
Sheikh Hasina like Zhaleda Zia, deny the charges against them.
Concerns about the Afghan anti-polio campaign.
In Afghanistan, nearly 200,000 children have missed the recent polio immunization campaign, due to Taliban-related violence, the United Nations said.
The United Nations conducted a vaccination campaign in the six provinces last week.
But she says she has failed to contact the children in the dangerous areas of Helmand and Kandahar, located to the south.
A United Nations spokesman said that this occurred despite the Taliban's promises not to attack or obstruct thousands of nurses during vaccinations.
BSkyB loses ITV's judicial battle
BSkyB lost its trial following the decision of the Competition Commission, which would require it to reduce its participation in its rival ITV transmitter.
The Competition Appeal Tribunal ordered BSkyB to reduce its share of ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
The Commission stated that, in the past, MSkyB's participation had prevented competition and allowed it to influence ITV unfairly.
BSkyB purchased its shares in 2006 following an agreement to effectively prevent NTL, now known as Virgin Media, from purchasing ITV.
In April 2007, the Fair Trading Office reported that BSkyB's purchase of ITV shares raised doubts about the effective independence of ITV, thereby inciting the Competition Commission to investigate
Virgin's boss, Richard Branson, a consumer group and the Ofcom regulator were all against this purchase.
BSkyB argued that forcing it to reduce its ITV shares would not be reasonable and on the contrary was excessive – especially since BSkyB has just waived its voting rights.
New investigation into the U.S. prosecutor's case.
The U.S. Attorney General appointed a special accuser to verify the issue of the dismissal of nine U.S. prosecutors in 2006.
The whole was born out of the record of the case of the Inspector General of the Department of Justice, which criticized the actions of certain ministerial officers.
The report was critical of White House officers, legislators and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation is based on the argument of lawyers who argue that their dismissal is due to political causes.
The Special Accusor, Nora Dannehy, will now investigate whether the officers interviewed during the investigation lied to the investigators, thus obstructing justice.
"Serious charges of potentially criminal conduct, which are unfounded, have not been fully confirmed or resolved," said Inspector General Glenn Fine in his report.
The appointment of a special accuser capable of forcing witnesses to testify was one of his greatest recommendations.
The dispute began with the removal in December 2006 of nine US prosecutors from the U.S. Department of Justice.
At the time, the department had stated that prosecutors were dismissed because of poor benefits.
But then it emerged that the dismissed prosecutors were no more criticized than their other colleagues, which prompted some observers to attribute a political connotation to these dismissals.
Some of the prosecutors were accused of being close to the Republicans of Congress, while others reportedly refused to investigate allegations of fraudulent voting against the Democrats.
U.S. prosecutors investigate and prosecute court proceedings for the government.
It is certain that they can be dismissed at any time, but cannot be dismissed for political reasons.
The head of the justice department, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, ended up being accused of being involved in this case of dismissal, and in the end he resigned.
A number of ministerial officers in the Department of Justice also resigned.
The Inspector General's report was very critical of Mr Gonzales' role in this case, stating that he considered him "primarily responsible" for these redundancies, and ended up "abdicating" his role as leader," remarkably succeeding in not getting involved in this case.
Other ministerial officers, including Bush's former collaborator Karl Rove, were critical of their failure to cooperate during the investigation.
Meat Loaf's epic will have to be honored.
The Rock star Meat Loaf, must be honoured at the Q Awards for her epic song Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will receive an Oscar at the ceremony in London next week, said he was "honored" to obtain this recognition.
The nine-minute, fifty-second song was the hit title for Meat Loaf's 1977 album.
The evening of the award is presented by Coldplay, with this year's selection restricted to four categories.
Paul Rees, editor - in - chief of Q magazine, said: "There are songs that transcend things like time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly part of it.
The song, written by Jim Steinman, required a great voice like Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental section that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was released in the United Kingdom as a single in 1979, ranking 15th.
In addition, his Bat Out of Hell album remained nine years in the English rankings, and was sold to over 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf- or Marvin Lee Aday, of his real name- has suffered from health problems in recent years, even undergoing an operation to cure his an irregular heartbeat, after having collapsed on stage, in 2003.
In 2007, a strong laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts.
Then we found a cyst in his vocal cords.
A Sombre Street in the City, Often Forgotten, and Can Be Soon For Sale.
New York has hundreds of avenues, boulevards, streets and other parallel roads, some famous, some only functional.
And even some veteran taxis and long-time local residents don't know how to give directions to go to Extra Place, because they've never heard of it.
The street is located in the East Village and runs north of First Street- not to be confused with Second Street- between Bowery and Second Avenue.
From about 30 feet wide to 120 feet long, it looks like a dusty alley rather than an active artery.
. No signs indicate the street.
It is virtually impossible to find it on a standard atlas.
This street, however, has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the builder of recent luxury buildings on First Street.
He would like to repave Extra Place, and create a smoother passage to the shops and shops, which should open in the new buildings.
Other admirers, including long-standing neighbors, said they were charmed by this short cut simply because it remains one of the last and oldest streets on the block.
But the City's Department of Preservation and Real Estate Development, which runs the street, has no interest in keeping it.
This month, at a meeting of neighborhood owners' committees, representatives of city agency and Avalon Bay drafted a proposal allowing the real estate developer to buy the street.
But the committee prefers that the street remain in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new proposal to be submitted next month, said Susan Stetzer, the local manager of Committee No. 3.
"There are only a few spaces left that belong to the city, and we would like the city to conserve Extra Place," she said.
"They could propose to restore it and manage it, which Avalon could do, but we want to keep it public."
Avalon Bay announced several months ago that she wanted to renovate the small street and install seats there, some would be used by a coffee shop to which the builder would grant the space.
The proposal for this potential acquisition was made public at this month's meeting.
Michele de Milly, the mouthpiece of Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to exploit the street, it doesn't necessarily mean that it wants to own it.
"Avalon Bay's main interest is to relook at this abandoned alley, and make it public," she said, stressing that it was the city that suggested the sale."
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Preservation of Real Estate, confirmed that the city wanted to sell the street, stressing, moreover, that the agency's mission was to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to his more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place left a slight historical footprint.
Some believe that Extra Place has borne this name since 1802, when the inheritance of the large farm of Philip Minthorne's many children was divided, leaving aside this small piece of land, which has since been abandoned.
The subsequent entrance of the CBGB, a punk rock monument closed in 2006, reopened in Extra Place; the street is certainly more famous thanks to the cover photo of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia"
"This place was beautiful," said Danny Fields, the Ramones manager, who took the picture in November 1976.
It was full of scraps, rags, barrels, posters, leaves and ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers who had already talked about the evolution towards the luxury of the East Village, opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, saying that this humble little property should remain public.
Others have proclaimed Extra Place as a true rarity - a fragment virtually identical to the city that should be destroyed in peace.
Jeremiah Moss, who leads a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled "The Book of Challenges: A Nostalgic Amerizing Look at a City in the Extinction Process") tells the history of the City and Extra Place, published in 1952 in The New Yorker.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow cul-de-sac, dark day and night, and bounded by the doors of a rusty iron warehouse and Persians, full of newspapers from last week that fly along the gutters."
With few exceptions, the street always looks the same.
A rat runs agile at the bottom of the alley, near a door that once led to the CBGB, and which has now become the seat of a chic clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls, an empty 22 ounce beer bottle, rests next to newspapers that have just been thrown away.
Some passers-by said they rarely thought of Extra Place, and suggested its enhancement.
Mr. Field, on his side, expressed the view that some underestimated the appeal of the street in its current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "have taken place in dark, damp and disgusting places."
The Bilingual Debate: Immersion in the English Language
In this part of the Education Supervision program, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the candidate's position on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a former member of studies in California, and former director of the education department at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "Not as Good as You Thought. Why the middle classes should be able to choose their school."
Attracting the favors of Hispanic voters is a complicated business.
Barack Obama's proposals on education are an interesting example.
Obama's campaign emphasizes that "African-American and Latino students are less likely to graduate than white students." This is a true fact.
To combat these differences, Obama's education program particularly supports among many other topics, "Bilingual Transitional Education" for those who learn English.
However, Obama's question is whether his desire to pursue a bilingual education that advocates non-English language class education goes beyond his interest in eliminating differences.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in eastern Los Angeles County.
The students of this school are mostly Hispanic, and low-income.
More than a third of the students, made up of many new arrivals, study English.
Among CM1 students, 100% passed the 2008 state math exam, expert level.
Similarly, almost 93% of students passed the English-language-of-art exam
This incredible success was achieved thanks to another ingredient than that advanced by Mr Obama.
Sixth Street relies on analysis, practice, a constant assessment of capabilities and an exemplary attitude.
In addition, and here's an example that Obama could copy, reports Linda Mikels, the sixth street principal, this school has instituted the English language instruction "full immersion".
Total immersion in English focuses on the almost constant use of English in instruction.
Miss Mikels, contrary to bilingual education, told me "we had a huge success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico, 12 months later, if you went without his class, you would have had no chance to identify him."
"It works," she observes, "it worked for us"
Mr. Obama should not take an example of Sixth Street Prep and replicate it in other schools composed mostly of Hispanic students learning English.
The excellent results obtained by this school speak for themselves; but the policies on education within his party (the Associations for National Education have long supported bilingual education) and his enormous support for bilingual education obscure the prognosis of Obama's response.
Although he was in favour of the fact that immigrants were learning English, Obama had recently considered this issue to be insignificant, when he proclaimed that we should all stop arguing about the wording of English-language laws.
"On the contrary, he said, "you must make sure that your child speaks Spanish."
If Obama really wants to eliminate the differences, then he should carefully consider the models of education that work, rather than dismissing them or considering them as insignificant.
Netfall of Oil following the New Concerns of the World of Economy
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday, because people fear that the bailout plan for the financial marches will be able to bring the economy back to life.
The futures of crude oil, fell by 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel. The New York Stock Exchange, during this morning's sales.
Prices have fallen by more than $20 per barrel since last Monday.
In the past two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by the financial turmoil of Wall Street, as well as by two powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After experiencing an increase in July to $145.29 per barrel, prices fell to almost $90 per barrel this month, before rebounding again in view of the deep uncertainties in the financial markets.
This Monday, investors are again worried despite the agreement on the rescue plan, the largest in history, concluded this weekend by the leaders of Congress.
The news has been mitigated by recent concerns that the crisis will be lasting.
In the very last episode of this financial disaster, "Citygroup will buy the banking operations of the Wachovia Corporation," the government said on Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have in part nationalised the European financial conglomerate, Fortis.
Barclays Capital analysts said this weekend's frantic negotiations with the rescue agreement" seem to have failed to revive the market."
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for raw materials, including oil, is expected to slow down.
"the outlook for global equity, interest rates and market exchange has become uncertain," Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a letter to their investors."
"we believe that raw materials cannot escape this contagion.
"As far as raw materials are concerned, our most pressing concern is to understand how far the American virus would spread globally and in particular, in China."
The bank's analysts have reduced their expectations for next year, given the fall in oil consumption due to the slowdown in economic growth, they were therefore forced to decrease by 20 percent, the oil and gas price forecasts for 2009.
The Day of the Second Determinant Time for the Improvement of the Team Record.
After spending the last eight seasons, more time than anyone in the uniform of the Shaun Ellis Jets, the defender thought he had seen everything.
He was watching the second time, when the Jets turned a 0 to 0 into an explosion.
"I've never seen anything like it," Ellis said.
The second stage began after the Jets and Arizona Cardinals played under dark clouds.
Then the quarter back Brett Favre managed to make a pass to Laveranues Coles allowing a 12-yard touchdown, a precursor sign of an after noon during which their relationship made a leap forward.
Favre found Coles for two more touchdowns, the first when a back corner fell and the second, 10 seconds from half time.
"I didn't get out of my area" Favre said about all his passes to Coles.
"he's a mediocre player"
"We communicate extremely well, despite what people think."
While Favre and Coles were playing catch, the defense beat the Cardinals' quarterback, Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, corner back, intercepted a lost shot and made 32 yards to touchdown.
Eric Smith made another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker, David Bowens let the ball escape because of Warner.
At the last change, the loss of Bowens' ball, could well be the most charming event
The Cardinals took control of this possession for the last 10 seconds, and then the Jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely made a 20-yard goal taking an advantage from 34 to 0.
It was the best that the Jets could have scored in a while.
"Jet coach Eric Mangini, who was asked to describe this madness, said "second or third time?"
When he was told the two- the Jets passed 21 uncontested points in the third time- Mangini said: "I can tell you that I enjoyed the second time more than the third time.
"Many points have been marked in a short time."
Gebrselassie rested, exceeds its world record.
Haile Gebrselassie, Ethiopian, once again proved worthy of his title as the best cross-country rider of the century, after beating his own world record at the Berlin marathon on Sunday, becoming the first to run 26.2 miles in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a win in 2:03:59 of an accommodative race on the plate, Gebrselassie beat by 27 seconds his record of 2:04:26, played last year in Berlin.
At the age of 35, Gebrselassie won the 26th world record of his superb career in which he won the world championship or world record for any distance, from the 1600 metre marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie missed the Beijing Olympic marathon, fearing - perhaps exaggerated in today's eyes - that air pollution will increase his asthma problems.
On the contrary, he promised to run to Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions- sunny weather, 48 degrees at the start, 55 at the finish- Gebrselassie won Sunday, now an impressive average of one thousand in 4 minutes 43 seconds
Runners such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat, both Kenyans, converted into background runners, have contributed to the decline of the marathon record by more than two minutes in the last ten years, since 1998, when Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin at 2:06:05 .
After Sunday's victory, Gebrselassie told reporters that he had suffered from calf cramps two weeks earlier, and missed training for a week.
It is obvious that the rest allowed him to remain shiny, but not rusty.
"I'm so happy," he told reporters.
" Everything was perfect.
I went back to it last week, and today I had doubts; but in the end, everything went for the best.""
He was accused - especially in Kenya, the rival is African from Ethiopia - of having too much orchestrating his races, avoiding the world's marathon stars, actually counting on the hare as if they were in a track competition, and considering world records more than the sense of competition.
But this criticism does not diminish the magnitude of Gebrselassie's abilities as a background runner.
Sunday Gebrselassie, preceded by four Kenyans, recorded a time of 1:02:04. halfway.
Two Kenyan elite riders, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to challenge Gebrselassie after the leaders disappeared.
A little over three miles from the finish, Gebrselassie made his final climb to get off Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, improving his best personal record of five minutes.
Kamathis arrived third at 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, now a German citizen, finished a remarkable year getting the seventh time of 2:19:19.
Englishman Paula Radcliffe holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko surprised everyone winning the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She could not participate in the Beijing games because of a hypothetical backache, but promised to win in Berlin, improving her third marathon, her personal record of almost five minutes.
She ran using a clever strategy, letting the group of Ethiopian and Kenyan riders take a nice advantage, then surpassing them about 18 miles 1⁄2 later.
Askale Tafa Margasa of Ethiopia came second at 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop, Kenyan, finished third at 2:25:01.
In a Part City, the Pride and the Tests of Black Life
Hidden in the development of its huge park, a few miles from the sunny, bright and giant Orlando, is a small quiet town where the pride and complications of the African-American experience are born.
"Eatonville, the first fully black city to be integrated, Zora Neale Hurston's childhood home, this description she made in 1935, is no longer so simple to make nowadays." The city with five lakes, three croquet courts, 300 dark skins, 300 good swimmers, full of guavas, two schools and no prison."
It has now become a city of pilgrimage
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the Zora Festival, which is held every year in Eatonville, to pay tribute to Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
And in various ways, the city she describes- became a tourist thanks to its inclusion in the Florida Tourist Guide published by The Depression-Era Federal Writers' Project- remains a separate place.
It is as independent, dignified, and private as it was in the 1930s, when Hurston reported that Florida's black rural population was often reluctant to share its true thoughts with the white man, who "knowing so little, doesn't know what he's missing."
Although this is the year of the election of a black president, Senator Barack Obama, who has indeed invoked an open dialogue on the subject of race, many here remain cautious of the eyes of the foreigner.
"We are very careful about how to tell the story," said Hortense Jones, 59, a long-time resident and the oldest parishioner in the city.
"it must be in accordance with reality.
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and fighting.
It represents both a historical model of black empowerment and a community of nearly 2,400 people where poverty is twice the national average.
This is a central point, but also an example of a black rural Southist culture - sometimes scorned, sometimes acclaimed - that recalls the birth of American slavery.
This would explain why residents are both proud and protective.
The interest in Eatonville's image born with Zora, which everyone here calls Hurston.
She presented her hometown to the world through sincere, dialectic books, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida Guide transformed this city, located just outside Route 17, a road that crosses the center of Florida, often forgotten, which ends in a chapter of black history and human drama.
Bold as a big box in life as in literature, Hurston led the readers to the property store of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, who was then divided into several private parts.
"Passed the road on the left," she writes, "you will find the modern brown and white public school, with its gardens and well-preserved playgrounds that Howard Miller has always taken care of, although he barely knows how to read and write.
She also mentioned Widow Dash's new husband and wrote that Lee Glenn" sells drinks of all kinds as well as anything that can be used by passing people.
So, in just a hundred words, Hurston associates Eatonville with a self-government but also with literacy, remarriage, and sex.
Of course, Fodor wasn't like that.
It wasn't actually a portrait that everyone liked.
Zora well described the reality "said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of Johnson's young girls whom Hurston immortalized, quoting the colorless songs, interpreted by men who praised their beauty."
She added: "Some people didn't like it."
We always remember Hurston as a living and eccentric person, who often came back after his family moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that Hurston usually arrived in town without warning, on board a large Chevrolet, a cigarette in his mouth and wearing pants here, where even today, we are proud of traditional clothes.
Many residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin told, while many mocked her.
"People were always happy to see Zora," he said.
But he adds, swinging in his chair from the back patio that overlooks Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was certainly baptized, that "it never remained too long".
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of production.
Eatonville and the whole world seemed to have forgotten her.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary from Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in some grave in Fort Pierce, Fla, where she lived.
In Eatonville, no big memorial, no plaque for the general public.
I don't think they understood the contribution or legacy she offered to the world," said Valérie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography of Hurston published in 2003.
A crucial moment occurred in the 1980s.
Orange County public servants wanted to move a five-lane highway through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, a two-lane main street in the community.
Orlando's development has already pushed Interstate 4 to the western corner of the city.
The proposal was made when Eatonville was recovering from a difficult time in its history.
Forced integration, among many other things, has brought an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the dispute over race mixing led to hatred at the gates of the community.
"At that time, a bunch of white youths came to throw oranges or objects at people sitting on the side," said Mr. Franklin.
"a lady has even died. "
They launched a watermelon from their car."
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's request for forced integration, defining its decision in Brown v. Board of Education" insulting rather than glorifying my race."
Residents now claim that the elimination of racial segregation in schools, although positive in some respects, has diluted the cohesion of Eatonville and weakened young people's confidence.
"Black children used to be kissed - I remember well - our master was kissed in the morning, and in the evening too," said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins as well as Chief Director of Rescue of the Eatonville Community, a non-profit group.
It lasted, she added, until the teachers and students no longer came from the same place.
"You don't kiss your white teacher because he's white- I mean there's a line of cultural demarcation here," said Ms. Nathiri.
The civil rights, moreover, have allowed to create space for many other Zora Neale Hurston- black writers, actors and artists who have gone beyond the prejudice, such as her, armed with joyful self-confidence and lines of conduct such as: "how can they deprive themselves of the pleasure of my company!"
It's beyond my control."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker visited Hurston's anonymous grave and began to struggle to revive her reputation.
Five years later, a biography acclaimed on Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway, a real best seller, reintroduced it to American guns.
The highway project arrived just as the most famous girl in Eatonville had regained her appeal.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors consider her a lifesaver.
The community began organizing a Hurston festival to demonstrate the catastrophic consequences of the highway.
Hundreds of fans came to the opening of the festival two years later, and many come back in January to commemorate it.
After many years, the county rejected the highway proposal.
"The fiasco of the five-way highway, extremely fast, a real civic pride," said Ms. Nathiri.
Miss Boyd summarized it all by stating that "Zora saved Eatonville".
The victory over the highway project allowed him to change his own image.
Non-residents, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been attending our church since 1993, began to come in large numbers, and residents began to reconsider the past.
Eatonville has been classified as a historic city since 1998.
A mono-theme library (of course known as Hurston) opened in 2006 on a beautiful Kennedy Boulevard, repaved.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly for Florida: six miles from Orlando, it can at any time consider itself as a back street on a day of summer rain, small as it was when it was founded by 27 black families in the 1880s.
( There are now 90 percent black people)
Foreigners who come to discover the history of Eatonville, its raison d'être, are still treated with caution.
You have to ask permission for most interviews, and some things- like the walls of the old church of Eatonville, painted by the white man, illustrating black men in the fields- must not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Miss Jones, a courageous teacher who has a weakness for bright red, are always afraid that their island community will be well understood.
However, given the expansion of the Hurston festival, a certain level of local pride has emerged.
In particular, young people tend to consider Eatonville as their entire race: beautiful, problematic and everything, neither better nor worse, but as proud, creative, bossy, crazy and mixed as other ethnic and racial groups in America.
It is true civic affection that is heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, Edwin Harvey, 18, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work for the local government or police forces, who need additional forces.
And even for the younger ones, like 11-year-old Alondra and Alexia Kenon, twins from Winter Park, they seem to have learned the Eatonville description correctly.
"Most people who pass through this area will think: "Oh, this city has nothing compared to others" Alondra Kenon said after Mass last Sunday.
But if you stop and take the time to contemplate history, it is a very beautiful city".
Here in New York, everyone speaks fluently finance.
Still, nothing has changed.
If the tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the kiosk and the giant TV screens in Times Square, they would not realize that they were in the eye of the cyclone.
They could never think that in glass and honeycomb offices above their head, bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York, spend the worst "working day at the office" since the crack of 1929.
Deliverers continue to sneak on sidewalks, with their carts and muffin trays for morning meetings.
The Latinos always hang between residential buildings carrying, like mules, about fifty luxurious shirts hanging at a yoke placed on his shoulders.
Office staff continue to line up to buy their morning sandwich from street vendors, and it is still impossible to find a taxi between 4:00 and 7:00 a.m. on a weekday basis.
I had not felt the crisis despite the completely pessimistic accounts until this afternoon when I decided to open a new savings account.
Fortunately, I had planned to work late after noon, as I was discovering my local subsidiary of JP Morgan Chase, some 20 people in line.
Not in front of cashiers' counters, nor to withdraw from the species or make a payment, but in front of the customer service counter, where the usual customers ordered their cheques, tourists asked for direction for the Macy store, and new customers opened accounts.
Most of those in front of me, I would later learn from Starr, my "authorized personal banker," all lined up for the same reason as I did.
Not the same, as they had already withdrawn their economies from smaller banks, such as those in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They have withdrawn their money from savings accounts called thrifts (such as a building company), credit associations, and the type of local savings banks and their subsidiaries that operate only in one state, and that claim to treat customers as their family.
In a recent past, 15 of these banks have gone bankrupt.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a capital bank of $327, used the bankruptcy trustee, and while the New Yorkers were returning home for the weekend this Friday evening, another bank, Wachovia, with savings accounts worth $440 million, was desperately looking for a buyer to save it.
The office and shopkeepers in front of me, frightened of another potential debacle, have transferred their money to a bank that seems to them to be reliable, the one that does the most rescue on Wall Street.
Some random New Yorkers have become very familiar with the world of finance in recent weeks.
"I heard a lady at my local Chinese supermarket, talking on the phone about Lehman Brothers, the bank that went bankrupt, and her skinny CEO Dick Fuld, with the same familiarity she might have had to criticize a colleague.
And Lyn, the uniform attendant in my building, changed the subject of our usual conversation about Brad and Angelina or my fruit and vegetable dealer's deliveries.
She told me, following my visit to the bank. "I put all my savings in the money market.
"I've changed, I don't want to take any chances."
Muslim falls profaned while Austria oscillates to the right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, who abandoned the right wing of the Austrian Freedom Party and , Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right Vlaams Belang, took part in a demonstration to present the organization of "Cities Against Islamization" in Antwerp, Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They wear road signs illustrating red-lined mosques.
The police accuse extreme right-wing extremists of desecrating an Austrian Muslim cemetery on the weekend of the victory of the far-right political parties in the country's general elections.
More than 90 graves were seriously damaged at the Traun cemetery near Linz between Friday night and this morning, according to the police, an organized action.
The criminals painted Jewish symbols such as the Star of David on several graves; however, the detectives believe that this could have been done to disguise the sense of hatred of extremists towards Muslim immigrants.
Could this accident be somehow related to the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said that he was "deeply shocked" at the announcement of this desecration, which occurred just during the religious month of Ramadan that is coming to an end.
Austria is seriously thinking of regaining its courage, following its right-wing swing in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two extreme right-wing parties, which had almost 30 per cent of the votes, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, carried out an anti-immigration campaign, some of which were even regarded, according to critics, as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the Freedom Party leader who won more than 18 percent of the vote, led his campaign against wearing the scarf and burkas, and even voiced opposition to alaha food.
During his final race in Vienna, he spoke of "a European brotherhood" to avoid the rise of Islam.
Both parties are trying to prevent the construction of mosques and minarets, proclaiming that they would be a political symbol of the Islamisation of Austria and Europe.
The polls and analyses carried out just after the elections defined the far right as the strongest political bloc in the country, which is demonstrated by the majority of young voters who made the difference, because they are worried about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter forbids travel abroad.
Courts have banned rock star glamour, Gary Glitter, accused of child sexual abuse, expatriation in France and Spain.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter, after expressing their intention to travel to Spain via France to the authorities under their control.
The police in Kent granted this travel ban last Thursday after proving Glitter's guilt for child sexual abuse to the magistrates.
Glitter, or his real name, Paul Gadd, was not present at Ashford's limited court hearing, but was still represented by his lawyer Corker Binning.
A spokesman for the court said "Thursday, September 25 in Ashford court, Kent police requested an application to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from travelling to France and Spain until March 25th.
"Paul Gadd wasn't there then."
Glitter, 64, informed the authorities that he wanted to go abroad, even if he was registered on the list of those accused of sexual abuse.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to go abroad for more than three days.
In addition, he must inform the police 7 days before his scheduled departure date.
If he does not communicate his movements to the authorities, he could serve a sentence of up to five years' imprisonment.
Kent Police stated that they would not discuss any specific cases or potential movements of Glitter into the county.
A spokesman for Kent Police said, "Kent Police will do whatever it takes to protect our children as well as those from abroad.
"according to us, it is easier to monitor someone who remains in the UK because we have devices capable of managing any potential risks, in a much more effective way.
"Protecting the inhabitants of Kent is the most expensive intention for the Kent Police, and we closely monitor the behaviour of those accused of sexual abuse in the region, in order to minimize the potential risks to the public."
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month, after serving 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two 10- and 11-year-old girls, respectively.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok from where he should have boarded for a flight to London.
But he said he was not feeling well, and refused to leave for London.
The Thai authorities blocked him from passport control, and in the end he left for Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities refused him entry into their territory and were therefore forced to return to Bangkok; Thai police and immigration officers insisted that he return to England.
He finally arrived at Terminal 3 at Heathrow Airport on 22 August and, while his lawyer, David Corker, went to the Uxbridge Court of Limited Jurisdiction, West London, for registration on the list of persons accused of sexual abuse, as required by Scotland Yard.
In the past, Glitter had already been served a four-month sentence in the United Kingdom for possession of child abuse images.
A source from the Ministry of the Interior stated that Jacqui Smith, the Minister of the Interior, was reassured and pleased to know that Glitter had been banned from travelling to France and Spain.
"I photograph the master outside the scene to capture elements of his character" Günther Bauer - Photographer
No heels, no strapping.
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, freed from all tensions to obtain the relaxed appearance of the man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, the person.
Inseparable except in privacy, in these moments unknown to the general public, where one discovers with intimate gestures and the stolen looks of artists who do not care to go on stage.
The German Günther Bauer mixes in "Flamenco - people" the theatricality of some stage performances with singers, dancers and guitarists with this less known side of the artists.
In this project, the photographer takes up the special iconography of flamenco from different angles.
Included in the programme of the Flemish Photography Month, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, greater every day", explains the creator, who clarifies that "Flamenco - people" "can be anyone but, after seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not typical images of artists on stage.
These people photographed "in the street" are artists capable of transmitting on stage passion, sadness, joy ... by captivating the public.
To capture moments of personality of these artists it is not necessary to take pictures on stage.
They have a personality and a unique character.
What interests me was to create an intimate atmosphere that allows me to capture with the camera the moments of personality of the flamenco stars. "
With the festival "Popular Song of Mines", Bauer began a long journey in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a plate camera.
These are portraits that, thanks to the choice of camera and material, remind classic photography.
The implementation of different stylistic means breaks with the classic side of the image, giving it a touch of modernity, this reflects the perception of flamenco according to Bauer: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and surprises every day".
It is not the dance or the singing itself, but the personality and character of the artist who captivates the public with his art.
The search for the essentials and the magic was the constant of this work that is presented these days at the gallery El Fotómata.
Flamenco stars such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are part of the selection made from about seventy artists photographed.
The project has become an anthology of flamenco, which will soon be published in a book of the portraits exhibited in the gallery.
Bauer's passion for portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with the "Portraits of Old Sportsmen" ("SportARTproject").
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco - people", the photographer admits that he loves to photograph people's portraits, to know them and to be able to enter their lives for a little while.
I think in photography the portrait is the most difficult genre.
You find yourself in front of people, characters you sometimes don't know or who only give you a few minutes to take a picture of them.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true. "
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco, entitled "Flamenco - people", is exhibited at the Galerie El Fotómata, located at number 20 of the rue de la Mata (a street parallel to the People of Hercules) which will be opened until 16 October next.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel he writes is "real bold"
The novel takes place in places that nobody knows and deals with unknown subjects, but once again, Mario Vargas Llosa is determined to advance the new project on which he works, a novel that has as its main character Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived twenty years in the Congo and who has passed through the Amazon.
The favourite at the Nobel Prize in Literature confessed yesterday at the Hay festival Segovia, that the novel that currently occupies it "is a real audacity" and that "everything proves that it should not write it".
"If I were reasonable, I wouldn't do it, but I will do it and I hope to finish it," he concluded in his speech at the festival of exchange of ideas and thoughts that for four days saw a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people parade in the aqueduct city.
The author of "The City and Dogs" was the most anticipated character of the third edition of this festival and fulfilled his contract.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival award with the majority of the participants' voices, performed at the Juan Bravo Theatre.
The presenter of the Festival, Félix Romeo, found himself faced with a fascinating audience who did not see the past hour when the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with a great dose of humour, traced the birth of his literary vocation, which is due to "his thirst to read" and "to live new experiences"; how he wrote a "very methodical way" thanks to intense documentation work, correcting and rewriting a part of the text to face his "lack of inspiration"; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas influenced his vocation and how his memories inspired his novels.
The Spanish-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know if books change life. "But I refuse to believe that literature is a pure fun, an ephemeral experience," said Vargas Llosa, who said that it "has effects" and "makes people less alike", because writers were asked "not to let go of frivolity" and to assume their vocation.
Bad weather spoils Pozoblanco fair
The flag party that concluded the bull races at the Pozoblanco fair was suspended yesterday morning, after horse bullfighters checked that the arena was impractical.
In this way, the organizing committee, in agreement with Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Léonard Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the bull race.
The bad weather was hard on this fair, since two out of three parties could not finally take place.
On Saturday it was the rain that prevented the celebration of the second bull race planned.
On display was José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz y Juan Bautista, who should have fought in the arena of Castilblanco
So only Friday's party took place
On Friday, the winner was Daniel Luque who cut off three ears and was carried in triumph, after making arm movements facing the bull with taste and aesthetics.
In the afternoon itself Alejandro Talavante concluded on two flags planted on the back of the bull and a cut ear that the uncovered stands applauded more than his fight in himself with the bull.
Worse still for El Juli, who entered the arenas of Los Llanos without pain or glory.
In his fight with the second bull, after a much better fight, he was whistled by most of the public.
Police control of a van in the province of Alava: two thousand kilos of hashish found
Five hours minus ten in the morning.
Traffic control of the Basque police (the Ertzaintza) at the border of the municipality of Arminón (Alava).
Police officers arrest two occupants of a van and the latter two begin the flight.
Its load, more than two tons of hashish, can stop them.
The police prosecuted them and arrested one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old man, identified as A.A.J., according to reports released by the Department of the Interior of the Basque Government.
The arrested individual was charged with drug trafficking and forgery of documents.
The incident occurred when various officials of the Alava Traffic Unit carried out a vehicle check on the N-1 at the border of the municipality of Arminón.
They were about to stop a van to inspect it when the driver disobeyed orders, abruptly accelerated and control began.
The police began their pursuit until the vehicle stopped two kilometres later on the lower side, where the two occupants came down to flee into a wooded area.
The Basque police finally arrested one of the two occupants and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they were carrying and found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The rear part of the vehicle was loaded with hashballs. Then they transferred it to a police station for a thorough inspection and to weigh the drugs.
In addition, officials found that the license plate had been "falsified" as it did not coincide with the one written on the grey card of the van, which is also why they charged the detainee with an offence of falsifying documents.
Ertzaintza continues its investigation to arrest the other suspect, who managed to escape and to determine the source of the seized drug.
The detainee, A.A.J. 28 years old, was placed in police custody to carry out the various procedures and will be tried within hours.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under a drug
Actress Heather Locklear, the famous Amanda of the Melrose Place TV series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Bárbara (California) for driving under the influence of a drug.
A witness saw her do strange maneuvers while trying to get out of her garage in Montecito, according to a California police patrol spokesman at People magazine.
The witness said that at around 4:30 p.m., Locklear "was leaning hard on the accelerator, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car out of the garage, and going back several times, she rolled on her sunglasses".
Shortly afterwards, the witness, who at first had not recognized the actress, saw Locklear stopping in the middle of the highway and exiting his vehicle.
This person, at that time, called the emergency services because "she was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived, she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which partially blocked the road.
"She looked disoriented," that's why the agents took her to the drug and alcohol center to run a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative and alcohol abuse was ruled out from the outset, although "according to the observation of police officers at first sight, we thought Locklear was under the influence of a drug."
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under a substance that was not specified and was incarcerated around 7 p.m. and released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear left the Arizona clinic where she was interned to treat a nervous breakdown.
Llamazares asked the Andalusian federation of the United Left to assume its responsibilities in the Silva case
The General Coordinator and Member of Parliament for the United Left, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that it was the regional federation that took a decision on the case of the former councillor for Youth and Sports of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of performing preferential treatment for members of his family.
"In these cases, I am a very federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that will have to assume its responsibilities," said Llamazares regarding the behaviour of the political party that he will have to adopt on the Seville municipal council.
However, the leader of the United Left asked that the investigations show "transparency" for the irregularities that Silva could have committed: "The United Left has always defended such cases so that they have a maximum degree of transparency".
He also stressed that the political party has "very strict ethical codes for all civil servants".
"Blood of Mayo", Garci's dare bet
Drawing on the stories of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci recreates the famous battle of the Spanish against the French in "Blood of May", which is the most ambitious film of his filmography with nearly 15 million euros of budget.
The filmmaker tried "to stage the many characters and illustrate the social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of the long list of actors.
The film lasting more than two and a half hours, "Blood of May" will be released in the cinemas next Friday, which will then become a television series for Telemadrid of more than four hours.
A great admirer of Galdós' literature, José Luis Garci assures that with this film "a child's dream" thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him three years ago to shoot a commemorative film for the two hundred years of May 2, Madrid, something he has always accepted when the story was based on the national historical facts.
The €15 million provided by the Commune of Madrid is a "one-of-a-kind opportunity" for Garci to reproduce the atmosphere of "a Spain that has been wrong to lead the fight, since the struggle for independence has led the people to rebellions under the reign of Ferdinand VII", he said.
But the filmmaker regrets that he did not get funding as for the films "Captain Alatriste" or "The Ghosts of Goya" - more than double that obtained for "Blood of May" - because he could not shoot a few scenes written in a script signed by Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he collaborated during almost his entire career.
The filmmaker of "Reverver a primir" has influenced his usual way of working, on the staging of actors, with whom he is used to repeating before starting the shooting and to whom he does not cast, since it seems to him "humiliating" and considers that "the role of the filmmaker is to go to the theater and to the cinema to keep himself informed".
Many actors in "Blood of May" repeat in front of the camera, like Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillen Cuervo.
Four times an Oscar candidate (he won one), Garci considers that the three candidate films that represent Spain this year at the Hollywood Academy, "Blood of May", "Seven tables of French billiards" and finally the winner, "The blind sunflowers", are not representative of the young Spanish cinema, "which deserves to be better known", he said.
With this movie Garci does not expect a prize.
"At first you think you're working for posterity, then you realize you're working only for prosperity, and now you're just making an extra movie," explains Garci after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabelle Bayón gets into the shoes of the Seville dancer Tórtola Valencia
A dancer from Seville will pay tribute to a dancer from Seville as well.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, daughter of a Catalan father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and an Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district and at the age of three will live in London with her family.
She was a free dance dancer and a specialist in Oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, a pioneer in the liberation of women, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian and pleaded for the abolition of the corset that prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman who marked the history of the dance in Europe of the interwar period, fascinated Isabelle Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and the latter offered to interpret the Seville dancer Tórtola Valencia and it seemed incredible to me."
According to the dancer, "we are not trying to tell her life but to translate her thinking.
The titles of his dances made me think of flamenco.
Thus, "the butterfly dance" made me think of a Cuban folk dance and "the snake dance" to some tangos.
Her dance was sensual and they told me that my way of dancing was the same as hers," she says.
The staging was made thanks to two remarkable contributions: that of Miguel Poveda who will sing again Isabela in one of his shows, as he had done at "The Open Door"; and that of Professor Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to collaborate with the one who was his student.
"Matilde transforms Tortola into a mature character.
I am happy because she has agreed to play a role in my work and that honors me. "
The staging was also done thanks to the musical composition and guitars of Jesús Torres y Paco Arriaga, the popular song of Michel Ortega, el Pulga y Moi de Morón, the percussions of El Pájaro, as well as the rape of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, "who plays the role of the eternal companion of this kind of artists who were considered divas".
This work also tells, in a way, the life of this woman who has exhibited in places so far away, especially for the time, as in India, the United States, or Russia, but also throughout Europe, since she usually lived in London.
"I wanted to remind her because I think it is these women who have a huge influence in their time and now no one knows and highlights her work," says Bayón.
The show will start at 8:30 p.m. at the Lope de Vega Theatre
The publication of the "Journal of a newly married poet" concludes the Triennat
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Journal of a Recently Married Poet" in St Stephen's Church in New York, where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia to celebrate the "Triennat Zenobia and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the Nobel Prize in Literature and their deaths.
In this way, the "Triennat Zenobia and Juan Ramón " comes to an end with the reissue of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum and with the traveling exhibition " Juan Ramón Jiménez: This poplar of light" that was inaugurated last May and that, after traveling to the various Andalusian provinces, will go to New York at the International Congress.
Similarly, the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia bought eight hundred copies of the "Journal of a Recently Married Poet", edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to perpetuate the work of one of the most famous Andalusian poets.
America likes less without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God creates perfect people
Paul Newman was part of it."
This sentence is by actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "Absence of Malice", and illustrates the despair of American cinema, and of all America, in the face of the striking idea that Newman is no longer of this world.
He had trouble getting an Oscar.
He hasn't been shooting since 2007.
Everyone knew he was sick.
This has been a hard blow for everyone.
"Sometimes what one feels goes beyond expression, and now I have lost a great friend," cried Robert Redford, "my life and my country were better because of its existence."
No one was afraid of making a fool of themselves or exaggerating.
One of the fathers of cinema and the homeland died during a particularly obscure period, where terrorists and stock markets are afraid, American esteem has fallen far short, desperately seeking grounds for dignity.
When times are so hard and for no reason to live, there is only admiration for human beings and it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
He embodied for everyone an ideal of beauty and truth.
He was the enemy of Richard Nixon and the defender of lost and defeated causes, such as the foundation for the fight against drugs created in honor of his deceased elder following an overdose and the creation of his own organic food brand.
It was a victory for a country that struggled against a suicidal food culture.
This expanding wave of admiration swept Hollywood without paying attention to nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, found that no James Bond died before him.
Another Englishman, Oscaris Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman marked the height of his career.
The bad boy who arrived from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to name Newman as his greatest inspiration.
"He set us up," noted George Clooney, who is perhaps the only one who is trying to break through the screen today as Paul Newman did: being very honest and having a serious privacy and far from the goals.
It's still not easy or possible in the media jungle these days.
But there's the one who's trying, and Paul Newman is an example.
After a divorce, he was married fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he was faithful even though opportunities were not lacking for him not to be.
"But why should I eat a hamburger out of my house, if I have a steak in my fridge?" he used to joke.
In heaven, he proudly attends the encounter of his daughters with his fans on earth, something that is not so common in America.
"Among all the great roles he has played, he has never been as proud as the devoted husband, the loving father, the caring and philanthropic grandfather," he says.
Madrid in the race to organise the 2016 Olympic Games
And yes, the dream of many of us is that Madrid can organize Olympic Games, after the failure in 2012, this could happen in 2016.
But I wonder if we're ready.
If we take the example of yesterday's race: we are not!
They call it the perfect race, but I think it was the worst race I've ever been in.
If they had taken into account all the errors that occurred during the race, they would be the subject of an elimination note.
But let's look at it in detail and from the beginning.
Mistakes begin with the withdrawal of the dorsars, which forces you to go ahead.
It's not bad, but if they make you move it would be better if they gave you everything (including the electronic chip for the races).
Well, no.
They made you go there only to take the dossard (first mistake, move just for that) and (after a long queue) surprise!, there was only the size 'S' for the jersey (second error, because I need a size XL)
What world do we live in?
Is it because of the crisis that they decided to buy only small jerseys with less fabric and then cheaper?
Well, this is nothing compared to what happened on the day of the races.
Apart from the fact that you have to go there very early to remove the electronic chip, the queue is 15 minutes and, in addition, you have to leave your backpack at the entrance.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, this is incomprehensible since 11,000 people are expected for these races.
Since there was a long queue, the competitions began and we had not yet left our backpack at the entrance, although once done, the withdrawal was worse.
In addition, the rain accompanied the wait of more than 40 minutes during which rebellions and assaults took place in the barracks.
I believe that about 500 people will have pneumonia tomorrow, and some people like me will not even be in the classification with the exact time, because of the chip they gave me that, I think, did not mark the start properly.
Of course, if they asked me to cite an example of a perfect race, it would not come to my mind.
So I think we can always dream of becoming the host city for the 2016 J.O.
Microsoft is looking for a receptionist (virtual)
At MIT Microsoft's Emerging Technologies conference, a new system of image recognition and human interaction was presented, a kind of artificial intelligence with little intelligence but able to perform some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle to move to the company's campus) in response to what was asked of him during a conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of shapes and faces, this "receptionist" can know how many people there are in the place, who are - including remembering what positions they occupy - and listening and hearing the key words of their conversations.
But also group them together according to conversation groups
In the presentation video, the receptionist detects a third person but she understands that she does not belong to the group that is talking to her and that she is not part of the company.
She asks if she's here to visit someone and she tells him she'll answer in a few moments.
All this without a blue screen.
Impressive.
But of course this represents the future.
Now the company has other things to focus on, for example on the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week we talked in addition to a change of strategy at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and it will no longer have as many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer discovered that if computers were sold with the essential instead of useless applications, they would go five times faster.
This represents a discovery since Microsoft, version after version, has continuously added functions and "extras" to Windows.
The change of strategy is welcome.
Microsoft is right, its operating system loses importance but also its software.
When Google Chrome arrived on the network, I was one of those who adhered to the theory that Google Chrome is the first step by Google to compete with Windows.
Several people rightly pointed out that an Internet browser is not an operating system.
The operational system will always be necessary since it is the indispensable basis for the understanding of computer hardware and software.
He holds the same position as your wife or husband when you have something to say to your mother-in-law.
That's right.
It will never disappear but one must see the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth but as a relative truth.
This week, Ballmer confirmed this idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system but more and more to the Internet browser.
We turn on the computer only to run Firefox, Explorer or Chrome and every day people spend more time browsing the Internet than they do browsing windows.
Who uses half of the applications provided with the system?
Who can the most can the least.
And Windows 7 will need to contain fewer applications, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, more cumbersome, less complex.
At the moment, Microsoft is more interested in launching its own online services so that they finally become an alternative to Google.
They desperately need this, indeed, and I show you an example.
The picture in this article, was taken earlier this month in one of Microsoft's employees' rest rooms in Redmond.
On the beverage distributor, a poster asks them to use their own search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, a study concluded that 66% of Microsoft's employees used Google to search for information on the Internet.
Last week a delay occurred in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not be released in early 2009 but towards the end of 2009 or see in 2010.
Microsoft will surely try to launch at the same time Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The phone, after all, looks more and more like a computer.
But the launch of Android being late and the iPhone already on the market, it will cost them dear.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso endorsed it on the Côte d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio wore one in Edward Zwick's 'Diamond of Blood', as well as Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's 'Sponsor' and was part of the association of the muscular gays.
And if we start listing all his appearances, we could also mention this robust mustache that raised weights in a walking circus.
It's not just a simple men's body jersey made of cotton, molding and sleeveless.
The English call it 'tank' but the Fabulous Marcel de Bruxelles stands out among all the others.
First of all, by his flamboyant name - although he is known as 'Marcel' - who has to do with sport since he takes the name, according to legend, of the boxer Marcel Cerdan, a lover of singer Edith Piaf.
The 'Marcel' is distinguished from the others by its excellent cotton, its unisex cut, its distinctive logo and by the small Belgian flag ( barely recognizable) that the best known body jerseys have in their necks.
But be careful, because the Belgian brand does not only produce tank tops.
But it also produces sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, babes, mini shorts...
Clothes designed for the comfort of underwear.
Even if it's too bad to wear them only as underwear.
They have too much charm.
"I want to become a young mom; the candidate doesn't worry me"
His enormous resemblance to his sister did not prevent him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Currently the Cruz sisters take their new activity in fashion very seriously.
According to Monica, they are not just beautiful, famous girls who lend their names.
She was present at the promotion that the Mango brand made in Paris at its new head office but also at the presentation of the most important fashion awards that the Spanish house sponsors.
Monica is warm and shy.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I created for Mango for the new fall-winter season, but also to attend the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the opera dinner in honor of Valentino.
A very intense but, at the same time, exciting day awaits us.
What is the basis of your new collection created for Mango for this fourth season?
The cinema of the 1950s and 1960s delights us and we are inspired by it for our collections.
I like to walk around town and watch women see how they are dressed, how they combine their clothes, I often do.
Dancer, actress and cartoonist, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, but in the end everything comes together and these activities have a lot in common.
Since I was little I liked clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother's to look in my aunt's closets and see her clothes.
It was great, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then, when I became a dancer, I always tried to take care of my way of dressing.
Dancers like to dress very well for classes and tests, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of actress, when you wear the clothes, that's when you really get into the character's skin.
So it's all connected.
You didn't have 30 years ago: was it hard for you?
Not at all.
I feel better than ever. I'm happy with my 30s.
I think the woman is more mature, has more experience and enjoys life with less problems.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I've done all the things I've wanted to do since I was a little girl and it has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So, you think you're a mom?
Of course, I want to be a mom because my body asks me and, besides, I want to be a young mom; I don't want to lose that.
As far as the candidate is concerned, I'm not worried.
What I will do is give my son a lot of happiness and raise him with a lot of love.
Let's go to the movies, wait for the different movies you shot last year to come out.
That's right, I can't wait for them to get out.
I am a woman from the theatre, I am very impatient and worried, I would like to have everything now but of course it is not possible.
I look forward to the release of the films 'The Last Hour' and 'Looking for the Tomb of Christ'.
See what you think...
A few days ago you started on the bridge with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Don't say that!
I didn't go up on the bridge to be a model.
Just like that, Naomi Campbell called me, I've known her for quite some time, to invite me to attend a charity parade in London for her association in support of women and the clothes we were exhibiting - I exhibited two clothes from our collection created for Mango - were sold at auction to raise money for Naomi's NGO.
People that Naomi is a person with a tender heart.
They say so many things about her, I know her, many things are not true.
Besides, this good side of Naomi fascinates me.
She asked me to parade for such a noble cause, but if she had asked me to do the pear tree, I would have done it anyway.
The important thing is to make life better for women in the third world.
Recidivists of alcohol at the wheel will have to install the 'alcolock' system
The Minister of the Interior wants that the driver who has had more than three administrative penalties for alcoholemia, have to install in his vehicle a system that prevents the vehicle from starting in a state of drunkenness, or if it does not blow.
The initiative was already announced last June and is now included in the report of the Minister of State in which this initiative is considered a pilot project that will last one year.
Its aim is to reintegrate the driver by offering him road rehabilitation courses.
The Minister of State responsible for road safety, as well as the General Directorate of Road Safety and the Technological Institute for Automobile Safety Foundation, will participate in this initiative.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists arrested for driving more than once in a state of drunkenness, take the car back.
Alcohol would avoid this because it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the alcohol level in the breath and prevents the vehicle from starting if the driver does not blow before; or when the alcohol level of the driver is higher than that allowed.
Its cost is more than 1,000 euros and is at the driver's expense.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with this device reduced up to 65% of the infringements in the first year of installation.
And in Spain it is estimated that this could save 115 people every year.
This measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: dealing with these behaviours before they become criminal offences.
And to facilitate its implementation, since legal reform can be done by ordinary means, but, however, criminal reform requires reform of the organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial form, although some industrial and functional vehicles already have one on an experimental basis.
Precisely tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote for an initiative of the Spanish Socialist Party that proposes to install in the school buses this system as it was done in France.
In Mexico without 'peep-toes'
At 5:40 p.m., the scheduled official time, the plane of the Spanish air force in which the Princes of Asturias were travelling landed in the Presidential Hangar of Benito Juárez Airport in Mexico City.
The sun was on the way to bed, but its rays still forced to put their hands as a visor to see the royal couple coming down from the plane.
At the foot of the stairs, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities were present.
A few hours earlier I had asked the taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Spanish Princes were visiting the city to complete their official journey.
- Ah, all right, so we can't go to the airport to pick up customers at this hour... are you from here or...?
- No, no, sir, I'm Spanish, but I lived here thinking two years.
- Oh, very well...
But the Mexican press knows very well who the Princes of Asturias are and knows the importance of the journey.
There are several waiting in the airport hangar near the red carpet and at a military row composed of 27 marines.
The Prince is smiling and dressed in navy blue, the Princess, when to her, has hair in the wind, is dressed very soberly and does not wear her usual 'peep-toes'; perhaps they had told her that a storm threatened.
They make a brief stop at the photographers before passing in the hall where the official procession awaits them.
At the door of the hotel where they are staying, one of the four largest hotels in the city, a funny Mexican television journalist awaits them.
The most prestigious price of fashion
There is certainly no more suitable place in the world to present a fashion award than Paris and there is certainly no more extraordinary and good living designer than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of the Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, in order to strengthen the international image of new fashion talents.
The winner will be rewarded with a price of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian exit winner of the first edition, looked at her models in the window of Mango at 54 Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and she almost cried with emotion.
Certainly it is the second largest store of the brand in Europe that has just been inaugurated with 1,335 square meters of surface.
The first shop is in London.
The events, as well as the desire to thank the designer Valentino, president of the jury of the competition, have made us find ourselves in a luxurious dinner at the opera Garnier in Paris.
With the table next to that of the extraordinary Chagals family, the presidential table prepared by Mango, seemed even more spectacular.
Having grown on the heart and making against bad fortune a good heart, because of the recent death of his brother, Nati put on a garment of Mango and a few ELAH trimmings, which cut off the breath, and arm on it, arms below with his son Luis - a handsome man of almost two meters high - she accompanied Valentino to her dinner prepared in his honor.
Andik, the owner of Mango, a gallant man, and Baron de Rotchil ended the evening without a jacket because they had lent them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who presented herself at the store with a pair of pants and a shirt – from her own collection – and who for dinner metamorphosed by wearing a sexy and black long dress, moved when during the night visit of the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us the rehearsal hall of the ballets and remembering the good old days, she grabbed one of the bars and made the gesture of a 'great fold'.
Inés Sastre did not stay for the visit of the outbuildings of the palace, but she showed us before on her mobile phone photos of her son.
The next morning, we had the pleasure of seeing Olivier Martínez – another handsome man moving on a motorcycle – and John Travolta, who arrived at the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with his sheets, towels and having asked beforehand, that there be no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh, that's life.
1001, the anti-stress number
There are not only 1000 but 1001 ways to forget the chaos and frenzy of everyday life.
And to top it all off, they are all listed in a book that will bring relaxation to bookstores on September 30.
The wake-up call almost saddens us when it rings every morning at 7 a.m., but it's even worse when we think of the agitated rhythm imposed on us by today's life.
The office is synonymous with tension and the back pain computer.
Stress represents the evil of the 21st century.
But there is not one or two methods to combat daily fatigue and work-related problems.
But 1001, not one more or one less.
Apart from yoga positions, classical massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott brings together in the pages of a book a whole 'menu' of methods adapted to the taste and time of everyone.
The anti-stress work is entitled '1001 ways to relax' and will arrive at the booksellers directly from the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone believes that it is not possible to obtain tranquility in places such as work or through personal relationships, this 'manual' denies such a belief.
In addition, this manual offers other methods such as contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that help you relax.
If adrenaline doesn't run into your veins to restore your body's balance and stress has become a problem, it's time to sit on the couch, disconnect from your mind and focus on reading.
Talking in your sleep
Some kids talk at night.
I am not referring to those who wake up very awake by telling us something that happened the day before, but to children who speak during their sleep.
The first time this happens, it may surprise you, but it doesn't really matter.
It is a mild alteration of sleep called sleepyness.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure there's more than one talking at night.
This phenomenon can appear very sporadically (once in life, for example, associated with a high fever episode), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once a month...), the day after the child remembers nothing.
There is no single cause that determines its appearance
They are often related to other sleep disorders such as nightmares, night terrors, night sicknesses (to pee in bed) or sleepwalking, but this is not always the case.
As we have said before, they can also be associated with very high fevers, stress or overexcited situations.
Anyway, it's a little studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it occurs is also very variable.
He may speak with a quiet little voice, with isolated words, murmurs or, on the contrary, with cries, tears, long speeches ...
In the event that somniloquia becomes very common, it would be wise to observe the child and consult a specialist, to check if there is a problem that causes a lot of anxiety and to obtain an explanation for this problem.
We said that it is a mild alteration, which is why there is no treatment, unless it is related to another sleep impairment that can be treated (for example, if it is related to sleep apnea or stress).
What can be done is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child before going to sleep.
Therefore look for quiet games and avoid programs or TV series that are more or less violent.
With very nervous children who are struggling to relax, relaxation techniques can be used to help them calm inside.
This will allow the child to have a more peaceful sleep.
As soon as the sleepyos appear, try to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will not remember what happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake him up.
It's useless since he's unconscious and you'd wake him up.
Even if he talks, he sleeps and then rests.
Remember that if he is very anxious several times, it is advisable to consult a doctor or to check what causes so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he says (which is not usual), do not be tempted to question him for information.
You won't get anything, because by sleeping, he's not conscious so he can organize his mind.
In addition, you will hear what he says, but you will not know what he is dreaming about, so be careful how you interpret the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Never tell the child that you can interview him at night to know his secrets.
Not even joking.
This causes a lot of anxiety.
In conclusion, don't worry, it's nothing bad, it's an episode that only lasts a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
Illhaeusern finally regained the path of victory on his ground after a long period of destitution.
Without making a big game, the Yellows and Blacks created the largest number of opportunities and managed to transform one for winning the game.
The pace was not very strong during this meeting where the attackers had difficulty expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by the visiting captain Kauffmann, who scoured the lucarne on a shot from a distance, Illhaeusern would take the ascent slightly and turn around Fonderflick from a distance, then with Hirn above, Roman from the tip of the foot or Diebold would tickle Dannemarie's defense.
In front of it, we were blocking in the middle of the field and just leaving the Riahi stirrup at the tip of the attack.
The start of the second half was going to be decisive with first two occasions signed Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the score for the Illhousians by Marais, well positioned to resume a shot repelled on a first attempt of Diebold (53e').
But the Illhousiens scorer will not be able to enjoy his happiness for long and will be forced to return to the locker rooms a dozen minutes later and thus leave his teammates in numerical inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not be able to take advantage of it and will not pose any big problems to an Illousian Eleven who just retreated a little to "compare" his defense, except in the last seconds of the game where, after a big hoarseness, the bullet passed very close to the cross.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a detour through Brittany.
In the face of the demonstration of strength of the fishermen who strongly disturbed on Monday the access of several Breton and Norman ports, the President of the Republic decided to go Tuesday morning to the port of Guilvinec, in Finistère, to meet their representatives there.
They promised to welcome him "in a constructive spirit" and hope that he "will come with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit that falls at the same time as a general meeting of the "crisis committee" set up by the Breton fishermen to obtain measures in the face of the rising prices of diesel, which reached a record of more than €1.14 per litre on average.
According to the spokesman for Elysée David Martinon, the president "will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their companies regain competitiveness and to secure the conditions of employment and remuneration of sailors".
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected to stand firm by the fishermen.
On Tuesday morning, they conducted snail operations in Morbihan and Calvados, causing caps of nearly 10 km.
The marina of Quiberon was also blocked, but connections to Belle-isle did not stop.
A filter dam was set up on the Quiberon peninsula.
The sailors have already shown their determination on Monday by burning, at dawn, tires and pallets in front of the fuel deposits of the ports of Brest, and Lorient, while demonstrations were taking place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement has spread to other ports of the Atlantic front and the Channel, as in the Sables d'Olonne, in Vendée, where the trawlers have remained at dock, or in the Havre, where about twenty ships have blocked the movements of the commercial ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and the Croisic, in the Loire-Atlantique, stopped in the evening the blockade of the important Total refinery of Donges.
Those in Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until Wednesday's meeting at the Ministry to decide on possible actions.
In the Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" must decide on Tuesday the follow-up to the movement and its participation in the interview planned at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by officials of the National Fisheries Committee, who did not support their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "fishers will not let go" and "don't want to move to Paris", for example announced Liliane Cariou, president of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel fuel, currently pay about 50 cents per litre but believe that the profitability threshold of a vessel is only reached with a diesel fuel less than 0.30 euro per litre.
Paul Newman the beautiful
The unforgettable performer of "Butch Cassidy and the Kid" died of cancer at the age of 83 in his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford, and Sam Mendes praised the cinema legend and the committed actor, Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains delivery forecast in 2008
The Brazilian airliner is counting on 215 aircraft delivered this year despite the threats of recession that are hovering over the world economy.
The fourth world aviation manufacturer, Embraer, maintains its delivery forecasts for 2008 with 215 devices delivered, reaffirmed Fredrico Fleury Curado, its president.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer hopes a lot from the Chinese market especially for its aircraft of the range from 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 devices to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider divesting more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group insurer, which the US monetary authorities have bailed out, plans to divest more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the $85 billion advanced to it, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is ready to study the sale of most of its activities beyond its international life insurance and retirement activities in the United States, the newspaper quotes sources close to the file.
The board of directors of AIG met on Sunday evening to consider possible divestitures, according to the FT.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
The assets that AIG plans to separate include its International Lease Financial Corp. air leasing subsidiary, its 59% stake in the Transatlantic Holdings reinsurer, and its real estate portfolio and its private equity investments, adds the FT.
No final decision has been taken on these divestitures, the FT continues.
AIG must quickly realize liquidity to repay the loan of 85 billion granted to it by the Federal Reserve at the risk of the US authorities taking 80% of its capital, diluting the current shareholders to a due extent.
Analysis Paris History of the Morning Meeting Session History Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange experienced a historic fall on Monday after the House of Representatives rejected the Paulson Bank Rescue Plan: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a loss never seen approaching 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dived from 777.68 points to 1O.365.45 points.
In terms of points, the sharpest fall in its history (684.81 points) had previously been recorded on 17 September 2001, the day of the resumption of trade after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The technology-dominated Nasdaq index yielded 199.61 points to 1,983.73 and the expanded Standard & Poor's 500 8.81% (106.85 points), to 1,106.55 points, according to final closing figures.
Already depressed at the beginning of the session, Wall Street sank after the unexpected rejection by the House of Representatives of the Bank Rescue Plan to restore some stability in the markets.
By 228 votes to 205, representatives denied the Secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulson the means he was asking for.
Nearly two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
"This is a bad signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan," said FTN Financial's Lindsey Piegza.
"It shows how much the market was counting on this," she added, fearing that a project adopted in several days would arrive "too late."
"If the project is indeed moribund (...) then the relay will be quickly passed to the Fed (the US central bank, ndlr) and other central banks to manage the crisis, which would further tighten credit conditions," warned Brian Bethune, chief economist at Global Insight.
And further accentuating the sense of urgency, "every day that passes brings the fall of a financial institution" to the United States, said Piegza.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, the authorities organized the buy-back of Wachovia's banking activities by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has suddenly accelerated, leading to emergency interventions for banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, indicating that markets are facing "not only an American crisis, but a global crisis," added FTN Financial analyst.
The bond market has risen sharply.
The return on the 10-year Treasury bond fell to 3.632 per cent, compared to 3.827 per cent on Friday night, and the return on the 30-year bond to 4.161 per cent, compared to 4.357 per cent the previous night.
Obama, winner at the points of the first televised duel
At the first debate on Friday between the two candidates for the White House succeeded another to find out who, from John McCain or Barack Obama, took it.
Unsurprisingly, Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters proclaimed their own victory in this TV duel that was reportedly followed by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, although honourable, was not "bright enough" to allow him to stop his decline in the presidential polls from five weeks away.
The Gallup Institute, whose opinion poll published on Saturday gives Obama a five-point lead (49% versus 44% in McCain), is of the opinion that it was the Democrat who pulled his pin out of the game.
Among the undecided voters, who are the ones who count, Obama came out as a winner for 39% of the polled, while 25% of them gave McCain the victory, according to a CBS poll.
Obama should be able to confirm his advance on Thursday with the well-anticipated performance of his packer, Joseph Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
She has good instincts," however, Bill Clinton warned this weekend.
The seven-year-old McCain has constantly highlighted his unquestionable experience in foreign policy, while stressing the "naiveness" of his opponent on these issues that were at the heart of this first face-to-face.
"Senator Obama does not seem to understand that..." he accused several times.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge to be president," he said.
An angle of attack hammered since yesterday in Republican TV commercials.
Obama stressed that he represented the future.
Without disassembly, he was concise and precise.
He highlighted his ability to make the right decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
"McCain still didn't understand, while Obama did," said a Democratic spot this weekend criticizing the Republican for not taking the full measure of the impact of the crisis on the "American street."
"During the ninety minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you," Obama denounced yesterday in front of 20,000 people gathered for an election meeting in North Carolina in a raging rain.
He did not even say the words "medium class" or "workers."The financial blunder clearly benefits Obama, who is considered by the Americans to be the most able to save the economy on the edge of the precipice.
"The coming week could be a turning point," said influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer yesterday.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former Clinton administration representative, compared Obama's "good economic instincts" to Bill Clinton's during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current debacle "is the final eight-year verdict of a bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain."
Reaffirming that he would still be able to reduce taxes by 95 per cent of Americans despite the sluggishness of Wall Street, the Illinois senator also pointed out that achieving a possible energy independence of the country through the promotion of renewable energy was his first priority, with the establishment of a health insurance system.
McCain wanted to build a fleet of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Careful, the two candidates have evaded the questions regarding the financial rescue plan of 700 billion dollars (470 billion euros) adopted last night by Congress and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, "Did you notice there was an election, you?"
Young people and opponents were protesting on Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the legislation in advance.
A few hundred Belarusians met on Sunday evening from the closing of polling stations in the central square of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislature.
While no results had yet been announced, many young people had come to protest against the power of President Alexandre Lukashenko: "the dictator, resign".
Some admit they didn't even vote: "What good, since they will do what they want with my voice," says one youth.
They do not believe that the regime that has made good the presence of foreign observers in order to resume language with the European Union is ready to make a democratic turn.
Sanctions, including the ban on visas for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered by the observers to be clean.
They were not, according to the opposition.
"We were kept away from the electoral commissions and our observers were not able to participate in the recount," lamented Yuri Potemkine, the spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous group of twelve parties.
"This is a cosmetic change," says Alexandre Milinkievich, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, "because the important thing is that it counts the voices, and at home it is the executive power.
If members of the opposition enter parliament, they will have been appointed, not elected.
But their entry into parliament can mean space on television, meetings in the regions and proposals for legislation."
The opposition must therefore enter the political arena because "the dialogue with the European Union must begin.
For if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, enters into crisis, and we do not reform, we risk becoming a protectorate of Russia.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition is concerned that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process will not recognize the validity of the election.
She stressed that participation figures appeared too high, and that the generalization of advance voting (26% of voters in Minsk) had opened the door to all manipulations.
"Did you notice that there was an election, you?" asks Social Democratic leader Alexandre Kozoulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August of this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be no more than five Members of the opposition in parliament, those who are best suited to power."
The silence of the night falls on the square of October.
On television, President Lukashenko and the members of the Central Electoral Commission welcome their success.
The Interview - Blood Back Safe
Hema-Québec celebrated yesterday the 10th anniversary of its foundation, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, was right to rejoice, as Hema-Québec became one of the safest and most effective blood providers in the world.
Above all, he regained public confidence that had been seriously shaken by the contaminated blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is well known, the national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service were contaminated with acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In February 1994, in the face of this tragedy and public grumbling, the Government of Canada instituted a public inquiry, chaired by Justice Horace Krever, to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations to stop such a disaster from happening again.
While Justice Krever was late in filing his report, some provinces then set up a committee to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee fulfilled this mandate.
Following the Gélineau and Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Hema-Québec to serve Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to supply all other provinces and territories.
"In 1998, when Héma-Québec began its activities, barely 38% of people still trusted the blood system in Quebec," recalls Dr. Décary.
The situation was discouraging.
As a result of efforts to improve the safety of blood and work products in the field over the years that followed, we regained public confidence," she said before proudly asserting that at the beginning of 2008, nearly 94% of the Quebec population now had confidence in Hema-Québec.
However, Dr. Décary keeps in mind that "trust is something extremely fragile".
Since its inception, on September 28, 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, many cases of the human form of mad cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, were occurring in Europe, says the one that has held the fort since its foundation in 1998.
"And we did not know at all whether this disease could be transmitted by blood.
One of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports was that when it is not known and a serious disease may result, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is characterized by a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, exclusion measures are introduced.
In April 1999, the blood of those who had spent more than a month in the United Kingdom since 1980 was refused.
A few years ago, however, it has been shown beyond doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood.
This episode has shown us that the precautionary principle that has been applied makes sense."
In 1999, a much more sensitive HIV testing technique was introduced on the market: nucleic acid (NAT) tests, which directly detect the presence of the virus itself in donor blood and not antibodies against the virus, on which the tests used so far were based.
TANs have shortened the silent period, which extends from the time the person was infected to the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, the specialist explains.
This period could be reduced to less than one week.
This substantially reduced the risk that some donors would be infected without knowledge and could not be detected.
These improvements have significantly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS through blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people are at risk of receiving HIV-contaminated blood.
"In other words, it means that 12 million blood products will have to be distributed before someone is infected with HIV.
As Hema-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products annually, it will take more than 24 years before a case of transmission of HIV by a blood product occurs.
I think we can now feel comfortable receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to recover our health," says the Chief Executive Officer of Hema-Québec.
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogen will emerge in the system.
No later than last year the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
It is necessary to be constantly vigilant," Dr. Décary continues before pointing out that in addition to a secure supply, Héma-Québec must also provide sufficient supply.
"Needs are increasing because the population is ageing.
As anti-cancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need to recharge red blood cells or platelets.
The aging of the population also has consequences on the blood donor network, which on average accounts for only 3% of Quebecers eligible for blood donation."
Any healthy person who is 18 years of age or older who meets the eligibility criteria can still give blood every 56 days, six times a year.
On average, 14 per cent of people who offer their blood are not accepted because they suffer from AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have travelled to a malaria-affected country, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
"With these 3%, we manage to maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Shortages are very rare.
But it is necessary to renew the members of this donor network as they age and can no longer give their blood.
It is difficult to convince people to give their blood, but above all to hold them back and encourage them to become a regular donor.
As today's life is so frantic, one rarely finds time to spend an hour giving blood," desolates Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Québec supplies not only blood products, but also human tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored at Héma-Québec, which also manages the only public cord blood bank in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was once considered a biomedical waste is filled with blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"We celebrated, a few weeks ago, the banking of our thousandth sample of cord blood and we plan to collect more than a thousand per year.
We should start proposing transplants at the beginning of next year," says Dr. Décary, who describes this cord blood collection program as very popular.
"Several moms are disappointed they can't have access to it," as Héma-Québec has no means of offering this complex and expensive program in all Quebec hospitals.
Soccer - The Impact in the semi-final
The Montreal Impact qualified for the semi-final round of the playoffs of the first division of the USL, thanks to a win of 3-1 (4-3 in total goals) at the expense of the Seattle Sounders, yesterday, during the second and decisive game of the quarter-finals series in total goals, at Stade Saputo.
The middle of the field Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal at the 90th minute of play.
After a goalless first half on both sides, the middle of the field David Testo and Rocco Plancentino marked the other nets of Montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one who played Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Let's remember that in the first round-trip game on Friday, the Impact had suffered a 2-1 defeat at the Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, in the suburbs of Seattle.
The Impact will be measured at Vancouver Whitecaps in the semi-finals.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thunder filled a deficit of 3-1 in the return game to win 4-3, but the Whitecaps still reached the semi-final round 5-4 in total goals.
The Impact should face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series will be confirmed today.
In Brief - Kovalev's Victorious Goal
The Canadian's number one trio is ready to start the season.
The unit composed of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn led the attack in a 3-2 Canadian win at the Florida Panthers last night at the Bell Centre.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the match, scored a goal, Plekanec collected two assists, and Kovalev collected a pass in this win, the fourth of the Tricolore in six preparatory games.
Kovalev gave the victory by marking the only goal of the shooting.
"I'm not ready yet," warned the Russian.
I need another game to feel comfortable."
"He tried to do too much in the first period," noted Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he enjoyed the end of the game.
He had a nice ovation."
Charest bet on the North
The Prime Minister does not rule out the possibility of holding elections before the end of the year
As soon as the Liberal Party General Council was completed, Jean Charest visited Jean-Talon, Quebec, yesterday, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), is trying to get elected on the occasion of today's by-election.
"Remove the limits of our last major northern border": this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual force while remaining in the broad outlines, at the end of the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, a sort of image mill was projected.
On three huge screens, spectacular photographs of hydroelectric dams, mining operations, Quebec, seen by "Google Maps", maps, etc. were turning in a loop.
Great means as in the election period.
As a news outlet, the Prime Minister refused to exclude that he would call the elections this fall, even though he pointed out that his schedule was very busy.
The "Plan Nord" is the fourth part of a "vision" that the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes an agreement on labour with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe, and agreements with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the Prime Minister's speeches recently, the opening of the North - the northern territory at the 49th parallel - had never been presented.
The Prime Minister, however, merely explained why the North was "a jewel with immense potential", but did not give time, amounts of investment, or specific priority in future projects.
At most a few avenues of what could be further developed: in particular hydro, the forest, but above all the mining sector, driven by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamond", according to Mr. Charest's enumeration.
This "territory twice as big as France", "it's home, it's in Quebec.
Not only is it home, but it's in us," he insisted, as if to show that he was asking for a national founding myth.
Quebec has built a lot in its relationship with the North, he stressed: the gold rush in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James Bay.
"It's ours, it's our future," he added, after taking a theatrical break to contemplate the immense map behind it.
The North, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes a portion of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, said the Prime Minister at the press briefing.
"This is a traditional position that all governments have reiterated.
There is a border line on which there has been no agreement for a very long time and, when the opportunity arises, I reiterate this position on behalf of the government," he said.
"With climate change, we need to rethink our vision of the North," he said, speaking of the Northwest Passage, which will open all year round because of the melting of the ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that occupying the territory is a duty.
What about the locals, First Nations and Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebec would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, especially young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pequist deputy of Ungava), have already begun consultations with some 30 communities.
An interdepartmental committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important place has begun work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a large meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a time when "a common vision will be given".
Northern development would also be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The Northern Plan will be "concerted, orderly and environmentally friendly," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as being in continuity with that of the Liberal prime ministers who preceded it.
"Like the Liberals who preceded us, we thought otherwise to turn the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
This was also one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a big cocktail to mark the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's arrival at the head of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposed the renaming of the Beauharnois Centrale in the Adélard-Godbout Dam.
"From Godbout, who created Hydro-Québec, to Lesage who made the Quiet Revolution and the nationalization of hydropower, to Bourassa who made the James Bay, our party managed to forge the future," said Jean Charest.
As a news outlet, he invoked another conservative reference to the "Roads to the North" program by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
In addressing the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam project, Mr. Charest stressed that its commissioning was planned for 2012.
"It stays between us, but I plan to be there," he told his activists, raising their applause.
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008 and probably not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of calling a vote this fall, which the law allows him.
He points out, however, that his schedule is fulfilled, notably by a mission of the federation council in China and a Quebec-New York summit.
The weekend General Council provided the Liberal leader with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, including "constitutional aspirations" that have passed as a letter to the post: the PLQ calls in particular for recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
He also hoped that Quebec would appoint members of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission and that they would have the right of veto over decisions taken in Quebec.
On the opposition side, the broad outlines of the Northern Plan were welcomed with scepticism.
The Beijing Chief Pauline Marois emerged from the Northern Quebec Development Policy launched by the Landry government in 2001.
In her view, the Liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, gave up applying it.
If he had done so, "we would be more advanced today" commented Ms Marois alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (scrutin that is taking place today), Françoise Mercure.
The QDA said it supported the adoption of a Northern Plan by the government.
"But what we want is that this isn't just a show," commented leader Sébastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who is coming back from vacation today.
Letters - A dishonored country
It was Mr. Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice (O Irony) in Harper's firm, who allowed herself last summer to say that Louise Arbour was a shame for Canada.
To cast the reproach on this woman who has waged an incessant struggle for justice and who deserves all our admiration says as much about the Prime Minister's entourage as about Stephen Harper himself.
Here we are in front of a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, not to have repatriated its citizen locked up in the Guantánamo concentration camp.
A government that takes no account of the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager at the time of the events he was accused of.
The only government that, despite Canada's signing of the Geneva Convention, denies its word and lets a child soldier croup under inhuman conditions.
The only one who relies on a parody of justice to assess the guilt of the accused.
As a reminder, UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, among other things, are advocating for the repatriation of Omar Khadr for a fair trial in Canada.
It is the same government that closes its eyes to torture: it does not matter whether a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, probably forever after so many years of abuse.
We do not yet realize this, but we are witnessing at the moment an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy", this word that Harper keeps brandishing and which sounds so hollow in his mouth.
The time has come when there is no longer any morality: one can mislead, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen according to the goodwill of a so-called minority head of government (so what will happen after October 14...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that advocates the Vertu, the Law and the Order: they do not see that this government has renounced what made our country's reputation and dignity.
Shame, Mr. Toews, she's here, in this renunciation, and not anywhere else.
Free opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwellian Speech
In its September 17 edition, Le Devoir published a letter from Patrick J. Garver, Executive Vice-President of Canadian Mining Barrick Gold.
Pursuing an Orwellian logic, the Orwellian states that the world's largest gold company has filed a defamation suit of six million against three authors and a small, penless publishing house with the aim of launching a "transparent public debate".
While judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth they judge, especially in the case of defamation proceedings, but the law.
Unsurprisingly, this fundamental difference is completely concealed by Mr. Garver.
Because, for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would be to ruin anyone who dares to support a position contrary to his own?
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the authors and publisher of the Black Canada book will have to spend considerable money to prepare their defence and to fight, with very unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers supported by almost bottomless pockets of mining.
The tactic, in these unequal struggles, is, moreover, often to ruin the defendants in order to impose a settlement to the amicable that will stutter the opposition in addition to scaring anyone who dares to address the issue again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it was before the public that she should have presented her vision of the facts.
Unlike in many of the countries where Barrick Gold works, debates in Canada are normally conducted through the exchange of ideas rather than by batons.
Thus, it was sufficient for mining to open its books, records and establish a real debate, through newspapers, the media, publications and the funding of independent research teams that could have shed light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold does not seem to trust public opinion and rejects from the back of his hand the petitions and letters of support for Black Canada's authors.
Perhaps Mr. Garver could explain how he can both ask for a "public" debate while disregarding the views of the same public?
In the vice-president's world, it seems that this word refers only to fat lawyers paid and not all Canadians; here is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In democracy, even detractors have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand - is that the public that supports Black Canada's authors and publishers do so primarily because it rejects the brutal way of mining.
This public is ready to hear Barrick and to judge, but on the basis of civilized exchanges of arguments, and not in the context of what many perceive as a bailiff (in pursuit of the "public debate", Barrick Gold has, moreover, just filed a notice against Black Canada authors urging them to stop using this term...).
Beyond Mr. Garver's surreal speech, the pursuit of Barrick Gold is a direct attack on the freedom of academic research and the quest for truth, essential to any democratic society.
It denies, as a whole, the right to quote credible sources and to debate facts and interpretations, which are the very basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss topics that displease the rich companies of this world in a country like Canada, under duress of repeated prosecution, who will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could do so by following the scientific standards used by Black Canada authors.
She has a right of reply.
The academic community, to which we belong, has long been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's disproportionate pursuit clearly shows that, contrary to what she claims, she has no desire for a transparent debate.
It is a loss to the academic world, as well as to the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place mechanisms to limit such abusive prosecutions.
Wall Street Rescue Operation - Democrats and Republicans Agree
The Bush administration and Congress leaders, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the largest economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the US$700 billion plan to curb the financial crisis that has shaken Wall Street for months still needs to be endorsed by both chambers of Congress.
In particular, it provides for: better control by elected officials of its implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of public money committed, new provisions to contain the number of houses seized for default of payment, and a right to look at the salaries paid to the managers of the rescued enterprises.
The US Treasury Secretary, Henry Paulson, Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and the Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday at the end of a two-day negotiating marathon.
"We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be effective in the markets," said Bush administration representative Henry Paulson.
"Everything has been done to protect the real economy and ordinary Americans from the ongoing crisis on Wall Street," said the Democrat.
"This is the fundamental point: if we don't do this, the trauma, chaos and disruption to the daily lives of Americans will be immense," Republican Judd Gregg said.
The negotiations had turned to sprint in the last few hours for fear of the effect that a new failure would cause on the mood of investors.
The cut-off time was the opening of the markets this morning.
Lately associated with the negotiations, the two candidates for the U.S. presidential election were rather in favour of the agreement, without failing to express their discontent at being forced to reach that end.
Senator Democrat Barack Obama attributed himself to the addition of certain provisions to the agreement, including that aimed at allowing homeowners to keep their homes, and that on the salary of managers of state-recovered companies.
"When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, there is nothing to be congratulated on.
But these measures are necessary," he commented on American television.
Asked on another channel to see if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, replied, "I'd like to see the details, but I hope so."
"The broad lines I have read [show] that this is something that we will all have to digest and with which we will be able to move forward.
The option to do nothing is simply not acceptable," he said.
The $700 billion plan aims to buy back with taxpayers' money the doubtful, risky and unsellable claims of US financial institutions.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis triggered by the bursting of a real estate bubble that first led to the collapse of mortgages at risk (subprime) before extending to other more widespread forms of credit (PCAA) and leading to a freezing of liquidity and the debandade of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republicans who blew up the first draft agreement last week.
It is believed that they have come out of this impasse since the Democrats accepted that certain "toxic" assets of companies in difficulty are only insured by the government, rather than purchased.
In order to round the corners for everyone in Congress, a provision was also added stipulating that if the government were to bear losses for five years with this program, it could put in place new taxes to help it recover its stake.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first tranche of 250 billion to which an additional 100 billion may be added if the President deems it necessary.
Another 350 billion is expected to be endorsed by another Congressional vote.
In exchange for his help, Washington will get stakes in the rescued companies that will be worth dividends in the event of profit and that he will be able to resell when the storm is over.
The federal government will have the opportunity to delay the seizure procedures for housing units for real estate loans covered by this plan, as well as to set limits on the remuneration and severance pay paid to the managers of the affected companies.
The plan's architects would like to see it put to the vote in the House of Representatives today, and in the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will have the green light.
Indeed, votes continued to rise yesterday against this project, both in the Republican and Democratic camp.
"Certainly, Washington does not hear you," Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House Finance Committee, told his constituents.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the one that consists of profiting from taxpayers".
Animator of a small group at the Congress called "the sceptics' caucus", Democratic Representative Brad Sherman presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred prominent economics professors, including three Nobel Prize winners, wrote to us to tell us: Congress is asked not to rush and carefully examine the way forward," he said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, we once again had proof of the global nature of the crisis.
At the end of an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for EUR 11.2 billion (16.3 billion US).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg was made necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it had given up acquiring its competitor in full sinking since it lost EUR 2 billion (US 2.9 billion) in the crisis of risky real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the twenty largest European banks and ten largest insurers.
"This is not lost money," Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
In return, one recovers a right to vote in the bank and influence.
It's just something that savers and households now appreciate that times are getting uncertain."
Meanwhile, on the other side of the Channel, the British government seemed to be nationalizing another bank badly affected by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all outstanding loans from Bradford and Bringley Bank, including over US$41 billion (75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander informed yesterday that it was she who would buy the branches and accounts of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, to be nationalized by the British government since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a committed icon
His beauty in the eyes of the blue was long his card asset, some will say his weakness.
Had he freed himself from the narcissistic mirror, the American actor with a charming smile?
Yes and no.
His modesty, sensibility and a talent that flowed from the source will also have removed him from the power register that gives birth to the true sacred monsters.
But what a great cross-country runner!
Paul Newman, who disappeared on Friday, at the age of 83, from lung cancer in his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of the past few years.
Less monumental than Brando, to whom he looked and whose long time he was a sort of rival on the screen, more cautious in his game, certainly more fragile, but also apostle of freedom and the bursting of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often makes beautiful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, to a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother of origin.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without excessive ego, ultimate quality brand.
For in him there was a whole country full of self-made man, the warrior of the Pacific war, wounded in combat, who in the early 1950s studied dramatic art in Yale and then attended the Actor's Studio in New York, before triumphing at the theatre, on television, soon at the cinema.
The same man who fought for civic rights was also the car driver who ranked second in the 24 hours of Le Mans in 1979, with a sex symbol, although a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
The shadow zones of this secret, discreet, committed, and allergic star of the show-business are also disappearing with him, and the puzzle will not have been completely pierced.
An honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
Paul Newman's disappearance brought vertigo to the filmmakers this weekend, as his great roles overlap on the black screen of memories.
More than half a century of a seventh American art in perpetual mutation parades through it.
Back to the memory of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man rejecting his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in La Chatte on a suitable burning roof of Tennessee Williams in 1958.
Closer to us (1990), his sensitive Mr. Bridge, troubled in his old age by a marriage that did not fulfill all his promises, was mentioned.
So many other Paul Newmans have come to history.
This boxer Rocky Graziano, delinquent, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Someone Up There Likes Me, by Robert Wise, a role intended for James Dean, resumed after his death, who really launched Newman in 1956.
This sympathetic miscarriage in the brilliant The Sting (L'Arnaque), Oscar of the best film in 1973.
A bitter billiard player and avenger in Robert Rossen's magnificent The Hustler (1961), he will take over the character on Martin Scorsese's return to The Color of Money, which in 1987 earned him his only Oscar out of nine nominations.
That face through the ages was him.
Him again.
The eras are shaking through his path.
Young people know him mostly through George Roy Hill's cult Slap Shot (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen brothers.
With a final role as Irish Mafia sponsor in Road to Perdition by Sam Mendes in 2003, the loop was closed.
Against several movie legends who gave up the profession early enough, Newman would have remained in the saddle for a long time, while denouncing Hollywood, its gold, its charms and its concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered him, not without humour, "as a living challenge to "underplaying" judging his performances too supported.
The profession has not always been tender for the beautiful Paul Newman to whom the roles fell long all cooked up in the beak.
However, he played less often the young first than the marginals: neurosists, alcoholics, bastards or desperate, whose perfect traits reflected the drifts and revolts.
As a director, Newman revealed poorly known facets of his true pudic sensibility.
His Rachel, Rachel, in 1968 (according to the Canadian novel Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, drew a fine female portrait of melancholy.
He who lost his son Scott by overdose dedicated his film Harry and Son to him in 1984, a work of modesty and sadness.
Amongst the heavy tributes that struck Newman yesterday, his great friend and former arms companion Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, very saddened: "His presence has made my life and this country better."
Generosity, love of existence are vibrating traits of the missing actor.
Beyond his legendary career, he also wipes out a great activist for civic rights, ecology, independent cinema, a challenger of Hollywood's drifts.
We'll have seen a lot of her benevolent throne on pots of vinaigrette, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging the process of quite bad taste, although gag at the beginning.
However, the profits from these sales were paid to his Foundation for Children in Difficulty.
Newman, rather than sitting on his myth, will have committed himself to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter containing these sentences: "Always and until the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be here."
And a privilege for us to have followed the path of such a lucid and generous American artist.
A model citizen, in sum and in addition.
What could Zuschlag &amp; Company do in their invoice factory?
In the near future, on 8 October, hearings on the ongoing criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and his accomplices will begin.
The politician and his accomplices are accused of fraud, in the form of a criminal organization, on a permanent and regular basis, resulting in particularly serious damage, and other charges have been brought against them, such as forgery and use of falsehood.
According to the prosecution, money from grants was spent for personal purposes, while benefits were justified by false invoices.
The money of the state and the municipalities, about 65 million HUF in total, went on the one hand in the caisses of the Fial Baloldal movement and on the other, in the pocket of some people.
Their method, also made public by the investigating authorities, was to receive the money from the subsidies obtained by issuing bills of fees, after which no real benefits were provided and thus, the associations never complied with their commitments.
According to the indictment, a large part of the invoices were false.
For the latter, they obtained invoice books from the Józsefváros market, while they manufactured the stamps in Kiskunhalas.
For the names of companies that would appear on the invoices, it was decided, among other things, during the tours in the northern province of Lake Balaton, carried out by István Lados, at the request of János Zuschlag.
According to his testimony, he had to locate pensions and restaurants.
For his personal consumption, he asked for an invoice, on the model of which they made the other invoices that they were going to introduce, among other things, to the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, and the Municipality of the Capital to access subsidies.
The majority of the invoices were created by István Lados and his accomplice András ☆ri, who, according to our information, was mainly responsible for drafting the necessary files for obtaining the subsidies.
During a "tracking circuit", one of Lados' choices was a bistro.
According to the two invoices issued by the Zuschlag in 2003, this place has restored a group of 90 people, members of the association Biztos Pont Egyesület.
However, according to the manager, it would have been impossible for so many people to occupy this place at the same time.
In the same way, in the summer of 2002, the invoice drawn up on behalf of the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, which will later bear the name of Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért, was full of faults of form and substance.
A pension, located in Badacsonytomaj, actually had only three bedrooms, and a maximum of ten people could spend the night there. However, the bill mentioned one hundred and thirty customers.
In the accounts, neither the name of Jobb Jövőért nor that of Hoppá appeared, according to the information given to the prosecution.
Győző Farkas, the company's manager, told hvg.hu that when the prosecutor summoned him and showed him the invoices, he immediately knew that they were false documents.
"The name of our company and our tax number were placed in a wrong place on the stamp."
He added: "Beyond the form, the fact that, according to the invoice, 100 people have stayed there, also did not collide, since this establishment has only eleven rooms, which do not have so much space.
In addition, the invoice also mentions meals, and our restaurant has been closed for a long time."
The issuers of zealous invoices also did not find out about the travel agencies of Budapest, which were part of their choice, but only organized trips abroad. Thus, naively, they indicated stays in Hungary on invoices to be paid in cash, which also goes against the accounting practices of the agency.
Moreover, as it appeared in the investigation, they also added VAT on these documents, while the services relating to travel activities, whose destination is outside the European Union, are invoiced without VAT.
Similarly, the VAT rate of the four invoices established on behalf of the Hotel Revfülöp at the order of Jobb Jövőért was incorrect, since the company's services do not bear a VAT of 25% as indicated, but a VAT of 15%. Furthermore, the hotel employees only issue printed invoices, while the fakes were handwritten.
The prosecution's investigation revealed that the "issuers" also made mistakes by mentioning as a service the transport of goods by road, which the invoice-issuing company could not exercise, since its profile was the investment council.
Moreover, it is also for defects of forms, such as inadequate types of invoices and false stamps, that the invoices issued to the order of Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, of XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont proved false.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or Kunfehértó's sports internship, both of which deny being the authors of the invoices issued on their behalf.
Nor did the counterfeiters pay attention to the fact that the company HIB Kft., established in Nyíregyháza, was in liquidation at the time (in 2001) the group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület was supposed to have a meal at their home. According to our information, it is for this reason that the liquidator of the company denies having issued this invoice.
Deliberately established invoices
Another category of invoice issuers is that of those who were fully aware that they were being asked to issue fictitious invoices.
The foundation Esély Budapestért Alapítvány, at the request of the group of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, has established an invoice to the order of the foundation Együtt to Harmadik Évezrerit, for a sum of four million HUF.
According to the indictment, the manager of Collab Kft. was forced to issue false invoices by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi.
Similarly, it cooperated with the Zuschlags, the company Biogate Kft., which is currently under liquidation and which in 2003 issued invoices to the order of the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány Foundation, the association Atlasz Egyesület and the association Vörösfenyő Egyesület, for an amount of approximately HUF 5 million, but after which no benefits were actually provided.
No financial movement took place, either, as the invoices issued were subsequently cancelled, but this was avoided by the agencies in their accounts.
The following category of invoice companies is that of companies directly related to the accused.
Thus, the administrative delegate of the general manager of Delta Trió Kft., dealing with the fuel trade and motor vehicles, whose head office was in Budapest, but where it was not found, was Ivan Kubatov.
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued several invoices for the sale of computer equipment, amounting to approximately HUF 18 million.
According to the investigation, the equipment was allegedly purchased by Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, which had been in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The director of this company was a man of Romanian origin, to whom Ivan Kubatov would also have sent documents related to the company, between 2002 and 2005.
As far as we know, Kubatov acknowledged during the investigation that he issued invoices to the order of Atlasz, Hoppá and Együtt companies to Harmadik Évezrert Alapítvány, and that he seized their countervalue.
It was precisely at the request of Ivan Kubatov that Romanian masons created the companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In fact, none of these companies were functioning, which the accused explained by the fact that they did not receive work.
He still used these companies, since at the request of Master Zsolt Szente, co-accused as well as editor of the acts of foundation of the companies, he made invoices to their names, to the order of associations relating to Zuschlag, such as the associations Atlasz and Y-Generáció.
Kubatov gave agencies, 15 invoices in total, issued by Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, for a value of HUF 14.2 million.
The prosecution thought that 10% of the amounts indicated on the invoices as well as VAT went into Kubatov's pocket.
The man even used the company Szi-Beri Bt. to establish fictitious invoices that were used in the context of Biztos Pont's grant application.
In January 2006, the Y-Generáció and Szövetség Association in Modern Magyarországért applied to the public utility body of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA).
They obtained this grant twice as much as HUF 500,000, but these amounts were not used for the purposes indicated in the application.
To avoid this, five fictitious invoices received from Works Team Kft. were presented to the TMA.
Moreover, these invoices were found during the search carried out in Árpád Kemecsei's office in the Ministry of Education.
At the hearing, some of the defendants will report on the method of making the invoices, as they had done before the prosecutor's office earlier.
What could be really interesting would be that the prime defendant, János Zuschlag himself, decides to lift the veil over the whole story.
So far, his confessions are not very detailed, and although he has repeatedly promised to tell the smallest details, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in his interest, or perhaps the Socialists would have reached an agreement that, in exchange for the repayment of a large part of the fifty million HUF, Zussi would wear the hat alone.
Today, the latter is likely to be offended, as requests for his supervised residence, on the basis of a reduction in his conditions of detention, are continually falling into the ear of a deaf person.
While those who have caused much greater damage, and those who commit unreparable economic crimes, walk freely or at least wait at home for the end of the proceedings. He does not have this possibility.
The psychology of the auction: why are we spending more money?
At auctions, buyers tend to spend more, and overestimate the goods.
Neurology and economics researchers at the University of New York have been able to update the neurological and economic bases of this well-known and apparently irrational behaviour.
According to their study published in the journal Science, human beings do not want to be distanced in this type of competition, such as an auction on eBay, and that is why they even prefer to pay too high a price.
This research attempted to develop a neurological pattern of this kind of "game" using experimental auction sales.
One of the groups of volunteers played the lottery, while the other group took part in a playful auction, while using a functional magnetic resonance (FMRI) process, researchers analyzed the active brain domains of experimental subjects.
In both games, participants could earn money, but during the auction, one essential element of which is the over-award of a third, the whole being under the brain stem, called striatum, was moving intensively when the part was lost.
This part of the brain, alongside several other functions, plays a role in the mechanism of "self-stimulation" of the nervous system.
This is why, according to researchers, the rise in prices is explained by the leak in front of the violent reaction of striatum.
In support of their theories, economists in this group of researchers continued financial surveillance analyses.
In these cases, three groups were over-bidding against a partner in various circumstances.
They simply informed the group about the actual value of the product in question, and they did so.
To another group, they promised that if, in addition, they would win the game, then they would receive an extra $15 in reward.
While the third group received this $15 before the auction, the members of the group also lost that money in case they lost the auction.
The difference between these two groups is, in fact, that the emphasis was on victory in one group, while the focus was on failure in the other group.
Thus proving the hypothesis of neurologists, the members of the players' team "against failure" were willing to bet higher than those performed by the control group and the group "for victory".
"These results cannot be demonstrated by any existing economic theory.
In fact, each one explained the phenomena found in auction sales only by the pleasure of winning and the parade at risk.
Only the methods of neurological imaging have helped to remove the contradiction between the two theories by leading, now, to a third explanation." - noted Andrew Schotter, professor of the Faculty of Economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When should we consult a doctor?
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while in Hungary chronic liver disease is mentioned as one of the leading causes of death.
It is estimated that one hundred thousand patients carry the hepatitis virus in Hungary, but only seven miles are treated because of the fact that patients often do not know that they carry the virus.
The name hepatitis is a generic name given to infections affecting the liver and caused by different viruses.
There are many similarities between their symptoms. Inflammation of the liver and jaundice are characteristic, but pathogens and induced diseases differ from each other.
Hepatitis viruses, depending on the pathogen genes, spread mainly in two forms: hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (e.g., contaminated food or water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses by blood and organic fluids (sperm, vaginal secretion, saliva).
For travellers, it is recommended to be vaccinated against viruses A and B. There is no vaccine for C.
Symptoms of hepatitis A occur two to three weeks after consumption of contaminated foods, usually accompanied by poor general condition, weakness, stomach ailments and nausea.
Then a visible yellowness develops on the skin and on the white of the eye, the stools become clearer and the urine takes a darker color. Healing can take two to three weeks.
Around the world, every year, one million people die from the most serious form of this disease, such as cancer or liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only one in ten patients receive medical treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: if not treated, it can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most patients are not aware of the virus, because the pathogenic gene disproportionately destroys liver cells. In many cases, the first symptoms only appear after 20 to 30 years.
Therefore, early prevention is very important, as well as regular screening tests.
The contamination is much higher than the average among a population of three groups: people who had undergone a blood transfusion before 1991, drug users and tattoos.
Currently, there are 200 million patients with chronic hepatitis C worldwide.
Since the disease can be detected through a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to consult your doctor when symptoms of unknown origin are observed.
The disease can be cured, if it is detected in time. The virus can be eradicated from the body, in this way the risk of contagion disappears and the development of a cancer is prevented.
September 30th is World Hepatitis Day, organized for the first time in 2004 by organizations representing patients from around the world.
Its objective is to draw attention to chronic liver cirrhosis caused by viruses, the causes of its development and the importance of early diagnosis of the disease.
Does anyone who grows in God feel less pain?
According to the results of recent research, religious belief would function as a sort of painkiller, which would have already contributed to making the death of Catholic martyrs more bearable.
The British daily Telegraph published an article according to which researchers from the University of Oxford have realized an interesting experience by analyzing the level at which belief in God can influence tolerance for human pain.
As part of this strange experience, 12 Catholic believers and so many atheists were subjected to electroshocks, while each of them observed a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude much of the suffering.
Thanks to a technique of palpation of the human brain, it was also found that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain responsible for regulating pain.
This analysis is the first in a series of experiences, in which academicians, scholars, philosophers and theologians participate from different sectors of the university.
Specifically, the experiment takes place as follows: an instrument that emits sparks and diffuses electroshocks is attached to the left hand of the experimental subject.
The researchers asked the participants of the experiment to look at two paintings in a sustained way, one being the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and the other, the Lady with the hermine painted by Leonardo da Vinci in the 15th century.
The researchers at the origin of this experience hoped that the view of the Virgin Mary evokes a kind of state of faith among believers, while the choice of Da Vinci's painting, not very different from the first, focused on its soothing effect.
The experimental subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, and during that time, they received 20 electroshocks in four successive parts, while looking at either the religious theme painting or the more general theme painting.
The Catholics declared that in the sight of the Virgin Mary, they felt as "safe", as someone "take care of" and they "quietly, and peace invaded them".
In view of the painting of religious theme, they reported 12% less pain than when they looked at Leonardo's work.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who himself took part in the experiment, thinks that the same effects can be achieved with any other strong image, in atheists, provided he finds the appropriate photo.
"We should find an image to which they react very positively, such as a mother or a father," said the psychologist.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of this research.
"The practice of faith should change, and in many cases, it does change our personality," Wright added.
After these excellent results, all that remains is the question of what would be the effect on the regulation of the pain of the subjects if we showed the believers a Madonna painted by Leonardo or by a painter of the same caliber?
Would the view of a Virgin Mary of better quality produce better results?
You're what you're telling me about you.
On the occasion of its tenth anniversary, Google states that it can be found at the bottom of people's pockets as well as the sky above their heads. It knows where they spent their holidays, what specialists they consult and what are their interests.
Yet it is not yet enough, according to Eric Schmidt, who is one of the influential people in society.
While with regard to the skeptics establishing a parallel with Orwell's vision of horror, they just don't see the bulk of web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt said recently in the Financial Times that Google's main ambition is to gather even more information about its users. This is necessary for Google founders to meet their initial goal, which sounded as follows: "Let's gather into a system all the information in the world!".
According to the Google leader interviewed, after ten years of global change work, they are still only at the beginning of their goals of being able to process all the information.
To the question: what will happen in five years? Schmidt replied that he would like Google to be able to answer questions like "What can I do tomorrow?" or "What would be the best job for me?" However, software will only be able to answer this kind of question, simple at first glance, on the day they know enough about users.
It is not perfectly clear to all Internet users that the words used during internet searches, the IP address of the computer launching the search, and the pages then accessed by interested persons are precisely listed.
Through the Personalized Search program launched two years ago, users can, for example, store their own search history and can view what they have searched for, what they have clicked on. Thanks to this, in the long term, Recommendations, program based on the same logic, will be able to give much more personalized answers, and will submit products and services based on our previous statements and registered preferences.
What happens if someone uses my data against me, if they look at what my work is? users ask, who worry seeing Google's monopoly of information.
In most cases, it is the potential power represented by society that can arouse fear, and it is not the remorse, the fear of punishment, the desire for freedom or possibly the revolt against power that can provoke a counter-reaction among Internet users.
However, it is a confirmed fact that the terms sought are not only registered, but in justified cases they are passed on to a third party, and in such legal cases, nothing protects the personal rights of Internet users.
The most striking example of recent years is probably the coordinated action against Brazilian paedophiles, during which Google transmitted to the Brazilian government the information it had collected on the public page called Orkut, thus allowing an identification.
Human rights-conscious Internet users were able to breathe a sigh of relief last May, when Google, arm above arm with EFF's electronic legal protection agency, proved its right to the court before the FBI. According to the ruling rendered, in the future, Google will still not be obliged by any of the constitutional points to disclose information about the FBI's secret request, of any kind.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully obtained some 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms that it had won in relation to the strengthening of the Child Protection Act, voted several years ago. But ultimately, it fails to obtain the lists of searches of private users, nor the entire list of websites and keywords of the past two months.)
Google's judgment is therefore quite contradictory: it is flouted by those who fear the transmission of their personal data, because they think that their intimate sphere and private domain suffer from it when they start using Google services. Therefore, they attack them in the spirit of revolt that is manifested against the proud multinational companies of their conservative image.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its "savageons" bringing together enthusiasts, activists and enthusiastic computer users who appear in many countries see Google as the next generation of big companies, the "connected corporation", as opposed to its rival, Microsoft, catalogued as an invader of the world because of Windows, and this, even though both are fighting for the same goal.
This can be explained by the fact that Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for identification code, does not ask for money for its applications. The documentary code and the package of programs, continuously refreshed, has a much more accessible, younger and cooler effect, compared to the practice of the official software giant.
The reason may also be that geeks see very exactly the problematic relationship between human rights and the internet, and what web 2.0, the most proclaimed keyword of recent years, is right behind it.
Indeed, web 2.0 does not concern anything other than collaboration, that the fact that we intentionally leave traces behind us, and that we use channels of communication made available to us, and while the dimension of these changes one by one, the essential remains the same: we expose ourselves.
A young person, in general, can keep a profile on several public pages, from Facebook to Shanghai, and he can even link them to other services, such as Twinter, or last.fm, listing his musical habits. Then he can link them to a tracking system, such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. These young people can also hold blogs, in which they automatically appear their latest photo galleries that they store on Flickr or Picasa.
While many examples can be seen, such as that of the girlfriend who easily understands in view of the morning photos, taken by the circle of common friends, with whom her unfaithful friend spent the evening, or that of the society that dismissed one of her employees, only for the sincere opinions that he wrote on his blog about top management, one can be sure of one thing: the term of privacy is totally to be reconsidered nowadays.
The one who lives an online life is made up of what he shows of himself, and that is how one can define the principle hiding behind the behavior of today's young people.
He wants to hide something, or at least he wants to try to circumvent Google's monopoly, can do so (starting, for example, with Scroogle, using Google's search system, but at the same time, intentionally leaving no trace).
The number of people who deliberately do not register on public pages so that it is not possible to find them is not the least. Google's services online, through the processing of text to image processing, to the reading of information can be replaced by alternative versions, which are not attached to huge server parks and which do not assemble our best profile, having existed to date.
Public opinion is waiting, without really hiding it, for Google to reveal its true nature.
The company, with its current value of $156 billion, is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion). AdWords/AdSense advertising areas threaten the sales of advertising agencies, while services introduced at an increasing rate cause serious migraines not only to Microsoft, but to many other creators of computer programs.
However, the critical observers find, alongside all this, contradictions with worrying effects: for example, the company's top management has refused, in its entirety, the employees' protests, after it has doubled the price of the business kindergarten and after the company has considered the daily multiple restoration too expensive, taken at any time. All this seems to be derisory alongside the fact that already in 2006, Google has acquiesced before the Chinese government and according to the terms of their agreement, the company detects all the results that hurt the good taste, as well as the interests of the Chinese regime.
According to one of the company's internal rules, the new services are not announced until they can be used. What is certain is that in the coming months and years, they will move the world on new points. While some think that Google's scanning and archiving of books and magazines takes on such important dimensions that the company will soon find itself facing the U.S. Supreme Court, others are shaking ahead of its Health system, because in it, we can build a complete medical profit from our previous analysis results, our doctors and our problems.
The fact that Google builds a genetic database can give a good raw material to the next generation of science-fiction authors. The novel of the famous Cory Doctorow, written with Orwellian half-tons, describes the future in which a man could be approached in a frightening way only through Google data.
Two miners helped to remove the traces of the double homicide of Ózd
"The police summoned two minors to question them in the case of the double homicide of Ózd. According to well-founded suspicions, they helped to make the traces of the crime disappear." - said the spokesman of the police department of Borsod.
The young people have acknowledged the facts they are accused of. For the moment, they are accused of complicity.
The two minors, who, according to information from MTI (Hungarian Telegraphic Agency) are young girls, defend themselves freely.
The complicity of murder can result in detention of up to five years.
The suspect of the double homicide of Ózd, a 23-year-old local boy, was placed in pre-trial detention on Sunday.
The charges against him are multiple homicides, committed premeditatedly and out of interest.
During the investigation, it turned out that the 23-year-old man owed a large sum of money to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to settle his debt and that is why he attracted his creditor last Wednesday to a site in Ózd where he killed him, as well as the 9-year-old daughter of this man.
According to MTI, the young man premeditated his crime. The weapon with which he was going to commit his hidden crimes at the scene of the crime is proof of this.
The police examine the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the help of specialists.
Warsaw Stock Exchange Makes Proposal for Prague Stock Exchange Repurchase
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has offered two hundred million euros, about five billion Czech kroner, for the purchase of 100% of the stock package of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed this proposal that the Polish made despite the fact that the Czechs previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the circle of potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for this exclusion is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the State.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish State which wishes to separate from more than 60% of its shares in a few months of activities.
According to Czech economic daily E15, the Polish proposal represents the highest offer that has been made so far for the purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse have made an offer to date.
Petr Koblic, the director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that among those interested, the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner, and did not exclude the fact that this could lead to the disappearance of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague stock exchange is estimated to be between 5 and 10 billion Czech kroner by market specialists.
On the basis of an agreement between the shareholders, some 90% of the papers would be sold.
The most important owner of the Prague stock exchange is the Patria Finance investment bank, with about 25 per cent stakes, followed by 14.7 per cent of the bank Ceská Sporitelna and the Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 per cent.
The financial crisis from the point of view of the European press
In their comments on Tuesday on the international financial crisis, worsening from day to day, the leading newspapers of the European press already mention a "second 11 September".
"The global financial disaster is due to the American president" - accuses the daily newspaper of Rome, La Repubblica. "The president has not even been able to block with his own party behind a bill, improvised at speed, aimed at helping a desperate situation..."
Instead of a new Pearl Harbour, as billionaire Warren Buffett mentioned, it is more appropriate to speak of a second September 11th.
Part of the Madrid press also sees the scapegoat in Washington.
According to the vision of the daily El Mundo, it was the failures of the political leadership there that brought the world economy to the brink of collapse.
The danger of the collapse of the U.S. financial system is increasing every day, and then the world will pay the high price.
Bush's plan was far from perfect, however, according to the congressional vote, a real threat, the one that Washington does not propose a political tool to deal with the crisis.
The world economy hangs in the void, just as one of the greatest transformations takes place in the history of capitalism.
The threat cannot be ignored any longer - stresses the Tages-Anzeiger of Geneva.
Some states can still extend a life-saving buoy to their stumbling financial organizations, and thanks to their taxpayers' money, they can save them from bankruptcy.
Of course, if even more banks collapse like dominoes, then neither financial means nor new improvisations will be sufficient.
In the long term, we need the states of the European Union to pay little attention to their national selfishness, and to centralize control over divided financial markets.
On Monday alone, the weakened financial institutions received more than 100 billion euros - recalled the Viennese daily Der Standard, which adds that fears that European taxpayers will also have to put their hands in the pocket, very deep, in a way similar to the Americans in order to remedy the crisis, become more and more realistic.
So far, the EU has not really dealt with the crisis, which, like a tsunami, crosses the old continent from one side to another.
The rescuers must not immediately brandish a hundred billion euros, but it would be wise if they could see how rational it would be to touch taxpayers' money, with the aim of preventing further damage.
The smart car mimics the theft of the buzzard
What method would be better for developing technologies capable of avoiding an obstacle, if not imitation of an existing obstacle detector in nature?
Like, for example, bees.
In the amazing project presented at CETEC, taking place in Japan, the buzzing bees gave the strategic idea of starting Nissan engineers, to inspire them on how to design the next generation of obstacle detectors.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built a mini robot car, a bio-inspired auto-robotized control system, type BR23C, which it has equipped with bees' qualities, the ultimate goal being to encourage the development of a system capable of avoiding all obstacles.
During its flights, each bee constitutes its own space, oval in shape, which in reality looks very much like our secure protective shell - Kazuhiro Doi, the director of the research and development department and technological public relations of the brand, explained during the exhibition.
The bee's faceted eye plays a key role, as it is able to see in all directions, at an angle of 300 degrees.
To imitate the functions of the faceted eye, the engineers approached the idea of the laser telemeter.
It identifies the obstacles at an angle of 180 degrees and at a distance of 2 meters in front of the BR23C, it evaluates the distances and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which turns it into avoidance manoeuvre immediately.
The perception of the obstacle takes place in a fraction of a second. Then, the mini auto robot, imitating the movements of the bee, immediately changes the direction of its wheels by turning it from an angle sufficient to avoid collision.
Unlike any system currently in place, this avoidance maneuver is carried out entirely instinctively.
"If not, the mini-auto robot could not react quickly enough to avoid the obstacle," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, the director of the Mobility Laboratory and the robotized car project.
It must react instinctively and instantaneously, since this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and internal layer of the protective envelope, a layer where for the moment the collision is considered inevitable.
This whole process must reflect what the bee does to avoid other bees.
The process must take place in a blink of an eye.
Unlike bees, the difference cannot go up, down or diagonally, it can only be two dimensions, and only in the direction in which the wheels can turn.
In this way, instead of the infinite combinations that bees possess to avoid other bees, in our case, we could only use the rotary movement, the acceleration and the slowing down as maneuvers at the disposal of the mini auto robot
The BR23C uses Lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and have a higher energy concentration, making their lifespan longer than in the Lithium-ion version.
According to Andoh, it is the instinctive intelligent reaction that is paramount, not data processing, and even less the ability to store.
This mechanism should only deal with a few incoming signals per second, and react to them.
It is not necessary to store them and react with intuitive logic based on data from previous maneuvers. In this way, it uses only a few dozen kilobytes of memory continuously.
We don't need memory of a gigabyte capacity, or even megabytes.
This is the first step towards the design of a technology used for instant avoidance. According to Nissan's estimates, this system will enter the mass-produced cars in the next ten years.
Another application could be its incorporation into the GPS navigation system, so that it can guide the driver to his destination by avoiding obstacles on his way.
We even gave the baby a name out of price.
The written version of the $700 billion economic rescue plan, which aims to buy back dubious loans from banks, and to be used several times, is ready.
In the first round, half of this money will be spent.
Reuters announces that in further discussions extending until after midnight on Saturday, local East Coast time, Congressional leaders have agreed on the controversy that has existed for days and days around the $700 billion bailout plan.
"We have taken a serious step forward" - said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic President of the American House of Representatives, according to which all that remains is to put the agreements on paper.
The compromise, born from the plan, is supported by the two presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
The US Treasury Secretary, Henry Paulson, commented on the results of the compromise that the program will work and be effective, but other measures still need to be implemented. According to Pelosi, it is not, here, about saving Wall Street, but about turning the machinery of the economy in the other direction.
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of the Asian markets, Sunday evening at 8 p.m., Washington local time (i.e. Monday at 2 a.m., according to the Central European local time), but did not cause a spectacular rise in the stock exchanges.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will be the first to vote on the bill in the name of the 2008 Emergency Economic Stabilization Act. Then, its fate will be in the hands of the Senate.
On Saturday evening, President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi, and then the White House also welcomed the news of the agreement.
"We are pleased with the progress made last night, and we highly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy," said Tony Fratto, the White House spokesman.
In addition, the program diverges from the original Bush administration proposal, which stated that the $700 billion had to be spent in one go, for the redemption of dubious credits.
From now on, up to half of the 700 billion can be spent. The first 250 billion will be issued immediately after Congress passed the law, probably on Monday. This first sum will be used by the Secretary of the Treasury to buy suspicious claims from banks, while the use of the additional $100 billion will be left to the President's discretion.
The program will be overseen by an independent body, in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also participate.
The expenditure of the second half of the 700 billion depends on a new Congressional decree.
Under the law, the Treasury Secretariat will be able to put in place a combined strategy: at the same time, it will be able to purchase doubtful claims, securities relating to doubtful mortgages and mortgages, as well as other types of "toxic" claims.
The department's competent individuals stated that buybacks may take place as part of an auction, but also directly.
The rule gives the companies concerned the opportunity to take part in an insurance program, where the Treasury Secretariat guarantees the tools behind the concerns, for which the companies will have paid a premium equivalent to the foreseeable damages.
Henry Paulson stated that the law provides the necessary tools to devote $700 billion to the urgent needs of the financial system, whether it is the vast buy-back of doubtful debts, their insurance, or to avoid the risk of the system leading to the collapse of one or other major financial institution.
"We will make the necessary arrangements, to be ready for law enforcement, as soon as it is signed," he added.
On the other hand, bank managers in poor postures and waiting for state aid can expect their severance payments, simply called a gold parachute overseas, to be capped by the government.
Salary ceilings are only mentioned in specific cases, and limitations depend on how the Treasury Secretariat offers its assistance to the company.
The cap principle means that if the Treasury Secretariat buys back as part of an auction, they will levy a surplus of tax on the golden parachute, unless the discredited bank president retires.
Directly after the redemption of the doubtful debts, the government will act aggressively to ensure that the amount paid to the officers is not exaggerated.
In order for the image to be complete, it must be added that the existing golden parachutes are not changed. The cap only concerns new contracts, thus motivating participation in the plan.
This is the first time in the history of the United States that legal caps will be in effect regarding the additions of the Directors General - commented the chairman of the commission in charge of the financial benefits of the Chamber of Deputies, the Democrat Barney Frank.
In addition, the State obtains a right to acquire shares in the banks participating in the plan, thus reducing the risk of taxpayers, since they can even be a winner in the case as soon as the economy and with it the banks saved will fall back on their feet.
The bill mentions that in the next five years, the President must submit to Congress a proposal that will decide how the losses will be returned to taxpayers, from the financial sector.
On both sides, of course, there were those who expressed their doubts about this plan.
That's not why American citizens have sent us, this does not protect taxpayers' dollars - said California Republican MP Darrell Issa.
Her Ohio Democrat colleague, Mary Kaptur, believes that they are the same people who are pressing for action, as are those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continued to rise

Industrial export sales prices increased by 1.1 per cent compared to July 2008, while compared to a year earlier, they decreased by 3.9 per cent.
As a result of fluctuations in domestic and export prices, industrial production prices rose by 0.7 per cent compared to the previous month, and by 3.2 per cent compared to the previous year.
Domestic industrial sales prices rose to a lesser extent: 0.1 per cent, compared to the previous month.
The domestic sales prices of the processing industry sectors were only slightly higher in the order of 0.1 per cent compared to July.
In August 2008, the most significant price increase was observed in the leather and footwear manufacturing sector (2.8 per cent), with first the manufacture of bags and belts with a monthly increase of 4.6 per cent, then the production of shoes with a monthly increase of 2.5 per cent.
The higher prices of plastics and chemical raw materials resulted in a substantial monthly increase in the prices of the chemical and product manufacturing sector (1.6 per cent).
This has resulted in a deflation in the oil processing (1.4 per cent), the manufacture of electrical machinery and equipment (0.9 per cent), and a minimal increase in the wood processing (0.1 per cent).
The prices of paper production, publishing and printing have not changed.
Other sectors of the processing industry recorded an increase from 0.2 percent to 0.9 percent.
In the sectors of electricity, gas, steam and water supply, which account for a significant share of domestic industrial exploitation, prices rose by 0.3 per cent in August, mainly due to the effect of the increase in gas prices introduced by the authorities since 1 July.
In a 12-month comparison, taking into account the domestic sales of the processing sectors, the most significant increase (32.4 per cent) was in the oil processing sector.
In the metallurgical manufacturing sector, prices increased by 13.2 per cent, while in the important area of food production, beverages and tobacco, prices rose by 11 per cent.
Price reductions have taken place in the textile and textile production sectors (2.5 per cent), as well as in the manufacture of electrical machinery and appliances (0.3 per cent).
In other sectors of the processing industry, price increases ranged from 0.6 percent to 9.1 percent.
In the processing industry as a whole, prices have increased by 10.2 per cent over the past year.
Prices in the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors exceeded the previous year by 18.7 per cent.
Among the domestic trade groups and by sector allocation, in August, the most significant monthly price increase (0.7 per cent) was shown by the investment profit-making sectors.
In consumer goods production sectors, prices increased by 0.3 per cent, while in energy and materials-producing sectors for further processing there was no change from the previous month.
In August 2008, compared to the same month of the previous year, the largest increase was observed in the energy and material production sectors for further processing (16.8 per cent).
In the consumer goods production sectors, an inflation rate of 6.8 per cent was measured, while in the profit-initiating sectors, a decrease of 1.4 per cent.
Export prices for the industrial sector in HUF increased by 1.1 per cent in August compared to the previous month, while they fell by 3.9 per cent over 12 months.
In one month, our national means of payment weakened by 1.7 per cent compared to the euro, and by 7.1 per cent against the dollar. Compared to August 2007, it increased by 7.5 per cent against the euro and by 15.9 per cent against the dollar.
Next year, will we still need a visa to go to the United States?
Kinga Göncz believes that there is a good chance that the American-Hungarian visa waiver agreement will come into force on January 12th. This is what the Foreign Minister said in Chicago, before the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
According to her, "now everything depends only on the time when the overseas electronic entry and control systems will be put into operation".
Every time, she drew attention to the fact that in the new system, there will be no entry visa, but tourists will have to register before departure.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy will be in negotiations from today in Washington.
He will meet with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Condoleezza Rice, to whom he will present the decoration of the Commander's Cross with the Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary, and will have an interview with the Foreign Policy Advisors of the presidential candidates, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain both support the bank's bailout plan
Sunday, Barack Obama as well as John McCain, the presidential candidates for the two major US parties, assured their support of the 700 billion dollar government's bailout plan. However, there are politicians who demand the resignation of the US Secretary to the Treasury.
After the marathon negotiations that lasted days and days, the representatives of Congress and the Administration finally announced, on Sunday at dawn, that they had concluded agreements in principle on the rescue plan of the banks.
This financing plan, which aims at thawing the Wall Street crisis and the paralyzed credit market, has become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain even present themselves, each as more fit than the other, to drive the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls, with the promotion of economic issues, Obama has again managed to get a little ahead. McCain's advance, obtained with the appointment of Sarah Palin as a colt just after the Republican convention, has melted.
At a campaign meeting held in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress would quickly vote on the 700 billion bailout bill.
He stressed that the proposal contains the consumer protection passages he also supports.
"It is now that we must act with responsibility (...) a danger threatens your work, your economies, entire industrial sectors and the stability of the whole economy," he said in front of a crowd of 35,000 people.
He did not fail to describe McCain's economic ideas as outdated.
In an interview with ABC, McCain said: "We will all have trouble swallowing it (...) but doing nothing is not a possible way."
The Republican senator stated that the proposal referred to the establishment of a Treasury Control Commission and the capping of senior management severance pay, and that he was personally very committed to these points.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no substantive role in the negotiations, while he was in daily contact with the Secretary of the Treasury.
Nancy Pelosi, President of the House of Representatives, said Sunday that there is serious hope that the House will vote on the bill as early as Monday.
Press review of the German language territory
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only at the heart of the party that voters have become more aware - this is what the Der Spiegel, the low CSU score in the Bavarian country, refers to.
Haider is ready to govern Austria, to prevent the coalition of reds and blacks.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the internet edition of the German left-wing news magazine, Franz Walter analyses the causes of the CSU's dramatic defeat in his article entitled "The Revolution in Bavaria Eats its Fathers".
According to this recognized political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took office.
Christian socialists have transformed Bavaria for decades and now it is these same modern citizens who turn their backs on them.
This change of era is at the same time the problem of the whole Christian democracy, and therefore also Angela Merker's.
For the CSU, failure was not quite a surprise, but Sunday, a process that was likely to be completed just ten years ago: the indisputable hegemony of the national party ended.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU collected 47.7 per cent, for the first time since the 1950s, with a score below the 50 per cent level.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, that is to say at the time of the so-called Stoiber.
The cause of this can be attributed to the modernization "eating its parents", set up in the region in a consistent manner by the CSU.
Sociologists have been announcing this for 40 years, but they have been strongly mistaken about the pace. However, the secularization, the results of education and the establishment of Germans in the north and east of Bavaria, in full development, could not be without consequences on the loyalty of voters CSU.
Modernisation goes hand in hand with increased opportunities, and the consequences of such a policy are also visible.
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only within the party that voters have become more conscious, more critical and more stubborn.
It is also surprising that in recent weeks, it is precisely the groups of traditional citizens who have moved away from the CSU, such as the self-employed, the craftsmen, the holders of the baccalaureate and the graduates of higher education.
In these groups, CSU support fell below 40 per cent.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
In its article entitled "Who? With whom? Party presidents stand on the reserve in the face of coalition issues", the conservative Austrian daily takes care of the situation of confused domestic politics that settled after the Austrian elections.
The Austrian Socialists of the SPÖ wish to discuss with the Conservatives of the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits the SPÖ from interfering with its internal affairs.
The BZÖ populist party is open for negotiations. Greens still do not want to agree on the coalition.
The elections took place, now everything revolves around the coalition; during the debates organized on public television, party leaders barely let their cards be seen.
Werner Faymann, the president of the SPÖ, confirmed that he wished to discuss with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that the cooperation of the two parties is indeed possible - that is what already exists in certain regions and in the socialist partnership.
The question that he would imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of ÖVP, as vice-chancellor, remains open from Faymann.
As he mentioned, the Schüssel-Molterer approach was, in any case, rejected.
A replica of this combination is out of the question.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the proposals of the reds.
As he has already said, collaboration will surely be unsuccessful if Faymann tries to interfere in ÖVP's internal affairs.
In his party, the choice of opposition or entry into the coalition is momentarily a completely open question, and these points must absolutely be debated within the ÖVP.
Jörg Haider, President of the BZÖ, is once again open to any proposals.
"To avoid the coalition of the Reds and Blacks, we are ready to assume governmental responsibilities" - Haider said.
Járóka said: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, the European Summit for Equal Opportunities, hosted by France, began in Paris as a representative of the current Presidency of the European Union.
In his message to the plenary assembly, as one of the main spokespersons for the consultation of experts, Livia Járóka, MEP Fidesz European People's Party, drew attention to segregation in education, because it is a violation of the law that most affects Roma children and therefore one of the main obstacles to their success in life.
On behalf of the French Presidency, this high-level conference was opened on the one hand by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Labour and Social Affairs, and on the other by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Labour, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among those invited to take part in the consultation are the European social partners, as well as the most prominent representatives of European legal protection and civil organisations, in the area of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the group Fidesz Parti Populaire, Járóka warned that alongside the distinctions observed during the hirings, the Roma disappear from the labour market, in the first place, as a result of their low qualification.
"An overwhelming majority of young Roma do not have high school diplomas, and as a result of poor quality elementary education, only a tiny part has the possibility of obtaining a higher education diploma."
Furthermore, Járóka stressed that education as a basic human right plays a key role when other fundamental rights are to be upheld.
Investment in the early education of Roma children means strengthening the economy of the member countries of the European Union.
According to the MEP, it is necessary to raise awareness of these relations in as wide a circle as possible, also between Roma and non-Roma.
The sooner a Roma child starts school, the more likely he is to become a productive member of the labour market; by taxes paid from income and consumption, he participates in the state budget.
"By virtue of their citizenship of the European Union, Roma must be assured of their right to quality education, and be protected from low quality and sectarian education." - stressed Livia Járóka.
According to the MP, a European Union collaboration aimed at an objective and action is necessary for an immediate acceleration of the process of disintegration of schools. To this end, compliance with the existing anti-discrimination directives and in preparation is of paramount importance.
"The vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be broken; the opportunities provided by democracy for Roma children must be given to enable them to participate as citizens of their own right in the future of Europe" - demanded Járóka.
On behalf of the European Year for Equal Opportunities for All, the objective of the Summit on Equal Opportunities in Europe, held every year since the Berlin Summit last year, is to ensure a single platform to support the measures taken to promote equal opportunities and to combat discrimination, aimed at the European level and at the level of the Member States.
CSU: Grace for a Transitional Period
It is in October that the decision will be taken on the fate of the fallen duo Huber-Beckstein
Despite this pitiful electoral failure, the heads have not yet fallen, and the debate on personal issues at the Bavarian CSU summits has been postponed.
The president of the party, Erwin Hube and the head of the regional government, Günther Beckstein, can still retain their place. The question is how long will grace last?
The fate of the tandem, having suffered a catastrophic loss of voice of 17 percent, will be on the agenda of the congress of the exceptional party, held on the last weekend of October.
The members of this highly criticized pair felt, in any case, that they did not particularly care about their seat.
As a result, they worked to appease the furious members of the fraction and the base, who one day after the "Bavarese tsunami" demanded personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - it is true, still under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, at the top of his career - the socio-Christian union won 60.7 per cent, while today, one year after the putsch against Stoiber, only 43.4 per cent of their strength remains.
For 46 years, the CSU was the only "sovereign" in Bavaria giving 18 percent of German GDP.
But the conservatives still count heavily in this region of the south, of key importance to the Hungarian economy. In the future, they will be forced into the coalition.
As one of the first signs of an internal reorganization of the party, the vice-president and the federal minister of agriculture, Horst Seehofer, presented as Huber's possible successor, also received a place in this modest recognition group, which initiates tactful discussions with the FDP Liberals, as well as with the Free Electors, formed along the right-wing values, about a possible coalition of the Munich government.
A strange nose of fate was that with the help of the list of Free Electors, the Gabriele Pauli, whose action against Stroiber served as a putsch possibility perpetrated by the duo Huber-Beckstein, enters the legislation, and then treats without care the very ambitious municipal political woman.
Now, the CSU leaders put all their energy into stabilizing, one way or another, Beckstein.
In this transition, Stoiber, who until now pulled the strings behind the scenes, will also receive an active role. The former head of the regional government and former president of the CSU, designated September 28 as the bitterest day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber made some acerbic remarks to the CDU. According to him, they would have deserved much more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted defeat as a warning for the CDU and also for Angela Merkel.
Following the Bundestag elections, which will take place in September 2009, Merkel will only be able to be chancellor again if they re-establish in one way or another, with a common force, the CSU, having played an important role in the national success of 2005.
According to Merkel, hiding his disappointment from the fiasco, the loss of land from the CSU will not negatively influence the great coalition of Berlin.
However, this is relative because it will not be easier to manage the injured CSU, and the crisis of the socio-democrats still lasts.
Since 1946, the SPD has achieved its worst results with 18.6 per cent in Bavaria.
Lukasenko - his rivals : 110 - 0
No opposition MPs joined the Belarusian parliament after Sunday's elections.
According to Russian observers, this is due to a country led by Alexandre Lukashenko, which provides him with prosperity and stability, while according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is due to illegalities committed in the counting of votes.
The OSCE, having sent 450 observers from 43 countries, does not recognize the elections.
Although the legislative system of 110 people in this country of 10 million people has been very well opposed for decades, before yesterday's elections, the opposition uniting its forces under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) seriously hoped that Lukashenko, renewing his term as president for the fourth time in question elections, in the wake of the 2006 amendment of the constitution, would "allow" this time the presence of a few members of the opposition in parliament.
In this way, the ODSZ gave up its original boycott.
The fact that Belarus, increasingly economically dependent on Russia, would like to improve its relations with the EU, where due to the Belarusian political order described as anti-democratic, Lukashenko and several high-ranking politicians do not receive an entry visa, was one of the opposition's expectations. Belarus had to take credit because of the declining imports of Russian natural gas, which is increasingly expensive, and thus contributed to the passage of Beltransgaz, owner of the gas pipelines crossing the country, passed into the hands of the Russians.
The fact that the OSCE, in the evaluation of the campaign, focused on positive changes rather than failures, such as the ban on one-third of opposition candidates, referred to a prior calming.
However, the OSCE press release on Monday was already challenging the campaign, during which most opposition candidates could not appear in the media, and particularly the fact that the opposition could not be present at the counting of votes.
Despite all this, the opposition still feels a tangible improvement in the political regime: political prisoners have regained freedom, and Minsk is ready for small confrontations with Moscow, still refusing to recognize South Ossetia and Abazzia separated from Georgia. However, Russia with whom Belarus forms a confederation on paper, considers the two independent territories for already a month.
"We took two steps forward, and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue was initiated between Belarus and the EU" - said Alexandre Milinkevich to our newspaper.
According to the opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential elections, it is desirable that this remains so, despite the fact that "the power was afraid in this parliament that has no weight, to bring in even one opponent".
The opposition does not foresee protest actions in the light of the results, but rather attempts to send its message on the need for economic reforms to the electorate.
"Of course, we have a lot of concerns on this side: we have to get our opposition newspapers printed in Russia, the local authorities put sticks in our wheels in terms of broadcasting, but I can also see that they are increasingly supporting the elections, even in the circle of the elderly" - said Milinkevich, referring to the fact that in the current Lukashenko regime, which considers social security as its main result, the layer of the most officially supported pensioners no longer really considers it appropriate.
"Because of the country's debt and the increase in the trade deficit, the collapse of social security, 'evoking the silence of a cemetery', is now only a matter of time," Milinkevich says.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers have described the elections as democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, leader of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "People do not believe in words, but in deeds." In this way, the absence of opposition is only proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From today, breakfast before work".
Never, in the history of the Chigi Palace, had we had any rotating doors for the entry and exit of the employees.
But as of today, this new measure is in effect against the little smart guys, against whom points and then goes to drink coffee at the bar during working hours.
The anti-fooling novelty was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary General of the Council Presidency, Mauro Masi.
"The rotating doors," says Brunetta, "are an instrument for better work, with more productivity, more presences and more services," said the Minister.
Now begins a new season of accountability and transparency.
"It's reformism," Brunetta points out.
The installation in all the institutions of the Presidency of the Council is complete with the Chigi Palace.
According to Masi, "the choice of rotating doors is important even from a symbolic point of view.
No resistance from the employees has been recorded, says the Secretary General: "It is a process shared by the employees, and we have had the collaboration of all".
In short, no breakfast during working hours; no coffee or croissant.
Brunetta's promise, which suggests by smiling, "a good cappuccino at 7 a.m. is an excellent and healthy resolution".
At a conference at the Higher School of Public Administration
in Rome, the minister informs that "in three months, the absence of illness of public employees has decreased by 50%, that is 60 thousand more workers in one year".
And he adds that it is essential to make the Public Administration more effective.
Italian, "whose wage dynamics - explains the minister - over the last 8-10 years have doubled compared to the private sector, and well in addition to inflation rates.
At the same time, thousands of public employees came together to challenge the standards of the Brunetta Decree using the Codacons.
"While the Minister of Public Service is now publishing data on the decline of absenteeism in the workplace due to illness- writes the association of consumers- the people of the "active lazy" continues to increase.
Indeed, in Italy, thousands of correct and productive public administration employees gathered to declare war on the illegitimate norms contained in the decree.
In particular, in the Tar, the exclusion of additional allowances in the event of infirmity on account of service is contested; the extension of the hours of the sick worker's hours of stay, during which check visits are carried out, and other aspects contained in the new provisions required by the Minister.
Accidents at the workplace, Napolitano: "Critical prevention"
Every day in Italy, there are 2,500 accidents at work, 3 deaths and 27 people who remain permanently disabled.
In 2007, the Inail data confirm that white deaths were approximately 1,200.
Figures testify to the seriousness of the phenomenon, which remains one of the main causes of death, and causes almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
To get the attention of the institutions, social forces and media on this dramatic aspect, Anmil celebrates today, in all the Italian provinces, the 58th National Day of Victims of Accidents at Work, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The worrying data disseminated by Anmil, as well as the tragic events of the last few days, confirm the importance of the topic of prevention in the workplace," said the President of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, in a message sent to the President of Anmil, the National Association of Mutilated and Disabled Workers, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his sincere appreciation for the ongoing associative effort for prevention in the workplace, protection of injured workers, assistance to victims' families and public awareness.
"naturally indignant, everyone has punched in the fist to put an end to such tragedies that, by their dimension, provoke the clamor of the media and the participation of public opinion, even if the daily reality presents dramatic cases, even repetitive in their dynamics.
Napolitano does not hide that "there is certainly a problem of resources: it is essential to invest in training and information"
The many initiatives promoted in the school sector are of particular importance for a more direct awareness of young people entering the world of work.
It is our duty, to maintain attention to this phenomenon, not to underestimate the alarm about social gravity, to implement and improve legislative standards.
For his part, the President of the Chamber Gianfranco Fini stressed how "this phenomenon of the white dead constitutes an absolute social urgency, which insults the conscience of each of us, and requires all institutions to make a concrete effort to put an end to it quickly".
The data from accidents at work seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not prevent the number of white deaths from being impressive," the president of the Anmil Pietro Mercandelli later stressed.
" we do not want this "reduced tendency" to translate into a minor attention, because it is precisely when attention relaxes that tragedy happens.
"We believe that in general, we do not do enough to contrast the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be accomplished through multiple actions."
"In our opinion - Mercandelli has emphasized - more controls and inspections are necessary, as well as a more important intervention on the training of workers, and this, from the school."
- He added- "that there is still a need to make an effort with regard to communication and public awareness.
"But above all, there must be a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers for a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
"Mercandelli then denounced "the progressive deterioration of the conditions for safeguarding the compensation provided for the victims of work" and the" drift of assistance towards which the system has been directed in recent years".
"The aim, therefore, is to give back to the worker the guarantee of insurance – he added – so that the fate of the one who has an accident, must not depend on spontaneism or the enlargement of the legislature"
Mp3 player pointed at the finger, they put the hearing at risk.
Listening to full-volume music for an extended period of time using portable music devices such as Mp3 players can cause permanent damage to the hearing.
This is what the European Commission announces, which, in a communiqué issued in Brussels, cites the opinion of the Scientific Committee, on the recent and unexpected health risks (Csrseri) of the EU, published today.
"of this scientific report - we read in the note - it appears that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to full-volume music using portable music devices, for more than one hour per day and per week, risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity."
"I am concerned that such a large number of young people who frequently use portable music devices and full-volume mobile phones can unconsciously damage their hearing in an irreparable way," says Meglena Kuneva.
"According to the scientific data- continues the responsible EU- this is a clear risk and we need to react quickly.
The most important thing is to raise consumer awareness and make this information publicly available.
We must also review existing control systems in the light of scientific opinion, so that they are fully effective and can follow new technologies."
Brussels asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the intensive use of portable music devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise they generate.
"Scientists-concludes the EU executive- confirm that there are good reasons to worry, and that the European Commission will now examine with Member States and other interested parties, what measures could possibly be taken to better protect children and adolescents, against exposure to noise from portable music and similar devices.
There is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable music devices to 100Db, but there is increased concern about hearing damage that could result from excessive exposure to such sources of noise.
It is possible to limit these data well using solutions such as reducing levels and duration of exposure to noise.
The Scientific Committee points out that users of portable music devices, who listen to full-volume music (more than 89 decibels) for 5 hours per week, exceed the limits currently in force for the maximum noise level at the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for prolonged periods risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity after 5 years.
This concerns 5-10% of the users of these devices, and their number can be quantified at around 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno gave the order to send the Commission away for the future of the capital.
Today we start, in March we finish, in June we will draw the money.
This is the timetable set by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of Rome Capitale", which took place this morning at the new headquarters behind the Caracalla Thermal Baths.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the 49 other members of the Commission will draw up the directives for Rome.
In March, when they are finished, the Committee and the Communal Council will evaluate the analyses and projects, in order to present in June, the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "official stamp " of the Capitol and its mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent; all political, social and cultural ideas are represented in it - it would like to emphasize Alemanno - it will have to propose ideas for development of Rome that the political decision-makers, who remain the Committee and the Communal Council, will be able to use.
No overlapping roles, but only the desire to have a corner where to draw up a great project for Rome.
In March, she will have completed her duties and will then disappear, as this experience must have a precise time span.
In June-announces the mayor- we will present the strategic plan resulting from the work carried out by the Commission for the future of Rome Capitale."
For those who accuse the Commission of being useless, since its opinions will not be binding, Alemano replies: "It all depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do, as well as on the quality of its proposals.
If quality is there, as in France thanks to the Attali Commission, as in Rome, I am sure, its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often, politics is overwhelmed by the management of everyday life and emergencies that occur from time to time.
On the contrary, we want to look forward, and further forward, to a deeper perspective, working seriously on the development of Rome and its future."
In addition, the Mayor of Rome wishes to stress that "this Commission is not an unnecessary body or a bureaucratic whole: it is absolutely free, and it will not cost the Roman citizens a euro, and it will be used to study and involve the best intelligences that express the Capital.
For Alemano, in fact, "a strategic draft of reference is needed, neither firm nor immobile, in order to enable our city to improve, which it absolutely needs, while thinking about its future now a unitary spirit, " says Alemano.
A future that, according to the mayor of Rome, "will not be limited to the usual communal borders, but that will look further" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as Capital, but also in relation to the role that Rome can and must have, as Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama? The first anti-American president. That's why.
A famous American politician who wants to be independent, wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, on the basis of his decisions, destroyed the US economy and had relations (as he still has today, as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam."
Attacks on Obama are increasing as the election date approaches.
A Miami lady wrote on a website: "this person is full of ambition".
Obama is really stubborn: he believes he will win the highest office of a nation that counts in all, two governors and five black senators!"
In reality, these are attacks that do not say much; they are obviously attacks of a racial nature, and they do not answer the question of all voters: will he be a good president? We also have the polls, which all declare that Obama will win and with a good advantage.
In this case, it is still someone who speaks with the heart and not with the brain.
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the bowels of the southern United States, wrote an article: once in the voting booth, we know who the American patriot will give his vote to.
Here comes an aspect of the American mentality kept secret until the end.
"Say whatever you want, we'll see ourselves put the cross, on Obama or McCain.
There are even people who swear: if Obama wins, we will leave the United States.
Things never revealed until now, so much so that the black candidate's success seems almost certain.
In any case, despite all these reasonings, the winning card for the Democrats is George Bush.
1500 people were asked: what were Bush's mistakes during his term of office? 89 per cent answered: Iraq.
America's changing.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50 thousand soldiers and was kicked to the butt.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers lost their lives, and the Americans were not forced to pack.
Despite this, Iraq was, for the most part, Bush's weakness.
Who will take the place of George W will have a huge task to accomplish.
Usa, the economic debacle is felt even in journalists: in the press, it's time for deletions. And many accuse the Internet, this "killer" of the newspaper.
Five hundred American journalists were questioned by the PEW Research Center about the status of their profession and mental control for the future.
Well, almost all journalists are now pessimistic about their future.
However, they did not openly declare to the information attachés, feeling less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like they used to.
The problem with American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of a destroyed economic model.
In addition, deletions in the newsroom, in the room where the editors work on the assembly of the newspapers, are a big problem.
It is a problem that needs to be resolved, according to the journalists interviewed, if traditional journalism, as the general public sees it, is to be significantly reduced.
An obvious but complex pessimism invades American journalism.
Six out of ten senior executives and newspaper journalists are convinced that national journalism is on the wrong track.
Locally, the executive group is 65%.
Printed publication against broadcast.
Journalists don't have a problem seeing where the web is going.
The largest publishing houses are a passage to the Internet, perceived by many as the "killer" of the newspaper.
The "economic pressure" felt by journalists is increased to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted to the technology hoping that it would "do something good" for their journalism.
Today, the biggest increase in American journalism lies between those who run the newsrooms - that is, the directors - and the reporters who work for them.
56% of managers at national level are convinced that reporters share their values, while at local level this percentage drops to 23%.
For some, this is linked to "work safety".
Directors who think they will lose their jobs within 3 years are 47% at the national level.
As far as journalists are concerned, we go to 30%.
That of "safe work" at the staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is still on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In an immense nation like the Usa, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of journalists, magazines, radio, television and the Internet, employers often offer what they want, and this quickly becomes a matter of taking or leaving.
Directors almost always receive large salaries, while the editor can earn $10 thousand a month, in addition to retirement and insurance payments.
As for holidays, logic becomes complicated: x days after the first year, x days after the third, up to 15 days in total, spent a number of years.
But according to their revelations, American journalists are often "wrong" during the year.
It's the fault of the weather.
UNIPOL: TRIBUNAL ROME, DANILO COPPOLA STAYS IN GROTTAFERRATE.
The president of the second criminal section of the Rome court, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the court of the real estate agent, Danilo Coppola, who had asked to be able to leave his town, Grottaferrata, for a home in Rome.
. Coppola is investigated for bankruptcy under the Unipol-Bnl Climbing Instruction.
At his trial last week, he was released from his home and converted into a compulsory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had requested that the real estate agent could travel from the provincial city to a home in the capital.
According to the court, such travel (which the PM did not grant) would allow him to influence his society and have access to the evidence that accuses him.
The elites in danger.
The phenomenon had already manifested itself a few days ago, with the vote of the House of Representatives, contrary to the $700 billion rescue plan approved by the White House: a significant number of Americans were, and still is, more interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the American economy.
And it is the New York Times of yesterday that confirms this by telling us that the current crisis divides the Republican Party, even more shared between its watchful East Coast soul, moderate, favorable to federal institutions as well as the business community, and its new soul, on the contrary, conservative, hostile to " Washington" and the world of finance, powerful especially in the Central and Southern states.
The soul, in fact, that made itself felt despotically with the vote that I spoke to you at the beginning.
However, what has just been mentioned is just an example of the changes, the major changes that the economic earthquake is in progress or is already letting run: not only in the United States, but throughout the West, and perhaps not only here.
In both the United States and Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the phenomena that have existed for some time, to such an extent that, in the new climate, they become more solid and reveal themselves.
The first of these phenomena is the re-updating, the extraordinary revival, of the dual state-sovereign category, in relation to a kind of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of banking and financial institutions which, of course, have close relations with abroad, but which, above all, are involved on a large scale, the balance sheets of individuals and families living in one country, in one State.
This immediately creates a political problem for whom it governs: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of individuals and families who are also an electorate.
In short, the crisis appears to be economically global, but politically, it is almost exclusively national.
Political internationalisation seems really out of the question, or it has little to say: the obvious proof is given to us by the European Union, which, as usual, between the various interests and between the various national strategies, is unable to decide any common policy line.
And so, it is from the government of each state that all expect interventions, rescue and recovery plans, new rules, and above all a credit ailment: when one goes through a difficult period, there are only the states that have the economic resources, the mass of financial resources able to try to put things back in place.
They also have the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of invaluable value, elements that no market or international organization will ever be able to dispose of in a similar way.
This new emphasis of the state-nation crisis is moreover in perfect harmony with the ever greater importance that the more recent economic developments of the economy tend to attribute to a factor quite linked to this element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that we were now entering the realm of the network, of the ever more sophisticated technology, of the non-material, convinced that globalized finance was now destined to dominate the world, we realized in one stroke, that our future will have to settle its accounts more and more with things rather little material like water, harvests, oil.
Things that can certainly be transported from one place to another from the earth, but that are absolutely linked to a limited space, to a territory.
Thus, who is sovereign, certainly possesses more cards than the one who is not, that is, the one who has the misfortune of living in a place without harvest, without oil and without water.
I now come to the second novelty which, however, provides for a fracture.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably called Politics, and therefore Leadership.
In this regard, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, the awareness of the objective need for authoritarian leadership, the search for a person who knows how to take control of the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for existing leaderships, economic species that have proved inadequate and full of shadow zone.
And in addition, something even deeper, in a certain sense, even worrying: a discredit, suffering, an image of inadequacy, a sense of remoteness that tends to involve the entire class of directors in an increasing number of West countries.
This further increases the conviction of the various classes, before the actions are the same ideas of the social elites until now at their peak, their way of listening and being, their culture in the complex acceptance of the term, to have the same time, and to be ever more alien to the opinions of the majorities.
In short, The demand for leadership, feeds underground, a powerful and ramified movement of delegitimizations of the ruling classes and traditional political orders, which manifest themselves in the improvised electoral "revolts" or, in the changes of collective moods of the latter all the time, from the conservative ascension in Austria Bavaria, to the fall of the workers in Great Britain, to the rebellion of the American congressmen against Bush (and it may well be that the victory of the right in Italy did not arrive by chance).
It is felt that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format, would say someone, have more and more difficulty, which does not date from today, to understand and therefore to represent the deep layers of Western societies, and that the economic crisis strengthens, increases and acts potentially in a way that is far too much.
In view of all this, talking about a current "rebellion of the masses" on the agenda seems frankly exaggerated.
But it's said well, keep your eyes wide open, it's not without reason.
The superglue to walk on the walls.
Defeating the laws of gravity through super glue and, in the future, walking on walls like Spiderman.
This is the goal of various American research centres, and today, a team of four institutes has almost succeeded.
With an adhesive measuring barely 2.5 square centimetres, the researchers managed to keep a 100-kilogram body glued to a vertical wall.
STUDY- The American journal Science has published the discoveries of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material, invented by the team of researchers, is an evolution of those we know who use a particular carbon structure, called nano carbon tubes.
"The glue principle can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged as a spaghetti pile." Explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Atlanta Georgia Institute of Technology.
Scientists have inspired the legs of the geckos, covered with microscopic hairs that allow to assure the animal, a perfect adherent.
Tests on various materials, such as glass, Teflon, and glass paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of these reptiles, and at the same time, that it "removes easily from the wall," explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton's Faculty of Engineering.
"This material could be used as a temporary adhesive," says Liming Dai.
Maybe to walk on walls like Spiderman? Maybe so, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use such as the connection between electronic devices, since nano carbon tubes are conductors of heat and electric current.
Other applications could include aerospace engineering.
For now, no superheroes.
THE OTHER RESEARCH- The University of Berkeley, California, is also dedicated to the search for a new adhesive.
In an article from the American Chemical Society, Californian researchers presented an adhesive made of microfibers such as hair, which self-cleans dust during movement on a surface to ensure perfect and constant adhesion.
Medicines: never with fruit juice.
Be careful with grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, mainly consumed in the summer because they are desaltering and rich in vitamins, if combined with certain vital medicines, alter the absorption that amplifies or diminishes, depending on the case, their effectiveness, with even serious consequences for health.
David Nailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, recalls the risks of fruit juices, whether canned or fresh, associated with the ingestion of certain medicines; during the 236th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he launched a new alarm: just a glass of grapefruit juice, orange and apples, to reduce the absorption of certain vital medicines, cancelling their beneficial effects and endangering the health of patients.
Grapefruit juice has already been heavily criticized as being responsible for increasing the effects of certain anti-arrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, anti-stamine and neurological drugs to toxic levels.
DRUGS AT RISK- It was the Italian Medicines Agency itself, which had provided the news in a two-year newsletter, alerting doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger of this mixture and to be careful to drink, if you take medicines such as Diazepam or Methadone.
NOT LIKE PAMPLEMOUSSE - Experts say even orange and apple juice contains substances that inhibit drugs.
Long is the list of active ingredients inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
From there, the call of Michele Carruba, director of the Department of Pharmacology of the Public University of Milan: "These discoveries are in general, immediately reported to the various national and international drug agencies that will have to change the informative notes of the drugs if necessary.
It is always necessary to read the illustrative papers of the medicines that are taken, and, if something is not clear, not to be impressed, but to speak clearly to the doctor or pharmacist," the expert pointed out to the Ansa agency.
The Nobel Prize in Economics at Paul Krugman.
The Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his research on business models and the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a neo-Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is also a famous editorialist in the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the greatest critics of the Bush administration's economic and foreign policy solutions.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, during the days of Enron's bankruptcy, Krugman had written, in an article published in the New York Times, that the second event would have been more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences for the history of the United States.
A forecast that triggered many polemics, and that was blamed on the economist for years, but that has now proved to be accurate.
"I am surprised and even a little shocked by the speed with which the memory of scandals such as the collapse of Enron or Worldcom, disappeared from the attention of the public," Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "high-value economist" but also a very aggressive style divulger, particularly critical of the excesses of the Bush administration's liberalism.
Open Office, this is the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
This is the day of the release of OpenOffice.org.3.0, the open source of personal productivity suite that aims to reach ever more users, from home to office, professionals to public administration, offering a free alternative to the most famous Microsoft Office.
After nearly a year of work by voluntary developers, supervised by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office package is shown to the general public with various new features: from the welcome screen, and the interface reviewed and become less austere, to more important ones, such as the compatibility born for the Apple Mac OS X operating system, and the support for the new ODF format (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest standard ISO version.
Open Office has paid particular attention to the interaction with the Office 2007 suite, and it is indeed possible to open the documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx.)
Also interesting, some functions specific to certain modules, such as the one that allows to reduce the dimensions of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example, to send them by email, or to import PDF files into the graphic development module, retaining the original appearance of the page.
Also on this front, it is possible to create "hybrid PDF" documents that link the typical Adobe format chart to the elements of a spreadsheet or text writer.
The collaboration between several people is an element that has had various improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet, various users can intervene, avoiding conflicts over the changes, in the preparation of texts, because each employee is assigned a color of comments for better recognition in the revision phase.
Some companies are even working to bring some OpenOffice functions to the Web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the coming weeks they are expected to deliver the final result.
The Italian version is available for download at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.htmland is in addition to the English version that has been on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the suite is as usual available in addition, for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation cd can be shipped to home or to the workplace.
And if the theme of gratuity can be a means to spread it in the houses, it is precisely in the business, that Open Office continues to try the big challenge, already able to count on various projects carried out in the public administration and schools.
Not to mention the realities that offer a service of training, consultation and assistance, ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could also open up to business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for equivalent Word writing video; Calc, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for rival PowerPoint presentations;Dbase, like the famous Access, is the program that allows working on the databases; finally Drwa is the graphical module.
Target for 2008, reaching 5 million downloads, and considering that today there are almost 3 million and 600 miles, it is likely that with the release of the new version, we can even exceed the expected figure
Kohl, too, is positive, this is the fourth case of doping.
New case of positivity at the last Tour de France: he is the Austrian of the Gerolsteiner team, Bernhard Kohl, qualified third, and winner of the jersey of the best climber.
It is the website of the daily L'Equipe that reports the news.
At the age of 26, Kohl was the fourth positive cyclist in the Cera, the third generation Epo, after the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli, and the German Stefan Schumacher, also of Gerolsteiner.
Blood tests on Kohl's test pieces are one of those carried out in recent weeks by the laboratories of Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter-analyses confirm the positivity at Cera, the Austrian will lose his third place at the Tour and will have to expect two years of elimination.
The news of Kohl's positivity at the Third Generation Epo was confirmed by the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who communicated to the Associated Press, having notified the positivity to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian placed himself on the podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, blowing up the polka dot jersey of the best climber.
IMMIGERS: NEW YORK TIMES ASKS IF ITALY IS RACIST?
Italy "as a country of emigrants has recently become a privileged destination for immigrants" welcomed reluctantly.
Would it turn the beautiful country into a nation of racists? That's what the New York Times is all about, which dedicated a long article discussing the theme of racism in Italy, starting with the case of young Abdul William Guibre, a native of Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milan, for stealing a box of biscuits.
This case highlights what the New York Times defines as the "northern paradox": the northern regions are both those where we record" more integration and more work", but also" an anti-immigrant feeling the strongest of the country and the most important support for the North League"
To confirm the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, NYT also referred to episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not just.
Even the new legislature required by the Lega to curb immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegal immigrants is cited as evidence of climate change in Italy.
Trends highlighted by the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano during his meeting with Benedict XVI at the Quirinal, asked that the State and the Church work together to defeat racism."
Student victims of expensive rents, up to 900 euros for one room.
The student rental market knows no crisis
According to Sunia's latest investigation, the tenants' union, renting a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now reached very serious aspects to the point of excluding entire categories of young people, from the right to study because of the very high overall costs that the families of origin must support- explains the head of the study office of Sunia, Laura Mariani- in these cities, the strong demand from the students has distorted the market so much that a process of general increase has begun for the residents themselves.
In most cases, rental offers also involve a series of violations: free, unregistered, rent-free, sub-hire contracts.
For the Sunia, extraordinary interventions through the tax review are needed to calm prices.
Reading in detail the survey, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza zone, it takes about 450 euros; for a single room, we go from 650 euros minimum (Black Band zone), to an average value of 800 (Lambiate zone, Udine, and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 euros (Vittoria zone)
In Florence, an average bed costs 350/400 euros, a room about 700 euros.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in areas close to the University, it takes 250/280 euros for a double bed, and 370 to 500 euros for a single room.
In Rome, in the areas close to the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), about 600 euros are requested for a single, 450 for a bed in a double.
A slightly lower value (550 euros for a single one) for areas close to other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
One can save only if one moves away in the peripheral areas: 300 euros for a bed, and 450 euros for a single in the Predestina, Centocelle or similar area.
In Naples, for a bed it takes 300/400 euros, for a simple one, we spend from 400 to 600 euros, with higher prices in the zones Policlinico, Vomero, and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, for bed, it is necessary to count 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a single.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they are of major importance in the city economy.
Finally, cities such as Perugia, where rents are often taken by extra-Community students, have a subsequent anomaly: the rent charged to foreign students is increased by 25/30% compared to that applied to Italians.
Farewell old cinema Paradiso, the cities elevate the historic halls.
The historic cinemas close in favor of the Multiplex.
"A city without cinemas is a blind city, it's like a face without eyes"
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore, illustrates well what is happening in the major Italian urban centers, but also in the cities of the province,
The process of marginalisation of cinemas, with the birth on the outskirts of the large multi-salles, and the death of consumption of mono-salles in the central areas of the cities, is one of the major events that seems inevitable and incontestable to us; it also has all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
To disappear, they are often historical places and loaded with memory, "it's as if one of my friends disappeared, someone we know, with whom we shared a bit of a path and so many emotions" observes the director of Nuovo cinéma Paradiso, a film that offers Tornatore 20 years ago, the first Oscar and the Grand Prix de la jure de Cannes, and which recounts the poetry of a provincial hall, and the nostalgia of a way of living the cinema, lost can be forever.
The figures provided by Anec, the main association of merchants, mean everything: in the last five years, 316 cinemas of traditional type have closed, and it is the halls of the main cities that have paid the most for them: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closure, the Emilia Romaine is in the lead with 82 single cinemas lost, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
The evidence that confirms that the first person responsible for their disappearance is the advent of the multiplex, because it is the three Italian regions that have recorded the most new multi-room cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany and in Emilia-Romagna.
"Italian exploitation has developed irrationally," notes Paolo Protti, president of Anec, "it is useful to build new structures, but it would still be necessary to guarantee the survival of those that already exist, because when a firm room in a city, these frequenters are not necessarily all willing to go to multiplexes.
Not to mention the lack of deliberation of credit in favour of traders: the historical debt of the state is about 10 million euros.
It is shameful that, from an ethical and moral point of view, the Government does not respect existing laws.
To support the sector, it would take between 16 and 18 million euros a year.
Note the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that, concerned about these closures, decided to solve the situation through the signing of a protocol between Mairie and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy, to defend and promote the cinemas mono rooms of the historical centres and in the periphery.
Among the regulations provided for, there are tax facilitation measures for managers and benefits for the public in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to enter the restricted area, and will have special rates for parking and certain parking spaces.
"It is an initiative that I like" observes Giuseppe Tornatore "and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna putting in place other measures.
It is clear, however, that in order to contrast the super power of multiplexes, traditional rooms also need to improve the quality of sound and image, because today's public is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important to me: the closure of the Supercinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make "New Cinema Paradiso" which I had been thinking about for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass the Rialto, or the Quirinal of Via Nazionale, now closed, where I have lived so much shared emotions, I turn to the other side not to see the signs blackened by dust.
Links between politics and ‘ndrangheta, arrested mayor of Gioia Tauro.
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to standardize the Mayor's choices to the interests of the Pyromalli clan."
heavy accusations are made by the magistrates of the Anti-Mafia Directorate of Calabria, against the mayor and vice mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione, as well as Rosario Schiavione, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external competition for Mafia association.
The mannets also for Gioacchino Piromalli, the former mediator between the clan and the public administrations, and his grandson lawyer, homonymous of the boss, already condemned for association of mafia criminals, as well as to pay 10 million euros.
"an affront to legal and moral norms, and above all common sense," the prosecutors wrote, "the two local administrations had expressed their willingness to pay for consultations with Master Piromalli.
"Thus the clan would have been granted - the judges write - to officially enter the town halls facilitating the already considerable possibilities of control and orientation of the public administration"
The president of the Calabrian regional committee Agazio Loiero, does not hide that "collusions between local committees and organized crime, there is more than one" in his region: "there are places where the mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are also many politicians who resist the pressures of the Andrangheta, heroes who are honest."
This morning's arrests follow those of last July, after which the police announced that they had beheaded the Piromalli clan.
By the end of April last year, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved; already in 1991, and still due to alleged conditions between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been discharged from their function of administering the City.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the UDC at the time of the dissolution, had been appointed head of a right-wing coalition after the May 2006 ballot.
He shouted at the scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the communal council.
He accused the Deputy Minister of the Interior at the time, Marco Minniti, accusing him of manipulating everything for a political issue, but given the request for incarceration signed this morning, the judges explain that the Piromalli clan had even managed to ask for variation in the A3 project.
Starting from the intercepts ordered against Dal Torrione, they write, "the willingness to marry the demands of a businessman, representing a more well-known group, close to the Pyromalli, is emerging, standardizing the choices of the public administration to the interests of the clan.
When the energy comes out of the waves, now the big ones start.
This is a disproportionate deposit that occupies more than 70% of the planet's surface and now the world's largest energy companies are discovering it.
Waves, currents, tides, these are the new renewable sources on which colossal people like Chevron have laid their eyes, and now they're trying to get their hands on them.
The possibility of obtaining energy from the movements of the sea has now been studied for hundreds of years, and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, research has intensified.
When the price of oil dropped by 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was put aside, but now the environmental authorities and the new increase in oil give a great boost to the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimated in 2007 that 15% of the world's electricity demand could be covered by sea swell operating systems.
This quantity would be twice as high as that produced by nuclear power plants.
And besides, there would be currents and tides..
Colossians on attack.
The first company to rely on marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build a facility in northern Portugal.
When the deal was announced, it looked like a real revolutionary step.
Two years away from this, more and more candidates among these companies, which have always been dedicated to traditional energy, rely on marine energy.
"Chevron is currently studying ocean energy technologies," said the spokesman for a company associated with the U.S. oil colossus, the Wall Street Journal, "and it is assessing the possibilities of cooperating with us."
The cooperation in question concerns the obtaining of a deliberate permit by the American Energy Commission, which is necessary to give rise to a project for the exploitation of marine energy in Alaska.
This is a very interesting signal, especially if we consider that, precisely in Alaska, the US continues to extract oil, and President Bush has recently put in place a project for new excavations.
In addition to Chevron, there are Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey, which are on the way to energy from the sea, and the sums invested to date, although their details are not known, indicate, according to observers, an increasing interest.
Technology to be developed.
Experts are talking about a technology that is still in its early stages, apart from the fact that marine energy does not dispel fears about the environmental impact.
At present, systems such as those in Portugal, or some in Scotland, are small in size and do not seem to create major problems for the ecosystem.
To produce large-scale energy, however, technologies with a higher environmental impact need to be used.
And the choices are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a buoy system connected to each other.
The wave thrust, which moves the sludge upwards and downwards, is converted into a hydraulic pressure of the pistons and cylinders inside the floats.
The pressure turns a turbine that, in turn, feeds a generator.
The energy is sent to the shore through underwater cables.
For the time being, we have four such systems in the project phase, pending a single federal approval and some of the energy could be used for a military facility.
Verdant Power, on the contrary, already produces energy for a mall and a parking lot using six submarine turbines from the East River in New York.
The movement of the water during the tides, turns the blades of the turbines, creating a rotating movement that feeds a generator.
Verdant has announced to have a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorizations to draw energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say to the Institute for the Research of Electrical Energy, deserves right now, the potential of tides.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable of wind, sun, or waves, and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
And it is precisely on the energy of the tides that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, along with others, look to the coast, invested 7 and a half million dollars in 2008 and plans investments up to 35 million in 2009.
