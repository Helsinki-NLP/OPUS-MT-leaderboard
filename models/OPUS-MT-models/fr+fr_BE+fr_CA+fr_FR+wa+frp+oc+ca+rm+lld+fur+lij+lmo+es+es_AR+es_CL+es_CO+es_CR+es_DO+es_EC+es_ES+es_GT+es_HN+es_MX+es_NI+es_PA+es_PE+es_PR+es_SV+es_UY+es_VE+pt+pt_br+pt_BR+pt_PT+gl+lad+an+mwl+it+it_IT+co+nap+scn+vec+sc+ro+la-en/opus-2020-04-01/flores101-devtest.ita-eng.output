. According to scientists, the plumage of this animal was brown chestnut in the upper part, with a pale or carotenoid coloration in the lower part.
The discovery also allows to obtain detailed information about the evolution of the feathers of the birds.
Since the plumage of the dinosaur is not equipped with the basic structure, the so-called rachid, but has other characteristics typical of feathers, beards and beards, the researchers concluded that the rachid is probably the result of an evolutionary development following these characteristics.

Huhne has resigned and will be replaced by Ed Davey MP to the government. Norman Lamb MP is expected to fill Davey's role as Minister for Business.
The appearance of Huhne and Pryce at the Westminster Magistrates' Court is scheduled for 16 February.
The victims were 25-year-old Nicholas Alden, and the driver, 21-year-old Zachary Cuddeback.
Edgar Veguilla has sustained injuries to his arm and jaw, while Kristoffer Schneider will have to undergo facial reconstruction surgery.
The weapon of Uka did not explode when it was pointed at the head of a fifth man. Schneider has constant pain, is blinded by an eye, he lacks a section of skull and his face has been reconstructed into titanium.
Schneider testified through videoconferencing from an USAF base in his country.
In addition to the Wednesday event, Carpanedo took part in two single championship races.
The first in the slalom, where on the first descent had a DNT recorded. Another 36 competitors out of 116 in the same race did not complete the test.
The other race in which she participated, the giant slalom, saw her rank tenth in the women's group of the category "sit", with a combined journey time of 4:41.30, slower than 2:11.60 minutes compared to the first ranked, the Austrian Claudia Loesch, and slower than 1:09.02 minutes compared to the ninth place of Hungarian GyÃ¶ngyi Dani.
Four women's skiers failed to finish their descents, and 45 of the 117 participants in the Giant Slalom did not qualify in the race.
Madhya Pradesh police managed to retrieve the laptop and cell phone that had been stolen.
Deputy Inspector General DK Arya announced: "Five people have been arrested for the rape of the Swiss woman. We also found her cell phone and laptop."
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
According to police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the defendants appeared in court with their faces covered.
None of the three people who were in the house at the time of the crash of the car were injured.
Nevertheless, the driver was seriously injured in the head.
The road in which the accident occurred was temporarily closed, while the rescue services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to the Adenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been in the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court on charges of killing her own son.
She is detained pending referral to trial and trial, but any testimony given by an eyewitness could be polluted, as her image has been widely published.
This is a common practice in other parts of the UK, but Scottish justice has other parameters. The Scottish courts have in fact considered the publication of the photos to be potentially prejudicial.
According to Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee University, "journalists who publish photos or other suspicious subjects walk on a minefield."
The Crown Office, which has general responsibility for judicial proceedings, has specified to journalists that no new comments will be issued until at least the formal indictment.
According to what has been leaked, the subject of the document will be the border dispute, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders existing before the 1967 Middle East War.
According to what is said, the other issues addressed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Once the agreement was signed, Israel demanded a constant military presence in the valley, while the Palestinian Authority agreed to abandon that presence only for five years.
The shooters within the experimental programme for the control of harmful animals had to be carefully monitored by the rangers, since the experiment was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
As part of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program, NPWS, in collaboration with the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., recruited qualified volunteers.
According to Mick O'Flynn, director of the NPWS Park Conservation and Heritage, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive training and security instructions.
Yesterday Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) composed of nine members.
This is Martelly's fifth Provisional Electoral Council in four years.
Last month a presidential commission proposed a package of measures to push the country towards new elections, including the resignation of the previous CEP.
The commission constituted Martelly's response to the widespread protests, which began in October, which challenge the regime.
Occasionally violent protests have been triggered by the failure to conduct the elections, some of which have been scheduled since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of malfunctioning iPod overheating have been reported, causing a total of six fires and causing minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) has claimed to be aware of 27 device-related incidents.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that it had been informed by Apple of 34 other incidents related to overheating, which the company called "non-serious".
In its reply, the ministry called it "absolutely deplorable" the referral of the report by Apple.
The earthquake in Marianne was warned at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
According to the emergency management office of the Northern Mariana Islands, no damage has been reported in the country.
And also the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported that there were no tsunami signals in place.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former Filipino policeman took hostage Hong Kong tourists after hijacking their bus.
With his rifle M16 Rolando Mendoza set fire to tourists.
Many of the hostages have been saved, at least six have died.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were immediately released along with Filipino photographers.
The photographers then replaced an elderly lady who needed to use the bathroom. Mendoza was shot to death.
Liggins retraced his father's footsteps and began his medical career.
After completing her training in midwifery, she joined the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While serving at the hospital, Liggins began studying cases of early labor in his spare time.
His research showed that the administration of a hormone would accelerate the maturation of the lungs in the foetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators Wednesday recovered two 'black boxes' with flight records.
Even his fellow wrestlers wanted to pay homage to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Moon was the first Queen of the Extreme. My first manager. She died on the night of the two moons. Unique, just like you. A strong woman."
"Luna was as weird as me... maybe even more... I love her and I'll miss her... we hope she's in a better place," was Dustin's comment "Goldust" Runnels.
According to the poll conducted on 1,400 people before the 2010 federal elections, people against the move from Australia to the republic increased by 8% compared to 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, the interim Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, said he believed that Australia should become a republic at the end of Elizabeth II's reign.
This opinion is shared by 34% of the survey participants, according to which Queen Elizabeth II should be the last monarch of Australia.
To the opposite of the survey, 29% of respondents argued that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% felt that it should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medal should have competed in the 100 and 200 meters free style and in three sets at the Commonwealth Games, but it accused several disorders that led to doubt of its physical form.
He could not take the necessary drugs to overcome the pain because they are banned from the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest number ever known to this day.
The discovery was verified by several people through the use of various hardware and software at the beginning of February, and was announced on Tuesday.
Comets could have been one of the sources that brought water and organic matter to the earth, that is, matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists want to understand how planets are formed and in particular how the Earth was formed, having clashed with comets a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, has been in office since the beginning of this year as governor; last month he signed a law that makes marriage between people of the same sex legal.
According to him speculations are nothing more than "pockets and political idiocies".
A presidential candidacy is assumed in 2016.
According to the FAA, the NextGen system would allow aircraft to cover shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel a year, thus reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
The system uses satellite rather than obsolete ground radar technology to enable air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport is being arranged and surface trains will not stop at Wembley, while no car parking or interchange parking is available on site.
Fears about the absence of means of transport have raised the possibility of having the game held in closed doors, without the support of the fans of the team.
According to a study published on Thursday in Science magazine, a new species of birds would be born on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
According to researchers from the University of Princeton, USA, and Uppsala University, Sweden, the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was thought that the time required for this process was much longer; this was due to the coupling between an endemic Darwinian bandit, Geospiza forts, and the immigrant cactus bandit, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked in any form. It can be rolled to create tiny shapes.
It can be pulled up to form a thin thread, suitable for twisting and braiding. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and attached to other metals. Sometimes it has been used to decorate the hand-painted images in the books called "minimum codes" precisely thanks to the possibility of being made so thin.
This is the so-called pH of the substance. Using red cabbage juice you can build a pH indicator.
The cabbage juice changes color according to how much acid or basic (alkaline) the chemical element is.
The pH level of the chemical analysed is given by the amount of hydrogen ions present (the pH H letter).
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been removed from the electrons (as hydrogen atoms are formed by a proton and an electron).
Mix together the two dried powders and then, with clean and wet hands, put them in a ball.
Between the humidity present on your hands and the outer layers will trigger a reaction that will cause a strange sensation and form a kind of shell.
Almost all houses in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a bathroom with running water with a connection to an advanced sewage system.
In Greece, remains of sewage networks have been discovered in the homes of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini.
The toilets in ancient times also existed in Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization they were sometimes inserted in public bathrooms, frequented by a mixed audience of men and women.
To call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the signal and then sends it back almost instantly.
The launch of the satellite into space was carried out with a rocket. Scientists resort to space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere partly distorts light and visual.
To transport a satellite or telescope into space, a rocket more than 100 feet high is required.
The wheel has changed the world enormously. Among the various advantages it has offered us, the most important one is to have provided us with easier and faster transport.
Thanks to his invention, they made their appearance the train, the car and various other means of transport.
Below them there are other medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free domestic cats) that feed on small prey, considerably more numerous, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The concept of niche is the secret of their success, a particular objective that every cat has and that allows them not to compete with others.
Lions are the most social felines and live in numerous groups called herds.
The herds are composed of adult males, usually 2 or 3 related to each other, and a number of females and puppies that can reach 30.
Usually females are closely related to each other, being a large family of daughters and sisters.
The pack of lions acts in a very similar way to the pack of wolves or dogs, whose behavior is in fact surprisingly similar to that of lions (but not to that of other big cats), even as regards the deadly attacks on their prey.
A complete athlete: the tiger is able to climb (although not too well), swim, jump very long and exercise a traction force five times greater than that of a strong man.
The tiger belongs to the same family (the genus Panthera) as the lion, leopard and jaguar. These four cats are the only ones to roar.
The roar of the tiger is not as powerful as that of the lion, but more like a phrase of shrieking and rabid words.
Ocelots love to feed on small animals. If possible, they hunt for monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds and almost all the prey they catch are much smaller than they are.
Scientists believe that the ocelots follow and find the animals to eat (prede) thanks to the smell, smelling on the ground where they have been.
Thanks to the night vision they are able to see very well in the dark, as well as being able to move stealthily. To hunt their prey, the ocelots mingle with the surrounding environment and then drop them on.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) separates from the main population to which they belong (for example, if they move over a mountain chain or a river, or move to a new island, thus making it difficult for them to return), they will probably find themselves in an environment different from that in which they were before.
This new environment is characterized by different resources and competitors, so, in order to become a strong competitor, the new population will need different characteristics or transformations from those previously needed.
The original population has not changed at all; it continues to need the same adaptations as before.
Over time and as the new population adapts to its new environment, it is less and less like the other population.
At some point, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different from each other that they will no longer be defined as belonging to the same species.
This process, which consists in the formation of new species, is called speciation. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and is a fundamental element of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that is breathed by humans and absorb the carbon dioxide expelled from them (through the breath).
Plants make their own nourishment with the sun through photosynthesis. They also shade.
We build our houses from plants and produce clothes with plants. Much of the food we eat is made of plants. Without plants animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the super predator of his era and for this he feared nothing but the other mosasaurs.
From its long jaws there were more than 70 sharp teeth like razors, plus another row on the palate, so there was no escape for anyone who crossed his path.
We do not know for sure, but it is possible that it had a bifurcated tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fishes, other mosasauri and it is also possible that it was a cannibal.
He also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T-Rex could not compete with him.
Although much of their food would seem familiar to us, Roman banquets also provided for various strange or unusual courses, such as wild boar, peacock, snails and a kind of rodent called giro.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate sitting on chairs, rich men loved to feast together lying on one side while eating their meal.
Of course the meals of the ancient Romans did not include different foods, arrived in Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes or cocoa, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built for each god a main temple, which was considered the dwelling place of the god.
People brought sacrifices to the gods and priests sought to provide for the needs of the deities through ceremonies and feasts.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary accessible only to priests.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurat, were built and became part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a sanctuary dedicated to the god.
Thanks to the mild climate that characterizes the Middle East, the house was not of fundamental importance.
Much of the life of the Jewish family took place outdoors.
The women were cooking in the courtyard, while the shops were simple open-air counters overlooking the street. The stone was used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests, so the wood was particularly expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Nordic sages it is said that it was Erik the Red who named it, having met Greenland on his journey after being exiled from Iceland for murder.
But, regardless of his discovery, at that time the Eskimo tribes were already living there.
Although all "Scandinavian" countries, the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland had very different characteristics.
If you've seen the movie "The Mystery of the Templars", you might think that a treasure map is drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is false. Even if something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence is the inscription "Declaration of original independence of 4 July 1776". The text appears upside down at the bottom of the document.
Although it is certainly not known who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of its existence the large parchment document (measure 29.75 inches per 24.5 inches) was rolled up to be put back.
Probably, therefore, the annotation was only set as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent clashes had brought northern France to liberation, but the south was still occupied.
It was governed by the Vichy regime, that is, by those French who in 1940 had made peace with the Germans and allied with the invaders, instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France: this offensive action took the name of Operation Dragoon.
The American forces and those of the Free French had liberated southern France in just two weeks and were heading towards Germany.
Civility means a specific culture, shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work collaboratively, forming a society.
The word civilization derives from the Latin "civilis", which means civilis; the term is in turn connected with "civilis", i.e. citizen, and "civitas", i.e. city or city-state, and in a certain way also defines the dimensions of society.
Cities-states are the first realities to anticipate the idea of a nation. Culture of civilization means transmitting knowledge through several generations, leaving an indelible cultural footprint through a fair spread.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving significant historical traces, not being thus recognized as true and proper civilizations.
During the war of independence, the thirteen states formed for the first time a weak central government, and Congress was the only component, according to the Statute of the Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes and, given the absence of an executive or judicial power at the national level, it entrusted itself to the State authorities, often uncooperative, for the application of its acts.
He did not even have the authority to bypass tax laws and duties between states.
In order to amend the articles it was necessary for the unanimous consent of all the states. These for their part had so little consideration of the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is, together with the German team, the second most successful football team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the most popular sports are: football, basketball, volleyball, basketball, screen, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, track hockey and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are more widespread in the northern regions and see Italians competing in international competitions and Olympic events.
They are part of the Japanese almost 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), and this makes Japan the seventh largest archipelago in the world!
From a geographical point of view, it refers to Japan as an "archipelago", considering the presence of groups of islands that make up it.
Taiwan was born in the 15th century, when European sailors who were passing from there recently recorded the name of the island under the name of Ilha Formosa, or wonderful island.
The Dutch East Indies Company in 1624 established a base in the south-west of Taiwan, starting a transformation involving the production systems of Aboriginal cereals and employing Chinese handiworkers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan ended up under the control of the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912); in 1885, Taiwan was declared province of the Qing Empire.
After being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, thus ceding Taiwan's sovereignty to Japan; the island will remain under the Japanese government until 1945.
Machu Picchu comprises three primary structures, notably the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Much of the peripheral buildings have been rebuilt to give tourists a more accurate idea of their original appearance.
In 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu's site had been recovered, but restoration work is still ongoing.
The most common format in the world for the photography of fixed images, for example, is the 35 mm, the same as the film most used at the end of the era of analog photography.
It is still produced today and, most importantly, its aspect ratio is inherited from the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
Strangely, the height of the 35 mm size is 24 mm and its width is 36 mm.
The proportions of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest ratio of whole numbers) are therefore considered 3:2.
The proportions of many of the common formats (e.g. the APS family of formats) are the same or very close to this value.
The widely exploited and often derisive third-party rule is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a measure of order within an image.
According to this rule, the most effective point where placing the main subject corresponds to the intersection of the lines dividing the image into third parties, both vertically and horizontally (as in the example).
At this stage in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was entitled to be examined.
The Christian religion had been a glue between the European states for over a thousand years, despite linguistic and customary differences.
His omnipresent power has influenced anyone, from king to common citizens.
One of the foundations of Christianity is that wealth must be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's monetary reserves exist for this very reason.
The central authority of the church has remained in Rome for over a thousand years and this convergence of power and money has prompted many to wonder whether this principle has been respected.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain decided to implement a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved to be effective: it provided for the interruption of any essential military and civilian supplies, despite this blockade violating international law usually accepted and codified by multiple international treaties of the last two centuries.
Britain undermined international waters to prevent access of any vessel to entire sections of the ocean, also endangering neutral ships.
Since this tactic had given rise to a limited response, Germany expected a reaction similar to its indiscriminate underwater war campaign.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and effervescences of World War I, the nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884 Tesla accepted a job offer at the Edison Company in New York City and this led him to move to the United States of America.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poems and a letter of recommendations written by Charles Batchelor (his manager in the previous work) and addressed to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China the different periods of time were indicated in a very singular way: every period of China or every family that was in power constituted a specific dynasty.
Even the intervals between the individual dynasties were characterized by periods of instability and division between the provinces. The most famous was the so-called period of the Three Kingdoms, between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty, which lasted for 60 years.
During these times, fierce wars ensued among many nobles fighting for the throne.
The period of the Three Kingdoms was one of the most violent eras in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died fighting to win a place of honour in the imposing palace of Xi'an.
The social and political effects are numerous, including the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to the republic, nationalism and the conviction that the nation belongs to the people and is not the property of a single sovereign.
Moreover, after the Revolution the professions were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and fortunate to succeed.
The same applies to the military, since the army's rankings, instead of being class-based, are now based on the calibre.
The French Revolution was also a source of inspiration for many other oppressed workers in various countries to start their own revolution.
Muhammad had a deep interest in matters that go beyond the earthly life. He was usually going to a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of the "noor" (light) to meditate.
The cave, which survived the passage of time, offers in itself a very clear picture of Mohammed's spirituality.
The cave rests on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, completely detached from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find, even if one knew its existence. Once inside the cave, the isolation is total.
You can see nothing but a wonderful clear sky and a lot of mountains around. From the inside of the cave you can see or feel very little of the surrounding world.
Among the seven wonders of the world, the Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one that has arrived today not in a state of ruin.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C., the Great Pyramid is one of the great pyramidal structures built in honor of the dead Pharaoh.
The plain of Giza, or "Necropolis of Giza", in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, houses numerous pyramids (the largest of which is the Cheope pyramid), various smaller tombs, various temples and the great Sphinx.
The important pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Cheope, and many of the pyramids, tombs, and smaller temples were built to honor Pharaoh's wives and relatives.
The indication "articulated up" resembles a V and the indication "articulated down" resembles a graffiti or a square without the lower side.
Upward means you should start from the tip and push the bow, and downward means you should start from the alamaro (which is where the hand holds the bow) and pull the bow toward itself.
An ascending bow usually generates a softer sound, while with a descending bow it is a stronger and more determined sound.
You may decide to add your custom pencil indications, but keep in mind that the archegy signs you find printed have a musical value, so in principle they should be respected.
On 6 October 1789, a crowd of women from the market forced King Louis XVI, in prey to terror, to leave Versailles to return to Paris, together with Queen Marie Antonietta, to their two young children (Maria Teresa, 11 years old and Luigi Carlo, 4 years old) and to Elizabeth, the king's sister.
With a carriage they returned to Paris, surrounded by a crowd of people who shouted and shouted threats against the rulers.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep the windows of their carriage wide open.
At some point someone in the crowd showed the terrified queen the head of a royal guard who had been killed in Versailles.
The war expenses of U.S. imperialism to conquer the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover much of the expenses and interest on bonds fluctuated on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking institutions.
Clearly, the huge gains from the prolonged exploitation in the time of the Filipino people constituted the profits at the base of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars you need to know the context that led to the creation of this order.
The period in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history covering the XI, XII and XIII centuries (from the year 1000 to 1300 AD).
The Middle Ages was preceded by the High Middle Ages and followed by the Lower Middle Ages, which ended by convention in about 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that includes in practice a wide range of ideas, from technological innovation or the technological imperative to the narrow sense that man's destiny is driven by a underlying logic, associated with scientific laws and their realization in technology.
Much of the interpretations of technological determinism have in common two general ideas: one is that the development of technology itself follows a path that goes far beyond political and cultural influence, and the other is that technology in turn has "effects" on societies that are intrinsic, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, we can say that the car necessarily involves the development of the road network.
However, a national road network for only a few cars is not economically sustainable, so new production methods are developed to reduce car ownership costs.
The mass ownership of cars also leads to a higher percentage of road accidents, and consequently the invention of new rescue techniques for the care of injured persons.
Romanticism was characterized by a consistent component of cultural determinism, treated by authors such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of romanticism, geography has conditioned individuals, and over time uses, customs and culture linked to this geography have emerged which, being in harmony with the context of society, have proved more effective than laws imposed arbitrarily.
Similarly in Paris, known today as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was the capital of fashion in feudal Europe.
Its fame as a center of luxury began around 400 AD and continued until about 1100 AD.
During the 12th century its prestige decreased, especially because the Crusaders returned carrying gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued more than the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this point that the title of capital of fashion passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The highest point of Gothic style was touched in the period between the 10th and the 11th century and in the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was influenced by the strong influence of Eastern Byzantine culture.
But the slow pace of communication means that the spread of styles in the west can be delayed by 25-30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most significant developments of the time, the result of the crusades, was the introduction of buttons to tie clothes.
Agriculture is defined as subsistence when it is practised solely for the purpose of producing enough to meet the food needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple system, usually of a biological type, which uses preserved seeds originating in the ecological region in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques aimed at obtaining the maximum from crops.
Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence farming, and in many developing countries this is still the case.
Subcultures combine individuals with the same opinions, who do not feel represented by the standards of society, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures are distinguished according to the age, ethnicity, social class, position and/or sex of its members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinctive may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a set of factors.
Often the members of a subculture indicate their belonging through a peculiar and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, manners and slang.
One of the most commonly used methods to explain the importance of socialization is to analyze some unhappy cases of children who, due to negligence, as a result of mishaps, or as a result of intentional abuse, have grown up without proper socialization with adults.
These children are called "feral" or wild. Some of them have been segregated by people (often their own parents): in some cases abandonment is motivated by the rejection of a serious intellectual or physical impairment by parents.
Feral children may have suffered severe violence or trauma prior to abandonment or escape.
Other children may have been reared by animals; others still seem to have lived alone in the wild.
When the feral child is fully reared by nonhuman animals, he shows behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely similar to those of the particular animal that took care of him, such as fear or indifference towards man.
Project-based learning should make learning itself simpler and more interesting, while the shelf goes a little further.
Scaffolding is not a mode of learning, as much as it is a help for those who undertake a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is an example of "scaffolding", but it is also the small graffiti assistant of Microsoft Office.
Virtual shelves are integrated into the software and have the purpose of questioning, soliciting and explaining the procedures that the student may have had difficulty managing alone.
Children are taken into custody for various reasons ranging from abandonment to abuse, to extortion.
A child should never grow up in an environment that does not guarantee him/her nutrition, care and training, but happens to them.
We believe that the affidavit is a safe area for these children.
Our trust system should provide safe homes, loving foster parents, stable education and reliable health care.
The affidavit is supposed to satisfy all unmet needs in the house from which they were taken.
The Internet brings together elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The features of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of usage theory and rewards.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important motivations for the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995).
The study by Eighmey and McCord (1998) on public reactions to websites identified two new aspects of motivation, namely "personal involvement" and "continuous relationships".
The use of video recording has led to significant discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is argued that it is possible to find out if a person is lying by interpreting micro-expressions correctly.
In his essay "The President's Speech", Oliver Sacks illustrated how people unable to understand the language spoken because of brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even argues that such skills in interpreting human behavior can be shared with animals, such as domestic dogs.
In the 20th century, research has demonstrated the existence of two pools of genetic variability, that is, hidden variability and expressed variability.
With the mutation a new genetic variability is added, with the selection it is eliminated by the pool of expressed variability.
Generation after generation, segregation and recombination redistribute the variability back and forth between the two pools.
For a primate with a digesting apparatus similar to that of humans, it is difficult to satisfy its needs for amino acids with the plant resources available in the savannah.
Moreover, the failure to carry out these activities has serious consequences: slowing growth, malnutrition and, in the end, also death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would have been proteins in leaves and vegetables, but for primates like us they are difficult to digest, unless cooked.
On the other hand, animal foods (such as ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but provide a high amount of protein, containing all essential amino acids.
In light of all this, it should not be surprising that our ancestors themselves have solved their "protein problem" in a certain sense as the chimpanzees of the savannah do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentional awakening that occurs during the normal sleep period, followed by a recovery of sleep (10â€“60 minutes later).
This process can be easily implemented using a relatively silent alarm clock to bring you to a state of consciousness, without waking you up completely.
If you decide to reset the clock to sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, so you will be forced to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options focused on the biorhythm provide for the consumption of many liquids before sleeping (especially water or tea, known for its diuretic properties), which force you to get up from bed to urinate.
A person enjoys an inner peace proportionally opposed to the tension existing in his body and spirit.
Less is the tension, more positive is the existing vital force. Each of us has the potential capacity to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can reach enlightenment. This goal is hampered only by our tension and our negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on Buddha's teachings, but has been enriched by the Mahayan ritual's love path and various Indian yoga techniques.
In general, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It has a foundation in Kundalini Yoga, in meditation and in a path of omni-understanding love.
Kundalini Yoga activates Kundalini energy (light energy) by using yoga positions, breathing exercises, mantra and visualizations.
Deity Yoga is the heart of Tibetan meditation. Through the depiction of various divinities, energy channels are cleaned, chakras are activated and the consciousness of enlightenment develops.
Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, leading to collaboration between the USSR and the United States. With the end of the war, system conflicts, both procedural and cultural, caused the breakup between the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies had become enemies; so the Cold War began.
It would have lasted for the next 40 years and would have been fought for real, by mercenary armies, in the battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba and in many other countries.
On 17 September 1939, the Polish defence had already been broken; the only option was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridge head.
These plans were, however, immediately obsolete, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army advanced and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, after having invaded the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Treaty of Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact and other international, bilateral and multilateral treaties.
Exploiting ships for freight transport is certainly the most efficient way to move large volumes of people and goods across the oceans.
It has always been the task of the marines to ensure that the country preserves its ability to move people and goods, while at the same time opposing the enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the recent examples in support of this theory and most noteworthy is the Battle of the Atlantic during World War II. During the battle, the Americans tried to move men and goods across the Atlantic Ocean to support Britain.
At the same time, the German military navy, mainly using submarines, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had not succeeded, Germany would probably have had the opportunity to conquer Britain, as it had done in the rest of Europe.
Apparently, the goats were tamed for the first time about 10,000 years ago on the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
They began to be bred by the cultures and tribes of ancient times to have milk, hair, meat and skin readily available.
The domestic goats were usually reared in herds left free to move on the hills or in other pasture areas, often cared for by goats (similar to shepherds) who were often children or adolescents. These pastoral methods are still used today.
Already in the 16th century in England the wagonways were built.
Although they were simply made of parallel wooden axes, the wagonways, when compared to the slightly more rugged roads of the period, allowed horses to reach higher speeds and move heavier loads.
The rails were introduced relatively soon to keep the tracks in position. Gradually, however, it was understood that the tracks would have been more efficient if they had a bar of iron on top.
It became a common practice, even though the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, the wooden wheels left the place to the iron wheels. In 1767 they made their appearance the first railways completely made of iron.
The first means of transport that man knew were the legs. Human beings began to walk in an upright position two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means "erect man").
His predecessor, the australopithec, did not usually walk upright.
Specialisation marks for bipedal walking are present in Australopiteco fossils dating back to 4,2-3,9 million years ago, although it is possible that the Sahelantropus walked on two legs seven million years ago.
In order to try to mitigate future sufferings to some extent we can start adopting lifestyles that are more respectful of the environment, we can join the environmental movement and also activism.
In many cases this only works as a symptomatic treatment. If we do not want only a temporary solution, we should find the ultimate cause of the problems and disable it.
It is quite clear that the world has changed a lot because of the scientific and technological advances of humanity, while the problems have increased because of the overcrowding and extravagant lifestyle of human beings.
After Congress adopted it on July 4, a manuscript draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to John Dunlap's printing house a few blocks away.
In the night they were produced between 150 and 200 copies, now known as "The Dunlap Manifestos".
The document was first read publicly on 8 July in the Independence Hall courtyard and was entrusted to John Nixon.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, which had it read to his troops in New York on July 9, while a copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 borders of Dunlap still known are the oldest existing copies of the document. The original manuscript has been lost.
According to many paleontologists of today a category of dinosaurs has survived and is still alive. They are those we call birds.
Many tend not to consider them dinosaurs because of feathers and their ability to fly.
Yet birds have many characteristics that combine them with dinosaurs.
Like the T-Rex, they are equipped with feet with scales and claws, lay the eggs and walk on the two hind legs.
Ultimately, the manipulation of coded information in the form of binary numbers is the basis of all computers currently used.
A binary number can only have one of the two values, 0 or 1, and in the technical computer language these numbers are called binary numbers or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately evident. Its symptoms, including vomiting, are very generic enough to make an immediate diagnosis impossible.
The main indication of internal poisoning could be the presence in the home of an open container of drugs or harmful chemicals.
Check the label for first aid instructions for that specific poison.
The term mite is formally used by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term comes from familiarity in ancient times with bed bugs, insects that have strongly adapted to become parasites of man.
Both the killer and the bed bugs are nidical, that is, adapted to live in the nest or home of their host.
In the United States of America, multiple sclerosis (MS) causes some 400,000 known cases to be recorded, ranking first among neurological diseases affecting young people and middle-aged adults.
MS is a condition that affects the central nervous system, including the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has shown that the chances of developing MS among females are double that of males.
A couple can decide that raising a child is not in their interest, or that of their own child.
These couples have the opportunity to choose an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, natural parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The primary objective of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method actually guides most of the scientific investigation.
But this is not just about experimentation, since an experiment is a test that is used to exclude one or more of the possible hypotheses; even asking questions and making observations can guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, particularly the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's views on the various subjects of knowledge, including psychology, were accepted.
With the progressive decline of the Greek language, the West was isolated from its philosophical and scientific Greek roots.
Many have observed that physiological rhythms and behavior depend decisively on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms have been documented, which are not only reactions to external periodic signals, for most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are independent oscillators, whose free cycle continues for a period of time even in the absence of external stimuli.
One of the first experiments to suggest that DNA was a genetic material was that conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, that is, viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments highlighting the DNA of the bacteriophage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the bacteriophage with radioactive sulphur.
Mutations may have a number of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the relevance of the piece of genetic material involved and whether the cells concerned belong to the germline.
The mutations that can be transmitted to children are only those at the level of germ cells; mutations that occur elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Naturalistic tourism reminds people interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of enjoying the landscape, including flora and wildlife.
Examples of activities to be done on site include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visits to parks and the study of ecosystem information.
For example, by visiting, photographing and learning about Borneo's oranges.
Every morning, people leave small country to go by car to work, crossing other people whose place of work is the place from which they have just left.
In this dynamic andirivieni, everyone is somehow connected to a transport system based on private cars, which at the same time support.
Today science reveals that this massive carbon-based economy has forced the biosphere out of one of its stability conditions that has allowed human evolution over the past two million years.
Every person participates in social life and uses transportation systems, of which almost everyone complains.
In developed countries it is rare to hear similar levels of complaints concerning water quality or falling bridges.
Why do transport systems attract so many complaints, why are they rejected every day? Are they designed by engineers who are incompetent, or are there deeper motivations?
The "Traffic Flow" is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles from one point to another and the interactions they generate with each other.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is complex as the behaviour of drivers cannot be predicted with absolute certainty.
Fortunately, driver behaviour tends to fall into a reasonably constant range, so, in turn, traffic flows tend to show a reasonable consistency and can be represented generically in a mathematical way.
In order to obtain a more accurate representation of the traffic flow, the three main variables were correlated: (1) flow rate, (2) density and (3) speed.
These reports are useful for planning, designing and managing road structures.
The insects were the first animals to fly. The ability to fly allowed them to escape more easily to enemies and to find food and companions more efficiently.
Much of the insects benefit from the ability to fold the wings along the body.
This allows them to exploit a greater variety of small amphibians to hide from predators.
Among all the insects that exist today, the only ones that are not able to fold the wings are dragonflies and ephemerals.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system was moving around the Sun.
For someone he was right, but many others believed the opposite, that the solar system, including the Sun itself (and also the other stars), would move around the Earth.
Which seems sensible, why don't we have the feeling that the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the largest and second longest river on Earth. It carries a water quantity equal to 8 times that of the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the largest river on Earth, with a width that at some points reaches six miles.
The total 20% of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km long (3,980 miles) in which the waters of thousands of minor tributaries flow.
They continued to build stone pyramids until the end of the Old Kingdom, but despite this the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in terms of the magnitude and technical excellence of their realization.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom remained enchanted to admire the monuments of their ancestors, who at that time were well over a thousand years old.
The population of the Vatican City consists of about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and that with the smallest population.
The language of the Vatican City for official legislation and communications is Italian.
Italian is also the language of daily use spoken by most people working within the state, while Latin is often used in religious functions.
In Vatican City all citizens are Roman Catholics.
Man has begun to know the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper already in antiquity: these elements can be discovered in nature in native form and you can extract them quite simply with the help of primitive instruments.
According to the philosopher Aristotle, everything consists of a combination of one or more of the following four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
These actually resemble more of the four states of matter, namely (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma. However, he also theorized that they were transformed into new substances, forming what we see.
The alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Keep in mind that the periodic table contains numerous elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There may also be alloys made up of minimal amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
In the universe, everything is made of matter and all matter consists of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are incredibly tiny, so that trillions of them could get into the point at the end of this sentence.
After her invention, the pencil became a good friend to many.
Unfortunately, with the introduction of new methods of writing, pencil has been relegated to a lower status and less widespread use.
Today everyone writes messages on computer screens and never has the need to get close to a temperamatite.
We can only wonder what fate the keyboard will have when something newer comes.
The principle that energy is needed to put together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons is the basis for the operation of the fission pump.
In practice it is like rolling a heavy cart on a hill. So, further dividing the core, a part of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break in the presence of a weak thrust or nothing.
The surface of the Moon consists of rocks and dust and its outer layer is called crust.
The crust has a thickness of about 70 km on the nearest side and 100 km on the furthest side.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker under the mountainous areas.
The maria could be more numerous on the nearby side because the crust is thinner. This facilitated the lava rise to the surface.
Content theories are focused on finding what suits or attracts individuals.
According to these theories, people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they become adults.
These theories analyze what some people share and urge them to want to do what they do, and what are the factors in the context in which they live that lead them to do or not do certain things.
Among the theories on the most widespread content are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Herzberg's Two Factor Theory.
In general, when managers start directing their former colleagues, two behaviors can emerge. On the one hand, there are those who try to remain "one of the boys" (or girls).
The manager of this type finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, implement disciplinary actions, evaluate performance, define and assign responsibility.
At the opposite extreme, the manager becomes a completely different person, who feels that he has to change the entire team's work and do it himself.
In the end, the leader is the person who ultimately is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This attitude often generates disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team.
The standard of excellence of virtual teams is similar to that of conventional teams, but with some small differences.
Virtual team members often have the function of contact point for their next physical group.
They often have greater autonomy than the members of the conventional teams, as meetings can take place according to the various time zones, which may not be understood by local management.
The existence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a fundamental element of a virtual team.
The management team to which each member refers is defined as "invisible team" and is what sets the standards for each member.
For what reason should an organisation be willing to face the long process leading to the construction of a learning organisation? A good reason for implementing organisational learning concepts can be innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively in all functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
Consequently, the path of collaboration within an organization to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the customer's needs.
In order for an organization to define itself as innovative, leaders need to create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) illustrates the continuum theory as a method used to help organizations achieve higher performance levels.
Neurobiological results have demonstrated the physical existence of a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. The research area becomes narrower and therefore much more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior is the basis of scientists' research.
It has long been known that certain types of brain damage, trauma, injury, and tumors can affect behavior and alter certain mental functions.
The introduction of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes never previously observed.
This offers us a great deal of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand our mental processes.
Although it has a strong science fictional connotation, AI represents a very important branch of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines.
AI research includes the development of machines to automate operations that require intelligent behavior.
Some examples of application are control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as the recognition of writing, vocal and facial.
These things have become distinct disciplines, focusing on providing solutions to real problems.
The AI system is now often used in the economic, medical, engineering and military fields, as well as being integrated into various home computer and video game software applications.
Trips are a fundamental part of teaching. Often teachers would like to take their students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
The solution is offered by the technology with virtual tours. Students can see the artifacts of the museums, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art while sitting in the classroom.
Sharing a virtual school trip is also a great pretext for sharing experiences and travel reflections with future classes.
For example, every year Bennett School students, North Carolina, design a website on their trip to the capital; the website is redesigned every year, but previous versions are kept online and become an album.
Blogs can also help improve the writing of students. In fact, their first experiences with blogs are often characterized by an uncured grammar and spelling, but in general the presence of an audience changes things.
Since students are usually the most critical audience, to avoid negative reviews the blog author commits to improving writing.
Blogs also "constrict students to become more aware of the moment around them." The need to feed the interest of the public motivates students to be ingenious and interesting (Toto, 2004).
The blog is a tool that aims to encourage collaboration and develop student learning well beyond the normal school day.
The correct use of blogs "can help students to become more critical and analytical. By actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their position within the writings of others, as well as outline their perspectives on specific issues" (Oravez, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's evocative and bilingual capital, rich in art galleries and museums that tell the country's past and present.
Further south you will find Niagara Falls and north you can admire the natural and unspoilt beauty of the Muskoka region and much more.
All this and more makes Ontario typically Canadian according to the opinions of foreigners.
The large northernmost areas are sparsely populated, among these some are almost uninhabited wild lands.
If we compare the population, the result can be surprising for many: in the United States the number of African American citizens is higher than that of Canadian citizens.
The eastern African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and its natural heritage makes it a continent of its own.
Almost all smaller islands, known as luxurious resorts, are mostly independent nations or associated with France.
In the lands the Arabs also brought Islam, which took a long journey to the Comoros and Mayotte.
In the 15th century, the discovery of the Cape's route, from Europe to India, by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama opened the way to European influence and colonialism.
To the north, the region is bordered by Sahel, while to the south and west it borders the Atlantic Ocean.
For travellers: it is recommended that everyone declare that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women should realize that cultural differences can lead to what they consider to be a nuisance, and that it is not unusual to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Have the firmness to reject men, and do not be afraid to oppose them (cultural differences or not, there is no justification!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC; under the name of Anfa, it was a port of strategic importance used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids.
The Portuguese destroyed it to rebuild it under the name of Casa Branca, which they abandoned in 1755 following an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city called Daru l-Badya, then called Casablanca by Spanish traders who chose these places for their commercial bases.
Throughout Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting shopping cities.
In the vicinity of the old Medina it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan products, such as tajin, ceramics, leather goods, narghilÃ¨ and a lot of china, but all this is reserved only for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town located in the easternmost part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, not far from Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma, burying much of the city's streets, especially those of the center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, it is appropriate to document yourself well before making any visits outside of Goma, so as to properly assess the status of the clashes that still persist in North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for climbing to the Nyiragongo volcano, as well as being one of the least expensive opportunities to see the mountain gorillas of Africa.
You can use a wedding-bode (taxi-motorcycle) to move to Goma. The normal price (in local currency) is about 500 Congolese francs for a short run.
Even as a result of its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" ended up becoming a metaphor of exotic and distant land.
Today Timbuktu is a fallen city, but for its reputation it remains a tourist attraction, also equipped with an airport.
In 1990 it was included in the list of UNESCO heritage sites that are in danger, due to the threat posed by desert sands.
In the special of Henry Louis Gates of PBS "Wonders of the African World" was one of the main stages.
With its more Arabic than African touch, the city stands out clearly from the rest of the country.
Kruger National Park (Kruger National Park, KNP) is located to the north-east of South Africa and winds east along the border with Mozambique, to the north border with Zimbabwe, and its southern border is represented by the Crocodile River.
With an area of 19,500 km2, the park comprises 14 different ecozones, each of which provides support for a different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the most important of South African national parks (SANParks).
As with all national parks in South Africa, daily contributions are provided for conservation and entry to the park.
The purchase of a Wild Card could also be useful, as it allows access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
The Hong Kong Island, which gives its name to the entire territory, is the main destination for many tourists.
The series of buildings forming the Hong Kong skyline was compared to a glittering bar graph, even more evident because framed by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To enjoy the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and visit Kowloon's waterfront in front.
Most of the urban development of the island of Hong Kong has focused on the heavily populated land reclamated on the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonizers chose for themselves, so if you are looking for testimonies of the colonial past of this land, this is a good point to start from.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastal range of mangroves in the world. It extends for 80 km (50 mi) from the coast in the hinterland of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The part of the forest included in the Indian territory takes the name of Sundarbans National Park.
However, forests are not only mangrove swamps: they also contain what remains of the imposing jungles that once covered the Gange plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about a third consists of marshy areas.
Since 1966 the Sundarbans have become a sanctuary for wildlife; in the area it is estimated the presence of 400 royal tigers of Bengal and about 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although many (especially those to the east and to Jakarta/Bumthang) depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since service buses between different districts are often full, it will be good to buy the ticket a few days in advance.
Most of the neighborhoods are reached by comfortable and robust small Japanese buses.
Shared taxis are a convenient and fast way to reach nearby locations, including Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a crossed bridge connecting the city of Oiapoque, Brazil, to Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
Its two cobblestones have a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long and has two lanes 3.50 meters wide.
Under the bridge the free vertical space is 15 meters. The construction ended in August 2011, but the opening to traffic took place only in March 2017.
By September 2017, when Brazilian customs checkpoints are likely to be completed, the bridge should be fully operational.
The GuaranÃ­ were the most important indigenous group that lived in today's Eastern Paraguay. They were semi-emed hunters and also engaged in subsistence farming.
The Chaco region was inhabited by other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycuru and Payagua, who lived in hunting, harvesting and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called "La grande province delle Indie", was born in the 16th century from the encounter between Spanish conquerors and native native groups.
The Spanish began a period that lasted three centuries, the period of colonizations.
Since the founding of AsunciÃ³n in 1537, Paraguay has been able to maintain much of its indigenous identity and peculiarities.
Everyone knows that Argentina boasts one of the best teams and the best polo players in the world.
In December, in the polo fields of Las CaÃ±itas, the most important tournament of the year takes place.
Here you can watch minor tournaments and matches also at other times of the year.
To receive information about tournaments and the purchase of tickets for polo matches, please contact the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The Falklands have their official currency, the Falklands pound (FKP), whose value is equivalent to that of the British pound (GBP).
The only island bank, located in Stanley in front of the FIC West store, offers the currency exchange service.
British pounds are generally accepted anywhere on the islands. Stanley can often also be paid by credit cards and US dollars.
It is likely that on the peripheral islands they do not accept credit cards, although British and US currencies can be accepted. Check in advance with the owners to decide on an acceptable payment method.
It's almost impossible to exchange the Falklands' currency off the islands, so you change the money before you start again.
Since Montevideo is south of Ecuador, it is summertime when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical region; during the summer months temperatures above 30Â°C are quite normal.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely reach below zero, but the combination of wind and humidity gives the feeling of a temperature lower than that marked by the thermometer.
There are no defined "dry" and "wet" seasons: the amount of rain remains almost constant throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to the sight of man, the fauna is still wild and must not be fed or disturbed.
The park authorities recommend maintaining a distance of at least 100 yards/metres from bears and wolves and a distance of 25 yards/metres from all other wild animals.
No matter how docile they may seem: bison, moose, deer, bears, virtually all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured for not keeping an adequate distance. It is necessary to leave these animals adequate space because they are large, wild and potentially dangerous animals.
Also keep in mind that smells can attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid bringing with you or cooking foods with very strong smells, and try to keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of the Samoan Islands. It is located on the island of Upolu and its population is just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded between 1850 and 1860 and is the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In this port there was the notorious naval stall of 1889, in which seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk, with the exception of a British cruiser. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful rally in the city led to the killing of Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, the supreme leader.
There are many beaches, since Auckland is located between two ports. The most popular ones are divided into three areas.
The beaches overlooking the North Shore Pacific Ocean (North Harbour district) extend from Long Bay north to Devonport south.
These are mostly sandy beaches, safe for swimming, and most of them enjoy the shade of pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive in Auckland Central, in the elegant suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, overlook the port of Waitemata.
These are beaches suitable for families sometimes a little crowded, surrounded by a wide choice of shops. You can take a bath safely.
The best known local beer is a non-complex, pleasant and refreshing beer called "Number One". The other local beer is called "Manta".
You can have many French wines, but those Australians and New Zealanders could better face the journey.
The local tap water is totally safe to drink, but if you are afraid, bottled water is easy to find.
According to Australians, flat white coffee is born from a foreign idea. Espresso is black short coffee, cappuccino is covered with cream (not foam) and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is at the same level as Belgian chocolate. Fruit juices are expensive, but very good.
Throughout the year there are many excursions on the coral reef and accidents for one of these causes on the coral reef are rare.
Always ask the authorities for advice, follow directions and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
The cubomeduses appear from October to April near the beaches and estuarines of the rivers north of Seventeen Seventhy. Outside this period they can only be found occasionally.
Sharks are present, but rarely attack man. Most sharks fear him and tend to stay away.
The habitat of saltwater crocodiles consists mainly of estuaries of rivers north of Rockhampton, not living actively in the ocean.
When booking in advance, the traveller has the serenity to find a place to sleep once he has arrived at the destination.
Travel agencies often enter into agreements with certain hotels, but it is still possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as camping, through the same agencies.
Travel agencies usually offer packages including breakfast, airport transfers or even combined flight+hotel packages.
They can also keep the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to get you additional documents needed for your destination (e.g. the visa).
However, any changes or requests must be submitted first to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, most participants decide to camp on the spot, considering this aspect a crucial element of the experience.
To be close to the center of the action it is necessary to arrive soon and to acquire a space close to the music.
Remember that once the music is finished on the main stage, there may be sections of the festival where the music lasts until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the North Baltic Sea in winter, check the cabin location, as the ice crossing causes quite annoying noises for those who are most exposed to it.
Cruises in St. Petersburg include the time to explore the city. Cruise passengers are granted the exemption from the visa requirement (check conditions).
Generally, casinos do everything to increase as much time and money as possible spent by their guests. Generally, there are no windows, no clocks, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually offer food, drinks and exclusive entertainment to keep the mood of guests up so that they stay.
In some places alcoholic beverages are offered from the house. However, the state of drunkenness alters the ability to judge and every good gambler knows how important it is to remain sober.
Anyone who decides to drive at high altitudes or on mountain passes must take into account the possibility of snow, ice or near-zero temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is reduced and it is not possible to drive as when you are on clean asphalt.
During a snow storm, in a very short time it can fall so much snow that it will keep you stuck.
Even precipitation and snow spots, or the formation of ice or condensation on the vehicle windows, can reduce visibility.
However, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic continues to flow almost continuously throughout the year.
The safari are probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the heart of the holiday of many visitors.
In its popular use, the term safari refers to trips made by land, especially in the savannah, to see the beautiful African wildlife.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get closer to cars, so normal equipment is enough to get a good look.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes fearsome and for this reason it is possible to observe them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called "bush walk", "travel safari", or "walking safari") is an excursion that can last a few hours or more days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2012, and some of the events will take place in other locations scattered throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics. The first Olympics were held in 1964.
If your reservation for flights and accommodation for 2020 was made before the postponement was announced, you might find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary between them, however most of the cancellation policies related to the coronavirus, at the end of March 2020, do not arrive until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
It is expected that the cost of most tickets for events will be between 2,500 Â¥ and 130,000 Â¥, while normal tickets will cost about 7,000 Â¥.
Stretching wet clothes can make drying easier. Many hotels offer the use of iron and ironing board, even if they are not present in the room.
If you do not have an iron, or if you do not like to wear ironed socks, you can try with a hair dryer, if you have it available.
Be careful not to subject tissues to too high temperatures, to avoid restrictions or, in the worst case scenario, burns.
There are various ways to sanitate water and some of these are more effective against specific risks.
In some areas it is enough to boil water for a minute, in others it takes many minutes.
The effectiveness of the filters is variable, for this reason in case of doubts it is appropriate to evaluate the purchase of water packaged inside sealed bottles from a reliable company.
Travellers may come into contact with animal parasites that are not widespread in their regions of origin.
Parasites can damage food, cause irritation or, in the worst case scenario, cause allergic reactions, as well as transmit poison or infections.
The same infectious diseases and dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force are not usually qualified as harmful animals.
Duty Free purchases are an opportunity to buy duty-free and excise-free products in certain locations.
Travelers to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a lot, especially on products such as alcohol and tobacco.
The section of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh motorway between Point Marion and Fairmont is the one that presents the most difficult driving conditions, as it often crosses isolated areas between the vegetation.
If you do not have the habit of driving on country roads, it is recommended to keep your eyes open, as steep slopes, narrow streets and narrow curves prevail.
The speed limits shown are significantly lower than those applied in the previous and subsequent sections (normally 35-40 mph / 56-64 km/h). Their strict compliance is extremely important.
Strangely, however, in this area, the level of coverage of mobile phone service is much higher than in other sections of the route, for example in Pennsylvania Wilds.
The German sweets are quite good and in Bavaria they are quite tasty and varied, similar to those of the nearest Austria to the south.
Fruit cakes are an unstoppable classic, from those with apples available all year round to those with cherries and plums, which make their appearance during the summer.
Several German baked cakes also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. The most popular cakes are often accompanied very well by a strong cup of coffee.
If you want to taste sweets that are small but rich in flavor, you can focus on those that, depending on the region, are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish prepared with herbs and spices combined with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be presented both "dry" and "wet", depending on the amount of liquid contained.
In northern India and Pakistan, curries in the hinterland regions usually use yogurt; in southern India and in some other coastal region of the subcontinent coconut milk is more used.
Given the presence of 17,000 islands to choose from, the term Indonesian cuisine is a generic term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines that meet in the country.
However, when used without further specification, the term generally refers to foods originating in the central and eastern part of the main island, Java.
The Japanese cuisine, now widely spread throughout the archipelago, offers a series of simple dishes; its predominant flavors are given by the use of peanuts, peppers, sugar (especially Japanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The brackets are supports for the rider's feet and are hung on both sides of the saddle.
They guarantee more stability to the rider but may present security problems for the chance that the rider's feet will be blocked.
If a ghost is thrown by a horse but has a foot embedded in the bracket, he could be dragged by the horse that escapes. To minimize this risk, there are some safety measures that can be taken.
First, most riders wear riding boots equipped with heel and a smooth and rather thin sole.
Later some saddles, especially the English ones, have inserted safety bars, which cause a leather bracket to pull off the saddle when, in the event of a fall, the rider pulls it back.
CochamÃ³ Valley: the most important climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, where there are a large number of huge granite walls and cliffs.
Peaks of peaks include breathtaking views. Scalators from every part of the world continually trace new paths on its potentially endless walls.
Snow sports, like skiing and snowboarding, are very common and include snowslides thanks to the use of skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
Skiing is one of the main tourist activities and boasts multiple enthusiasts, sometimes also called "ski booms" (the skiers), which devote whole periods of holiday to skiing in a particular area.
The beginning at the base of the ski is very ancient: the first rock paintings with the representation of humans descending back to 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport had its origins at least in the 17th century; in 1861 the first recreational ski club in Australia was opened by the Norwegians.
Hiking on skis: the activity is also called off-road skiing, mountaineering or hiking on skis.
It is connected, even if it usually doesn't include them, to skiing tours or skiing, which are practiced on sloppy terrain and require much more rigid skis and boots.
Think of the ski slope as a path similar to that of hiking.
If the conditions are good, you can cover distances in some way more than those traveled by walking, but only very rarely you will reach the cross-country skiing speeds without a heavy backpack on steep slopes.
Europe is a relatively small continent but formed by many independent countries. Normally, to travel through more countries you would need to apply for a visa and pass through passport control several times.
However, in this respect, the Schengen area functions rather as a single country.
If you stay inside this area, you can normally go from one border to another without having to cross passport controls again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for visas for individual Member States, thus saving time, money and bureaucracy.
There is no universal definition of what makes a artifact a piece of antique. Some tax agencies consider it an object that is at least 100 years old.
The definition differs geographically from the age limit which may be lower, as in the case of North America compared to Europe.
Craft items could be defined as antiques, although more recent than similar items produced in series.
The breeding of the reindeer is an important source of livelihood for the SÃ¡mi and the culture on which this trade is based is also the basis of many other professions.
Even over time, not all SÃ¡mi have been involved in the breeding of large-scale reindeer; some lived in fishing, hunting and similar activities, using the reindeer mainly as working animals.
Today many SÃ¡mi carry out modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in SÃ¡mmi, the territory of the SÃ¡mi.
Although widely used, especially among non-Roma people, the word "gypsy" is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and a misperception of Roma people.
If a travel warning is issued for the destination you are visiting, there may be consequences on your travel health insurance or your insurance in case of cancellation of the trip.
You may also be interested in the opinions of governments other than your own, but keep in mind that such opinions are targeted at the citizens of those governments.
As an example, American citizens in the Middle East may encounter situations different from Europeans or Arabs.
Notices are simply a brief summary of a country's political situation.
The opinions reported are often superficial, generic and simplistic compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
"Adverse weather conditions" is the general expression by which any dangerous weather event that can cause damage, serious social discomfort or loss of human life is indicated.
Extreme weather conditions can occur in every part of the world, and there are different types of weather, depending on geography, topography and weather conditions.
Strong winds, hails, higher than normal rainfall and uncontrolled fires are manifestations and consequences of adverse weather conditions, similar to storms, tornadoes, sea trumpets and cyclones.
Among the meteorological phenomena of high regional and seasonal intensity are the storms, the snow storms, the ice storms and the sand storms.
Travellers are advised to inquire about adverse weather conditions affecting their area, as they may affect the planning of the trip.
Anyone who plans to visit a country that is potentially a war zone must support professional training.
Searching on the Internet 'Course on hostile environments' is likely to find the address of a local company.
A course will normally deal with all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually using practical experience.
A regular course lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing games, as well as many training activities on first aid and sometimes weapons.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in nature are disseminated, while there are few publications dealing with war zones.
Travellers planning surgery to change sex abroad must make sure they have the valid return travel documents with them.
Governments' intention to issue passports with no indication of sex (X) or updated documents to match a desired name and gender is variable.
Equally variable is the willingness of foreign governments to accept such documents.
Security inspections also became much more scrupulous in the post-September 11, 2001 era.
Transgenderers in the pre-operative phase must not expect to pass the controls without their privacy and dignity being compromised.
The currents are made up of the return flow of waves that break down on the beach, often near a coral reef or similar formations.
Given the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in some deeper sections where a strong current can form towards the open sea.
Most deaths occur because of fatigue in trying to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
As soon as you're out of the power, swimming again won't be any harder than normal.
Try to locate an area where you don't risk being trapped again, or consider whether to wait for help, based on your skills and whether you've been sighted.
The return shock manifests itself in a shorter time than the cultural shock (as it is a smaller "sweet moon" phase), it lasts longer and can be more serious.
Travellers who have found it easy to adapt to the new culture sometimes find it difficult to adapt to the culture of their country of origin.
When you return home after living abroad, you will be adapted to the new culture and you will have lost some of the uses of your culture of origin.
In the first experience abroad, it is likely to have met patient and understanding people, aware that travellers in a new country need to adapt.
Many people did not imagine patience and awareness were necessary even for those returning home.
The spectacle of the pyramid's sounds and lights is the more interesting there is in the area for children.
Before the beginning of the show, it will be possible to admire the pyramids immersed in darkness and silence.
Usually you always hear the noise caused by tourists and sellers. The show of sounds and lights is just like a book of stories.
The Sphinx becomes the background and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are projected on the pyramids and each pyramid is illuminated.
Claimed by several countries, the southern Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, have the highest number of bases, sixteen of which were active in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. King George Island is the largest and is home to the town of Villa Las Estrellas.
Among the other islands are Livingston Island and Deception; in the latter, the caldera of a volcano still active filled with water from origin to a magnificent natural port.
The land of Ellsworth is the region to the south of the peninsula and overlooks the sea of Bellingshausen.
Here the mountains of the peninsula merge into the plateau, then re-emerge and form the mountains of Ellsworth, a 360 km chain cut in two by the Minnesota glacier.
The northern part, known as the Sentinella Chain, boasts the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which reaches 4892 m with Mount Vinson.
In remote areas, without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone can be the only possible alternative.
A satellite phone is not usually a substitute for a mobile phone, because to call you have to find yourself outdoors with the visual clears up to the satellite.
The service is often used by pleasure boats, including pleasure boats, as well as missions that need data and voice at a distance.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide you with more information about connecting to this service.
One of the increasingly popular options among those who plan to take a sabbatical year is to travel and learn.
It is particularly widespread among newly graduated students, since they can take a year before starting university without compromising their education.
In many cases enrolling in a course abroad in the sabbatical year can effectively increase the chances of returning to higher education after returning to their country of origin.
Registration for these educational programs usually requires the payment of a fee.
Finland is the ideal destination for those who love to sail. In the "Terra dei mille laghi" there are also thousands of islands, inside the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
There is no need for a yacht for archipelagos and lakes.
Although coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are certainly large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is Finland's national pastime, where one boat is counted every seven or eight people.
This is also the case in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but in general it is a rather unique fact (e.g. in the Netherlands the ratio is one to forty).
Most of the different Baltic cruises include a stay of several days in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that it is possible to visit the historic town for two whole days, returning to the ship in the evening to sleep.
A separate visa (starting from 2009) will not be required for the descent to the ground using the on-board excursions.
Some brochures also offer cruises in Berlin, Germany. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not located near the sea, besides the visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can frighten people of all ages and any condition, especially if they have never flown before or had some traumatic experience.
There is nothing to be ashamed of: it is not dissimilar to the fears and personal aversions that many people manifest toward other things.
For some people to understand a little 'how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can prove useful to overcome a fear based on what is unknown, or on not having control.
The couriers are well paid to deliver products quickly. Often the timing is very important in the case of business documents, goods or spare parts for urgent repair.
For some routes larger companies use their own aircraft, but for other routes and in the case of smaller companies problems arose.
On some routes, air shipments would have taken days for unloading and customs.
The only way to get it to you faster would be to send it as a hold baggage. And this is where you come into play, since airline regulations do not allow you to ship baggage without a passenger.
To fly in first class or in business class the most obvious way is to pay off a good amount for privilege (or, even better, to convince your company to do so).
However, the price to be paid is high: indicatively, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economic rate for business trips and up to eleven times the rate for those in first class!
In general, direct flights from A to B are not even worth looking for discounts on first class or business class seats.
Airlines are well aware that there is a category of travellers willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of arriving quickly and comfortably at their destination, and therefore apply certain rates.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau and the local language is Romanian. However, Russian is also widespread.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has been the scene of ethnic conflict in the past.
In 1994, the conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, with its own government and currency, but not recognized by any UN member country.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic relations between these two areas of Moldova have been restored.
The predominant religion in Moldova is the Christian Orthodox religion.
Smirne is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of about 3.7 million; it is the second largest port after Istanbul and an important transport crossroads.
The ancient town of Smirne is built on a huge bay, surrounded by mountains and is currently a modern, evolved and active shopping centre.
Although in the city there is an atmosphere more similar to that of Mediterranean Europe than that of traditional Turkey, the wide avenues, the buildings with glass facades and the modern shopping centers are dotted with characteristic red tile roofs, the market of the eighteenth century and ancient mosques and churches.
In the village of Haldarsvik you can enjoy beautiful views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and you can visit a unique octagonal church.
In the sacred church, on some of the tombs, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves.
Half an hour is enough to walk around the charming village.
To the north is the romantic and enchanting town of Sintra, easily reachable. It has become famous in the eyes of foreigners thanks to the brilliant tale of its splendors written by Lord Byron.
The bus line Scotturb 403 regularly connects with Sintra, and stops at Cabo da Roca.
Also to the north, visit the great sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (place of worship), a place of famous Marian apparitions all over the world.
Remember that the site you are visiting is basically a mass grave, and has an almost incalculable meaning for an important part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women who survived these places, and many others who have seen their loved ones murdered or made work to the death, whether Jews or not.
Treat the place with all the dignity, seriousness and respect it deserves. Avoid jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Avoid distorting these places by hugging the structures with signs or graffiti.
In the city of Barcelona the official languages are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, the vast majority are able to understand it; Spanish is known to virtually all.
However, most of the signs are written exclusively in Catalan, which is by law the first official language.
Spanish, however, is also widely used for public transport and other services.
In the metro, regular ads are only in Catalan. Any unscheduled service interruptions are communicated in a wide variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese, thanks to an automatic system.
The Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude and presumptuous.
Although it is often just an imprecise stereotype, the best way to get well in Paris remains to behave at the best, relating as a "well-bred" (well-educated) person, which will definitely facilitate your journeys.
The harsh outward appearance of the Parisians will fade quickly if you make the point of some basic good manners.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is rich in woods, mainly beech, fish and fir, and is characterized by a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Thanks to a multiplicity of microclimates, soils and different altitude levels, it has a wide variety of plant communities.
The area also hosts a huge variety of animal species and birds.
Rare species such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wild cat and cedar rooster live in these places, along with several other more widespread animal species.
When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts covering their knees and to cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries offer stole for unprepared women, but if you already have one, especially if in bright colors, you will earn a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear long pants all the way under their knees.
These can also be borrowed from the warehouse at the entrance; however, the clothes are not washed after each user, so wearing these skirts you might not feel comfortable. For men, a unique size for everyone!
Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil everywhere.
Pa amb Oli is a simple popular dinner, typical of the summer season: bread with olive oil, tomato and all the seasonings available, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, in addition to the pronoun "Sie" used for the form of courtesy that stands for "Lei", always start with the capital, even if they appear in the middle of a sentence.
This represents an important mechanism for distinguishing certain verbs and complements.
This aspect probably also facilitates reading, although the need to understand whether a verb or adjective is used in a substantial form makes writing rather complex.
The Italian pronunciation is relatively simple since most words are spoken as they are written.
The main letters to which to pay attention are c and g, since their pronunciation changes according to the following vowel.
Also make sure to pronounce in a different way "r" and "rr": dear means beloved, while carriage means carriage.
The Persian has a relatively simple grammar and most of the time regular.
Therefore, reading this basic grammar manual could help you a lot with Persian grammar and understanding phrases.
It goes without saying that if you already know a novel language, learning Portuguese will be easier.
However, people with minimal knowledge of the Spanish language can come to the hasty conclusion that Portuguese is quite similar and therefore should not be studied separately.
Usually today, premodern observers are obsolete and serve as museums or educational places.
Since light pollution in their golden period was not a problem as it is today, they are usually located in cities or campuses, more easily reachable than those built in modern times.
Most modern telescopes for research are huge structures in areas where the weather is favourable.
The admiration of cherry blossoming, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated in China, where plum blossoming was preferred.
In Japan, the first celebrations for cherry blossoming were organized by the emperor only for himself and for other members of the aristocracy near the imperial court.
Plants do their best when they are in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to take "only" a specimen.
If you visit an Italian garden, even collecting some specimens of plants will cost you the removal from this place, without discussion.
In general, Singapore is a very safe and easy-to-turn city; you can buy virtually anything once you arrive.
But being in the "high tropics", only a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to reckon with the heat (always) and the strong sun (more rarely, when the sky is serene).
Some buses are also heading north toward Hebron, the traditional place where the patriarchs of the Bible Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives were buried.
Make sure that the bus you want to take reaches the interior of Hebron and does not stop at the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
The inland watercourses can be a great theme around which to organize a holiday.
For example you can visit the castles in the Loire Valley and the Rhine Valley, you can take a cruise to visit the interesting cities of the Danube or you can sail on the Erie Canal.
In addition, they define the paths of hiking trails and well-known cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important festivals of Christianity and celebrates the birth of Jesus.
Much of the traditions associated with this festival have also been adopted by non - believers in Christian countries and non - Christians around the world.
A tradition is to spend the night of Easter staying awake in an outdoor place in order to admire the dawn.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations at the basis of this tradition, but it could well be a pre-Christian ritual linked to spring and fertility.
In the more traditional Churches a Easter vigil is often celebrated on the Sabbath night of Easter weekend, with congregations that often begin the ceremony at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands reached us swimming, flying or floating.
Because the distance from the continent was considerable, mammals could not cope with the journey. This made the giant turtle the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Many mammals such as goats, horses, cows, rats, dogs and cats were introduced to the Galapagos after the arrival of the man.
If you visit the territories of the Arctic or the Antarctic during the winter, it will be possible to experience the polar night, when the sun remains under the horizon.
This phenomenon offers the possibility to attend the northern dawn, because the sky remains dark almost all day.
Since the territories are sparsely populated, light pollution is often not a problem and you can also enjoy the stars.
In Japan, the culture of work is more hierarchical and formal than that to which Westerners tend to be accustomed.
Office clothing is normally made up of a jacket and tie or tailor and is addressed to colleagues with a last name or professional title.
The harmony of the workplace is of crucial importance, as it gives importance to the group's commitment rather than commending individual achievements.
Workers often have to receive the welfare of their superiors over every decision, and they are expected to follow instructions without asking questions.
