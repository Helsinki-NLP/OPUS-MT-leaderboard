The Prague Stock Exchange at the close of the market had a negative collapse.
After the morning collapse, the Prague Stock Exchange restored the losses.
The transactions of the CEZ actions have reached almost half of the day-to-day trade.
Since the beginning of Tuesday, the Prague Stock Exchange has resumed from the day before it was almost 6%.
Behind this downfall is the collapse of shares on Wall Street.
Thus, also from us, there is a reaction of the market to the result of the vote of the House of Representatives in America, which has refused to support the plan of stabilization of the local financial sector.
Collapse of actions in Asia
Tuesday the actions of the Asian Stock Exchanges have experienced a dramatic collapse, although the indices, however, during the day have subsequently erased some of the losses.
The Hang Seng index of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange during the day cancelled almost 4%, but later also a part of the losses stabilizing at 2.5%.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which follows the Chinese stock movement on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, fell by 3.8% while the markets in Shanghai were closed.
Stocks at the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than 5%, but in the end losses were 4.3%.
The Thay-Wan Stock Exchange, according to the local index, fell by 3.6%.
"The planning of the rescue action is uncertain and this will influence the financial markets around the world," said the head of the Hong Kong currency office Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, despite being a part of China, manages financial policy on its own, so it does not depend on the Central Bank.
Hong Kong has interest rates at the same level as the United States.
American legislators, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, should quickly return to dialogue and approve the proposal for financial support.
Otherwise there is a risk that other countries will also be affected by the consequences.
U.S. actions destroyed
On Monday, the US Parliament rejected the financial system's support plan, for which $700 billion (almost 12 billion Czech kroner) had to be allocated.
The legislators have thus ignored President Bush's call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
On Monday, the American shares experienced a massacre and the main indices of the shares recorded the biggest collapse since more than twenty years.
The Dow Jones index fell by almost 7% and a similar collapse was observed the last time in 1987.
The index was down before the vote, but as soon as it was seen that the bill was not approved, it fell free.
Congress has yielded: the U.S. government can lend $700 billion to banks.
The highest representatives of the American Congress and the government of President George W. Bush agreed on a broader form of an understanding of economic support for the American financial system.
The vote will take place at the beginning of next week.
U.S. legislators broke the ice in the dialogue on approving the bailout plan in the form of economic aid for the U.S. financial system for a total of $700 million (almost 12 billion kroner).
But it's not said yet.
Congress representatives must therefore define some details of the agreement before publishing the final form of the law and voting on it.
The financial system support plan will be discussed on Monday on the territory of the House of Representatives.
On Sunday he told Reuters, the chairman of the Banking and Financial Services Committee in the Barney Frank room.
In the Senate, according to some sources, one could vote on the plan probably not before Monday.
According to the economies, the announcement that the financial plan will be approved should be the first and fundamental psychological factor capable of awakening the financial markets.
But then we will have a return to reality because of the complexity of the mechanisms by which, in practice, market aid can be achieved.
Paulson: the Plan must be effective
"We've taken a big step forward."
"We have clarified our different views on the form of the presentation of the market stabilization package," Democratic Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
According to the same , the final vote could still take place on Sunday .
Delegates of legislators met on the night between Saturday and Sunday with US finance minister Henry Paulson, to give final form to the government's financial funds.
These funds should be used to acquire non-transferable mortgage assets from financial companies, which lead financial firms to serious losses and endanger the stability of the entire system.
"We are in compliance with the final agreement of the plan that will work and that must also be effective on the market."
"It is necessary to carry on the recovery plan, but I think we have done so," said Paulson.
The Asian Trade Signal
The global financial crisis is heavily on the markets for actions that are suddenly falling apart.
According to Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid, legislators are trying to reach a final agreement at Congress even before Sunday.
In other words, they want to calm investors before trade in Asian financial markets, which are, in order of time, the first to influence the Monday market as a result of Congress's decision.
But for now it is definitely not clear when the two Houses of the American Congress will vote the law and even if the negotiations can stop at the last moment on some problem.
The legislators hope that it will be approved in the next few days.
But the law will still undergo many changes.
The total amount foreseen for the support of the system must be divided into two parts.
The first $350 billion must be available as soon as possible as President George Bush asked.
But Congress can block the allocation of the rest of the sum in case it will have the impression that the program does not perform its function, blocking the next $100 billion and after the 350 finals.
Bush appreciated the progress in the negotiations.
Although the President can veto this decision, Congress can overstep its veto right.
Despite these changes, the basic thinking of the program has remained, i.e. to obtain the finances to buy the passive mortgage values, whose price has collapsed due to hundreds of thousands of Americans who are unable to pay their mortgages.
"We've worked everything out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the Sunday Law and the Senate Monday," as the Republican Senator mentioned.
The American President Bush is also pleased with the progress made in the negotiations.
His spokesman Tony Fratto said that Bush is pleased with Saturday's positive development and appreciates "the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy."
Restriction of gold parachute
The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee Christopher Dodd, the main spokesman, said that the legislators agreed on the responsibility of the financial programme, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the closure of the budget of reductions, the breakdown of the financial plan.
The new law must also limit the so-called gold parachutes for managers of companies participating in the program and is creating a committee that will control the funds.
These should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard and we have made a great step forward towards the agreement that will work and will be useful for the market and also for all Americans," said Paulson.
The plan relies on the help of homeowners who have problems with payments.
The government should negotiate the new mortgage rates that it will buy with the aim of lowering monthly charges on the installments for debtors and will allow it to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological support
The proposed plan is, according to the main economist of Patria Finance, David Marek, a good idea but its realization will be very difficult.
"And that's because we don't know how and for what price the problematic assets will be bought
This will determine how losses will be divided between the financial sector and the government," Marek said for the iHNed.cz website this week.
Whether the plan will be approved now or at the beginning of next week is not, according to Marek, so fundamental.
"Much more important, it is that already this week the congressional representatives find agreement on the support of this plan and that they baptize it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of this agreement that will be approved is most important at this time, " stressed Marek.
Last blood duel: MP3 players against mobile phones
We will advise how to choose
While almost every mobile phone can read MP3 files, no MP3 player can call.
From this it is clear that it is better to buy only the phone.
Despite this, there are many reasons why you should get an independent reader.
The choice depends entirely on the method of use and the needs of the future owner.
Perhaps you would hardly buy yourself a expensive high-quality turntable to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
First of all these musical products do not come out as LP and from a qualitative point of view there is no objective reason for this.
If, however, hard-rock, jazz or blues vinyls are crowded on your shelves, a turntable like that at least you dream about it.
It also works with portable music, i.e. compressed music or simply in MP3 format.
Here too there are price and quality categories.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend on an 8 thousand crown reader, as well as a Pink Floyd fan may hardly digest the 20 crown headphones of the market.
Two extremes between which there is enough room for everyone.
The choice is wide.
The duration of the batteries is to be decided.
Some high-quality music players can do much more than just read the music, but they don't even accidentally do the mobile phones.
There is no other current device as universal as the mobile phone.
Alongside primary functions, calling and texting, you can read music and video, record both and have a camera, sometimes better sometimes worse and maybe you can even navigate.
And if we consider smartphones and handhelds you will also have a miniature computer in your pocket.
It is a small miracle that no refrigerator can make the grill and no television can photograph anything.
The universality of the mobile phone also brings disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your mobile phone and first the indicator on the screen will require the charger.
And reading music consumes a lot of energy.
Few cell phones can read the music for more than twelve hours, usually, and much less.
In this sense the music players (especially the simpler ones) are much more effective.
With regard to uncounted economic mobile phones that can last for more than a few hours.
If you still add us, from time to time, some call, get to work for safety another charger, this also applies to the most expensive devices.
But you won't have this problem with an MP3 player, even the worst ones last at least 9 hours continuously with a charging.
Another problem is when you download the music into your cell phone.
Unfortunately only a limited part of devices has the universal USB port and not all of them can be connected to the computer without special software.
Certainly the music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but only a few memory readers are able to do it without adapter for minicards that are not used in mobile phones.
Readers, with some exceptions (Ipod) do not need any special software.
Just fill the device with music via USB from the computer.
Most mobile phones and readers are created by themselves a multimedia library arranged according to the names of the interpreters, the name of the album, genre or according to the user's classification.
Some devices only reproduce the tree structure of folders, similar to the Explorer tool in Windows, and some can do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Readers are easier to handle, cell phones can do more.
When you choose a particular device you are particularly interested in battery resistance, memory capacity, quality and type of audio outputs and clearly ease of use.
If you need music mostly from the background and if you listen to it every day only briefly on the tram you need a mobile phone that reads MP3.
This now succeeds, clearly to any cell phone.
You don't have to take too much care of what size your phone or player recognizes.
MP3 players all support them, the global majority of the music that comes to you will be in this format.
In addition to this format that belongs to the most common ones, the total majority of devices support music in WMA format.
There is less AAC (format used by Apple and its Ipods).
The best mobile phones also allow, for example, to buy music online.
Simply visit, through the mobile internet network, the corresponding pages of the operator (or another provider) and buy the song or album.
This same service could already be a valid argument to buy a cell phone-reader.
Unfortunately, the operators' offer is poor and is usually limited only to hits of the time of the radio.
The prices are not very low.
But it is generally assumed that precisely this mode of selling music (either via GSM, internet or wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always carry their cell phone behind them.
Anyone who wants to listen to something goes through the pocket while the MP3 player is forgotten at home.
It also depends on this, however, if you always carry behind the headphones or at least the wireless headphone.
If not, you can use the built-in player that almost every mobile phone, but only a small part of MP3 players has.
Perhaps the biggest benefit of cell phones-readers will be, for many, the price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than 3 thousand crowns.
For 3 and 4 thousand crowns you will already buy a very dignified walkman.
Usually, however, you will be limited by the absence of an entrance for common headphones.
The best and technically most equipped mobile phones and also with the 3.5 mm socket for common headphones, cost up to 15,000 crowns.
Instead the advantage of readers is, in addition to others, easy handling.
The simplest ones not necessarily cheaper (see our choice) can really handle them.
The minimum of functions, the similarity of manoeuvring once with the common stereo or maybe the turntable, is obvious.
There is no danger of accidentally hitting the start of the mobile internet network and as a result of a giant bill for data transmission.
Which device to take
Even cheaper mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable memory cards (e.g. M2, microSD, etc.).
Also with regard to the purchase of the respective card, they are included in the 2 000 crowns.
But be careful.
The base models support only cards with the maximum capacity of 2GB.
Only the most expensive ones can even do with 8GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or irivar.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB) you do not have to spend more than 1,100 crowns.
If you're one of the most demanding listeners, you'd rather take specialised mobile phones - walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have individual keys for MP3 and the convenience of the service thus approaches the same MP3 player.
In this field Sony Ericsson made more way, which walkman cell phones have the same scale of use as separately sold MP3 players.
The MP3 players of the above brands provide you with the same service and price category up to 4,000 kroner, but with greater memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery resistance (usually 15 hours, in principle up to 35 hours).
The first virtual operator will reach the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe.
Perhaps the mobile telephony market in the Czech Republic is quite mature and our operators offer practically all services like their partners in Western Europe.
Here, however, something is missing – a virtual operator that forces traditional ones to lower the price.
Maybe he won't be missing for long.
The fact that the Czech operators belong to the most dear ones in Europe has already written many times on Mobil.cz.
In the end, ČTU confirmed this, which pointed out that the price of SMS is higher than in the rest of the Union.
After the European Commission's last steps in the area of regularising roaming charges, perhaps a paradoxical situation will be created - for some customers of Czech mobile operators SMS will cost less from abroad than at home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high in relation to Europe?
The answer is simple, lacks the competition that would really like to start the confrontation.
It may sound absurd, but here we have three mobile networks and a high coverage of over 100 %.
Instead, mobile telophony operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this sense he also often emphasizes the head of the Czech Telecommunications Council (ČTÚ), Pavel Dvořák, who in the past has sometimes expressed that there is no room for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It is perhaps true that the traditional operator with his network is no longer likely to have many possibilities. (Moreover, perhaps it would be difficult to find other frequencies by now).
But there is still another possibility - the virtual operator.
The entry of virtual operators into the market has led to a significant fall in prices, to which traditional operators should have reacted.
At the same time, even before the arrival of sharks like Tesko Mobile and Virgin Mobile in the market, similar voices were resounding in Britain as we have.
It has been shown, however, that there is a place for such operators and that they can really succeed.
In the end, for example, we must not go too far.
In February this year we informed you of the arrival of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year this operator has managed to win over 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest local operator.
At the same time behind Mobilking lies the financial group Penta to which in the Czech Republic belongs, among other things U:fon.
The advantage of virtual operators is the possibility of focusing on a much more concrete group-breath.
In order to be able to function effectively, it is sufficient that many less customers than a traditional operator.
They are not behind, i.e. relatively high costs for the creation, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
So in the world virtual operators usually present themselves at low cost, offer calls and SMS at low price, which is often in balance with the supply of the narrowest services
For example, Tesco Mobile in Great Britain offers text messages that cost at least half of its competitors.
But as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows it can be a pretty good move also the bet on a group-breeding not only recently.
This operator points, so to speak, specifically at men.
"True men choose Mobilking operator that they like and that they can trust," says David Seibertz CEO Mobile Entertainment Company that produces this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether a similar concept can be affirmed by us as in Poland.
The press spokesperson for Vodafone Miroslav Čepický doubts: "The Czech market is relatively small for a fragmented approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition from the point of view of services it is relatively saturated."
In the Czech Republic there is no possibility, mobile network operators say
But it seems almost certain that if there will ever be an operator in the Czech Republic it will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic negotiations do not have much expectations.
Mobilking's ignition will happen rather in the other countries of our area," he said in a telephone dialogue for Mobile.cz Jana Studničková, the press spokesperson for the financial group Penta.
He has thus indirectly confirmed that the current operators in the Czech Republic are not very much in favour of this thought.
On the contrary, try to do everything so that no potential competitor is created.
For some time now, it has not hidden its interest in starting a virtual operator, the GTS Novera group that would like to take another step to become a real competitor of Telefónika O2 in the field of business customers.
"We have great interest in being able to offer our customers not only fixed but also mobile telecommunications services.
And first it gets better.
We have repeatedly negotiated this possibility with all the Czech mobile network operators.
We have already made progress in the negotiations with some of them," says Pavel Kaidl.
So maybe better times will come.
Unofficial information shows that the first virtual operator may have to have it by the end of the year.
But for now around his creation there is an impenetrable wall of silence.
"At this moment we do not believe that there is room in the Czech market for the creation of a full-fledged virtual operator.
The Czech market, unlike other markets, is very specific.
So far no subject with a complex and serious project has addressed us," he mentioned in his statement for Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sršeň of the press section of Telefònika O2.
The specific nature of the Czech market is also used by other operators.
T-Mobil press spokesperson Martina Kemrová adds in a rare agreement with the statement O2: "For now we have not noticed any business projects that are vital and beneficial to both, on which it is possible to continue to build".
He adds: "In the T-Mobil network, a virtual operator will hardly appear by the end of the year.
At this point we had to have a concrete agreement on the table, so that it could be considered on the horizon."
Vodafone focuses its attention rather on achieving its 3G licence requests.
He adds Miroslav Čepický: "We are open to the negotiations of potential virtual operators, especially in the context of the sharing of costs and infrastructure.
We consider this, from the point of view of the customers, to be the most productive.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a common network for fast mobile internet."
Competent authorities - with accomplices
The attitude of mobile operators can be easily understood, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would lead to lower prices and thus lower profits.
Why then facilitate the rise of such a competitor?
The troubles around creation U:fon testify that when operators care about one thing they know how to row on the same side.
Perhaps the great pressure was on ČTU during the period of creation of U:fon towards the company of T-Mobile.
This testifies to public access information from ČTU's websites.
But right now U:fon serves as an argument for not accepting the virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová observed: "The environment of competition in the mobile telephony market has been strengthened little more than anything with the entry of the fourth mobile operator into the market.
With regard to the type of mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that the entry of another competitor would put on him and above all on his high demand services."
However, the complete disinterest on the part of the Czech regulatory bodies is surprising in the attitude of mobile operators.
This is not just the attitude of the ČTU which unfortunately in the Czech Republic - unlike Great Britain and other developed countries - has no competence to interfere in economic competition.
It belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (ÚOHS).
This, however, has taken its typical position with regard to the whole problem.
"The entry of the virtual operator into the mobile telephone market would be possible after the conclusion of the necessary infrastructure rental contract between the mobile operator and the virtual operator had been realized.
No such contract has been concluded so far because the offer of potential buyers has probably not been interesting enough for traditional operators," said Kristián Chalupa, from the External Relations Section UUOHS, in the answer to our question.
Such a statement by the operators' representatives may not be surprising.
Instead, on the part of the office which has to defend the interests of consumers and, in addition, take care that no one takes advantage of its position on the market, it is more than a delicate matter.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "Across the country where virtual operators usually work, we can observe that their entry into the market has contributed to lower prices for mobile telephony services."
But of course the pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and the lowering of prices do not belong to the interests of UOOHS.
Truly shocking in the whole situation is the almost exciting harmony of these three operators resulting from their reactions.
The question as to whether it is really just a coincidence is raised on its own.
Just as the identical price of petrol for all petrols is certainly the result of coincidence and competitive struggle.
"The section has found no signs of anti-competitive behaviour about this fact and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
No operator has a dominant position, so it does not have a corresponding greater responsibility for its behaviour on the market.
The tools needed to open the mobile network market for virtual operators may also be missing from the telecoms regulator," said Chalupa in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of the many controversial points .
Of course, there is the analysis of relevant markets developed by ČTU, according to which telecommunications are the only market from the point of view of economic competition.
In such a market, of course, no Czech operator has a dominant position.
But some legal experts offer another approach - the network operator's agreement is always necessary for the creation of a virtual operator.
And the mobile operator has – at the end of the day logically – the monopoly of its network.
So for a certain portion it has to be dominant by force.
But even if we do not accept this argument, for UUOHS it should be a minimum warning that three mobile operators will proceed in such a strangely similar way.
At the same time, complaints from interested parties (including the mentioned company GTS Novera) show that during negotiations with all operators they encounter very similar obstacles.
Downloading responsibility to ČTU in telecommunications is a fairly frequent trick with which ÚOHS is kept out of the whole thing.
We have already found this in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, it has not been possible to promote the expansion of ČTU's rights in the field of economic competition in telecommunications until the recently approved telecommunications law was updated, despite the fact that, from this, many experts expected the situation to improve.
This fact the representatives of UOOHS must know more than well, but perhaps their interests are elsewhere.
You can do it when no one looks
While we do not realize this, the functioning of these pseudo-virtual operators remains, some of which even exist in the Czech mobile networks.
These are companies that publish their price lists of mobile telephone services but are only partially public.
These are usually the companies that deal with multilevel marketing.
So for example Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and a number of others offer their mobile phone services.
The price lists of these companies usually reach only the pre-established persons.
The magic lies in the fact that the company with respect to the operator appears as a classic business customer, who orders a large amount of SIM card.
As an important customer then receives special price offers (and more).
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit a similar pre-sale.
"If the cases you are talking about, of which we will be interested, could be a breach of contractual conditions, and could lead to the conclusion of cooperation with this company", answered the question in question Martina Kemrová.
But it is unlikely that such an activity would reach the ears of those responsible for mobile operators.
Especially in the cases of the 3 companies mentioned, it can be thousands of customers.
No operator defends himself at the same time from such an attitude.
From the activity of these companies they make a non-indifferent profit and at the same time - unlike the real virtual operators - they are not damaged in any way with their official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický warns about possible problems: "The law allows for similar speculations, however only a negligible percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
They must also accept that the SIM card in their phone is not registered in their name, therefore they cannot have in full of it as the usual customers of mobile phone operators "
But this should be a strange minimum at ČTU.
In addition, another question is opened for UOHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes to such an attitude, why do they block the creation of the virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that UUOHS has sufficient rights to expose similar activities and if it does not want to, it will not have to be satisfied with the explanation of operators who have no idea of all this and that their commercial conditions forbid it.
When we're no longer expensive
As has already been said several times in the text, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile phone market has led to a significant fall in prices for services.
At the same time, in virtually all the countries where operators were born, traditional operators were more or less trying to prevent their creation.
The arguments they used were virtually identical - too small market, too saturated limit, problems with the quality of services, etc.
But in the developed countries precisely in these cases the regulatory bodies have intervened in defence not of mobile operators but of their customers.
Both with formal measurements and with non-formal pressure, then came the creation of the first virtual operator and he was followed by others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies throw each other the whole case like a boiling potato.
From our experience we cannot get rid of the feeling that the lack of clarity of skills in these cases makes it more than comfortable.
But let's not throw in the sponge.
If the backstage information is right and the virtual operator will really appear to us soon, the Czech mobile phone market will get back on the move.
If one of the operators had consented to the creation of a virtual mobile operator only UUOHS could hardly remain impassive to the rejection (discriminate) of the others concerned.
And perhaps we will stop calling at higher prices than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech hymn has four new versions.
Choose the best one
Listen to the four new versions of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented in a solemn manner the new recordings of the national anthem "Kde Domov můj".
The new recording of the hymn was made by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available – solo with male or female voice, choir step and instrumental edition.
The song is directed by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the hymn reviews are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
On iHNed.cz you can listen to all four versions.
Bělohlávek considers the Czech national song one of the most beautiful hymns.
Already before he told the radio "Český rozhlas" that he chose specifically to sing the variants alone, the singers with the most representative young voices, which are expressive and popular.
"From the beginning I tried to be careful that both and the choir, have the clear diction, that the text is well understandable, that they are in harmony," he said.
Then the national anthem will celebrate next year's 175th anniversary.
The song "Kde Domov můj" was played for the first time in 1834 on the stage of the Stavovskéh divadlo in the original work Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl accompanied by the music of František Škroupa.
It has acquired popularity and people have spontaneously made it their own.
The first stanza of the song after the founding of Czechoslovakia in 1918 then became the natural part of the national anthem.
It remained one of the seven national symbols even after the birth of the autonomous Czech Republic.
How does the "new" hymn sound
Wednesday MHD Prague will accompany you for the first time also with an electronic card
Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will be written in the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date on which the first passengers who will have an electronic card in their pocket in the metro, tram and bus will get on board.
At this moment it can be provided about one hundred thousand people who own their Opencard card.
Passengers can buy the 30- and 90-day and annual one (which will start from January 1, 2009) and at the same time have their card recharged in the Infopoints and offices of the Transport Company and at the metro station Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
The coupons can be purchased from yesterday on the Internet at the Transport Company page www.dpp.cz.
More than four hundred customers took advantage of the service before the afternoon.
Those who will start using the Internet service can completely forget the doors at the metro stops where so far they had to file long files for paper tickets.
The cutting is purchased via internet and on the Opencard it is recharged on one of the twelve branches of the Municipal Library.
"In these places the passengers have at their disposal a desk with trained personnel that will help interested in the purchase on the internet and will also register on their card the acquired credit." said the spokesman of the project Martin Opatrný.
In addition to the libraries it will be possible to load the electronic coupons on the Opencards in ATM and selfservice that are installed at the entrances of the metro.
How are these ATMs?
They are red, similar to ticket obliterators and passengers have already noticed them at the Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská metro stops.
"There are now five in the whole city but by the end of the year there should be eighty," said Opatrný.
The cutter will be checked instead by the driver from the ATM.
The ATM service that will work from tomorrow is very simple.
Simply insert the Opencard card and after payment of the cutting, it will load on it.
The electronic cards are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
That is in the urban lines of trains and buses from 300 to 499, which the inhabitants of the municipalities of Central Bohemia take to reach the capital.
"In the added trains in the integrated transports of Prague there are the controllers with the readers of the cards with which they verify the temporal and zonal validity," explained the mode of control of the Filip tickets by the organization Ropid, which develops the schedules of the collective transports of Prague.
Urban buses have card readers integrated into the driver's box.
During the climb it is therefore necessary not only to show the magnetic card to the driver, but also to support the Opencard at the point determined next to the case.
So the driver checks the validity of the loaded coupons.
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the loaded coupons, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this type of information," added Drápal.
Passengers who take urban buses and will not remember, when the validity of the cutting, can again go to the self-service ATMs, where they load the cutters on the paper.
Here you will see the information on the validity of their documents on the screen of the device.
The Germans of the South wanted a referendum from the USA
The Germans of the Sudeten in 1945 asked to include Šumava in the United States.
This is the result of the letter deposited in the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live under the patronage of the United States.
With this desire, according to what is said, some groups of Germans from the South have turned in 1945 to the President of the United States.
This results above all from the letter kept in a private archive and today deposited in the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
The Germans of Český Krumlov ask in the letter to the American president not to allow again the return of the "district of Šumava" – occupied by Hitler according to the Munich agreement – to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation and want to be sure of the promises that American units will arrive in German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," is written in the letter signed with the words "People who care for the destiny of Šumava with all their heart".
Because, they say, the annexation to Czechoslovakia – knowing the Czech national character – gives the Germans of the Sudeten only hope to brutality, lack of respect, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter pray the American president to assume the protectionate over Šumava now and always.
"We cannot believe that without respect for the opinion of a quarter of a million inhabitants, you would recognize this territory as a foreign state to us, that oppresses and eradicates ethnic minorities and has not contributed at all, at all, to the victory of the Allies," it says in the letter.
The reason the authors cannot sign it is the alleged fear of revenge by the "Czech oppressors".
If the president of the USA were to doubt the conviction of the Germans of Šumava, it would be enough to organize in the district a referendum on the will of its inhabitants to become part of the USA or live under the control of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may seem naive with our knowledge of the history of the postwar period, according to some witnesses it describes in an appropriate way the expectations of the Germans of the Sudetenians at that time.
Even if the Czech Germans had to at least understand that it would be about their move from the republic, only a few of them fully admitted such a possibility.
Some expected the United States and Great Britain to negotiate a kind of autonomy for the peoples of the South.
Others believed that they would simply remain in Czechoslovakia.
This is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice.
He was mobilized during the war as a German of Budějovice in the maritime power of the Baltic Sea.
When at the end of the war he was captured by the British and put in the prison camp at Holštýn, the dozens of other Czech Germans went to visit him for the Czech to teach him.
"These thought that when he returned home the Czech would make him comfortable," Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners, who lived in Czechoslovakia, counted on the fact that on the basis of Beneš' decrees they would be moved from the Republic.
You don't think you'll pay!
Emotional campaign will attack drivers
The most expensive action in Czech history aimed at road safety.
Even so we could define the emotional media campaign, which the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday.
The office of Minister Aleš İebíček, expects this to discourage drivers from dangerous driving behaviour.
The 150 million campaign will appear on television, radio, cinema, internet but also on flyers.
It should discourage drivers from driving fast and under the influence of alcohol at the wheel.
And remind him to put his belt on before he leaves.
He wants to touch in the consciousness especially young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and not for the last professional drivers.
What will appear in the spots?
Especially stories of people who will affect emotions.
And this is also borne out by the "bloody" slogan of the whole campaign:
You don't think you'll pay!
The word "don't think" is written in capital letters on the plate.
And in a pool of blood there's the word "you'll pay."
This must symbolize that a person can in a moment of distraction pay with his life.
The spots will "frighten" viewers until 2010.
The Ministry has been inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where images with drastic scenes of accident victims can be seen.
This promises to lower the number of accidents and deaths on Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
Carrots and canes for drivers
"The carrot and stick system works with drivers.
The carrot for them is for example when they pass with red and thus save time.
The stick is the danger of a fine or an accident.
We must remember the risk to the drivers, " says the psychologist of the Ministry of Transport Martin Kořán of Na Homolce Hospital.
And so we need information campaigns in the press and especially negative advertising, the psychologist believes.
According to him, the panels that warn drivers of danger are already less effective.
"If the fixed panel warning of danger has been installed, it will probably soon be confused with the environment and the drivers will no longer pay attention to it," warns Kořán.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
The Prime Minister of the Provisional Israeli Government Ehud Olmert spoke out for the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, that is also the borders of Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace between Palestinians and Syrians.
So he said in the dialogue he published on Monday, the daily Jediot Achronot.
"We have to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) areas, if not all," Olmert told the daily.
"We will have a certain percentage of these territories but to the Palestinians we will have to leave the same percentage (of the Israeli zones), because without this there will be no peace," he added.
He admitted that the eventual return would also include East Jerusalem .
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and above all does not want the raspberries to pass on to him, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up a part of Jerusalem," Olmert noted in reference to the two attacks of July in the city, during which some people were killed and dozens of injured people.
According to the premier it will be necessary to find "a particular solution for the Temple Mountain, the sacred and historical places," which are inside the Old City. .
"He who wishes to maintain Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will have to make up 270 000 Arabs.
This will not work," he stressed.
Withdrawal from Golan Heights
Olmert also spoke out for Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which he said was the essential condition for concluding this peaceful agreement with Syria.
But that would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose the conclusion of peace with Syria solely on the basis of the withdrawal from Golan," he warned.
"The Syrians know well what they will have to give up to get the Golan Heights.
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with the Hizbollahs (the Shiite movement); they will have to give up their permanent support, which they offer to Hamas terrorism, (the Shiite movement) of Al-Qaida (the terrorist network) and Jihad (the holy war) in Iraq," said the prime minister.
Questions after the accident: Are stewards illegal in buses?
The law does not recognize them, you cannot walk on the bus that makes long-distance routes
In the context of the tragic accident near the Italian city of Padua of the bus company Student Agency came out the question whether stewards and passengers can move on board the bus during the race.
"If we want to respect the laws strictly and formally, the steward's activity is in conflict with the law of road traffic," says the spokesman for the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
The accident of last week with which a 22.-year-old hostess lost her life was caused by a truck that cut the road by the bus.
Unfortunately, the girl was sitting next to the driver in the less secure place of the bus, despite the fact that there were still two other seats.
But the bus can make an accident or stop abruptly even at the time of distribution of coffee or newspapers.
Depends on whether or not the bus is equipped with standing places according to the traffic log.
If passengers are not approved, they should be seated.
The buses of Student Agency have not stood up, confirmed it to the site Aktuáln.cz the director of the company Radim Jančura.
"We evaluated this with the Ministry and at the beginning did not allow the movement of passengers on the bus.
After it was revoked and we concluded that passengers can use the bathroom during the race if they have the assigned seat," he expressed his point of view.
The law doesn't recognize the steward.
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the steward's role – no law deals with the regularization of this role."
However, no regulation prohibits the transporter from performing the services.
The law of road traffic recognizes only the accompanying term of the vehicle, its rights and duties are not defined," adds less clearly the spokesman Hanzelka.
The director of the Department of Road Traffic of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorný believes, instead, that the law deals enough with this issue.
Depends on whether the bus has approved standing positions.
That's all," he says.
It categorizes buses in urban areas where there are standing places and maximum limited speed, interurbans with standing places with higher maximum speed and long-distance without standing places with maximum speed allowed and seats equipped with safety belts.
As on the plane, says the expert.
The expert BESIP on road safety Jaroslav Hořín does not find the underlying problem in the movement of stewards on board the bus.
"During a quiet race there are not many dangers, the situation can be compared to the service on the planes.
Nor is it safe there when a turbulence arrives and the flight attendant can hit his head."
"If the bus makes a sudden stop obviously the laws of physics are worth it.
Same as in the city bus or on the tram.
The carrier company must solve the safety of stewards by means of an internal regulation," she says and also understands that, from the point of view of the law, the issue is not solved.
Jančura is willing to suspend the services.
Student Agency is the only transport company that offers the services of stewards..
This takes about two hundred.
The director does not consider their job to be dangerous even after the accident.
"As soon as I feel I have to consider the steward's profession as dangerous work, I will abolish it.
Passengers can receive coffee and newspapers as they go up.
It would also reduce expenses," he says.
The director of Asiana Alexej Litvin, who manages a fraction of lines compared to Student Agency, has motivated the absence of stewards on his means as an interest in security.
"We have no hostess, we have already opposed from the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end with a fatal accident," said less than a year ago Týden.cz.
A huge tragedy has occurred.
In the accident of the line for Naples, a young hostess of the Plzeň region died, who had worked for the company for two years.
A Slovenian truck probably left the emergency lane without using the arrow and blocked the road to the bus.
The bus driver tried to avoid it with a sudden maneuver, but hit it with the right front.
Jančura rejects the fact that the two posts reserved for stewart rest had been occupied.
"It is not possible to reserve these places in long-haul buses, they are inaccessible."
The company has in mind to denounce the driver of the truck.
The agency will not wait for the Court's ruling to pay the damage to the girl's family, but expects financial compensation from the culprit.
The review of the law?
Not in view
The revision of the law, on which a group of 30 experts of the Ministry of Transport has been working for more than a year, could lead to the clarification of the movement of stewarts on board buses.
"They did not achieve any concrete results, however.
They do not consider them so much buses, they take more care of the scoring system, maximum speed on the highway and use of the mobile during driving," says expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not regard stewart activity as a major threat to passenger safety," concludes Havelka, spokesman, "that the control of bus safety is the responsibility of the police and the security offices.
Düsseldorf's hopes point to Frankfurt
There is no shortage of words in the letter from the WestLB director addressed to the employees of the house.
In the letter published Monday that could form "the center of the capital market of the financial group of savings banks" through the meeting of units of the bank institution of Düsseldorf with the Deka-Bank of Frankfurt.
West LB would launch a "competent block" with lasting profits in such a company.
Moreover, any such union could be a decisive step towards further links in the Länder banking sector.
Thus it is read, when a board of directors in difficult times wants to demonstrate the capacity for action.
Because the afflicted WestLB is still under heavy pressure.
Not only on the part of the EU Commission, but also through the National Authority for Financial Supervision, having pointed out a long time ago to the regional government of North Rhine-Westphalia that time is required to look for a future solution.
The links between Deka-Bank, which the same clients of the Savings Bank because of their investment funds already know, and WestLB has certainly been talking about this for quite some time, even from Frankfurt.
At the end of August the head of Deka-Bank Franz Waas reported at the time of the presentation of the first half of the year's turnover that a merger of the house at via Magonza with a national bank such as Helaba or West LB makes no sense.
But the board of directors of Deka, which is half carried by regional banks and savings banks consortia, has delegated the board of directors to conduct talks with West LB on joint contracts.
This could be about market negotiations or parts of them.
But the conversations have, as they say in the business square, just begun.
Of Deka-Bank, with its 3000 employees it is one of the most important in the business square in Frankfurt, it is not discussed the first time when it comes to consolidating the sector of savings banks.
In 2003 for a short period it seemed that Deka-Bank could merge with the regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate and Helaba.
Nothing was done about this three-way association.
As soon as the projects were published, the regional bank of Asia was opposed to Helaba's participation.
The remaining two institutions have also proved unable to reach an agreement.
The Rhineland-Palatinate regional bank instead went to the Baden-Württemberg regional bank in Stuttgart.
Yet they have always thought about a merger of Deka-Bank with regional banks.
But in the end Günther Merl, president of the Helaba Board of Directors, spoke against design games to meet with his home.
Apart from this it seems that knowledge is created, that it is necessary to approach the different houses of the public sector.
Since the election of the Bavarian Parliament has passed, a meeting of the Bavarian Landesbank with that of the Baden-Württemberg could first take place.
It's not entirely good news for Helaba.
If it increases the pressure for other mergers, the partners will soon be missing.
In the South now there would be the junior partner, although so far it has overcome the financial crisis much better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
The association of Assia-Turingia savings banks that participates with 85 percent of Helaba, has put the link to the meeting with WestLB.
Only the NordLB would remain
These geo-strategic reasonings are just an account.
On the other hand, there is also the question of how to match the different business models of individual homes.
In June Merl pointed out that the decisive question, with what business model the future of regional banks would be assured, would not yet be answered by the association of German savings banks.
In the end the division of the West LB could also come out, which by that of course is not desired.
Thus the letter of the board of directors expresses the will to aspire in any case to a "general solution".
You will see how the reunification of the single parts with Deka-Bank will work.
THE second weekend of the beer festival is dedicated to Italians
For Elena it is the first time while for Luca it is the third or the fourth.
This time Elena is present at the party as a companion, and so she says everything is different.
Behind them next to the 5l. barrel of the Kaiser brand stands a massive bearded and demonstrates to about 200 travellers what are the deep tones that can produce from the throat.
Elena first gave Luca a bag and after a kiss.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here to the bus parking next to Porta Nuova station, four couriers leave tonight at 23.45 with destination Munich, Festival of Beer" , expected arrival at 6.30.
Three couriers are reserved especially for Italians, in another they travel only Brazilians.
In a corner of the parking lot the South Americans are singing with the flag in hand, having already celebrated during the night.
It's so noisy, Marco says, that it's nothing for Italians.
Marco who wears a long coat with fake fur lining and a pair of glasses with silver-plated wide sticks belong to him the buses.
For five years they've been going to the Oktoberfest, this year it's three tours.
The night walk, the day to the party, back at 10:30.
Spending the night would only create unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The cost of 45 Euro includes the trip, the welcome of the toast with the beer Kaiser, made according to the standards of Bavarian authenticity, the sickness fund and the German guide – Marco attended a German course in Frankfurt.
And so at night the buses leave at the turn of the Brenner.
There's still no beer.
Suddenly the silence falls on the bus, the travellers sleep.
Better yet, they'll still need their strength.
They stop at Bressanone and Holzkirchen, where other buses with Italian plates on the A9 motorway before Munich take a short break.
When, as expected, Marco's group arrives at 6.30 in the parking lot near Theresienwiese, there are already about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather together, Marco explains for the last time the attack program.
First, put on the yellow hat.
On it on the left there is written "Oktoberfest" next to the internet address of Marco's travel agency: "Knowing viaggiando.it".
Second: "When I open the doors of the beer tendon it means running!", quotes Marco of the first morning.
"Run!" Run and occupy the seats at the bottom of the tent.
"Not in front, without blocking, and not all the yellow hats sitting on the same benches, divide into the adjacent space!"
The mouthpiece costs 8.25 Euro, screams Marco.
And don't forget to tip.
"Prove to the security service that we behave well!
As soon as you leave the seats, they disappear!"
Third: "We meet again here tonight at 10:30 p.m.!
We're already leaving for the party.
On the street one attacks as follows the yellow caps to the trees, to the road signs and even to a billboard of a large Bavarian popular party.
You want to be ready to beat the retreat.
It is the second weekend of the party, known as the "Italian Weekend".
Accurate data do not exist, we speak of 50 thousand, that they leave to cross the Alps and invade the tendons, it is argued that 10% of the visitors come specially from Italy.
The police of Monaco is strengthened with 7 agents of South Tyrol, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which makes a statistics on nationality, where the Italians come first with 200 medical treatments in front of the English (about 60 medical treatments) and the Austrians (about 80).
Especially loved by Italians is the tent of the Hofbräuhaus.
1. Sound nights for creditors of the Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stable, Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück confirmed last week.
It is good that the politician used the word "relative" and also mentioned, that the German banking sector is not spared from the critical developments.
Because the crisis started on the weekend.
The real estate financier Hypo Real Estate, noted in the DAX, obtains from a consortium of German banks a billionaire credit, in order to be able to protect itself from turbulence on the markets.
An expert on the situation told Reuters Monday, support credits would reach up to EUR 35 billion.
The Hypo Real Estate only has to pay the interest for the requested part.
Money comes from both private and public banks.
In the end are the losses of the affiliate Depfa.
The state funder according to a newspaper article has been refinanced in the very short term – which is no longer possible due to mistrust on the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's reserves had fallen by 95% from EUR 2.37 million, and the share of equity also fell from 1.6 million to 1.45 million.
Current income and net income from financial affairs had fallen to 0 compared to last year, profits from increases in both applications and certain shares in the liquidation of provisions in receivables have fallen by more than 70% over the 5 mn. of Euro.
Only thanks to higher incomes from the return of subordinated clearing costs that come both from the restructuring of the former Depfa group and from the repayment of interest according to the single text of tax laws and from the management of business for business consortia, the negative profit was fairly moderate with about 16%.
The former public financier after being privatized in 1990 had been lost in speculation with commercial real estate credits, which were split into the Aareal Bank.
As income in the classic state financing was too low, Depfa has become more involved in infrastructure projects and in the financing of joint private and state investor (PPP) projects and has diversified internationally.
The Hypo Real Estate must now depreciate the value of the affiliate, which will have a fundamental material effect on the group's profit and loss account.
The fact is that the dividends have been cancelled.
Already in 2007 they had been reduced by 2/3.
The Hypo Real Estate after the absorption of Depfa is an important funder of the state and infrastructure.
It is more dependent on re-financing on the market between banks compared to other institutions, because it does not have customer trusts.
Due to the collapse of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago the granting of loans between banks largely dried up, because banks accumulate liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate annually needs for a part of the Depfa's credit portfolio – about 50 mld. – in the short term the means of refinancing.
According to Hypo Real Estate, the group's financial needs were covered by credit for a certain period and the company protected by the influence of the international monetary markets was mostly non-functional.
From other sources it is felt, that thanks to the money the refinancing is ensured until the end of 2009.
On the contrary, HRE Chairman Georg Funke said that the HRE Group will not need money markets in a short time.
The Bundesbank and the National Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) are based on the fact that the marketability of the HRE Group is still assured.
This is expected for the shareholders and creditors of the bank.
In view of the dynamics and imponderability of the crisis there will be no guarantee.
Funding may not be fully used.
But the opposite is also not to be excluded.
After Sunday night the bank learned it was about to fail, the momentary rescue failed to calm the souls.
The share price drops by 75% on the 3.30 Euros.
The mortgage courses are fairly good.
While the front-degree debts are almost irremovable, they give way to deferred credit courses.
Colpiti are mainly the loans of the affiliate Württemberg-Hypo comprehensiblely the events with expiration beyond 2009.
First the loans of the HRE seemed to be an alternative speculative investment, now their value must, after the strengthening of the crisis of the banks and the institution itself, that with the relief of the Depfa the crisis has fallen, be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
As long as the central banks, governments and the least damaged banks are still ready, an amortisation of annualities can be expected within the deadline.
Or it comes into operation, which no one dares hope – that the financial crisis will be overcome within the next 15 months.
But with regard to the overturned information due to partial statilizations, the almost certain probability has become a justified hope.
It will mainly create long-term investors a few sleepless nights with the decision if they split from their commitments.
Short-term investors may conclude the carry-over of losses for future capital gains tax payments.
Sylvana and the secrets of Bento-Box
When Silvana Hiltrop, 16, the first day of school should show up at Tachibana Highschool, the girls start to giggle: The German is completely "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from Mangas-in the new Exchange Log tells about Japan.
The first day of school in Japan
How excited I was.
I used to look forward to going to school.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo to Kawasaki and I need 40 minutes by train to get to Tachibana Highschool.
I had to find my own way, and luckily I didn't miss it.
The beginning of the first hour of the lesson does not seem to have been fixed just as we did in Lower Saxony.
The students arrive slowly from 8 a.m. onwards, until 8.40 p.m. begins a brief interview with the professor, the so-called "home room".
But before the lesson began, it was up to me to introduce myself.
I'm not the kind of guy who talks willingly in front of people, plus in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I didn't have my school uniform yet, I put on an old skirt from the host mother, along with a shirt, blue socks and black leather shoes.
Dressed like this, I stood in front of the chair and tried to pronounce well: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana..."- my name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and celebrate in a week my birthday.
At that time I was very happy that I had already started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class whispered, gagged and made a mark, and I heard the word "Kawaii" all the time.
I already knew this one from my Mangas.
It belongs to the essential lexicon of Japanese girls to survive and means "nice, sweet".
Then I ran fast to my place.
The girl next to me scolded, for her it was an honor to sit next to a student exchange.
The rest of the lesson hour had continued quietly, but when the gong sounded, I was assaulted in the true sense of the word.
Everything they talked disorderly and gagged and dried me up with questions – then it's really hard to understand the English of the Japanese.
In the break everyone opened their Blessing.
My host mother also gave me the lunch basket- is different from the boring German sandwiches.
I had risotto with spices, salsiccine, cucumber salad and algae, fruit and a kind of wrap with meat and tofu..
To tell you the truth, I don't even know what I eat exactly in Japan.
Things seem strange and have a completely new taste.
It's just that everything is really good.
Maybe except for the plums under salt, Brrr!
Bentos are not just lunch at Japanese schools.
It happens sometimes that a girl gives a Bento made by herself, prepared quite artistically, with the hope then of getting to know the boy during recreation.
I read it in my Manga comic books.
I'm just curious if I can find out.
"Why Japan?" my friends asked me when I told them that I would want to go to school in Japan for a year.
I've always said:
"Because it fascinates me"
Finally, I've been reading Mangas for years now with fervor.
And to better understand the comic books and culture that they contain, eventually I started learning Japanese.
I was completely convinced to come here once.
I am also fascinated by tradition, customs and customs.
They're very fond of us here.
On the one hand Japan is a place of technology and latest trends - on the other hand: severe, disciplined and traditional.
Since everything is organized well, I have never felt lost, even though Tokyo is the largest city I have ever seen in my life."
1. Even rats have feelings
A rat or cockroach escapes when they feel the danger.
Neurologist Joseph Le Doux is convinced of this: even many animals have feelings.
4. But how could it be verified if, when they behave in the same way as we do, they have our own feelings?
The Internet newspaper "Edge" has been publishing articles by well-known scientists for some years.
6. SPIEGEL ONLINE in a series presents selected answers to the question: "What do you think is true, without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings or other states of consciousness, without me or anyone else so far being able to prove it, since we cannot even prove that other men have consciousness.
But in this case we must at least hope, that all human brains have the same basic configuration.
9. As soon as we address the other species and ask questions about feeling or in general about consciousness, we enter an impractical territory, because the base of reference does not match.
When a rat is in a dangerous situation, he does the same things that other animals do too. That is, he pretends to be dead, flees or attacks.
People behave similarly, from which some scientists understand that there is a comparable subjective feeling.
I don't believe this.
Two aspects of the structure of the brain make it difficult for us to convey our feelings to animals.
On the one hand it often connects the lateral prefrontal cortex with human consciousness, associated circuits (this for its direct sharing with short memory and with executive and control functions).
In man this vast area is much more developed than in the other primates and it seems that among the other creatures it is completely lacking.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness dependent on the prefrontal cortex, including knowledge, who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, we thus accept the basis on the assumption that man differs even from other primates.
Another dramatic feature should appear in man's way of speaking: since a large part of life is connected to the language, it is often said to be linked to consciousness.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
Although awareness does not depend on language, it would influence it so that the awareness of the animal, as it is done, will certainly differ greatly from the circumstances of our consciousness.
That is why it is difficult to find out how consciousness can be seen in other animals.
If it is not possible to measure it as an internal and subjective thing, in analyzing it through your own experience because of the special hardware, their research will cause us great problems.
Most interpretations refer to the content of conscious experience, but apart from this there is another aspect of consciousness to which it would be easier for science to have access.
One could analyze the processes of the consciousness of animals without regard to their contents, and this is precisely what happens in studies on the short memory of primates, in particular to the example of visualization.
So for this principle, which Christof Koch and Francis Crick follow, it passes first to the neural links of consciousness than to the causal mechanisms: both could be identical but not necessarily.
Interestingly this principle also highlights the value of the prefrontal bark for the implementation of the display.
What, then, is meant by feelings?
I blame them for the fact that an emotional system like fear is activated in one of its brain conscious activities.
So what we indicate as "fear" is the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as the reactions of the body) occupies the working memory.
Thus the feelings are closely related to the regions of the bark, which characterize the primates and in particular the human being.
With speaking nature, subtle shades of feeling are created, because we can distinguish and categorize situations with the help of words and grammar, to describe them to others.
In comparison to this Antonio Damasio for example believes that the feelings result from more primitive activities of the regions of the body of the sensations of the bark and the pale headache, similar to Jack Pankseep, who however focused more on the paleocephalus.
Since this network in the course of human evolution has not changed much, this could absolutely be part of the feelings extended to the species.
On a purely theoretical level, I cannot contradict it, but I consider it indisputable.
Pankseep argues that what appears to be a fear for rats and humans is likely to be felt with sense in both cases: but how could it occur, if rats and humans feel the same way when they behave in a similar way?
A cockroach in case of danger runs away like he's scared, too?
In my eyes the mere similarity of behavior cannot yet prove any vital similarity.
That is, neural comparison continues to be helpful: rats and humans have similar paleoencephalic, cockroaches not even a brain.
But is the paleoencephalus responsible for feelings?
And when it could even be demonstrated for humans: how would it be demonstrated on rats?
I think that rats and other mammals, perhaps even insects (who knows?), have feelings.
But I didn't know how to prove it.
And since their feelings are fundamentally different from ours (since human consciousness is based on specific circuits and language), I prefer to study emotional behavior rather than the emotional sensations of rats.
In any case, there is progress here at the neural level, as long as the same procedure on rats and men is abandoned.
As I don't do research on language and conscience in rats, so I don't do research on their emotions, I don't even know if they exist.
This may be considered shortsighted, but I prefer to take steps forward, rather than continually slamming against a wall.
I'm actually a practical emotional.
The President of UEFA Platini: referral to Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik said that preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and Prime Minister.
"The government sees the Uefa decision in Bordeaux as a demonstration of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organise Europeans with Poland," Wasjunik said.
"However, this is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is still a lot to do in both countries"
Both countries homeowners limp in the roadmap for the construction or reconstruction of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports.
Eventually, the number of stages for Europeans will even be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
Now we have to work with maximum speed," said the president of the Ukrainian association Grigorij Surkis.
"UEFA will keep an eye on us all the time"
An even more radical step has been taken in Poland.
After numerous scandals the leadership of the Polish association PZPN was suspended by the national Olympic committee and replaced with independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of Sport Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There would be "the serious danger that the PZPN will not be able to operate according to the rules," Drzewiecki told the Polish information agency PAP.
"In a letter we assured UEFA President Michel Platini that the preparation for MS 2012 will not suffer."
Many members of the first division only in the last season have been sentenced for manipulation, in the end even the beginning of the League had to be postponed to the last moment.
Dennis Quaid fights outraged
He wanted to promote a new film, in the interview he talked about the private and now he's in trouble with the ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan declared his ex Dennis Quaid an adulter.
He foams with anger and fights.
Roses War delayed for former married couple Meg Ryan und Dennis Quaid: seven years after their separation the two Hollywood actors are now arguing with each other a bad dispute - in public.
Meg Ryan in an interview with American magazine InStyle last week for the first time spoke about the reasons for the marriage failure: "Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, and this has been very painful."
The extent of the betrayals you would have come to know only after the separation.
The occasion for the "soul strip" was the work with Ryan's press for her new film "The Women" – the story of adultery is told.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his publicly declared adulterous husband was clear-cut: it would be "unaudited," he told the fifty-four-year-old "New York Daily News", which "Meg again repeats and reworks the story of our relationship."
It would also be "deplorable" that to Jack, the 16-year-old son they had together, again "let us publicly remember the pain and subversion, which a separation means for every child."
While Ryan from the separation lives alone, Quaid is married again and soon will become the father of twins.
And so his judgments close with the arrow: "My life goes on anyway.
I consider myself lucky to have a wonderful family to which everything goes for the best."
Low prices for air tickets and hotels
In the first half of 2008 flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would be up to 50% cheaper
Flights and overnight stays in the hotel have become more convenient again - this is the result of a study by the financial provider and American Express travel.
The company analyzed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and after an increase in prices in the first quarter saw a clear decrease in the second quarter.
After prices on the hotel market have increased for years, overnight stays in many places have already fallen in price.
From January to March prices rise in 41 of the 48 European cities still examined on average around 6.9 compared to 2007
However, prices from April to June were already 3.6 % lower than in the previous year.
The most obvious trend would have been in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay 30 up to 37% less than a year earlier.
The American Express sees as a reason for this the low dollar quotation, which would lead to a "heavy desire to travel by American tourists"
Financial centres such as Frankfurt and London would also be affected by the recession of hotel prices in a stronger way than industrial centres such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger
In the Norwegian city hotel prices with an increase of 26.3% even hold the record in Europe
Also with regard to flight prices, the trend in the first quarter is still upwards:
Because of the increase in kerosene, Economy Class passengers had to pay an average of 7.1% compared to 2007, fuel intensive long-range flights would be up to 29,2 % more expensive.
From April to June the prices of Economy Class air tickets fell by an average of 12,5 % compared to the previous quarter, however in the first class and in Business the price changes were much weaker.
In Germany prices have fallen even more sharply than in other European countries:
From January to March prices rose by 11,9 %, while in the second quarter they fell by 23,6 %.
As for German domestic flights according to the study, prices have even halved.
The reason for the price collapse would be on the one hand the economic growth downwards, explains the company.
Demand in many segments of the air travel market has collapsed.
On the other hand, there would be an increased pressure on competition from the open skies agreement, which liberalises air traffic between the US and Europe.
A sign of the critical situation would be the abolition of unprofitable routes with Airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that would have declared bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 – only in Europe were 24 airlines.
The HSV beats the Gladbach for 1 to 0
With a goal and simple methods, the SV of Hamburg becomes a principalist.
At Borussia Luhukay still can't find a working group of 11.
Kristoffer Klein makes the landing of luck worse for the national player Marko Marin.
Gladbach's player came in late first and failed with a shot on the crossbar
His message was precisely formulated, passed on his lips in a convincing way.
He knew he was absolutely right.
"We need the second goal," said Hermann Rieger in the hall of the Hamburg arena cabins.
It had not happened much in the catacombs, the game pause was over and most would sit back in their place.
Rieger has been an HSV physiotherapist for almost 3 decades, enjoying an even higher estimate than some old players.
And so his admonition also found heed in the high spheres.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol annihilated and raised his thumb as a sign of approval.
Cornelius is the brother of the head coach of Hamburg Martin Jol.
His order must have sounded in a similar way: here's the second goal!
The change of position did not occur.
"Today it wasn't all nice to see," Marcell Jansen admitted later.
Also Bastian Reinhardt would have "willed more relaxed".
For 1 to zero, those in Hamburg must thank Mladen Petric's 11th stroke of the head and the fact that many of Gladbach's weak players could not harm the weak players in Hamburg.
"It was a dirty victory," Martin Jol recapitulated.
The SV of Hamburg this Monday will be 121 years old.
The spectators celebrated already before, on Saturday afternoon, themselves, the blue sky on the arena and the flashing ranking on the video screen, which legitimized their sports society as before the class.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We are able to fix everything," said Marcell Jansen.
It has the feeling, that the provisional certificate from table is more indicative of the unpredictability of the championship than of the dominance of its HSV.
The team with its new late arrivals – the Brazilians Neves und Silva, the defender of the Petric door as well as Jansen blown to FC Bayern – slowly finds herself, but she has not yet managed to shine.
"We need more atmosphere and more Dribbling," Jol re-launches forcefully.
After the defeat of the vote
Wall Street is a place of fear.
The first news of the failure of the rescue package temporarily brought down the 700-point Dow Jones.
This was the biggest loss of points in one day's space in its history.

Dark matter influences the flight of space probes
For years a mysterious phenomenon has created perplexity among scientists: dark matter influences the speed of space probes during the so-called Swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einsteins' general theory of relativity may not be entirely accurate.
The Ulysses spacecraft flew through space for almost 18 years.
Because of the fast freezing fuel pipes, it is now up to her to freeze her to death.
Among scientists for years a mysterious phenomenon creates disaster – the anomaly of the Swing-by
The Swing-by is a flight maneuver of space probes, with which they gain additional momentum/spin/scillation in the gravitational field of a celestial body, for example of the Earth.
So probes can save a lot of fuel.
The Euro-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical expedient as well as the Ulysses solar probe.
What amazes scholars for years: rockets do not behave entirely as one would expect according to the law on gravitation.
In fact, there are irregularities in speed.
The probes suddenly become faster or slower.
So far, physicists have been unable to explain this effect.
The year was renamed the Swing-by anomaly.
Some experts fear that perhaps even Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, which describes the attraction force of matter with a curvature of space, may not be entirely accurate.
The American physicist Stephen Adler of Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study firmly believes as before Einstein was wrong, and tries to explain the anomaly of Swing-by by means of the so-called dark matter that astronomers have seen in the cosmos.
"Responsible for the anomaly could be the dark matter that could also be very close to the Earth," he writes.
The existence of dark matter space scholars have only known about 10 years.
A force of attraction evidently emerges from her, whose effect on other celestial bodies is shown.
Instead, she is completely invisible, i.e. she does not send or reflect any electromagnetic radiation of any kind, especially any visible light.
According to scientists' calculations, dark matter is at least a good fifth of the entire mass of the cosmos.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After 10 days in the hands of their kidnappers, tourists kidnapped in Egypt would again be free, as confirmed by the Italian Foreign Minister.
The kidnappers from Sudan had asked for several million euros in ransom.
In a shooting before release 6 kidnappers were found to have been killed.
Five Germans were abducted in southern Egypt.
The negotiations for the ransom are already under way.
The Germans are always in the sights of the kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
European tourists abducted in the Sahara are undoubtedly free.
This is what the Egyptian state television, the Arab broadcaster Al-Arabija and the Italian media have consistently reported.
Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the column of the Italian television broadcaster Sky TG 24: "Our citizens and other hostages have been released
We're looking at their state of health," Frattini said.
The 5 Germans, 5 Italians and a Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian companions would be in good health and safe, reported Egyptian state television.
The 19 members of a desert expedition are already on their way to Cairo.
The background to a shooting that took place before the hostages were released remains unclear: so the kidnappers after the instructions of an Egyptian public security officer would have been ready for the end of the kidnapping, before the Sudanese army killed 6 of them by surprise.
"The problem had been solved.
They agreed to a ransom," said the official.
It would be "still trying to take over the hostages", when suddenly "this surprise" arrived.
Sudanese soldiers on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt had shot 6 of the kidnappers and captured 2 of them.
The kidnappers had claimed from Germany a ransom of EUR 6 million; the money would have to be delivered by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom" reported in reference to a German intermediary, the release of hostages would be delayed, because the kidnappers feared for their own safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers wanted to release women hostage after the ransom was paid.
The men would have to stay in custody until the kidnappers had had a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo rejected a position on the report.
The abuse of the stepfather "has led to suicide"
Years of abuse by the stepfather led a woman to kill herself, declared a court.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stitians, Cornwall, was in prison for 6 years after admitting eight cases of sexual assault.
Truro Crown Court learned that he regularly harassed his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between the ages of five and seven.
Trerise wrote in a confessional note: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court learned that Ms. Randle had killed herself at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she was a little girl living in Coventry, Trerise harassed her and blindfolded her before having sex, while her mother was out working in a pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to live in Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
But the court learned that Mrs. Randle, who had spent a lot of time volunteering at the National Trust, was tormented by the abuses that had caused her.
In 2006, the Public Ministry Ramsey Quaife told the court that Ms. Randle's friends, who had been a very good surfer and cyclist, were "emotionally dead", and that she had "done with life".
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
It's thought she killed herself suffocating with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle comforted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a confession letter that ended: "I bound her and blindfolded her."
"I didn't sexually molest her.
I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: "You are an extremely strange fetishist, and for your victim you must have been terrifying, especially when you were only seven years old.
"This unpleasant saga ends with the victim taking his life.
Even harder is the fact that if he hadn't, it would have been difficult for the facts to end up before the court."
I notice the effects Stephanie's father and mother describe having had on their daughter these years.
"Otherwise, she was clearly likely to have been a promising and happy successful young woman."
The officer who lost the data will be punished.
The Cabinet Office officer who left top secret documents on a train in June must be charged by the Official Secrets Act, the BBC learned.
The man was transferred from the Ministry of Defense when he left two highly classified documents on the train to Waterloo.
The documents were passed to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
It is the least delicate of the charges made under this law and there is nothing to suggest a criminal intent.
BBC defense correspondent Frank Gardner said the movement would come as a surprise to many in the administration.
"They would have thought that this was being handled internally at the Mod and the Cabinet Office," he said.
The employee, who cannot be appointed, is about to be charged under section 8.1 of the act, the clause concerning the safeguarding of information.
The Crown Prosecution Service recommended that the officer be charged by the Metro Police because of the highly sensitive nature of his work.
The documents he lost contained assessments of al-Qaeda and the capabilities of the Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was taken away from his home and taken to a hidden location.
Construction company deals with B&B account
British construction companies could face an account of over £800,000 after the bailout of the Bradford & Bingley bank.
The government has given £14 billion to protect the deposits of 2.6 million savers from Bradford & Bingley.
Interest on that loan will be paid by all companies that take money from savers, including the 59 construction companies.
The Managing Director of the Building Societies Association (BSA) Adrian Coles said that it is "irritating" that companies and their members have to pay.
The £14 billion loan will eventually be repaid when Bradford & Bingley loans are redeemed.
But the interest that will mature in the meantime will be charged every year to the 700 financial companies that take deposits. But the interest that will mature in the meantime will be charged every year to the 700 financial companies that accept deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 construction companies would be included in that number.
It is irritating that those institutions that have behaved prudently... are now called upon to pay part of the account of those institutions that have been much less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that every company had to pay in proportion to the deposits it had, and that companies among them had to pay 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will amount to £450 million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find £81 million to pay the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, general manager of the construction company association, told the BBC that he believes it is unfair.
"It is irritating that those institutions that have behaved prudently in the recovering market of homes are now called upon to pay part of the account of those institutions that have been much less cautious."
According to the BSA, no company has failed since the documentation began in 1945.
"We need to look at all aspects in the coming weeks to see what options there are to protect construction companies and their members from what could be a significant account," added Mr Cole.
Interest due in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September of this year to the end of March.
In 2010 the interest of an entire year will be due and this could be almost twice as high.
Since the construction companies are mutual organizations without shareholders, their members end up paying the account through higher rates or lower interest rates on savings accounts.
Milk goes up to 5 pennies per litre
People in Jersey are dealing with having to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that there will be an increase in wholesale prices of its milk for an extra five pennies per liter from Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after an increase of two pennies in February, and comes after a research carried out by a consulting company.
Retailers must decide for themselves whether to download the price increase on their customers.
(DANILO) Before the February increase, the wholesale price changed for the last time in 2002.
Denied bail to former Prime Minister of Bangladesh
A Bangladeshi court rejected a bail request from former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, which means that you could be arrested when you return to the country.
His lawyers said that the court refused to grant him bail for extorting 50 million Taka ($729,700) to a businessman when he was a member of parliament.
The case is one of many allegations of corruption against you.
Sheikh Hasina's long-time political rival, Khaleda Zia, had been released on bail at the beginning of the month.
Sheikh Hasina's return to Bangladesh is scheduled for the coming weeks but his party, Awami League, has requested that the temporary government of the country supported by the military give her full freedom first.
Correspondents say that while you were going abroad for medical treatment on the word, it is not clear according to the terms of your release, if you can remain free when you return to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say he's going to appeal to the Supreme Court against the High Court's order.
"The High Court rejected the bail application for Sheikh Hasina stating that she cannot have bail since she is already abroad on the word for medical care," says her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We shall bring or appeal against the order of the High Court."
His lawyers explain that he needs bail to return to the country from abroad to prepare for the December elections.
She expects Sheikh Hasina's return home after October 17, a senior leader of the Awami League party said Sunday.
She was detained last year after the government flanked by the military took power, but was released in June, to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all charges against themselves.
Fear of Afghan Polio Campaigns
Nearly 200,000 children in Afghanistan are missing from the recent immunization campaign due to Taliban-related violence, says the UN.
The UN carried out a vaccination programme in six provinces last week.
But it is said that it cannot reach the children in the Helmand and Kandahar parts in the south for safety reasons.
A UN spokesman said that this happens despite the promises of the Taliban who would not attack or obstruct thousands of people in the staff carrying the vaccinations.
BSkyB loses legal battle with ITV
BSkyB lost its legal battle with the decision of the Competition Commission to force the company to reduce its participation in the rival TV station ITV.
BSkyB has been told by the competition appeal court to cut its shares in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
Previously, the commission had said that BSkyB's participation impeded competition and allowed an unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought the stake in 2006 in an agreement that effectively blocked NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Office of Fair Trading reported that the acquisition of BSkyB participation in ITV raises doubts about the independence of ITV, causing the Competition Commission to launch an investigation.
Virgin's boss, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the Ofcom regulator opposed the purchase.
BSkyB argued that forcing it to reduce its ITV stake was unreasonable and a disproportionate remedy - particularly as BSkyB had said it would overrender its voting rights.
New investigation into the US prosecutor's case
The U.S. Attorney General appointed a special Public Ministry to examine the dismissal of nine U.S. lawyers in 2006.
The operation took place when a case report by the Inspector General of the Department of Justice criticized the actions of the administrative officers.
The report was critical of the White House, the legislators and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was prompted by fears that prosecutors had been removed for political reasons.
Special prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officials questioned during the investigation lied to investigators in an attempt to obstruct justice.
"Serial charges concerning potentially criminal behaviour have not been fully investigated or verified," said Inspector General Glenn Fine in his report.
The assignment of a special prosecutor with the power to compel witnesses to testify was one of the main recommendations.
The dispute began when nine U.S. prosecutors were removed from their positions by the Department of Justice in December 2006.
At that time, the department said that the lawyers had been fired for poor performance.
But later it appeared that the dismissed lawyers had not been evaluated more than many other colleagues, leading many observers to conclude that the dismissal had been motivated by politics.
Some of the prosecutors had been involved in legal proceedings against Republican members of the high-profile Congress, while others had refused to investigate the charge of fraud against democratic voters.
U.S. prosecutors investigate and prosecute cases in court on behalf of the government.
They may be fired at any time, but cannot be fired for political reasons.
The then head of the Department of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, found himself in the storm for the dismissals, and eventually resigned his position.
A number of other Department of Justice officials resigned.
(The Inspector General's report was very critical of Mr Gonzales' role in the case, saying that he was primarily responsible for dismissals, that he had abdicated his role as leader and had been extraordinarily detached during the trial.
Other officials, including Bush Karl Rove's former senior assistant, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigations.
The epic of Meat Loaf will be celebrated
Rock star Meat Loaf is about to be honored at the Q Awards for her epic Bat Out Of Hell anthem.
The singer, who will withdraw his special gold prize at the ceremony next week in London, said he was "honored" to win the award.
The song, which lasted nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of the hit track of Meat Loaf's 1977 album.
Coldplay will lead the nominations for this year's awards, being on the list of nominees in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: "There are some songs that transcend things like time and gender, and Bat Out Of Hell is undoubtedly one of those."
The song, composed by Jim Steinman, required a strong vocality that was provided by Meat Loafs.
It opened with an instrumental section that lasted almost two minutes.
The song was made as a single in the UK in 1979 and reached 15th place.
But the album of Meat Loaf Bat Out Of Hell remained almost nine years in the standings and came to sell more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered from health problems in recent years, including surgery for an irregular heartbeat in 2003 after collapsing on stage.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel the concerts.
He later emerged that he had a cyst on a vocal cord.
Dark city streets, often forgotten and perhaps soon for sale
New York City has thousands of avenues, boulevards, streets and other crossings, some famous, others merely used.
But also many veteran taxi drivers and long-time residents find it difficult to give the location of Extra Place, mostly because they have never heard of it.
The tiny street is in the East Village and goes north from First Street – without making the Second Street – between Bowery and Second Avenue.
About 30 feet wide and 120 in length, it looks more like a dusty alley than an active traffic lane.
There are no road signs.
It's virtually impossible to see it on a normal atlantean.
The road must, however, have admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the real estate company of the luxury buildings recently built on the First Street.
You want to reopen Extra Place and create a cleaner passage for shops and boutiques that should open in new buildings.
Other admirers include long - time neighbors who say they were hit by the broken road simply because it was one of the last remnants of the gentlemanly quarter of the past.
But the department of preservation and development of the city, which has control of the roads, has no interest in keeping it.
During a meeting of the land use committee of the district council some representatives of the city agency and Avalon Bay outlined a proposal for the real estate company to buy the roads.
But the committee prefers that the road remain in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new plan to be presented next month, says Susan Stetzer, the director of the Community Board 3 district.
"There is very little space left to the property of the city, and we would like the city to continue to own Extra Place," he said.
"There may be proposals to fix it and manage it, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want to ensure public access."
Avalon Bay many months ago announced that he wanted to reopen the small road and install seating spaces, including some to use for a cafe to which the real estate company hopes to rent space.
The idea that Avalon Bay bought the road was made public for the first time at this month's meeting.
Michele de Milly, a spokesperson for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the road, it doesn't necessarily mean it wants to own it.
"Avalon Bay's main concern is to renew this derelict alley and turn it into a public amenity," he said, adding that the city suggested the sale.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for Preservation, said it was the city's desire to sell the road and pointed out that the agency's purpose was to develop the property rather than administer it.
Compared to his most colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place left a slight historical footprint.
Some believe that it took its name in 1802, when a large farm owned by Philip Minthorne was divided between his numerous children and the narrow strip of land was not claimed.
The back door of CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, opened on Extra Place, and the road is perhaps better known as the set for the cover photo of the Ramones album "Rocket to Russia."
"The terrain was beautiful," said Danny Fields, Ramones' manager, who took the photo in November 1976.
"It was filled with garbage, little clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves, ropes."
Some residents, including some bloggers who write "gentrification" of the East Village, opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that the piece of public property, modest as it is, should remain public.
Others praised Extra Place as a rarity – a fragment of almost unaltered city that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who has a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled, "The Book of Lamentations: A somewhat nostalgic look at the dying city"), published part of a City History Speech that appeared on The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow, unexhausted street, dark even by day and delimited doors of rusty iron warehouses and windows with saracinesche, with old newspapers of weeks flying along the lowlands."
With few exceptions, the road seemed almost the same as a recent evening.
A rat ran agilely through the back of the road near a door leading inside the CBGB, which is now the site of an aristocratic clothing store.
On the walls there were graffiti and an empty bottle of 22 ounce beer lies near a group of abandoned fresh newspapers.
Few passers-by said they rarely thought of Extra Place but suggested she would need to be a little beautified.
Mr Fields, for his part, said that he also thinks that some people underestimate the attraction of the road in its present state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "were in black places, dirty and disgusting."
Bilingual debate: immersion in English
In this episode of Educational Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the candidate's position on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, senior member in California studies and the senior director of education studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "Not as good as you think: Because the middle class needs to choose a school."
To really attract Hispanic voters is a complicated business.
Barack Obama's educational projects are a significant example.
Obama's campaign notes that "African-American and Latin students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students," which is true.
To combat these shortcomings in achieving the goals, Obama's educational plan specifically supports, among other things, "transitional bilingual education" for English students.
Yet the question for Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes teaching in languages other than English, does not take into account his interest in bridging learning gaps.
Let's take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in eastern Los Angeles County.
The students of the school are mostly Hispanic and low-income.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have recently arrived, are studying English.
But, among fourth graders, an amazing 100 percent of students took the upper-level test in the 2008 state of mathematics exam.
An equally surprising 93 percent of fourth graders took the expert-level test on English-language art.
This incredible result was achieved using a different ingredient than Mr Obama's favorite.
Sixth Street emphasizes the review and exercise, constant assessment of skills and an "no excuses" attitude.
Also, and this is where Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, director of Sixth Street, the school's obstructive approach to English students is "full immersion."
The use of English emphasizes the almost exclusive use of English in the context of education.
Mrs. Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, said to me, "we had a fantastic success with a student who had just come from Mexico and if you had entered the class 12 months later you would not have been able to identify which one."
"It works," he observed, "for us it works."
Would Obama model a school like Sixth Street Prep to replicate it in other schools by the Spanish majority and with English students?
The results achieved by the school make the answer to that question very easy, but the educational policy in its own party (the National Education Associations is a long-standing supporter of bilingual education) and its very continued support for bilingual education prevent us from predicting Mr. Obama's answer.
While he agrees that immigrants should study English, Obama has recently made the argument trivial when he said that people should stop worrying about "only-English" legislation.
Instead, he said, "you must be sure that your children are able to speak Spanish."
If Obama really wants to close these achievement gaps, he should carefully consider the educational models that work rather than despise or trivialize them.
Oil drops sharply and renews economic fear
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday because of concerns that even the US bailout plan for the financial markets may not be able to raise the economy.
The futures of the crude have fallen from 7 percent to 99.80 dollars per barrel to the New York merchant bag in the morning operations.
Prices have lost more than $20 a barrel since last Monday.
In the last two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by Wall Street's financial turmoil, and by a couple of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a peak of $145.26 per barrel in June, prices dropped to almost $90 per barrel at the beginning of this month, before rising again, in the background of tremendous uncertainty in the financial markets.
Anxiety influenced investors again Monday even after Congressional leaders said they had reached an agreement on the weekend about the rescue plan, the largest in history.
The news was obscured by the fresh concern that the financial crisis was far from over.
In the last episode of the progressive merger, Citigroup will buy the banking operations of Wachovia Corporation, the government said Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partly nationalised the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Barclays Capital analysts said the weekend's frantic negotiations had led to a bailout agreement " appear to have failed to revive the market's feeling.
As the economic situation worsens, demand for raw materials, including oil, is expected to calm down.
"The outlook for global equity, interest rates and exchange rate markets has become uncertain," Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
"We believe that raw materials will not be able to escape the contagion.
From a raw material perspective our most pressing concern is to what extent the American virus will spread globally and specifically to China. "
Bank analysts have lowered their expectations for the next year while home oil consumption due to the slowdown in economic growth, reducing oil and gas price forecasts by about 20% for 2009.
The exploit in the second quarter marks a team record.
After spending more time than anyone in the Jets uniform in the last eight and more seasons, counsel Shaun Ellis thought he had seen it all.
Then he watched the second quarter of Sunday, when the Jets turned a pointless game into a comeback.
"Never seen such a thing," Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the Jets and Arizona Cardinals had matched the grey of the threatening clouds over them with a flaming game.
Then quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, providing the perfect signal for an afternoon when their growing tune took a giant step forward.
Favre found Coles for two more touchdowns in the fourth, including one when a cornerback fell and another with 10 seconds left at the end of the first half.
"I didn't get out of my path," said Favre of all the passages that came to Coles.
He's a great player.
Our communication was great, despite what people can think."
While Favre and Coles were playing catch games, the defense heavily hit Cardinals Kurt Warner's quarterback.
The cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a vagrant launch and re-launched it for 32 yards in a touchdown.
Security officer Eric Smith scheduled another passage and intercepted it.
The linebacker David Bowens forces a Warner fumble.
The last turn, Bowens' forced fumble, could have been the most remarkable.
The Cardinals went ahead on that ball possession, with 10 seconds left, and after the Jets had resumed the ball with 10 minutes left, Jay Feely kicked a 20-yard goal, for a 34-0 advantage.
It was more than the Jets ever scored in a quarter.
When asked to describe their madness, the Jets coach Eric Mangini said, "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
When he was told both - the Jets gave 21 unanswered points in the third quarter - Mangini said: "I can tell you that I liked the second quarter much more than the third."
There have been a lot of points in a small amount of time."
Rested Gebrselassie exceeds its world record
Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia again showed why many consider him the best marathon ever, breaking his own world record at the Berlin marathon Sunday and becoming the first person to race a 26.2 mile race under 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a win on the race favorably flat at 2:03:59, Gebrselassie sends his previous score of 2:03:26, race last year in Berlin to smash for 27 seconds.
At the age of 35, Gebrselassie is developing the 26th world record for such an amazing career that he has produced a world championship or a world record at every distance from the metric mile to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie skipped the Olympic marathon in Beijing, fearing - perhaps too alarmingly, retrospectively - that air pollution would worsen his asthma problems.
Instead, he decided to run to Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees on departure, 55 degrees on arrival - Gebrselassie won Sunday with a scorching average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
As soon as half of the funders like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya went to long distances, the marathon record fell by more than two minutes in the past decade, since Ronaldo from Costa del Brazil won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday's victory, Gebrselassie told reporters that two weeks ago he had cramps in his buttocks and missed a week of training.
Clearly, the rest left him fresh, not rusty.
"I'm so happy," Gebrselassie told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and I had doubts today, but in the end everything went well."
He was somewhat criticized - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's East African rival - for having over-orchestrated his races, generally avoiding many of the world's best marathon stars, counting on an aperpista as if it were a mid-bottom race, and putting world records above the sense of competition.
But these criticisms rarely diminish the magnitude of Gebrselassie's skills as a marathon.
With the pace of four Kenyans Sunday, Gebrselassie reached the midway point at 1:02:04.
Two Kenyan elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, held Gebrselassie after the openers vanished.
Just over three miles from the finish, Gebrselassie made a final push to separate from Kwambai, who finished second at 2:05:36, improving his best personal time of almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi arrived third at 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, a native of Kazakhstan who is now a German citizen, completed a remarkable year winning at 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time ever.
Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, Mikitenko, 36, was a surprise winner of the London Marathon at 2:24:14.
She missed the Beijing Games with what is described as a bad accident, but was healed to win in Berlin, making her best personal time of almost five minutes in the third marathon she ran.
She ran a race doing good calculations, letting a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners leave with a large detachment, taking them back after about 18 and a half miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia arrived second at 2:21.31, while Helena Kiprop of Kenya finished third at 2:25:01.
In a city apart, pride and processes of a black life
Hidden in the extended theme park on the suburbs of Orlando, a few miles from the splendor, the noise, the huge, lies the quiet city where the pride and complications of the African-American experience enter life.
Eatonville, the first black city incorporated into the country and the birthplace of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as described in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet fields, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, plenty of guava, two schools and no prison."
Now it's a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to show their respect for Hurston, Harlem Renaissance's most famous writer.
Yet in many ways, the city that has described - and that stops tourists by understanding it in the Florida tourist guide produced by the Depression-Era Federal Writers' Project - remains a separate place.
It is as independent, dignified and private as it was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted sharing their thoughts with the white man, that "knowing so little of us, he doesn't know what he's missing."
Even now, in a year when a black presidential nominee, Senator Barack Obama, was called for an opening speech on the race, many here remain wary of the look of the outsider.
"We are very cautious about how our story is told," said 59-year-old Hortense Jones, a lifelong resident and member of the oldest church in the city.
"It must be right."
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and difficulty.
It is both a historical model of black takeover and a community of almost 2,400 where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is a literary center but also an example in the shade of the oaks of rural culture of the blacks of the south - sometimes disdainful, sometimes rewarded - born of American slavery.
Not surprisingly, the residents here are both proud and protective.
And the concern for Eatonville's imagination really began with Zora, who everyone here calls Hurston.
She introduced the world to her hometown through sincere, dialect-rich books, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs of Florida's guide transformed the city, just off Route 17, a road that runs through the often forgotten center of Florida into a scenario of black history and human drama
Low as a crab in both life and literature, Hurston took the readers to the store owned by Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then diverted to more private areas.
"Out of the street on the left," he wrote, "is the modern public school, brown with white finishes, with its well-maintained gardens and courtyards, which Howard Miller always looked after, thinking he could just read and write."
She also mentioned widow Dash's new husband and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds and whatever suits the passing rooms."
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston connected Eatonville with self-government but also with illiteracy, second wedding and sex.
Clearly this wasn't Fodor's.
In fact, it was not a portrait that everyone appreciated.
"Zora was saying it like it was," said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of Johnson's girls, whom Hurston immortalizes by quoting men who sing gross songs about their beauty.
He adds, "Some people don't like it."
Hurston is still remembered here as a lively eccentric who often returned from his family moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77, remembers that when Hurston fell into the city, he usually arrived unannounced in a triumphant Chevrolt, smoking and wearing pants in a city that even today boasts dignified clothing.
Many inhabitants were fascinated, says Mr. Franklin, while others were groaning.
"People were always very happy to see Zora," Mr. Franklin said.
But, he added, rocking himself in his chair on the patio on the back above Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, "she never stayed for long."
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books had gone out of print.
Along with the rest of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten her.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in a plaqueless grave in Fort Pierce, Fla., where she had lived.
In Eatonville, there were no major commemorative ceremonies, and no major conferences.
"I don't think they understand his contribution to the world or his legacy to everyone," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows," a biography of Hurston published in 2003.
A change occurred in the 1980s.
Orange County officers wanted to set up a five-lane highway across the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the two-lane main road.
Orlando's expansion has already pushed Interstate 4 through the western edge of the city.
The proposal came when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult time in its history.
Forced integration, in addition to other things, had put an end to its idyllic isolation of the community
In the 1950 ' s, the battle over racial mixing brought hatred to the door of the community.
"During that time, a group of white boys came and threw oranges and stuff at the people sitting on the side," says Mr. Franklin.
"We actually had a girl who was killed by that one time.
They threw a cocoon out of a car."
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston made a request to the Supreme Court for forced integration, defining his decision in Brown against the school office "an insult rather than an honor for my race."
Residents now say that the disintegration of schools, despite being positive in some respects, dilutes Eatonville's cohesion and jeopardizes the confidence of its young people.
"Black children were used to being hugged - I remember this - by hugging your teacher in the morning, hugging your teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, Ella Dinkins' daughter and the executive director of Preserve the Eatonville Community, a non-profit group.
This lasted, he added, until teachers and students came from the same place.
"You didn't embrace your white teacher because your white teacher...- I mean, there's a cultural division there," said Mrs. Nathiri.
Civil rights, however, helped and created space for many other Zora Neale Hurstons - a black writer, actress and artist who overcame prejudices, as she did, with cheerful self-assurance and lines such as: "How can some deny themselves the pleasure of my company!
I just can't figure it out."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker began a long journey to the unmarked tomb of Hurston and began to fight for the resurrection of her reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography of Robert E. Hemenway's Hurston struck the shelves of the bookstores, reintegrating it into the American canon.
The highway project arrived just as his most famous daughter had again flashed the lights.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
The community began designing a festival dedicated to Hurston in 1988 to show what could ruin the state with its highway.
Thousands of fans came to the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many come back for the commemoration.
Many years later, the state pulled itself back from its project on the road.
"The five lanes of the resurrected highway have brought what would be said high speed, a real pride for the city," said Ms. Nathiri.
Mrs Boyd makes it easier: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the highway project helped to change the image the city has of itself.
Those outside of town like Rachelle Munson, an attorney who began to come to church here in 1993, began to appear in large numbers, and residents began to re-evaluate the past.
Eatonville joined the public record in 1998.
A new one-storey bookstore (called Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 on a repaved and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains a Florida anomaly: only six miles from the center of Orlando, can give the feeling of a secondary road in the summer rain, small as when it was founded with just 27 black families in the 1980s.
(It's 90 percent black today.)
The outsiders who come to look for Eatonville's story, for its meaning, are often still treated with caution.
A permit requested in advance is required for most of the interviews, to some things - like murals on the oldest church in Eatonville, painted by a white man, who show black men in the fields - are not allowed to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Ms. Jones, a fat teacher, with a weakness for bright red, still fear that their island community will be misunderstood.
Yet, as soon as the Hurston festival expanded, a high level of civic pride also emerged.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville with Hurston saw her entire race: beautiful, problems and everything, neither better, nor worse and proud, creative, great worker, foolish and confused like other races and ethnic groups in America.
It is sincere civic affection that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, Edwin Harvey, 18, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or for the Police Department, who said he might need help.
And even those who are younger, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Many people, if they just came in here, will think, 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others,'" said Alondra Kenon after Mass on a recent Sunday.
"But if you really stop and take a moment to look at history, it's a really nice city."
Here in New York we all speak fluently of finance
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If the tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the newsstands and the huge TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn't notice being in the eye of the cyclone.
They would never guess that the glass offices, with bee nests above their heads the bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York every day live the worst "bad day in office" since the fall of 1929.
The stallion shakes metal trolleys for tea through the sidewalks, carrying trays of muffins for breakfast meetings.
Latin-Americans drag their feet between condominiums carrying, like human mules, 50 and broken ironed shirts hanging on a stick on their shoulders.
The employees are still waiting in line for their morning bagel at the food carts on the sidewalks, and it is still impossible to catch a yellow taxi between 16:00 and 19:00 on a working day.
It did not seem that there was a real crisis, until, with all the talk of ruin and sadness, I decided to open a new savings book Thursday afternoon.
Although I had planned the matter so that it would coincide with the late afternoon break at my JP Morgan Chase branch, a tail of about twenty was already waiting in line.
Not in front of the cashier's desk, to collect money or make deposits, but in front of the customer service desk, where old customers order cheque books, tourists ask directions for the Macy department store and new customers open accounts.
Many of those in front of me, I would then learn from Starr, my "banker of trust", were in line for the same reason.
Unlike me, however, they have already taken savings from smaller banks from places from which commuters do, such as those from New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They took the money from so-called thrifts (a bit like a construction company), credit unions and types of city savings banks whose subsidiaries operate only within a state, and say they treat customers as family members.
In the past years, 15 of these banks have gone bankrupt.
In the past few days the Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, was submitted to the controlled administration, and while the New Yorkers were heading home for the weekend on Friday afternoon, another bank, Wachovia, with savings deposits of $440 billion, was looking for a buyer to save it.
The employees and clerks who stood in front of me, frightened of another collapse, were moving their money to a bank perceived as a safe port, the bank that is asking for more bail on Wall Street.
The common New Yorkers in recent weeks have become competent in finance.
A woman at my trusted Chinese supermarket, speaking on the phone, referred to Lehman Brothers, the bank went bankrupt, and to her emaciated director general Dick Fuld in all familiarity, as if he was languishing at a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the doorman in uniform, almost 50 years old from my condo, has changed the subject from our normal conversational argument about Brad and Angelina or the delivery of my expense.
She told me, after my visit to the bank, "Now I have all my savings in market funds!.
I've changed, I'm not taking any chances."
Muslim falls profaned while Austria turns right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, to the left of the Austrian right wing of the Freedom Party and Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right party Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration to present the organization "City Against Islamization" in Antwerp, Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry signals like those road representatives mosques with a red line passing through the middle.
The police blamed the right-wing extremists for desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same week that the far-right political parties gained much in the national general elections.
More than 90 graves were severely damaged at the Traun cemetery near Linz in a few hours between Friday night and this morning, in what the police believe was an organized action.
The culprits traced Jewish symbols like David's Star spray over some graves, but the detectives believe it may have been an attempt to mask extremist motivations driven by hatred for Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is somehow linked to the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said that they were "deeply shocked" by the news of the desecration, which took place towards the end of Ramadan, a month of religious significance for Muslims.
Austria has meanwhile embarked on a journey of spiritual research following its right turn in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two extreme right-wing parties that took almost 30% of the votes, the Austrian Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, ran a campaign with vehemently anti-immigration tickets and some of their slogans were defined by xenophobic critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the vote, campaigned against veils and burkas and also expressed opposition to foods that are perceived as related to Islam.
At the final meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties seem to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, claiming that they are political symbols of a continuous Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses carried out immediately after the elections, which established the far right as the nation's strongest political bloc, indicating that the change was led predominantly by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
I'm off-limits to Gary Glitter.
Gary Glitter, the glamorous rock star guilty of sexual abuse of minors, has been banned from travelling to France and Spain from court.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he had informed the authorities controlling him that he wanted to go to Spain from France.
The ban on foreign travel was granted to the Kent police last Thursday after it had provided the magistrates with proof of Glitter's previous arrests for sexual abuse of minors.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadi, was not present at the Ashford pretura hearing in Kent but was represented by Corker Binning's lawyers.
A spokesman for the Court Service said: "Thursday, September 25 at Ashford Prefecture, Kent police filed a request to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from travelling abroad to France and Spain until March 25th.
"Paul Gadd was not present in person."
Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad as requested by the sex offender registry.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days.
He is also requested to give the police a seven-day notice of his scheduled departure date.
Failure to notify the authority may lead to a sentence of five years in prison.
Kent police said they didn't want to discuss Glitter's individual cases or possible movements to the country.
A spokesman for Kent police said: "Kent police will do whatever it takes to protect children in this country or abroad.
"From our point of view, it's easier to control someone who stays in the UK because we have the right complete systems to manage any potential risks more effectively.
"Protecting Kent residents is the main concern of Kent police and we work closely to monitor the behaviour of convicted sex offenders registered in the country to minimize any possible risk to the public.
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two 10- and 11-year-old girls.
When Glitter came he flew to Bangkok where he was supposed to board a flight to London.
But he said he felt sick and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities would not have let him go through passport control and eventually took a flight to Hong Kong.
Even the Chinese authorities did not let him in and returned to Bangkok where Thai police and immigration officers insisted on returning to England.
Finally, he arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 on 22 August and remained there as his lawyer David Corker went to Uxbridge Prefecture, west of London, since Scotland Yard had successfully applied for an order to place him in the register of convicted sex offenders.
Glitter had previously been imprisoned in the UK in 1999 for possessing images of child abuse.
A source from the Interior Ministry said that Jacqui Smith, the Interior Secretary, felt reassured and happy that Glitter had been stopped from travelling to France and Spain.
"Photograph the master away from the scene to extract his character" Günther Bauer, photographer
No heels, no flying, no clothes from before.
Only the essence of the great masters of flamenco, stripped of the concentration that characterizes the interpretation, to look at the relaxed appearance of man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, the person.
Two inseparable faces, except in private, in those moments far from the public, when the intimacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen gaze or the expressiveness of the hands, are natural because they do not have to go on stage.
The German Günther Bauer in "Flamenco-People" alternates the theatricality of some shots to singers, dancers and guitarists on stage with the lesser known side of these masters.
With this objective, the photographer offers an original iconography of flamenco, taking it from different visual angles.
The exhibition, included in the program of the Flemish Photography Month, reflects the international importance of this dance, every day increasing," explains the artist and clarifies that in "Flamenco-People" it could also be common people, but seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists, performers or performers on the scene.
These people portrayed "on the street" are "artists able to convey passion, sadness, joy when they are on stage ... and capture the public.
To capture the personality of these greats it is not necessary to portray them on stage,
because their personality and character are inner.
What I was interested in was creating an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture with the camera the personality of the great flamenco."
With the passion for the festival "Cante de las Minas", Bauer began in 1997 a long journey aimed at portraying singers, guitarists or dancers using a ballast camera.
They are portraits that, because of the type of machine and the material, recall classical photography.
The application of different stylistic techniques breaks with the traditional principles of the image, giving the photo modernity, according to an idea that reflects Bauer's own conception of flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and is able to surprise every day."
Not dancing, singing or playing in itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, able to conquer the public with his art.
The search for an encounter with the essential elements, with the magic that becomes visible in a certain way of feeling and being, are and have been the constant of this work, on display these days at the El Fotómata gallery.
Famous flamenco artists such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are included in this selection of about seventy artists portraits.
The project has become a kind of anthology of flamenco, and will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits exhibited during the exhibition.
The passion for portraits led Bauer to repeat the idea two years ago with "Veteran athlete portraits" ("SportARTproject").
Although in "Flamenco-People" the concept is different, the photographer admits "I love to portray people, to know them and to be able to penetrate for a moment in their lives, whether this is a long or short moment.
I think portraiting is the hardest kind of thing in photography.
You meet or compare with people, characters you sometimes don't even know or who only give you a few minutes to take the picture.
Beyond these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to put my ideas into practice."
The collection of portraits of contemporary flamenco, entitled "Flamenco-people" is set up at the gallery El Fotómata, at number 20 of via de la Mata, parallel to via Alameda de Hercules, and will be open to the public until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa reveals that the novel she's writing is a "wrong"
It is set in places that it still does not know and deals with unknown topics: despite this, Mario Vargas Llosa is struggling with a new project to which he is working, a novel whose protagonist, Roger Casemant, is an Irish nationalist who lived twenty years in Congo and crossed the Amazon.
Ever favorite for the Nobel Prize for Literature, the writer confessed yesterday on the occasion of the Hay Festival in Segovia, that the project he is working on today "is a gamble" and that "everything indicates that I shouldn't write it."
"If I had common sense, I wouldn't write it, but I will do it the same and I hope to finish it as soon as possible," he concluded his speech at the festival for the exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that for four days he saw pass through the city of the Aqueduct a hundred writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people.
The author of "La ciudad y los canros" was, as expected, the leading figure at the third edition of the word festival.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival award to be the most voted writer by the participants – an ancient edition of Dickens' book "Our Mutual Friend", filled the places of the Juan Bravo Theatre.
Presented by Félix Romeo, the writer found himself in front of an audience to which he flew the time when the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with great doses of humor, recalled as he was born the literary vocation, derived from the "extraordinary adventure" of the "pleasure to read" and "to live beyond what I lived"; as he writes in "disciplined mode" to supplicate the "lack of inspiration", with an intense work of documentation, writing and continuous remake; as Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas have influenced his vocation and as "images of memory" are the basis on which his stories rest.
The Spanish-American novelist, he recognized that "there is no way" to measure and know whether books can change people's lives, "but I refuse to believe that literature is a pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience," stressed Vargas Llosa, arguing that, on the contrary, it "has effects" and that it "makes people more unconformist." That is why he invited writers to "do not give in to frivolousness" and to "take responsibility" for their vocation.
Time hinders the Pozoblanco Festival, depriving it of the corridors
The celebration of the runners that should have sealed the days of the Pozoblanco Festival was suspended yesterday morning, after the towers selected for the runners had verified that the ground conditions of the square were not adequate.
Therefore, the company, in agreement with Fermin Bohorquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernandez, decided to suspend the celebration of the race.
The weather has been raging against this Festival, preventing it from celebrating two out of three days.
On Saturday, the rain prevented the second bullfight.
The posters included Jose Luis Moreno, Curro Diaz and Juan Bautista, who were supposed to face a bull from Castilblanco.
Therefore, the Festival was held regularly only on Friday.
On this occasion it was Daniel Luque who triumphed, cutting off three ears and being brought out in triumph, after having tasted and aesthetics.
The same afternoon Alejandro Talavante finished his two runs collecting greetings and an ear, granted more by the public than by virtue of the bullfight itself.
The worst of all was El Juli, passing from the Los Llanos arena without glory and without pain.
With the second bull, after a tremendous mule, he earned the whistles of most of the audience.
A van with two thousand kilos of hashish overtakes the lockout in Alava
Five minus ten in the morning.
The officers subdue the two occupants of a van that instead of stopping they give themselves to the escape.
The officers subpoenaed the two occupants of a van that instead of stopping they fled.
Their cargo, more than two tons of hashish, is a good reason not to stop.
The officers after chasing them, manage to arrest one of the two occupants, a man about 28 years old, identified as A.A.J., according to the statement of the Basque Government's Department of Interior.
The arrested individual is charged with drug trafficking and falsification of public documents.
The incident occurred when some officials on the Alava road were carrying out a transport check on the N-1 at the point where it crosses the municipality of Armiñon.
They were about to stop a van for inspection when the driver, violating orders, abruptly accelerated and passed the lockout.
The officers chased each other until the vehicle, after a couple of kilometres, stopped at the edge of the road and its two occupants fled to a forested area.
The Ertzaintza agents then managed to arrest one of the fugitives and seize the 2,178 kilograms of hash that they were carrying and took note of once they inspected the van, an Iveco Daily.
The hashish panets, which were located in the rear of the vehicle, were subsequently placed in police custody for a thorough investigation and weight detection.
Moreover, since the officials found that the matriculation had been "duplicated" as it did not coincide with the one reported in the van documentation, the arrest was also charged with the offence of falsifying public documents.
The Ertzaintza is continuing its investigations to arrest the second suspect, who managed to escape as already said, and to determine the origin of the seized drug.
The 28-year-old prisoner A.A.J. was taken to the police station to perform the appropriate procedures and be available to the judge in the next few hours.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the influence of drugs
Actress Heather Locklear, the Amanda of the popular Melrose Place series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the effect of drugs.
A witness saw her perform risky maneuvers while trying to get out of the car from the parking lot in Montecito, as revealed to People magazine by a California street spokesman.
The witness said that around 4:30 p.m. the Locklear "knocked the accelerator thoroughly, making a lot of noise, and trying to get the car out of the parking lot with sudden manoeuvres back and forth. By making a setback, he passed several times in front of his sunglasses."
Shortly afterwards, the witness, who apparently had not recognized the actress at first sight, saw that Locklear had stopped on a nearby road and had left the vehicle.
It was this person who alerted the emergency services, because "she was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived, she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which partially blocked the road.
"She seemed confused," and for this reason the officers took her to a specialist drug and alcohol centre for testing.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was collaborative and the hypothesis of alcohol excess was discarded from the beginning, although "according to what the officers initially observed, we believe Locklear was under the effect of some medication."
Locklear was arrested with the suspicion of driving under the effect of some unspecified substance and was locked in the local prison around 19.00, to be released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear was re-established by a specialist clinic in Arizona after she was admitted after an episode of anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian federation of the IU to assume its responsibilities in the Silva case
The general coordinator of the UI and member of the Izquierda Unita party, Gaspar Llamazares, confirmed today that it will be for the regional federation of training to make a decision on the case of the former councillor for Youth and Sport of the municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week following the accusation of clientelism.
"In these cases I am particularly federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that has to assume its responsibilities," he said regarding the resolution that the party will have to adopt with regard to what it has been to date as a councillor in Seville.
However, the leader of the UI stressed the need for "transparency" in all possible investigations regarding the irregularities that Silva would have committed. "The UI has always wanted this kind of investigation to be as transparent as possible."
He also stressed that training is regulated by "very strict ethical codes for all public offices."
"Blood of May", the epic bet of Garci
Inspired by the National Episodes of Benito Pérez Galdós, Jose Luis Garci reproposes in Sangre de Mayo the famous revolt of the Spanish against the French, in what is the most ambitious film of his filmography, with almost 15 million euros of budget.
With this film, the director tried to "illustrate the torrent of characters and at the same time the social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutierrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of a large cast of interpreters.
Blood de maio, more than two and a half hours long, debuts this Friday in the cinema halls, to become in the future a mini television series of more than four hours on TeleMadrid.
A great admirer of Galdós' literature, Jose Luis Garci claims to have made with this film "a dream of his childhood", and believes that he should thank Esperanza Aguirre, who from the Community of Madrid had commissioned him three years before filming a commemorative film for the second centenary of May 2. The director had accepted that the story of based on the novel Episodios Nacionales.
The 15 million budgets allocated by the Community of Madrid have represented for Garci a "one-of-a-kind opportunity" to recreate the scenes and the appropriate costumes to portray a "stunned Spain that misjudged the choice of leader to fight for and the fact that the struggle for independence led the people to a huge delay in development under the reign of Ferdinand VII" Garci observed.
However, the director regrets that he did not receive funding equal to those of Alatriste or Los ghosts de Goya - more than twice as much as Sangre de maio, so it was not possible to shoot some scenes provided by the screenplay that he himself had signed together with Horacio Valcarcel, a collaborator of almost his entire career.
This, for the director of Volver to begin, has influenced what is his usual work practice, the staging with the actors, with whom he often uses to try before shooting with those who will not be part of the cast, because he considers it "humiliating," considering that "part of the director's work resides in going to theatre and cinema to know what is happening in the field in which he works."
Many of the interpreters, part of whom are part of the cast of Sangre de maio, try in front of his car, as in the case of Michael Rell, Carlos Larranaga or Fernando Guillen Cuervo.
Candidate at the Oscar for four times - winning one - Garci believes that none of the three films candidates to represent Spain this year at the Hollywood Academy - his Blood of May, Seven tables of French billiards and, the last selected Los gironasoles blinds - do not represent the younger generation of Spanish cinema "which should instead be known."
This movie Garci doesn't expect prizes.
"At first you think you work for the poster, then you realize that you only work for prosperity, and at some point you conform to simply shooting one more film," explains Garci after more than 30 years of career.
Isabel Bayon rediscovers the Seville essence of the dancer Tortola Valencia
A Seville dancer pays tribute to another Seville dancer.
Carmen Valencia Tortola, Catalan father (Florence Tortola Ferrer) and Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district, and at the age of three moved with the family to London.
She was a free dance dancer and a specialist in oriental dances.
She led a fascinating life and was a pioneer of female emancipation, the calibre of Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
He was a Buddhist and vegetarian, and defended the cause for the abolition of the corset that prevented women from moving freely.
The life of this woman, who marked a revolution in dance and aesthetics in Europe between the two wars, has always fascinated Isabel Bayon.
"I would have liked to work with Pepa Gamboa and she offers me this character. I seemed incredible."
She says: "We do not intend to tell her whole life, but to gather the spirit.
The titles of his dances have suggested some basic elements of flamenco.
So, "the butterfly dance" suggested a guajira, or "the snake dance" some tangos.
Her dance was sensual and I was told that my way of dancing is also part of this aesthetic," she explains.
The staging includes two exceptional contributions: that of Miguel Poveda, who will again sing Isabel in one of his shows, as he does in "The Open Door"; and that of the teacher Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to work with what had been his pupil.
"Matilde plays Tortola as an adult, the character of maturity.
I am happy because he has agreed to work in my work and I feel very honored about this."
The arrangement also includes the musical composition and guitarists such as Jesus Torres and Paco Arriaga, the song of Miguel Ortega, the Pulga y Moi di Morón; the percussions of El Pájaro, as well as the purple of Rafa La Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfran Juárez "who plays the role of eternal companion of these artists who have been dive to all round, and who have always had many exhilarants."
In the work there is also in some form the life of this woman who takes place in distant places, especially for that time, such as India, the United States or Russia, and then all of Europe, because, usually, she lived in London.
"I wanted to remind her, because I think she is one of the women who have had a huge influence in a given historical period and now no one remembers her and even less regards her work as something of value," says Bayon.
The show will begin today at 8.30 p.m. at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
With the publication of the "Diario de un poete nouvelle married" the Triennio also closes
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Diario de un Poeta Reciencasado" at the church of Saint Stephen (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Council for Culture of the Junta of Andalusia to celebrate the "Triennio di Zenobia e Juan Ramon" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize for literature and that of the death of both.
Thus, the "Triennio di Zenobia e Juan Ramon" ends with the re-edition of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel house-museum and with the travelling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: Aquel copo de luz", which was inaugurated last May and which, after touching the various provinces of Andalusia, is expected to arrive in New York in conjunction with the International Congress.
In addition, the Associato alla Cultura della Junta dell'Andalusia has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Diario de un Poeta Reciencasado", edited by Pietro Tabernero and illustrated by James Perez-Enciso, in order to continue the dissemination of the figure and work of one of the most valuable Andalusian poets.
America likes it a little less without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of these."
The phrase is by actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "Ausencia de malicia" and gives the idea of the impotence of American cinema, and of all America, in the face of the shocking idea that Newman left.
Yet it cost him a lot to give him an Oscar.
And since 2007 he has been retired.
And it was also known that he was very sick.
Despite this, it was a very hard blow for everyone.
"Sometimes what a taste goes beyond any expression, and I have now lost a great friend," Robert Redford cried, "my life and my country could have been better because of its existence."
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or overreacting.
A father of cinema and country died at a particularly dark moment, for fear of terrorists and markets, with self-esteem from the American people on land, in desperate search of new motivations to feel worthy.
When times are so difficult, men so without virtue and remain well people to admire, you don't need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, it embodied the platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official opponent of Richard Nixon and defender of lost and won causes, from the foundation for the fight against drugs created in honor of the firstborn deceased of overdose to the creation of the brand of domestic and organic food.
All gifts to a country where it has cost a lot to go beyond a suicidal food culture.
The wave of admiration went beyond Hollywood, without taking care of either nationality or passports.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, observed that a man did not die, it ended an era.
Another Englishman, Sam Mendes, Oscar-winning director, said that working with Newman was nothing less than the height of his career.
The bad guy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to define Paul Newman as his greatest inspiration.
"He left a very high example for all of us," says George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who is trying to live as Paul Newman did today: keeping in high regard the need for uprightness and having a serious and distant private life on the cameras.
This is not always easy or possible in today's media jungle.
However, some are trying and Paul Newman is a good example for them.
He divorced once but remained married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he remained faithful, although he certainly did not lack the opportunity to be.
"Why do I go out to eat burgers today, if I have a steak in my house?" he used to joke.
In heaven he is accompanied by the pride that on earth his daughters are also his admirers, which is not so common in America.
"Among all the great roles he played, no one was as proud as that of a devoted husband, loving father, anxious grandfather and passionate philanthropist," they say.
The imperfect race of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that sooner or later the Olympics will be held in Madrid and, after the failed attempt for 2012, this could happen in 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday's race, I'd say no!
They called it the "perfect race," but in my opinion it was by far the worst I've ever seen.
A lot of nonsense, that if they were to be taken into account later in the evaluation and I had to examine them, the answer would be absolutely negative.
But let's go by order and start from the beginning.
The nonsense began with the withdrawal of the dorsal, which assumed that he would leave first.
It didn't seem like a bad idea, but if you are forced to go, it is to remove everything (including the chip to avoid the queues during the race).
No, you don't.
You had to go just to get the dorsal (first foolishness, go just for that) and (after its tail), surprise! they had only 'S' size shirts (second foolishness, because I need an XL size).
What world do we live in?
Is it because of the crisis that they decided to buy only small shirts made with less fabric and therefore less expensive?
Well, things like that are inept compared to the very day of the race.
Besides having to go very soon to pick up the chip, the queue was 15 minutes and, moreover, you had to deposit the backpack.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible for a race expected more than 11,000 people.
So, as was foreseeable, the race began that we had not even deposited the backpack, although, once successful in the venture, the recovery turned out to be even worse.
In addition, the rain threatened the wait of more than 40 minutes, to which were added attempts of popular rebellion and assault at the stand.
In at least 500 people tomorrow we will certainly have pneumonia, and some, like me, will not even be in the correct order ranking because of the chip that, I suppose, did not correctly record the arrival.
In the future, if they ask me about the perfect race, this will certainly not fit into my thoughts.
So I think we'll continue to dream of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft search receptionist (virtual)
At the MIT conference on emerging technologies, Microsoft presented a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a kind of artificial intelligence, but without much intelligence, able to perform some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or, in the case illustrated by Microsoft, a shuttle service to travel within the company's campus) assisting the telephone user.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of shapes and faces, this "receptionist" is able to know how many people there are in a room, who are - including remembering their position in the company - and to listen and understand the keywords in a conversation with them.
You can also group those present in conversation groups.
In the example video the receptionist detects a third person, but understands that he does not belong to the group he is talking to and that he is not an employee of the society.
He asks her if she's there to visit someone and tells her she'll be available soon.
Everything without a blue screen.
Impressive.
But this, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better to focus on, for example on the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week we talked a lot about a change of strategy in Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer discovered that if computers were equipped with essential functions and less loaded with commercial trash, they would go five times faster – hey! Steve, it will be at least.
All a discovery, if you consider that Microsoft, version after version has continuously added to Windows functionality and "extra".
The change of direction is appreciable.
Microsoft is right: the operating system is losing more and more importance, and with it the software.
When Google launched Chrome into the network, I was one of those who supported the theory that was Google's first step in competing with Windows.
Many rightly point out that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is an essential element for hardware and software to communicate.
Do the same job as your wife or husband when you have something to say to your mother-in-law.
That's right.
It will never disappear, but perhaps it is necessary to think of the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute, but relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system, and more and more to the web browser.
You take your computer just to launch Explorer or Firefox - or Chrome - and we spend more time browsing the network daily than in a remote window environment.
What is the use of half the applications of the operating system?
It's less than that.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less Vista.
Less heavy, less overloaded, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services into a valid alternative to Google.
They have a desperate need, in fact, and I have a small example here.
I took the photo inserted in this post in one of Microsoft's recreation rooms in Redmond at the beginning of this month.
On the beverage machine a sign asks them to use their own search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees use Google to search online.
Last week, moreover, the delay in developing the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was confirmed.
It will not be placed on the market in the first months of 2009, but probably at the end of the year, if not even in 2010.
Microsoft will definitely try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together.
The cell phone, after all, is becoming more and more a computer.
But the delay, with Android and iPhone already on the market, is criminalizing.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso took her to the French Riviera, Leonardo di Caprio shined in Edward Zwick's 'Diamante de sangre', as well as Francis Ford Coppola's Al Pacino in 'The Godfather' as well as being part of the typical uniform of the muscular gay parish.
And if we try to list the appearances of the stars, we can recall the image of the fork with the pointed mustaches that lift the weights in the walking circus.
In essence, it is the typical man's shirt, with the inside of cotton, strapped and sleeveless.
It is the 'tank', as the Anglophones call it, although the Belgian Fabulous Marcel stands out above all.
The "Marcel" excels over the others for the high quality of the cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive coat of arms and for the small Belgian flag (just recognizable), which the most emblematic models of the shirt carry as a detail on the neck.
The "Marcel" excels over the others for the high quality of cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive coat of arms and for the small Belgian flag (just recognizable), which the most emblematic T-shirt models carry as a detail on the neck.
And be careful, because the production of the Belgian company does not concern only the famous "tank".
It also includes college sweatshirts, retro boxer, cashmere cardigan, cotton pants, sailor shirts, baby dolls, mini shorts...
Intimate garments designed to be comfortable.
And it's a shame to use them as underwear.
They're too beautiful.
"I want to be a young mom, the candidate doesn't worry me"
The great similarity with her sister did not prevent her from developing her personality.
Monica Cruz is small, but full of vitality.
Today, the Cruz sisters have taken their new fashion activity very seriously.
For Monica, they're a lot more than beautiful girls and celebrities who name themselves.
It was in Paris for the promotion that the firm Mango made of its new headquarters, in addition to the presentation of the most important prizes that the Spanish fashion company sponsors.
Warm and shy, he'll get you fast.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I designed for the fall-winter season of Mango, as well as to participate in the presentation of the second edition of the Mango Fashion Awards and dinner at the Opera in honor of Valentino.
Let's say, a very intense day, but at the same time, exciting.
From what elements does your new collection for Mango start in this fourth season of work for the Spanish house?
Both my sister and I like the movies of the '50s and '60s, from here we get various inspirations.
Then, I love to get lost in the city and watch as women dress, as they combine and mix their clothes. I often do.
Ballerina, actress and stylist, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, even if in the end, everything converges and there are many elements in common.
When I was a little girl, they liked clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother's house to search my aunt's closets and see her clothes.
It was a bomb, even better than going to the playground.
Then, once a dancer, I always paid a lot of attention to dress.
It is known that dancers really like to have their own style to go to class and to the wise, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of actress, when you are handed the wardrobe is the moment when you really meet the character.
So, everything goes together, yes, with great respect for stylists and professionalism.
Not long ago, you turned 30, you got into a crisis?
But no.
Never heard better, I like the idea of 30 years.
I find that at that age women are mature and have a good experience to savor life by making fewer mistakes.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I've done the things I've wanted since I was a little girl, and that has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So, do you think you're going to be a mother or not?
Of course, I know I'm going to be a mother because my own body asks me and I also want to be a young mother, this I don't want to miss.
As for the candidate, I don't worry too much.
What I will do will be to give my son much happiness and to educate him with much love.
As far as cinema is concerned, you're waiting for some films shot last year to appear in different rooms.
That's right, and I really want them to get out.
Being a woman who comes from the theater, I am very impatient and restless, I would like everything immediately and clearly, but it cannot always be so.
I want you to come out "The Last Hour" and "En search de la tomba de Cristo".
Let's see if you like them.
A few days ago you debuted on the catwalk with Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, don't say that.
It's not like I was on the catwalk as a model.
Just Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for a long time, called me to invite me to London to attend a charity show for her organization "Women for a Better World" and the clothes we have exhibited – I brought two pieces of our collection for Mango – were auctioned to raise funds for this Naomi NGO.
People don't know this tender side of Naomi.
So much is said about her, that I who have known her for a long time can confirm that they are not so true.
Also, I find myself with this good part in which you are involved.
He asked me to parade for a noble cause, but if he asked me to be a pine tree, I would have done it anyway.
If it's to help women in the third world, you can't back off.
Reciprocated drivers of alcoholism will have to install the "alcolock"
The Ministry of Internal Affairs requires drivers with three administrative penalties for excessive alcohol in their blood, to install in their car the system that prevents the vehicle from driving in a state of drunkenness or if it does not blow in the appropriate device.
The measure was announced last June and is already included in the annual report of the Attorney General's Office, according to which it will be a one-year pilot project.
The purpose of this project is to reintegrate the driver, since he will have to attend a rehabilitation course on the road.
In addition to the General Prosecutor's Office for Road Safety, the General Directorate of Traffic (DGT) and the Technological Institute for Automobile Safety (FITSA) will participate in this initiative.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of drivers reported more than once for drunk driving then return to drive the car.
The alcoholic would avoid this, because it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the alcohol rate in the breathed air and prevents the car from being started if the driver does not blow, or when a higher alcohol concentration is detected than the permitted one.
The cost is more than EUR 1000 and would be borne by the sanctioned person.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with such devices can reduce up to 65% of infringements committed during the first year of introduction.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save the lives of 115 people a year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to stop these behaviours before they become criminal offences.
And in order to facilitate its development, since the legal reform can be carried out on an ordinary basis, and without a doubt the necessary reform for the criminal procedure would require an organic law.
However, the device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial solution, although it has already been introduced experimentally in some industrial and public vehicles.
Just tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote for an initiative of the PSOE in which it intends to install this system in the buses of schools, as has already been done in France.
In Mexico, and without "peep-toes"
With British punctuality, at 1740, the second program, the Spanish plane in which the principles of Asturias were travelling landed in the presidential hangar at Benito Juárez Airport in Mexico City.
The sun was setting but the rays still forced to use their hand as a visor to see the royal couple get off the plane.
At the foot of the steps, the Spanish ambassador and the other authorities.
A few hours earlier I had asked a taxi driver, on the street, if he knew that the Spanish princes were going to visit the city to formalize an official trip.
- Ah, very well, so you won't be able to go to the airport to load people at that time... you're from here or...
No, no, sir, you're Spanish, but you lived here for a couple of years.
- Ah, very well...
The Mexican press, on the other hand, knows very well who the principles of Asturias are and the importance of the journey.
There are many who wait in the airport hangar crushed to the red carpet and the military cordon composed of 27 marines who offer the greeting of honour.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in navy blue, and she, the princess, clad in the wind, very sober, does not use her usual "peep-toes," perhaps they told her that Mexico City was threatening bad weather.
They give the photographers a smile and a short stop before passing in the hall where the official committee awaits them.
At the door of the hotel where they are staying, one of the four largest in the city, a witty Mexican television reporter awaits them.
The best prize offered by fashion
There is probably no place in the world more appropriate to present a fashion award, than Paris and probably there is no more exquisite designer and bont vivan of Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, to promote the international promotion of new talent in fashion.
It offers a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at his drawings in Mango's showcase at 54 Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and almost cried from emotion.
Moreover, it is the second largest company store in Europe and has just been opened with 1,335 square meters of extension.
The first is in London.
The many events, together with the desire to please the designer Valentino who presided over the jury of the competition, began with a luxury dinner at Opera Garnier in Paris.
With the proximity of Chagal's most exquisite canvases, the presidential gala table prepared by Mango, was even more spectacular.
Born, with his heart broken and making virtue necessary, due to the recent death of his brother, he wore a dress of the House and some complements of ELAH to take off his breath and to the arm of his son Luis - a boy of almost two meters high - accompanied Valentino to the presidency of the tribute dinner.
Andik, owner and lord of Mango, did the honors of home and knight who ended up, along with Baron Rotchil, without a jacket, because they had both sold them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who managed the shop in pants and shirt – drawn with her hand – turned for dinner, wearing a very sensual long black dress and was thrilled during the night walk accompanied by Goya Toledo inside the work, when they showed us the hall for ballet essays and she, remembering other times, grabbed a bar and sketched a "big fold".
Inés Sastre did not stop for the walk in the premises of the palace, but he showed us his son's photos on his cell phone earlier.
The next day we rejoiced at the presence of Olivier Martinez – another youngster moving on the bike – and John Travolta, who had arrived at the Hotel Intercontinental in Paris, with his sheets, his towels and having made sure beforehand, that there were no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh, that's life.
1001, the anti-stress number
There are not 1,000 but 1,000 and a way to forget the chaotic and frantic daily life.
And as if that wasn't enough, they're all collected in a book that will bring relaxation to the bookstores on September 30.
The alarm clock is almost a punishment when it rings every morning at 7, but it is even worse to imagine being involved in the frantic rhythm dictated by modern life.
The office is called tension and the computer has a backache.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
However, there are neither one nor two methods to combat everyday exhaustion and the fatigue of getting rid of the world of work.
No, this number amounts to nothing more and nothing less than 1001.
Beyond yoga positions, classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott collects in the pages of her book, a whole "menu" of tailor-made options for each person's taste and time.
The anti-stress work is entitled "1001 ways to relax" and its calm will reach the bookstores thanks to the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone believes that it is not possible to conquer calm in areas such as work or personal relationships, this "manual" denies this conviction.
In addition, it suggests alternative solutions, such as being in contact with nature, or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenaline does not already flow into your veins to regain body balance and stress has become a problem, it is time to sit on the couch, turn off your mind and focus on reading.
Talking in your sleep
Some children talk during the night.
I am not referring to those who wake up very anxious to tell us something that happened to them the day before, but to those children who talk while falling asleep.
The first time it happens, at most you get a scare, but it doesn't really matter much.
This is a benign alteration of sleep called sleepyloquia.
It manifests with a certain frequency, especially in children and adolescents.
Surely, most of you have been told that you have spoken in your sleep.
This phenomenon can occur in a very sporadic way (once in life, for example associated with a high fever episode) or with greater regularity (every day, once a week, once a month ...), the day after the baby remembers nothing.
There is no single reason why this phenomenon can be explained.
Sometimes they are episodes related to other sleep disorders such as nightmares, night fears, night enuresis (to pee in bed), or sleepwalking, but not necessarily so.
As mentioned above, it can be associated with very high fever levels, stress or overcrowded situations.
In any case, it is a phenomenon that has not yet been studied.
The intensity with which it appears is also extremely variable.
It can happen that the person speaks with a very quiet tone of voice, with loose words, almost in a whisper or that the opposite happens (cry, scream, long speeches ...).
In cases where the event is particularly intense, it would be appropriate to observe the child and possibly consult a specialist to check if there is any issue that is generating an abnormal state of anxiety as a release to the situation.
We have said that this is a benign alteration so there is no treatment unless it is associated with other sleep disorders that can be treated (for example, if coupled with insomnia or stress).
What can be done, however, is to take into account a series of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child too much before he goes to sleep.
Propose quiet games and avoid programs or television series that arouse fear or suggest violence.
With very nervous children for whom it is difficult to relax, you can use relaxation techniques to help them acquire some inner calm.
This will allow the child to sleep more comfortably.
Once the sleepyos appear, try to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day will remember nothing of what happened.
Useful tips
Don't wake him up.
It is useless, because he is not aware of what is happening, and you would interrupt his sleep.
Although he's talking, he's sleeping and so he's resting.
Remember that if you appear very distressed and episodes have a certain frequency it is better to consult a doctor or check where such great anxiety comes from in the child.
If you understand what he says (which is not the most common situation), do not fall into the temptation to question him for information.
You will get nothing, because he is asleep and therefore not conscious to organize his thought.
In addition, you are able to hear what it says but not see what it is dreaming to say, so you need to pay close attention to the interpretation of the information and the conclusions to which it may lead.
Don't ever tell the child that you could ask him any questions during the night to know his secrets.
Not even a joke.
Something like this is causing enormous anguish.
In short, don't worry, it's nothing serious, it's an episode that only lasts a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
The Illhaeusern finally found the way to victory at home after a long, unfruitful period.
Without playing a formidable game, the Yellow-Blacks have created the greatest number of networking opportunities by turning one into the victory of the game.
The pace was not very sustained during this meeting in which the attackers expressed themselves hard.
After a first attempt by the captain of the host team Kauffmann who hit the seven with a shot from a distance, the Illhaeusern began to have the best and one after the other provoked the defense of the Dannemarie, Fonderflick from afar, then Hirn high, Romain peak and still Diebold.
The Dannemarie responded with a block to the center of the field, leaving only the unleashed Riahi at the point of attack.
The beginning of the second half was decisive with two initial occasions signed Riahi and Temporale for the Dannemarie, and soon after the first Marais network for the Illhaeusern, well positioned, picked up a ball rejected on a first attempt of Diebold (53').
But the Illhaeusern gunman will not be able to enjoy his happiness for long and will be expelled a dozen minutes later leaving his teammates in numerical inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not be able to take advantage of it and will not put great problems to the Eleven of the Illhaeusern, backed back just to "strengthen up" the defense, except in the last minutes of play when, after a rock-rock action, the ball rubbed the cross.
Sarkozy meets the fishermen in anger
Before leaving for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a stop in Brittany.
Before the demonstration of the fishermen who on Monday brutally prevented access to several Breton and Norman ports, the President of the Republic decided to go Tuesday morning to the port of Guilvinec, in the department of Finistère, to enchant its representatives.
The latter have promised to accept it "in a constructive spirit" and hope that "they will present themselves with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit that takes place at the same time as the general meeting of the "crisis committee", created by the Breton fishermen in order to take measures to cope with the surge in the price of diesel, which has reached its record with an average of more than €1.14 per litre.
According to Elisha David Martinon, the president "will discuss with them possible solutions to help companies regain competitiveness and to make the working conditions and the remuneration of sailors safe".
The fishermen are waiting for Nicolas Sarkozy to stand still.
Tuesday morning, they conducted "slumak operations" in Morbihan and Calvados, causing almost 10 km of congestion.
Even the port of Quiberon has been blocked, but connections to Belle-île have not been interrupted.
A roadblock was set up on the Quiberon peninsula.
On Monday the sailors have already demonstrated their determination by burning, starting at dawn, tyres and pallets in front of the fuel tanks at the ports of Brest and Lorient, while taking foot demonstrations in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement extended towards the ports of the Atlantic coast and the Channel, such as Sables d'Olonne, in Vendée, where the fishing boats remained at the dock, or in Havre, where about twenty boats prevented the movement of commercial ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe et del Croisic, near the Loire Atlantica, interrupted in the evening the blockade of the famous Total refinery of Donges.
In Boulogne-sur-Mer they decided to wait for the meeting to be held on Wednesday at the Ministry to decide on any actions.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" will in fact decide on Tuesday the future actions of the movement and the possible participation in the meeting planned at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by officials of the National Fisheries Committee, who did not support the movement.
"The strike will continue" because "fishers will not give in" and "they will not move to Paris", he announced, for example, Liliane Cariou, chairman of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel, currently pay about 50 cents per litre, but estimate that the yield limit of a boat is only reached with a diesel less than €0.30 per litre.
Paul Newman the magnificent
The unforgettable interpreter of "Butch Cassidy" died of cancer, at the age of 83, in his home in Connecticut.
Hillary et Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and yet Sam Mendes greeted the film legend and committed actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains delivery forecast in 2008
The airline company has 215 deliveries this year, despite the threats of recession that weigh on the world economy.
Embraer, the fourth largest company in the industry, maintains delivery forecasts for 2008 with the delivery of 215 aircraft, confirmed its president Fredrico Fleury Curado.
During the first half of the year, it delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian company relies heavily on the Chinese market, especially for the range of aircraft between 30 and 120 seats.
So far, Embraer has delivered 41 aircraft to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would cede more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group insurance company, re-established by the US monetary authorities, would cede more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the 85 billion dollar loan, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
The AIG is ready to consider the sale of much of its assets, in addition to the sale of life insurance branches to the international market and to the United States, the newspaper specifies on the basis of more than authoritative sources.
The Board of Directors of the AIG met on Sunday evening to consider any divestitures, according to the FT.
No confirmation was obtained from the AIG.
The activities that the AIG intends to divest include the international leasing subsidiary Lease Financial Corp., its 59% share of Transatlantic Holdings as well as its real estate portfolio and its private equity investments, adds the FT.
No definitive decision has been taken on such divestitures, the FT continues.
The AIG must quickly obtain liquidity in order to repay the loan of 85 billion concession from the Federal Reserve, at the cost of seeing the US authorities take 80% of its capital.
Paris: Morning Meeting History
The New York Stock Exchange accused a historic collapse on Monday, after the House of Representatives spoke out against the Paulson plan for the rescue of financial institutions: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a drop never seen, approaching 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Media (DJIA) finished at 10.365.45, down from 777.68 points.
In terms of points, the worst loss in its history (684.81 points) is greater than that of 17 September 2001, the day of the re-opening of the Stock Exchanges following the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The Nasdaq, the index of the main technological titles, lost 199.61 points closing at 1,983.73 and the extended Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points) closing at 1,106.55, according to definitive closing figures.
Demoralized at the beginning of the session, Wall Street collapsed after the unexpected rejection of the bank's bailout plan, designed to bring stability back to markets.
By 228 votes to the plan and 205 in favour, the representatives rejected the funding requested by Treasury Minister Henry Paulson.
About two out of three Republicans rejected the plan.
"It's a negative signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"All this signals how much the market counted on the project," he added, fearing that in a few days it might already be "too late" to adopt one.
"If the project were actually dying (...) then the witness would be quickly passed to the Fed – Federal Reserve – (the US central bank, ndr) and other central banks to solve the crisis, which would further limit credit conditions," warned Brian Bethune, head of finance and economics at Global Insight.
And still highlighting the state of emergency, "every day that leads to the collapse of a financial institution" in the United States, emphasized the Piegza.
After the Washington Mutual failed on Friday, the authorities organized the acquisition of Wachovia's banking activities by rival Citygroup.
In Europe, the crisis has abruptly accelerated, calling for urgent intervention in favour of the banks of the United Kingdom, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, a sign that markets "are not only facing an American crisis, but a global crisis", added FTN Financial analyst.
The bond market has risen sharply.
The yield of the 10-year Treasury Bonds fell to 3.632 per cent, compared to 3.827 per cent on Friday evening, while the yield of the 30-year Treasury Bonds fell to 4.161 per cent, compared to 4.357 per cent on the previous day.
Obama ahead of the first television duel
After Friday's first debate between the two White House candidates, here's a second to know who, between John McCain and Barack Obama, was the winner.
Unsurprisingly, the headquarters of the Republican and Democratic campaign proclaimed their victory of the television duel, followed by a third of American families.
Politologist David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, although deserving, was not brilliant enough to allow him to slow the decline in polls to five weeks after the presidential elections.
The Gallup Institute, of which an opinion poll published on Saturday gives Obama a five-point advantage (49% versus 44% for McCain), shows that the Democrat had the best.
An instant poll conducted by CbsNews on a sample of indecisive voters, found that 39% of them considered Obama the winner, while 25% focused on McCain.
An excellent performance by his listmate Joe Biden, expected during the first and only debate with rival Sarah Palin, should confirm Obama's advantage on Thursday.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
He has a good sense," however, Bill Clinton warned this weekend.
The 70-year-old McCain has never ceased to promote his undisputed experience in foreign policy, underlining the opponent's "ingenuity" with regard to the topics addressed during the first face-to-face.
"Senator Obama does not seem to understand that..." he has often stated on multiple occasions.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and skills to become president," he said.
What has been a continuing target for the republican television campaign since yesterday.
Obama, for his part, stressed how his election would represent a new future.
Without stretching, it has been concise and precise.
It has promoted its readiness for right decisions and its intention to restore the image of the United States on the world stage.
"McCain has never understood, unlike Obama," this weekend re-controverted a democratic spot, blaming the Republican for not taking the necessary measures to address the impact of the financial crisis on the American people.
During the ninety minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you, Obama denounced yesterday, in front of 20,000 people gathered in North Carolina, in a heavy rain, for an election meeting.
He did not even say the words "medium class" or "workers." The financial crisis goes in favor of Obama, considered by the Americans to be the most suitable person to save the economy on the edge of the precipice.
"Next week could be a turning point," said influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer yesterday.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's economic outlook to that demonstrated by Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current collapse "is the final verdict after eight years of poor economic policy adopted by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain."
Reiterating his intention to reduce taxes for 95% of Americans despite the whispers of Wall Street, the Illinois Senator also mentioned among his priorities the achievement of a possible energy independence of the country through the promotion of renewable energy and the implementation of a health insurance system.
McCain, for his part, would build a park of 45 nuclear centers by 2030.
With prudence, the two candidates avoided the questions focused on the $700 billion financial rescue plan (470 billion euros) adopted last night Congress and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, "Did you not notice that there were elections?"
Young people and opponents were protesting Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital to contest the results of the legislation in advance.
A few hundred Belarusians met on Sunday evening immediately after the closure of the electoral seats in the central square of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislation.
While still waiting for the results, many young people had come to protest against the power of President Alexander Lukashenko: "the dictator, resign".
Some confess that they have not even voted: "What pro? They will do whatever they want, of my vote," says a boy.
They do not believe that the regime which has been a good example before foreign observers in order to resume dialogue with the European Union is ready to take a democratic turn.
Sanctions, including the visa ban on 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of assets, could be removed if these elections were considered legitimate by the observers.
They weren't, according to the opposition.
"We have been removed from the electoral commissions and our observers have not been able to participate in the stripping of votes", complained Yuri Potemkine, spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous alliance of twelve parties.
"It's a change of face," says Alexandre Milinkievich, former candidate for the 2006 presidential opposition and leader of the pro-European movement, "because the important thing is who counts the cards and in this case the executive.
If Members of the opposition enter Parliament, it is because they have been appointed, and not elected.
But their entry into parliament can involve a television space, regional meetings and bills."
The opposition therefore has a duty to enter into the political game because "we need to engage in dialogue with the European Union.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, goes into crisis, and we do not provide for any reform, we risk becoming a Russian protectorate.
Now we want to be independent."
The opposition fears that the organisation for security and cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process will recognise the validity of the election.
He stressed that participation quotas seemed too high, and that the generalisation of the vote in advance (26% of voters in Minsk) had given rise to all kinds of manipulation.
"Have you noticed that there were elections? Asks Social Democratic leader Alexandre Kozoulin, one of the last two political prisoners released this year, in August.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will have been at most five Members of the opposition to the parliament, the most convenient in power."
Night silence falls on the October square.
On television, President Lukashenko and the members of the Central Electoral Commission welcome their success.
The meeting - Blood is safe again
Hema-Québec celebrated yesterday the tenth anniversary of its foundation, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, had every reason to rejoice, as Hema-Québec became one of the safest and most effective blood providers in the world.
Above all, it has regained public confidence, seriously shaken by the blood scandal in the years between 1980 and 1990.
As we know, the national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service were infected with acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C in the 1980s.
In the face of such a drama and the protests of the population, the Government of Canada conducted a public inquiry in February 1994, led by Judge Horace Krever, which aimed to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to disseminate recommendations to prevent the recurrence of a similar disaster.
While Judge Krever was late writing a report, some provinces set up a committee to design a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, this mandate was carried out by the Gélineau Committee.
Following the Gélineau et Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Héma-Québec to provide Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society for all other provinces and territories.
In 1998, when Héma-Québec started its activities, just 38% of people said they still trusted the donation system in Quebec, recalls Dr. Décary.
The situation was mortifying.
Thanks to continued efforts to improve the safety of blood samples and research in the field over the following years, we have regained public confidence," he says before saying proudly that at the beginning of 2008, about 94% of Quebec's population had confidence in Hema-Québec.
However, Dr. Décary is convinced that "trust is something extremely fragile".
Since its creation on September 28, 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At the time, there were numerous cases in Europe of the human variant of the mad cow, a new manifestation of the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, tells her that she has been president since 1998, the year of the foundation.
"And we absolutely did not know whether that disease could be transmitted through infected blood.
It was therefore based on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélinau reports that, when there are doubts and a serious disease could occur, in this case the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease manifests itself with a brain degeneration that inevitably leads to death, exclusion measures are taken.
In April 1999, the blood of those who had spent more than a month in the United Kingdom since 1980 was refused.
Now, for a few years, it has been shown that this disease is no doubt transmitted through infected blood.
This episode has shown us that it made sense to apply the precautionary principle."
In 1999 a much more efficient technique for the detection of HIV appeared on the market: the tests of nucleic acid (NAT) that allow the presence of the virus in the blood of donors and not the presence of antibodies against it, on which instead the tests used until then were based.
TANs have reduced the window period, i.e. from the time the person contracted the disease to the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood thanks to our techniques, explains the specialist.
It was possible to reduce that period to less than one week.
The risk of ignoring the presence of infected donors and not being able to detect them is thus greatly diminished.
These improvements have significantly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS with a blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people are at risk of receiving HIV-infected blood.
"In other words, this means that it will be necessary to distribute 12 million blood samples before someone gets infected with the HIV virus.
Since Hema-Québec distributes between 400 000 and 500 000 blood samples annually, it will take more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmitted with a transfusion is detected.
I believe that today we can feel at ease in receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to recover our health, says the head of the management of Hema-Québec.
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogen will emerge in the system.
No later than a year ago, the Chikungunya virus appeared on Réunion Island, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted into the blood by an insect.
It is necessary to be constantly vigilant", continues Dr. Décary before stressing that in addition to having secure resources, Hema-Québec must also provide sufficient resources.
"Needs increase as the population ages.
Being the most aggressive cancer cure, patients often need a supply of red blood cells or platelets.
The aging of the population also has consequences on the number of donors who on average make up only 3% of the population of Quebec acceptable as donors."
All healthy persons who have reached the age of 18 and who meet the eligibility criteria can however donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14% of those who offer themselves as donors are not accepted, because they are affected by AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have travelled to a country where AIDS is widespread, they will be refused for a period of one year.
"With this 3% we manage to maintain an inventory capable of responding to the needs of hospitals.
Cases of scarcity are very rare.
But we must renew the members of this group of donors as they grow older and can no longer make donations.
It is now difficult to convince people to donate blood, but above all to keep them and encourage them to become regular donors.
Today's life is so frantic that it's hardly an hour to donate blood," says desolate Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec distributes not only blood samples, but also human tissues, including bone transplants, eyeball heart valves and skin that are used almost exclusively for severe burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being deposited with the Héma-Québec, which operates the only public umbilical cord blood bank in Quebec.
In the umbilical cord, which was once considered a biomedical waste, abounds blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"We celebrated, a few weeks ago, the insertion in the bank of our thousandth sample of cord blood and we plan to take more than a thousand of them every year.
We should start proposing them for transplants at the beginning of next year," says Dr. Décary, who describes this practice of cord blood collection as very popular.
"Many mothers are disappointed that they cannot have access to it," as Héma-Québec does not have the means to propose this complex and expensive program in all Quebec hospitals.
Football - The Impact in semifinals
The Impact Montréal qualified for the semi-finals of the A series, winning 3-1 against the Seattle Sounders yesterday, during a second decisive quarter-final match at the Saputo Stadium.
The midfielder Antonio Ribeiro, scored the decisive goal at 90'.
After a first time without goals on both sides, David Testo and Rocco Placentino scored the next networks for Montreal.
For the Sounders, Roger Levesque was ready to score Matt Jordan.
We remember that at the first round of the return game, Friday, the Impact had suffered a 2-1 defeat at the Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, on the outskirts of Seattle.
The Impact will face the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semifinals.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thunderler filled a first 3-1 in the return game by winning 4-3, but the Whitecaps will still participate in the semifinal.
The Impact will face the Whitecaps both Friday and Sunday, but more details will be confirmed in the day.
In short - Kovalev's decisive network
The Canadiens and their axes are ready to start the season again.
The trio formed by Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn animated the offensive stage of the game by winning 3-2 against the Panthers, Florida, last night at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the star of the first meeting, scored a goal, took two steps, and picked up a pass for victory, in the fourth of the Hab preparatory games.
Decisive for victory the only network signed Kovalev.
"I'm not ready yet," the Russian warned.
I need another game to feel comfortable."
"He tried to overtake in the first period," noted Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he appreciated the outcome of the game.
There was a nice ovation."
Charest Point to the North
The Prime Minister does not rule out the opening of elections before the end of the year.
Following the conclusion of the general council of the Liberal Party, Jean Charest went yesterday to Jean-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc, (left), tries to be elected in today's by-elections.
"Enlarge the boundaries of our last great northern frontier": this is Jean Charest's long-term ambition, presented yesterday in Levis, through instruments with a strong visual impact, on the occasion of the General Council of the Liberal Party of Quebec.
Behind him, during his speech, the projection of a sort of "Imaging Mill".
On three maxi screens, spectacular negatives of hydroelectric dams, mining crops, images of Quebec seen with "Google Maps", maps, etc. were confused.
Great means like in the middle of the election campaign.
During the press conference, moreover, the Prime Minister refused to exclude the opening of the autumn elections, although he pointed out that he was very busy.
The "North Plan" is the fourth point of a "project" that the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes a first agreement with France on labour, a second agreement between Canada and Europe and other agreements with Ontario.
Often named in the most recent speeches of the Prime Minister, the opening of the North- the northern territory to the 49th parallel- had never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, merely explained why the North would be "a jewel of immense potential", but did not pronounce on timing or investment quotas, as he did not explain what the precise priorities would be in the implementation of future projects.
At the most, he merely pointed out what he believed deserved a priority position: hydroelectricity, forests, but above all the mining sector, which, following the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure, had experienced several improvements.
According to Charest's list, the North contains" nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds".
That "large territory twice France" is here, it's Quebec.
Not only is it here, but it is inherent in us," he insisted, like wanting to solicit a national founding myth.
The foundations of Quebec are rooted in his relationship with the North, he stressed: gold fever in Abitibi, national engineering, James Bay.
"It's up to us, it's our future," he added, after a theatrical break to contemplate the immense map behind him.
The North, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes a part of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, said the Prime Minister at the press conference.
" It is a position traditionally maintained by all governments.
There is a border line on which no agreement has been in place for a long time and, when the opportunity arises, I will reiterate that position in the name of the government," he said.
"Considering climate change, we need to re-evaluate the North," he said, talking about the north-west passage, which will be open all year round because of the melting of ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister considers it a duty to occupy the territory.'
What about the locals, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebec would be very careful about this and that the project would meet their interests, especially those of young people.
Two former ministers from different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Member of the PQ of Ungava), have already started the consultation of about thirty communities.
An inter-ministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) held an important position, started work.
The Prime Minister does not rule out a great meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a time when "common visions will be provided"
The development of the North would also be based on the principles of sustainable development.
The Northern Plan will be "agreed, ordered and will respect the environment", he promised.
Jean Charest described this "project" as a continuum with that of the former Liberal prime ministers.
"Like the liberals who preceded us, we know how to distinguish ourselves to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
This was, moreover, one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a big cocktail in honor of the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's arrival as head of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename the Beauharnois Centrale in Diga Adélard-Godbout.
"From Godbout, creator of Hydro-Québec, to Lesage who nationalized hydroelectricity, to Bourassa, creator of James Bay, our party has always been able to forge the future," said Jean Charest.
During the press conference, another conservative reference is made to John Diefenbaker's "Street to the North" programme from 1957 to 1963.
Faced with the project for the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam, Charest specified that its commissioning would be planned for 2012.
"All this remains between us, but I feel that we will do it," he confessed to his militants, raising his applause.
In fact, the Prime Minister, who stated in April that there would be no elections in 2008 and probably not even in 2009, has not ruled out the possibility of running a poll in autumn, which could happen in accordance with the law.
He stressed that he was certainly very committed, particularly on a federal council mission to China and at the Quebec-New York summit.
The weekend General Council provided the Liberal leader with a platform of nationalist resolutions, in particular "constitutional aspirations" that have passed smoothly like oil: the PLQ calls above all for the recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
He also hoped that Quebec would appoint the members of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Council and that the latter would have a right of veto over the decisions taken in Quebec.
As far as the opposition is concerned, the outline of the Northern Plan has been sceptically accepted.
PQ leader Pauline Marois dusted the Northern Quebec Development Policy launched by the Landry government in 2001.
In her view, the Liberal government, which came to power in 2003, would not have respected its application.
If he had done so, "we would have made progress today" commented the Marois alongside the candidate of Jean-Talon (scrutiny that took place today), Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ stated that it supported the adoption of the Northern Plan by the government.
"What we wish for is that all this is not simply perceived as a show," commented leader Sébastien Proulx, Mario Dumont's replacement, who is returning today from vacation.
Letters - A dishonored country
It was Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice (irony of fate) of Cabinet Harper, who allowed himself to declare, last summer, that Louise Arbor was a "shame" on Canada.
To dishonor in this way a woman who has fought tirelessly for justice and who deserves all our admiration tells a lot about both the Prime Minister's entourage and Stephen Harper himself.
Here we are in front of a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, not to have returned a citizen of its own detained in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that takes no account of the fact that Omar Khadr was a mere teenager at the time of the charges against him.
The only government that, despite signing the Geneva Convention, denies its word and lets a child-soldier rot in inhumane conditions.
The only one who trusts in a parody of justice to establish the guilt of the accused.
We recall, for information, that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, in particular, invoke Omar Khadra's return so that he can undergo a regular trial in Canada.
It is proper that same government that closes its eyes to torture: it cares very little that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, perhaps forever, after so many years of abuse.
We do not yet realize this, but we are witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, of freedom and of "democracy", a word that Harper does not cease to display and which sounds so senseless on his lips.
Here we arrived at the moment when there is no longer any morality: one can mistreat, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen according to the discretion of a head of government until today minority (to see what will be after October 14...).
Many voters believe that a party that preaches Virtue, Respect for the Law and the Order represents salvation: they do not see that this government has renounced what constituted the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame lies right here, Mr. Toews, in giving up all this, and nowhere else.
Free opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwellian Speech
In the September 17 edition, Le Devoir published a letter by M. Patrick J. Garver, Vice-President-Director of the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
In pursuit of an Orwellian logic, the latter claims that the world's largest gold company has filed a six-million defamation lawsuit against three authors and a small squatted publishing house with the intention of launching a "transparent public debate".
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth they judge, especially in the case of a libel lawsuit, but the law.
Without any surprise, this substantial difference is completely hidden by Garver.
Because for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would be to ruin anyone who dares to hold a position contrary to his.
No matter what the outcome of the process, the writers and publisher of the book Black Canada will have to spend a considerable sum of money in order to organize their own defence and fight, with decidedly odd weapons, against an army of lawyers financed by virtually unfunded pockets of the mining company.
On the other hand, in these battles for unlearned weapons, the tactic is often to ruin the defendant in order to impose a consensual settlement that impassions the opposition as well as to frighten anyone who dares to speak again on the issue.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it was before the public that he should have presented his view of the facts.
Contrary to what happens in many countries where Barrick Gold works, discussions in Canada usually take place with the exchange of views and not with manganese.
It would therefore have been sufficient for the company to open its books, documents and establish a real debate, through newspapers, media, publications and the financing of teams of independent researchers who could have shed light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold does not seem to have too much confidence in public opinion and poorly rejects petitions and letters in support of Black Canada authors.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he can ask for a "public" debate when his contempt for that same public is quite evident?
In the world of the vice president, it seems that this word only indicates the lawyers who are perfumed and not the Canadian as a whole; here is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In a democratic system, even denigrators have the right to speak.
What Barrack Gold doesn't understand – or doesn't want to understand – is that the public that supports the authors and publishers of Black Canada does it first because it rejects the brutal means adopted by the mining company.
This audience is ready to listen to Barrick and judge, but on the basis of civil exchanges of opinion, and not in the view of what many perceive as a sort of embalming (seeking the "public debate", Barrick Gold has just given the authors of Black Canada an ultimatum urging them to suspend the use of that word...)
Beyond Garver's surreal discourse, the Barrack Gold lawsuit is a direct attack on the freedom of university research and the pursuit of truth, indispensable in every democratic society.
It blocks the right to quote genuine sources and to debate facts and interpretations, which are the very basis of intellectual work.
If in a country like Canada it is impossible to study and discuss uncomfortable topics for the richest companies in the world, many complaints, who will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could do so by following scientific standards as the authors of Black Canada do.
You have the right of reply.
For a long time, the university environment, of which we are a part, has been able to manage debates and disagreements and to resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's excessive measures clearly show that, contrary to its claims, it is not looking for a transparent debate at all.
This is at the expense of the university world, as is the case with the same public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to take measures to limit abusive claims.
Operation - rescue for Wall Street – Dialogue between Republicans and Democrats
The Bush administration and the head of Congress, representatives of the Republican and Democratic leadership, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the largest bailout plan after the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new 700 billion US dollar version of the plan, which aims to put a stop to the financial crisis that has plagued Wall Street for months, still needs to be ratified by the two chambers of Congress.
In particular, it provides for: checks on its effective implementation by elected leaders, new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of public money, new provisions to contain the number of houses stolen for non-payments, as well as a right of inspection on salaries paid to managers of protected enterprises.
The American Secretary to the Treasury, Henry Paulson, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi and the Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday at the end of a two-day talks marathon.
"We have made great progress towards an effective market agreement," Bush administration representative Henry Paulson said.
"Every decision has been taken in such a way as to safeguard the American economy and people from the ongoing crisis on Wall Street," the Democrat explained.
"This is the crucial point: if we had not acted in this way, invaluable discomfort and turmoil would have spilled over on the daily lives of the Americans," Republican Judd Gregg said.
The conclusion of the negotiations was marked by concerns about the impact of a new bankruptcy on investors.
The agreed time limit was the opening of the markets this morning.
Together with the negotiations, the two candidates for the US Presidents were rather in favour of the agreement, but they did not express their discontent before the adoption of extreme solutions.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama has the credit for adding some provisions to the agreement, in particular the one that will allow the owners to maintain their home and the one related to salaries for managers of companies covered by the state.
"When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of others, there is nothing to rejoice about.
But these measures are necessary," he commented on the American TV screen.
Interviewed on another channel to see if he will vote in favour of the plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, replied: "I would like to analyze the details, but I hope so."
"As far as I've read, it's something that we all have to digest and that will allow us to move forward"
The option of non-intervention is simply unacceptable," he said.
The 700 billion plan aims to recover with taxpayers' money the doubtful claims, the risky and unsold assets of the US financial institutions.
The plan comes after 14 months of crisis due to the explosion of a real estate bubble that led first to the collapse of mortgages at risk (loans) , then extends to other more widespread forms of credit securities (PCAA) and results in the freezing of liquidity and the outflow of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republicans in charge that blew up the first draft of a deal last week.
It seems to have come out of that blind alley since the Democrats accepted that the "toxic" assets of some companies in difficulty are only protected by the government, rather than purchased.
In order to meet everyone in Congress, a provision was added that, if the government were to face losses over the next five years due to this program, it could impose new taxes in order to maintain its balance.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first sum of 250 billion to which 100 billion will be added if the President deems it necessary.
The deposit of 350 billion should be ratified by a further vote of Congress.
In exchange for its help, Washington will obtain shares in the protected companies that will be paid dividends in the event of profit and that will be able to resell when the waters have calmed down.
According to the plan, the federal government will have the opportunity to delay the collection procedures for real estate loans and to set limits on the remuneration and start-up allowances paid to the managers of the companies involved.
Starting today, the architects of the plan would like to submit it to the vote of the House of Representatives, and to the vote of the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will be freed up.
In fact, yesterday there were several votes against the project, both in the Republican and democratic leadership.
"Obviously, Washington does not hear you," Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House's Finance Committee, told his constituents.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But certainly not to take advantage of taxpayers..
Leader of a small group in Congress called the "sceptic caucus", Democratic Representative Brad Sherman presents the situation in a different way, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred eminent economic professors, including three Nobel Prize winners, have written to us to say: we ask Congress not to draw hasty conclusions and to examine carefully the way forward," he said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, there was once again proof of the global nature of the crisis.
After an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for EUR 11.2 billion ($16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary when the French bank BNS Paribas announced that it would give up the purchase of its competitor, in full bankruptcy after the loss of EUR 2 billion (US$ 2.9 billion) for the crisis of real estate loans at risk in the United States.
Fortis has 85 000 employees and is one of the twenty largest banks in Europe and ten largest insurers.
"It's not lost money," Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
In return, influence and voting rights are gained in banking matters.
It is certainly something that savers and families now appreciate when times are uncertain."
During this period, at the other end of the Channel, the British government seems to be in the process of nationalising another bank in the balance sheet for the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take charge of all the loans currently under way at Bradford and Bringley Bank, of which more than 41 billion (75.5 billion dollars) are real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it will be you who will buy the branches and customer accounts of the British bank.
Since the beginning of the economic crisis, Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank, after Northern Rock, to undergo a process of nationalization by the English government.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a busy icon
The blue-eyed beauty was for a long time his ace in the sleeve, for others his weak spot.
Did he get rid of the narcissistic mirror, the American actor with the emaciating smile?
Yes and no.
His discretion, sensitivity and obvious talent would have expelled him from that circle of powerful consecrated to true and proper sacred monsters.
What a constancy!
Paul Newman, who disappeared on Friday, at the age of 83, in his Connecticut ranch, following lung cancer, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of the past few years.
Less monumental than Brando, to which he resembled and of which he was for a long time a sort of rival on the screen, more cautious in his game, certainly more fragile, but also he spoke of freedom and the development of dramatic convictions.
Mixed couples often give birth to magical children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, to a German Jewish father and mother of Hungarian origins.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
A humble ego, the last mark of quality.
Because in him he recognized himself as an insufferable country of safe made man, of the combatant of the Pacific war, proud in the fight, who in the early 1950s studied dramatic art in Yale, later attended the Actor Studio in New York, before triumphing in theatre, television and early cinema.
The same civil rights activist was also the car driver who ranked second to the 24 hours of Mans in 1979, as well as sex symbol, although part of a model couple since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
The shadow zones of a private, discreet, busy star, allergic to the scandals of show-business, of which one will never be able to reveal the mystery completely, leave with him.
An honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
This weekend Paul Newman's disappearance was a heart-to-heart dip for the cinephiles, while his great characters populate the black screen of memories.
More than half a century of American cinema in full transformation is proposed through its interpretations.
The fascinating Butch Cassidy cowboy (1969) and the boy unable to wish for the hot wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on the Roof adapted by Tennessee Williams in 1958 are confused in memory.
More recently, we remember him in the role of sensitive Mr. Bridge (1990), upset by a marriage that did not keep what was promised.
So many other Paul Newmans have come to history.
The boxer Rocky Graziano, delinquent, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Lasù someone loves me, Robert Wise, a role destined for James Dean and resumed after his death, which officially launched Newman in 1956.
That nice villain in the excellent Stangata, Oscar as best film in 1973.
Player of bitter and vengeful billiards in the Lo Spaccone, magnificent film by Robert Rossen (1961), The color of Martin Scorsese's money, which won him the only Oscar on 9 nominations in 1987.
That face over the years, it was his.
He's still here.
The epochs follow one another through his path.
Young people know him especially for George Roy Hill's cult movie Slap Shot-Dry Hit (1977), in the role of Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in Mr. Hula Hoop of the Coen brothers.
The circle had closed with one last role as the godfather of the Irish Mafia in my father's Era, in 2003.
Unlike the finest cinema legends who soon left the profession, Newman will remain in the halls for a long time, denouncing Hollywood throughout its career, festivals and concessions.
Bertrand Tavernier, a French film-maker, called him "a living challenge to underplaying" with an ironic tip, judging his performance to be exaggerated.
The profession has not always been a game for the handsome Paul Newman, whose roles seemed to fall like manna from the sky.
However, he often preferred the role of the marginalized to that of the young actor: neurotic characters, alcoholic carrots or desperate, of which he expressed disbelief and rebellion with his perfect traits.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown nuances of his true, pudic sensibility.
Jennifer's first time in 1968 (based on the Canadian novel Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward as the protagonist, drew a subtle portrait of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott for an overdose, dedicated in 1984 the film Harry and Son, a discreet and sad film.
Among the countless tributes rained yesterday on Newman, his great friend and old comrade Robert Redford (they had recited together in La Stangata and Butch Cassidy) said with infinite sadness "His presence has made my life and this country better".
Generosity and love for life, two great features of the missing actor.
Beyond a career as a legend, a great activist for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a Hollywood drifter, is extinguished.
We will have seen her face stand out on bottles of vinegar, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging her a choice of bad taste, although born as gag.
However, the revenues from those sales were allocated to his Foundation for Children in Difficulty.
Newman, instead of leaning on his myth, chose to commit himself to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter that said" Always and until the end, your father was incredibly grateful to his good star.
Being there was a privilege."
And just as privileged it was for us to follow the path of such a clear and generous American artist.
Citizen model, then, and much more.
What was produced in the invoice factory of Zuschlag & partners?
The trial against János Zuschlag and his partners will be discussed shortly on 8 October.
Politicians and their associates are accused of repeated commercial fraud committed in the framework of a criminal association that has caused considerable damage, and of other crimes, including forgery of documents.
According to the Prosecutor's Office, the money obtained from tenders was used by them for private purposes, and they have often certified the carrying out of the activities through false invoices.
The state and municipal money, in total 65 million guilders, ended up in part in the caskets of the organization Fiatal Baloldal, in part in the pockets of some people.
According to the method, made known by the investigating authorities, they took the money obtained from tenders on the basis of invoices for non-existent transactions and the associations never fulfilled their obligations.
According to the indictment, most of the invoices were false.
To make them, the invoice blocks were purchased at the market of Józsefváros, the circular stamps instead were manufactured in Kiskunhalas.
And in order to decide on behalf of which companies to issue invoices, it was established, among other things, during the trip between the hills above Balaton where János Zuschlag had sent István Lados.
According to the confession of the latter he had to choose pensions and restaurants.
He asked for an invoice for the consumptions, on the model of these then were prepared the invoices to forward to the invitations of competition, among others, those of the Ministry for Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and the Municipality of Budapest.
Most of these are the work of István Lados and András, who, according to our information, drew up the reports necessary to obtain the funding.
One of the choices of Lados' "study trip" was a brewery.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlag and partners in 2003, the place of catering provided meals for a group of 90 people from the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
So many people, however, according to the restaurant owner, would not all enter the room together.
Similarly, the invoice issued in summer 2002 to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, later called Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért, full of formal errors and content.
A pension in Badacsonytomaj has only three rooms, more than 10 people could not stay there overnight, however in the invoice there were 130 guests.
But the compilers of the invoices full of fantasy exaggerated when they reported the Pigal Kft., it also deals with catering, in whose accounts - according to the information issued to the judicial authorities - did not even include the documents on behalf of the companies Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá.
Győző Farkas, the company's administrator, told hvg.hu that when he was summoned to the prosecutor's office and the invoices were shown to him, he immediately realized that they were false documents.
"On the stamp our company's name and game Iva were at a wrong place."
He added: in addition to the formal reasons, it did not even return the fact that according to the invoice, 100 people were accommodated, when in total they have eleven rooms and there are not so many beds.
Moreover, the invoice was for catering and their restaurant is no longer in operation for a long time.
The regular invoice compilers did not worry to inform themselves that the Budapest travel agency of their choice, organizes only trips abroad, so they foolishly indicated on the invoice with payment in cash trips to Hungary, which did not agree with the practice of issuing invoices of the company.
Furthermore, as demonstrated during the investigation, VAT was also included on the invoice, while travel to countries outside the European Union is exempt from VAT.
Among other things, the amount of VAT was wrong on the four documents issued by the Hotel Revfülöp Kft. in favor of the Jobb Jövőért foundation, in fact on the services offered by the company it is necessary to apply VAT to 15% and not to 25% as indicated on invoices, moreover the employees of the hotel only issued printed invoices, while the invoice made was written by hand.
In addition to this, the "issuers" have ruined other invoices, in the case of a company they have indicated as activity carried out the transport of goods by road, as is known from the Procura procedure, activities that were not carried out by the company originally founded for investment advice.
Moreover for formal defects - causes non-compliant invoice format, fake stamp - it has been discovered that the invoices issued in favor of Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, of XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont are false.
The same happened in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Sports Field of Kunfehértó, whose representatives refused to issue the invoices in question.
The counterfeiters did not even pay attention to the fact that the HIB Kft. of Nyíregyháza was in liquidation when (2001) lunched you a group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület, precisely for this reason the curator of the liquidation of the company, according to our information, denied that he had issued that invoice.
They've made conscious invoices.
Another group of invoice issuers consists of those who were aware of having to issue fictitious invoices.
The foundation Esély Budapestért Alapítvány has issued an invoice at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták in favor of the Együtt foundation in Harmadik Évezredért of almost 4 million guilders.
Ludovic Györfi, one of the defendants, according to the indictment, persuaded the director of Collab Kft. to issue fictitious invoices.
He also collaborated with Zuschlag and members of the Biogate Kft currently in liquidation, which in 2003 provided invoices worth around 5 million guilders to the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány foundation, the Atlasz Egyesület association and the Vörösfenyő Egyesület association, behind which there was no real economic activity.
No movement of money because the prepared invoices were then turned over, but the associations forgot to include this aspect in their documents.
In the following group of companies issuing invoices belong those that are connectable with the defendants.
For example, Ivan Kubatov, authorised at the dispatch of the general manager of the Delta Trió Kft, based in Budapest but not available there, who deals in fuel and motor vehicle trade.
The company issued several invoices in October, November and December 2005 relating to the sale of computer equipment, worth about 18 million guilders.
According to the investigation data, the Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas under liquidation since 14 September 2005 purchased these invoices.
The director general of this company was a Romanian to whom Ivan Kubatov would have forwarded the documents concerning the company between 2002 and 2005.
As far as we know, during the investigation Kubatov acknowledged that he had issued invoices on behalf of the company to Atlasz, Hoppá and Együtt at Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány and the countervalue was taken by him.
At the express request of Ivan Kubatov Romanian workers founded the companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
However, none of the companies were operational, because according to the defendant they had not received work.
However, the companies have made them useful because, at the request of the co-defendant lawyer Zsolt Szente, editor of the founding documents of the companies, invoices have been issued on behalf of the companies to associations related to Zuschlag: the Atlas and the Y-Generáció.
On behalf of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade Kubatov has issued 15 invoices to the various entities for a total value of 14.2 million guilders.
The prosecution considers that Kubatov has seized 10% of the amounts indicated on the invoices, as well as the VAT.
The man also used the Szi-Beri Bt. to issue fictitious invoices, manufactured for the bid of Biztos Pont.
Y-Generáció and Szövetség in Modern Magyarországért in January 2006 filed a notice for the public utility agency of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA).
They also won 500,000 guilders per head but the sums were not used for the purposes indicated in the ban.
In order to avoid this, they presented to TMA five fictitious invoices received by Works Team Kft.
These invoices were found during the search of Árpád Kemecsei's office at the Ministry of Education.
Some of the defendants, as they have already done in the prosecutor's office, will probably report on the progress of the production of invoices.
However, the most interesting thing could be if defendant number one, János Zuschlag, decided to lift the veil on everything.
His confession so far has not been very detailed and although he has repeatedly promised to talk about everything in an extensive way, he has not yet done so.
We must see whether it is in his interest, it could also be that the socialists have made agreements with Zussi, who - in exchange for a compensation of 50 million guilders, much of the damage - would be willing to do the scapegoat.
Zuschlag could have been offended for the time being, since his requests to lighten his prison conditions, that is, the granting of house arrest, have not so far been met.
While authors of non-compensable commercial crimes and causing much greater damage can freely walk or at least wait at home for the end of the proceedings against them, which is not granted to him.
The psychology of overbidding: why spend more money?
At auctions buyers are likely to spend more, overestimate the goods.
Neurologists and economists researchers at the University of New York have been able to discover the neuro-economic bases of this well-known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to their study published in Science magazine, men do not want to stay back in a race like eBay's auction, so they are willing to pay even a higher price.
The research tried to trace the nervous pattern of this "game" at the nervous system level through experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers played the lot, the other group of players participated in an auction while using the functional magnetic resonance method (fMRI) examined the active areas of the brain of the people participating in the experiment.
In both games the participants could win money, but in the game of the auction, in which the substantial element is that of bidding more than the other, the body striated under the cerebral cortex comes into operation intensively when you lose in the game.
This brain area, in addition to other functions, plays a role in the "self-gratification" mechanism of the nervous system.
Therefore, according to the researchers, the price rise is explained by scanning the vehement reaction of the striated body.
To support their theory, the research group economists conducted a financial tracking survey.
In this investigation, three groups tendered against a partner under different conditions.
They reported to the control group how much the actual value of the product in question was and they made their bet.
To another group besides this they have promised that in the case of winning they will receive another prize of 15 dollars.
The third group, on the other hand, would have received $15 before the auction, but the members of the group would have lost the money in the event of the auction loss.
The difference between the two groups consisted in the fact that for one of them the winning was emphasized, while for the other the loss.
By testing the hypothesis of neurologists the members of the group playing "against loss" were willing to make higher bets of the control group or "winner".
"These results are not deductible from any of the previously existing economic theories.
These so far explained the phenomena found at auctions with the joy of winning and avoiding risk.
Only the methods of creating the neurological image have helped to resolve the contradiction between the two theories, so that we have come to a third explanation" - said Andrew Schotter, professor of the Faculty of Economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: when should you contact your doctor?
Nearly half a billion people in the world suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while chronic liver disease is mentioned in Hungary as one of the leading causes of death.
In Hungary the number of hepatitis patients amounts to one hundred thousand, of which only 7,000 are treated: the reason is that many patients do not know they are infected.
The definition of hepatitis is the collective name of contagious liver diseases caused by different viruses.
There are many similarities between the symptoms, typical are hepatitis and jaundice, but their pathogens and the diseases caused differ from each other.
Hepatitis viruses spread in two main forms depending on the pathogen: hepatitis A and E via the food channel (e.g. water and infected foods), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and organic fluids (sperm, vaginal loss, saliva).
For travellers, it is useful to get vaccination against A and B, and there is no vaccine for C.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after eating infected foods, accompanied by general malaise, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After they form yellow spots on the skin and white of the eyes, the faeces become clear and the urine dark, the healing takes place within two to three weeks.
One million people die every year worldwide for hepatitis B, the most serious variant of the disease, which causes liver cancer and liver cirrhosis.
The main reason is, according to estimates, that only one in ten people receive pharmacological treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if not treated it can cause liver cirrhosis and liver tumors.
Most infected people do not know that they have contracted the disease because the pathogens subtly destroy the liver cells, in many cases the first symptoms appear after 20-30 years.
Therefore it is very important to prevent and carry out regular medical analyses.
This disease is much more common than the average in three groups: those who had a blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts and tattoos.
In the world today, the number of people infected with chronic hepatitis C virus amounts to 200 million.
Since a routine laboratory examination also reveals the disease, it is worth contacting your family doctor when you notice any symptoms of unknown origin.
Recognized in time the disease is curable, the virus can be eliminated by the body, thus ceasing the infectious power and preventing the formation of tumors.
September 30th is the World Day of Hepatitis, organized for the first time in 2004 worldwide by associations of patients.
The aim is to draw attention to chronic viral hepatitis, the causes of its development and the early recognition of the disease.
Who believes in God feels less pain?
According to the result of a recent investigation, religious faith functions as a kind of analgesic that has made the death of Catholic martyrs more bearable.
Scientists at Oxford University conducted an interesting experiment, examining how faith in God influences the feeling of pain, reported the British Telegraph.
As part of the bizarre investigation, an electroshock was carried out on 12 Catholic believers and as many atheists, while everyone observed a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to reject much of the pain.
Thanks to the exploratory technique of the human brain it was discovered that Catholics were able to activate the part of the brain responsible for pain control.
The test is the first in a series of research in which scientists, philosophers and theologians of the University also take part, in addition to academics.
The test was carried out exactly like this: an instrument that emits discharges and passes the electroshock was connected to the left hand of the experiment subject.
The researchers asked the participants to focus on two paintings, the Virgin Mary painted in the 17th century by Sassoferrato and the Lady with the hermitage of Leonardo da Vinci painted in the 15th century.
The authors of the examination hoped that the image of the Virgin Mary would give rise to a sort of religious state among believers, while Leonardo's painting was chosen because it did not differ too much from the other and considered it to be of reassuring effect.
The subjects of the experiment spent half an hour in front of the MRI scanner and in this age range received 20 electroshocks in four consecutive series, while observing either the religious-themed painting or the other.
The Catholics reported that the vision of the Virgin Mary made them feel "safe", as if "someone took care of" them and "they calmed down and were pervaded by peace".
Looking at the religious-themed image, they accounted for 12% less pain than when Leonardo's work was before them.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who took part in the test himself, believes that such a result can be achieved with any image with strong effect even for the atheists, but we must find the appropriate image.
"We must look for an image to which they have very positive feelings, such as a mother or a father" - said the psychologist.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the result of the research.
"The practice of faith should change, and in many cases it can change our personality." - added Wright.
After the excellent results only the question remains if the painting of a Madonna of Leonardo or another painter of such a calibre is presented to believers, what effect could it have on the control of pain?
Would the vision of a quality virgin Mary bring better results?
You're what you say about yourself.
On the tenth birthday Google can claim to be in people's pockets as well as in the sky above their heads; it knows where they spent their holidays, what outpatients they attend and what interests them.
This, however, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's directors, is still not enough.
What concerns the skeptics who make a comparison with the Orwellian nightmare, they do not really see the substance of web 2.0.
Recently Eric Schmidt told the Financial Times that Google's main purpose is to collect as much personal data as its users and this is necessary to meet the original goal of Google founders that was: "We put all the information in a system of the world!".
According to the director of Google interviewed the company, after 10 years of revolutionary work, it is still at the beginning of being able to manage all the information.
To the question what will happen in five years Schmidt answered: he would like if Google could answer questions like "what do I do tomorrow?" or "what would be the right job for me?", but the software can't answer seemingly simple questions because they don't know enough about users.
Not all Internet users are aware that during their internet searches exactly the search words are recorded, from which IP address they are searched and on which page the interested people stop after the search.
By means of the Personalized Search launched two years ago users e.g. can store their browsing history, can relate to what they have searched and clicked, these will then go for a long time generate much better tailor-made results; on this same logic is based Recommendations with which the system offers us products and services according to our declared and previously registered preferences.
What happens if my data is used against me, if they look at what I'm dealing with? - people are wondering about Google's data monopoly.
In most cases, the counter-reactions of Internet users are caused by the fear experienced by the size of the potential power represented by the company, and not by the sense of guilt, by the fear of punishment, by the desire for freedom or even by rebellion to power.
One fact is confirmed, however, that all the expressions sought are not only recorded but in justified cases can also be given to third parties, in such legal cases nothing defends the personal rights of the internet users.
The most striking example of this in recent times has perhaps been the coordinated action against paedophiles in Brazil, in which Google forwarded to the Brazilian government the information that made it possible to identify paedophiles from the page of the community Orkut maintained by Google.
The Internet users concerned about personal rights instead sighed of relief in May when the company - in agreement with the electronic legal protection association EFF - has successfully demonstrated the truth in court against the FBI: not even later can Google be forced with any point of the constitution to provide any information secretly requested by the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government has successfully removed almost 50,000 web addresses and thousands of search expressions obtained in reference to the confirmation of the Child Protection Act passed years earlier, but it has still failed to obtain the search lists of individual users and the entire list of web pages and keywords dating back to two months.)
Google's judgment is therefore quite contradictory: those who fear to provide their personal data flaunt Google because they believe that this will affect their intimate sphere and private life by starting to use its services and rise up with the rebellion of the multinationals that stand out for the conservative image.
Meanwhile the American geek culture and the proliferation of enthusiasts, activists and computer users appeared in many countries see in them the future generation of big companies, the "cool corporation", unlike their rival, the Microsoft liquidated as conqueror of the world because of Windows, however they both fight for the same goal.
This can happen because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for an identification code, does not ask for money for their services, the source code always kept up-to-date and the package of programs is much more accessible, youthful and cool than the official practice of software colossus.
But it can also happen because geeks see exactly the problematic relationship between personal rights and the internet, which implies one of the most frequently repeated keywords in recent years, the web 2.0.
Web 2.0 speaks only of collaboration, of intentionally leaving traces behind us and of exploiting the communication channels at our disposal and while the size of these changes for each individual, the substance is the same: to show ourselves.
A young average can create profiles in multiple community pages, from Facebook to Xanga, can connect them with other services such as Twitter or last.fm that lists its musical tastes, all these can insert them in systems like FriendFeed or Blip.fm, can also write blogs on which appear automatically its most recent photo galleries stored on Flickr or Picasa.
Meanwhile, we read of numerous exemplary cases from which it is clear that the girl, seeing the series of photos taken in the morning by the common tour of friends, comes to know easily with who spent the night with her perfidious boyfriend or a company can fire an employee because she wrote a sincere opinion on the company summit: one thing is certain, the concept of private life has now completely reconsidered.
Those who live an online life make it possible to show themselves and so we can formulate the fundamental thesis that hides behind the behavior of young people.
Anyone who wants to hide something or just wants to avoid Google's monopoly can do so (starting with Scroogle using Google's search system, for example, but which at the same time leaves no traces voluntarily).
There are not a few people who do not register on community pages for not being found, Google's online applications, from text processing to image management and news gathering, can be replaced with alternative versions that are not linked to huge server parks and that do not make up our best profile so far.
Public opinion doesn't wait that long in secret for the moment when Google will pull out the claws.
Currently the company with its 156 billion dollars worth worth more than IBM (140 billion dollars), Intel (124 billion dollars) or Coca Cola (110 billion dollars), AdWords/AdSense advertising spaces threaten the revenues of advertising agencies, the services introduced in record time cause not only Microsoft but also numerous software development companies.
However, the critical observers next to this find some alarming points: the company summit for example completely rejected the employee protest after doubling the line of the company asylum, considered too expensive the repeated catering to the employee's daily pleasure, but all this diminishes in the face of the fact that in 2006 Google has bowed the head to the Chinese government and according to their agreement the company will filter all the results that offend the good taste and interests of the Chinese regime.
An internal rule of the company seems to be not to advertise a new service in advance but only when it will be usable, but one thing is certain, that the foreseeable problems of the coming months and years will move the world at one point: while some believe that Google's scanning and archiving of books and magazines will assume such proportions that it will soon be facing the American Supreme Court, others are afraid of the health system, in fact in this we can create our health profile with our references, doctors and problems.
The fact that Google is building a genetic data base can offer good material to the next generation of science fiction writers, the Scroogled story of the famous Cory Doctorow describes the future with Orwellian accents, in which a man with Google data can be approached in an alarming way.
Two minors helped Ózd's double killer to make the tracks go away
The police questioned two minors about the double murder of Ózd, suspected of having helped to make the traces of the crime disappear - the spokesman of the Police Questionture of the Borsod region declared on Tuesday.
The young people have recognized the crime against them, they are currently accused of favoring.
The two minors, two girls according to MTI information, defend themselves freely.
The favoring is punishable up to 5 years in prison.
The suspect of the double murder of Ózd, a 23-year-old man from the scene, Sunday was put in pre-trial detention.
He's suspected of premeditated multi-murder committed for profit.
From the investigation it was found that the young 23 - year - old had a large debt with a 53 - year - old man.
The suspect did not want to pay the debt, for this reason last Wednesday he lured his creditor into a yard in Ózd where he killed him and his 9-year-old daughter.
According to MTI, the young man had prepared to commit the crime, a sign is that he committed the murder with a weapon hidden on the spot.
The police are examining the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the involvement of an expert.
Warsaw Stock Exchange made an offer for the purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has offered 200 million euros, about 5 billion Czech kroner, for the purchase of 100% of the stock list of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer advanced by the Poles despite the Czechs having previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange as a possible buyer of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for the exclusion is the fact that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is owned by the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state which intends to sell more than 60% of its securities within a few months.
The Czech financial daily E15 states that the Polish offer represents the highest figure so far advanced for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the German Stock Exchange have so far presented an offer.
Petr Koblic, director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that among all interested the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst owner and did not exclude that this could lead to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at 5-10 billion kroner.
According to the shareholders' agreement, almost 90% of the securities would be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the Finance Homeland with a share of almost 25%, followed by the Bank Česká Spořitelna with 14.7% and the Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5%
The economic crisis from the point of view of European newspapers
The main European newspapers in their Tuesday comments on the international economic crisis already speak of "a second 11 September".
The global financial disaster happened thanks to the American president - the Republic accuses - who was not able to compact his party behind a law drunk in all haste, whose purpose is to remedy a desperate situation.
Instead of a second Pearl Harbour, as the billionaire super financier Warren Buffett said, it would be more accurate to talk about a second September 11th.
Also part of the Madrid press sees the scapegoat in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of American political leadership has thrown the world economy on the brink of the baratro.
The danger of the collapse of the American financial system is growing more and more, and the whole world will suffer from this.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but as a result of the congressional vote there is a danger that Washington will not offer a political means of managing the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in the air, just when the greatest transformation in the history of capitalism is taking place.
It is no longer possible to abandon the threat - mentions the Tages-Anzeiger of Geneva.
Some states today can still offer a life-saving doughnut to stumbling financial institutions and taxpayers' money can save them from bankruptcy.
But if more and more banks collapse as in a domino effect then neither the financial means nor new improvised solutions will be sufficient.
In the long term, the Member States of the European Union must overcome their national selfishness and concentrate control on the dismembered financial markets.
Only Monday have the weakened financial institutions obtained more than 100 billion euros - recalls the Viennese Der Standard, according to which it seems more and more real the anxiety that even European taxpayers, like the American ones, will have to put their hands on their portfolio to remedy the crisis.
The EU has not so far been very concerned about the crisis that has crossed the old continent as a tsunami.
The "saviors" must not immediately unwind the 100 billion euros, however it would be better if they established in which case it is appropriate to touch the taxpayers' money to prevent greater damage.
The smart machine imitates the flight of the dungeon
What could be the best method of developing anti-collision technologies if not imitating the sensors of the obstacles found in nature?
For example, bees.
In the surprising project presented to CETEC in Japan, the calabrons gave the initial strategic inspiration to Nissan engineers on how to build the next generation of anti-collision systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built the BR23C biomimetic robot, a robotic mini-car with bee properties, with the ultimate aim of creating a system that can scan all collisions.
Flying the bees form a personal oval space that really resembles our protective shield - Kazuhiro Doi, director of the PR technology and research and development sector, explained to the exhibition.
Important is the role of the bee's view, capable of a 300 degree view in each direction.
Engineers have drawn to the telemetric laser idea to copy the function of the bee's view.
The BR23C detects obstacles up to two metres away within a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor that immediately turns it into a control to avoid collision.
In a fraction of a second the robot perceives the obstacle and then, imitating the movements of the bee, immediately changes direction turning the wheels of the measure necessary to avoid the accident.
This avoidance maneuver, different from the current system, takes place in a completely instinctive way.
"If it weren't for that, the robot car wouldn't be able to react quickly to avoid collisions," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the robot car project.
It must react instinctively and immediately because this technology corresponds to the more damaging and internal layer of the protective shield, within which the collision is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what a bee does to avoid other bees.
This process must take place in a blink of an eye.
But unlike bees the deflection cannot go upwards or downwards or diagonally, it can be only two-dimensional and in the steering direction of the wheels.
In this way instead of the infinite possibilities available to bees to scan other bees, the robot, as a possibility available, can rotate on itself, accelerate and slow down.
The BR23C is powered by lighter, high energy-density lithium polymer batteries, which means that they last longer than lithium ions.
According to Andoh, the instantity of the intelligent reaction is important, not the processing of data or even less the ability to store them.
This robot needs to process some inputs in a few seconds and react.
There is no need to store them and react with intuitive logic based on previous maneuver data, so it uses only a few tens of Kb memory.
There is no need for a memory of gigabytes or megabytes.
This is the first step towards the development of a technology for the immediate avoidance of collisions that, they foresee at Nissan, can be installed within 10 years on the standard vehicles.
Further possibility of application can be represented by unification with GPS satellite navigation system that avoiding obstacles on the road leads to destination.
They also found the name of the most expensive child
The $700 billion economic bailout law has been written for the purchase of disproportionate claims, to be applied in several parts.
In the first step half of the sum is spent.
In the new agreements protracted until midnight Saturday according to the time of the east coast the leaders of the congress have decided the rescue plan of 700 billion dollars after a debate that lasted days - the Reuters has reported.
We have made serious strides forward - said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic President of the American House of Representatives, that it has only remained to put the agreement on paper.
Both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain, supported the plan's compromise.
Treasure Minister Henry Paulson speaking about the outcome of the compromise said: the program will work and it will be effective, but there is still much to do. According to Pelosi it is not the saving of Wall Street but the reversal of the economic car.
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of the Asian markets at 8 a.m. in Washington (Monday 2 a.m. in Central Europe), but it did not bring a great growth of the bags.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will vote first on the 2008 bill on economic stabilization concerning the program, after which it will go to the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday night, then welcomed the White House news of the deal.
We are pleased with the progress made last night and we greatly appreciate the efforts of the two parties to stabilise our financial markets and defend the economy - said Tony Fratto spokesman of the White House.
However, the program differs from the original Bush administration proposal, which provided that the $700 billion would all be spent on the purchase of securities with disproportionate credits behind them.
Now as a first step we can spend at most half of the sum of $700 billion, 250 billion immediately after the Congressional Monday vote, with these the Treasury will buy securities with disproportionate credits behind, of the fate of the remaining $100 billion will decide the president.
A special college will monitor the program in which the President of the Federal Reserve also takes part.
The spending of the other half of the 700 billion depends on a new Congressional decree.
Under the law the Treasury may apply a combined tactic: it may at the same time purchase loans, mortgages and securities with mortgages and other types of "poisoned" credits.
The purchase can take place through auctions and directly - they have announced competent ministry.
The legal rule makes it possible for the companies concerned to take part in an insurance program where the Ministry of the Treasury guarantees the means that give concern, for which the companies will pay an appropriate price to the probable damage.
Henrz Paulson said: the law gives the necessary means for $700 billion to arrive for the urgent needs of the American monetary system, whether it is the purchase of the wrong financial means, or their insurance or to avoid the risk of the collapse of a large financial institution.
We will take all necessary steps to get us ready to introduce the newly signed law - he added.
The directors of the banks in crisis and waiting for state aid think instead that the government will limit their success, defined by the overseas slang simply as gold parachutes.
Payment limitations will only occur in some cases, and limitations depend on how the Ministry of the Treasury will offer the aid.
In essence, the limitation means that if the ministry acquires in the framework of an auction, it will impose a surcharge on the gold parachute, if they will not retire the director of the fallen bank.
At the time of direct purchase of disproportionate claims, the government will act aggressively to ensure that the directors' money is not exaggerated.
It should be added that existing gold parachute contracts will not change, the limitation is only valid for new ones to encourage participation in the programme.
This is the first case in American history of the entry into force of a legal limitation on the remuneration of directors-general - commented the measure the Democratic Barney Frank chairman of the committee responsible for financial services of the House of Representatives.
In addition to this, the state has the right to appropriate a share of the banks participating in the program, reducing the risk of taxpayers, since in the end they can also earn us if the economy, and together with it the bank saved, will recover.
The bill includes that in the next five years the president must submit to Congress a proposal that has how to return the expected losses from the financial sector to the taxpayers.
Of course on both sides there were those who expressed their doubts about the project.
This is not what American citizens asked us to do, not to defend taxpayers' dollars - said the Republican deputy of California Darrell Issa.
Her democratic colleague from Ohio Mary Kaptur believes that the measures have been taken by the same people who are responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industry prices continue to rise

As a result of the change in domestic and export prices, industrial production costs were 0.7% higher than in the previous month and 3.2 % higher than in a year ago.
Domestic industrial sales prices compared to the previous month rose by only 0.1%.
Domestic sales prices in the processing sector also rose to a minimum by 0.1% compared to July.
The biggest increase in prices in August 2008 occurred in the leather and shoe processing sector (2.8%), especially the bags and belts with 4.6% and the production of shoes with 2.5% monthly increase.
The high price of plastic and chemical raw materials has led to a significant monthly increase (1.6%) in the chemicals and products sector.
A decrease in prices occurred in the oil processing sector (1.4%), in the production of electrical instruments and machinery (0.9%) and to a minimum in the processing of wood (0.1%)
The prices of paper production, publishing and printing have not changed.
In the other sectors of the processing industry there was an increase in prices between 0.2 and 0.9%.
In the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sector, prices increased in August by 0.3% in domestic industrial sales, primarily as a result of the dominant effect of the increase in the gas price by the authorities since 1 July.
Compared in 12 months, considering the domestic sales of the manufacturing industries, the biggest increases were in the oil processing sector (32.4%).
In the manufacture of metal products, the price increase was 13.2%, 11% in the production of food, beverages and tobacco, which is a determining factor.
A fall in prices was observed in the textile sector (2.5%) and in the production of electrical instruments and machinery (0.3%).
In the other sectors of the processing industry, the pace of price increases ranged from 0.6% to 9.1%.
In total in the processing industry in the past year prices have risen by 10.2%.

The Hungarian guilder in the course of a month has weakened compared to the euro by 1.7%, compared to the dollar by 7.1%, compared with August 2007 it has strengthened by 7.5% compared to the euro and by 15.9% compared to the dollar.
Next year in the United States without a visa?
Kinga Göncz sees the possibility that around 12 January the American-Hungarian visa-exempt agreement can enter into force - the Foreign Minister spoke about this in Chicago with the Hungarian representatives of the place.
According to his opinion "now everything depends on the fact that overseas is built in time the electronic system of entry and control".
However, he drew attention to the fact that in the new system there will no longer be an entry permit, however before departure tourists will have to be registered.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy will continue negotiations in Washington today.
He will meet with Foreign Minister Condoleeza Rice, to whom he will deliver the Order of the Hungarian Republic Cross Medal with the Star and will hold talks with the foreign policy advisors of Democratic candidate Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and John McCain also sided with the banks' bailout plan
Barack Obama and John McCain, the presidential candidates of the two major American parties, guaranteed Sunday their support for the $700 billion government plan for the rescue of the banks, but there are politicians who claim the resignation of the Treasury Minister.
The representatives of Congress and administration after the marathon negotiations lasted for days, Sunday night announced that they had concluded an agreement in principle on the bailout plan of the banks.
The Wall Street crisis and the financial package to free the frozen credit market have become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain want to be better suited than their rival to get the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent surveys with the spotlight on economic issues Obama has again regained some advantage, while McCain's advantage, obtained after the Republican convention with the appointment of Sarah Palin's vice president, has disappeared.
Obama in a speech in Detroit expressed the hope that the congress would quickly approve the $700 billion bill.
He stressed that the proposal contains those steps to protect consumers which were also supported by him.
"Now we must act responsibly (...), the danger threatens your work, your savings, all industrial sectors, complete economic stability" - said in front of a crowd of 35,000 people.
He didn't let himself get away with defining McCain's economic ideas out of hand.
McCain in an interview with ABC explained that "all those who will send down this situation with difficulty (...) but doing nothing is not a way to go."
The Republican senator reported that the proposal includes the creation of a monitoring committee of the Minister of Finance and the limitation of the good outflows of top managers, things on which he insisted.
Obama told CBS that McCain did not play a worthy role in the agreements, but he was in daily contact with the minister.
President Nancy Pelosi reported on Sunday that the House of Representatives will probably be voting on the bill by Monday.
Press review of the German-language world
The right pole is intact, only within the pole the voters have become more aware cars - thus analyzes Der Spiegel the weak result of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider's party is ready to rule Austria to prevent the red-black coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
Franz Walter, in the internet edition of the German magazine on the left, in the article The Bavarian Revolution devours its parents, analyses the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known polytologist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad couple Beckstein-Huber took office.
The Christian-socials have modernised Bavaria for decades and right now these modern citizens are moving away from them.
The change of era is at the same time a problem of all Christian democracy, as well as Angela Merker.
The defeat was not a big surprise for the CSU, but Sunday ended a trial that exactly ten years ago had been achievable: the indisputable hegemony of a party-state ended.
Already 10 years ago, in 1998, the CSU had fallen to 47.7%, for the first time below the 50% threshold since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago in the Bundestag elections in 2005 even during the period of the so-called Stoiber.
The reason for this is the modernization carried out as a result in the region, which devours the parents.
Sociologists predicted it 40 years ago, but they made a lot of mistakes in time. But secularization, the results of education, the establishment of East and North Germans in the developed Bavarian region could not be without consequences on the loyalty of voters to the CSU.
Modernisation goes hand in hand with increased possibilities and the political consequences are evident.
The right pole is intact, only within the pole the voters have become more aware, critical, stubborn.
It is also surprising that in recent weeks the classic bourgeois groups have left the CSU: free professionals, craftsmen, graduates and graduates.
Here support for the CSU fell below 40%.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
The Viennese conservative newspaper "Who with whom?" In the article "The presidents of the parties are stuck in coalition issues" deals with the confused Austrian internal political situation created following the elections.
The SPÖ intends to deal with ÖVP.
ÖVP prohibits the intervention of SPÖ in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open to negotiations in all directions, the Greens still do not want to discuss coalition.
The elections have been held, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debate broadcast by the public TV the leaders of the parties have just shown the cards.
Werner Faymann Chairman of the SPÖ confirmed that he wanted to deal with ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to demonstrate that it is possible to collaborate between the two parties, in some regions and in the social partnership already exists.
Faymann has left the question open if he can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, current President of ÖVP, as Vice Chancellor.
As you said, the Schüssel-Molterer course has in any case been rejected.
The repetition of this direction is not considered.
Molterer reacted cautiously to red offers.
As he said, cooperation will certainly not succeed if Faymann tries to get involved in ÖVP's internal affairs.
If your party chooses the opposition or joins the coalition is still open in the party, the issues must be discussed in any case within the ÖVP.
Jörg Haider leader of the BZÖ has repeated to be open in all directions.
"To prevent the red-black coalition we are ready to assume the responsibility to govern" - Haider said.
Járóka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today in Paris the European Summit for Equal Opportunities began, organized this year by France with the presidency of the European Union.
Livia Járóka, MP Fidesz of the European People's Party, in a message addressed to the plenum as the main rapporteur of the Congress, drew attention to school segregation because it is the most serious legal violation that affects Roma children and, moreover, the most serious obstacle to their affirmation.
Mr Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, on behalf of the French Presidency, and European Commissioner Vladimír Špidla, responsible for employment, social affairs and equal opportunities, opened the conference at the highest level.
Among those invited to the conference were governments, European social partners and representatives of major European civil and rights organisations in the context of equal opportunities.
Járóka, according to the press office of the Fidesz EP parliamentary group, pointed out, in addition to discrimination in recruitments, that Roma are excluded from the labour market in the first place because of their low level of schooling.
"Most Roma young people do not have an average level of education and as a result of poor quality elementary education only a small number of them can achieve a higher level of education."
Járóka also stressed, as a fundamental human right, the key role of education in promoting human rights.
Investing in the education of Roma children can mean strengthening the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the honourable Member, it is necessary to make these links more aware in the wider context between the Roma and non-Roma.
In fact, the sooner a Roma school starts, the more their chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market increase; through taxes paid for income and consumption they contribute to the nation's budget.
"The right of European citizenship of the Roma must guarantee their right to quality education and the elimination of low-level and segregated schools" - underlined Lívia Járóka.
According to the honourable Member, the union of purpose and action of the European Union is necessary in order to speed up the process of disintegration of schools, and for this reason it is of fundamental importance to respect the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives.
"The vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be interrupted, Roma children must be given the opportunities provided by the democratic space so that they can contribute as citizens full of the future of Europe" - asked Járóka.
In the sign of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities" to be guaranteed for all, the aim of the European Summit for Equal Opportunities organised each year, since last year's Berlin meeting, is to ensure a single forum to promote the objectives of anti-discrimination and equal opportunities set at state and European level.
CSU: pity for a transitional period
At the end of October the fate of the immaculate Huber-Beckstein couple will be decided.
Despite the bad electoral defeat, the heads of the Bavarian CSU have not yet fallen, so far the discussion of personal issues has been postponed.
The president of the Erwin Huber party and regional governor Günther Beckstein are still in their place, the question is as long as pity lasts.
The fate of the tandem that suffered a catastrophic 17% loss of votes will decide the party's extraordinary congress on the last weekend of October.
The two highly criticized politicians have in any case announced that they are not being attacked with all force to the chair.
So they tried to soften the angry members of the parliamentary group and the base that one day after the "Bavarian tsunami" claimed the personal consequences for the loss of an absolute majority.
Five years ago, under Edmund Stoiber's leadership at the height of his career, the Christian-Social Union achieved 60.7%, but now after the coup against Stoiber, they fell to 43.4%.
The CSU for 46 years has been an "absolute monarch" in Bavaria that gives 18% of the German GDP.
However, there are still conservatives in the southern region of fundamental importance to the Hungarian economy, and in the future they will be forced in any way to join forces.
As the first sign of the reorganization within the party the vice president and federal minister of agriculture Horst Seehofer, considered possible heir to Huber, gets a place in the narrow exploratory group that will start negotiations with the FDP liberals and with the Free Electors exponent right values for a possible government coalition in Munich.
For a strange joke of fate in the list of Free Electors enters the legislature that Gabriele Pauli whose attitude against Stoiber had been exploited as opportunities of coup by the Huber-Beckstein couple and then treat the woman with great ambitions without regard.
CSU leaders are now concentrating all their forces to stabilize Beckstein somehow.
In the meantime, Stoiber will also be taking an active role, which he has been plotting so far in the shadows. The former regional governor and former president of the CSU defined 28 September as the bitterest day of his political career.
On Monday Huber issued some statements to the faithful to the CSU, according to which they would have deserved more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel.
Merkel will not be able to be a chancellor after the Bundestag elections scheduled for September 2009 unless the CSU, which played a decisive role in the 2005 national victory, will be put back on its feet with common forces.
According to Merkel, who does not hide the disappointment over the fiasco, the loss of CSU land will not negatively affect the great coalition of Berlin.
What is certainly relative: it will not be easy to manage the wounded CSU, but the crisis of the Social Democrats still lasts.
The SPD achieved its lowest result since 1946 in Bavaria with 18.6%.
Lukashenko-opposition: 110-0
Nor did a representative of the opposition enter the Belarusian Parliament after the Sunday elections.
According to Russian observers, it is a sign of well-being and stability in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, according to the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), instead it is explained by the misconceptions committed in the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognise the elections.
Although the legislation of 110 people in a country of 10 million inhabitants has been unopposed for more than a decade, before yesterday's elections the opposition under the name United Democratic Forces (ODS) seriously hoped that Lukashenko, with the presidential mandate renewed for the fourth time following the constitutional amendment to the 2006 elections held under disputed circumstances, would "give" some seats in Parliament to representatives of the opposition.
The ODS has thus renounced a previously assessed boycott.
Behind the opposition's expectations was that Belarus, increasingly economically dependent on Russia, which requested credit to reduce the import of increasingly expensive Russian natural gas and agreed to give Russians the gas pipelines in possession of Beltransgaz that cross the country, intended to improve the relationship with the EU where Lukashenko and other high-ranking politicians cannot enter because of the Belarusian political situation considered undemocratic.
It referred to a distension that the OSCE, in assessing the election campaign, placed emphasis on positive movements and not on shortcomings, such as the ban on one-third of opposition candidates.
However, the OSCE's rapid Monday report also criticized the campaign, during which opposition candidates in practice could not appear in the press, and in particular that the opposition could not be present at the counting of votes.
Despite this, according to the opposition, an improvement in the political climate is noticeable: political prisoners have been released, Minsk is also prepared to a small confrontation with Moscow, continuing to deny the recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia from Georgia, even though Russia, with which Belarus forms a federal state on paper, considers the two countries as independent for a month.
We have taken two steps forward and one step backwards, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun - said to our newspaper Aleksandr Milinkevich.
According to the presidential candidate for the 2006 election opposition, it is desirable that it remain, despite the fact that "the power was afraid to bring even one opponent into a weightless Parliament".
The opposition does not foresee protest actions for the results but rather tries to get the voters the message of the need for economic reforms.
Of course we have many problems, we have to print the newspapers of the opposition in Russia, for the distribution the local authorities raise difficulties, but also so I see that more and more people support the change, also among the elderly - said Milinkevich referring to the fact that not even the officially most helped class, that of pensioners, considers the Lukashenko regime that considers its main result to be the creation of social security.
Due to the country's indebtedness and the increase in the economic deficit it is only a matter of time the breakdown of social security "that recalls the sepulchral silence" - Milinkevich believes.
Unlike the opposition politician, the Russian observers have judged the elections democratic.
Sergej Lebedev President of the Community Independent States told the Russian press agency RIA Novosti: "men believe not in words but in facts", so the lack of opposition is nothing more than proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on breakfast before work"
It never happened in the history of Palazzo Chigi that there were revolving doors for the entry and exit of the employees.
But from now on, this new measure is taking off against the smarts, against those who stamp and then go to the bar for a coffee on working time.
The anti-fannulloni news was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and the Secretary General of the Council Presidency, Mauro Masi.
"The revolving doors - says Brunetta - are a tool to work better, with more productivity, more presences and more services" the minister says.
"A new season of accountability and transparency is now opening.
This is reformism," Brunetta continues.
With Palazzo Chigi the installation is completed in all the buildings of the Presidency of the Council.
For Masi "the choice of rotating doors is also important from the symbolic point of view".
There was no resistance from the employees, says the Secretary General: "It was a process shared by the workers and there was the collaboration of all".
I mean, no more breakfast at work; no more coffee and cornet.
Brunetta's words, which suggest, smiling, "a beautiful cappuccino at 7 a.m. is a holy hand".
During a conference at the School of Public Administration
in Rome, the minister then makes known that "in three months the absences due to illness of public employees have decreased by 50%, that is to say 60 thousand more people to work in a year".
And adds that it is necessary to make the Public Administration more efficient
Italian, "whose wage dynamics - the minister explains - in the last 8-10 years have been double compared to the private sector and well above the rates of inflation".
Meanwhile, thousands of civil servants joined forces to challenge the rules of the Brunetta decree by adhering to the appeal supported by the Codacons.
"While the minister of the Public Service is now outnumbered about the lesser absenteeism at work due to disease - writes the consumer association - the people of the 'operators' are constantly growing.
There are thousands in Italy, in fact, the employees of the correct and productive public administration who have joined forces to declare war on the illegitimate norms contained in the decree."
In particular, the Tar will object to the exclusion of additional economic treatment for illness dependent on service; the extension of the time-limits for finding the sick worker, within which checks are carried out, and other aspects contained in the new provisions of the Minister.
Accidents at work, Napolitano: "Critical prevention"
Every day, in Italy, 2,500 accidents occur at work, 3 people die and 27 remain permanently disabled.
For 2007, the Inail data confirm that the white deaths were about 1,200.
Figures testifying to the gravity of a phenomenon that remains one of the main causes of death and causes almost twice as many deaths as murder.
To draw the attention of institutions, social forces and the media to this dramatic issue, today Anmil celebrates in all the provinces of Italy the 58th National Day for the victims of accidents at work, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The worrying data disseminated by Anmil and the same tragic chronicles of these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at work is," says the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano, in a message sent to the President of Anmil, National Association mutilated and invalids of work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expressed his "great appreciation for the continued commitment of associations to prevention in the workplace, the protection of injured workers, the care of victims' families and the raising of public awareness".
"Of course, there has been an outraged 'enough', sincerely shared, in the face of tragedies that, because of their size, provoke the clamor of the media and the involvement of public opinion, but daily reality offers us dramatic, even repetitive, cases in their dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is undoubtedly also a problem of resources: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
Particular significance assume the numerous initiatives promoted in the school field for a more direct awareness by young people facing the world of work.
It is necessary to keep a close eye on the phenomenon, not to delay in the alarm about its social gravity, to apply and improve the legislative rules.
For his part, the president of the Gianfranco Fini Chamber stressed "how the phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which offends the conscience of each of us and imposes on all the institutions a determined commitment aimed at putting an end to it urgently".
"The data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight positive development, but this does not mean that the number of white deaths is still impressive," noted the president of Anmil Pietro Mercandelli.
"In fact, we do not want this "tendence to the downside" to be translated into less attention, because it is precisely when the attention is relaxed that the tragedy explodes.
"We believe that at the general level too little is done to counter the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be exercised through multiple actions.
In our opinion - it has emphasized Mercandelli - more controls and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the training of the workers, and this from the world of the school".
"It serves a further effort - it has added - regarding the communication and the awareness of the public.
But, above all, there needs to be a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers for a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
Mercandelli then denounced "the progressive deterioration of the levels of compensation provided for the victims of work" and the "supportive income towards which the system is moving in recent years".
"The aim is therefore to return to the worker the insurance guarantee - it has added - so that the fate of those who are injured must not depend on spontaneousisms or provision from time to time arranged by the legislator".
Mp3 readers on charges put the hearing at risk
Listening to high volume music for an extended period of time using portable music devices such as Mp3 players can cause permanent hearing injuries.
This is what the European Commission reports, which in a communiqué published in Brussels cites the opinion of the Scientific Committee on Emerging and Recently Identified Health Risks (Csseri) of the EU, published today.
"From this scientific opinion - it is read in the note - emerges that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable musical devices weekly for more than an hour per day keeping the apparatus at high volume risk a permanent loss of hearing ability".
"I am concerned that such a large number of young people who frequently use portable music devices and mobile phones at high acoustic levels can unconsciously damage their hearing irreparably," says Meglena Kuneva.
"From the scientific findings - the responsible EU - emerges a clear risk and we must react quickly.
Most importantly, we need to raise consumer awareness and make this information publicly available.
We must also review existing control systems, in the light of this scientific opinion, to ensure that they are fully effective and keep up with the new technology."
Brussels had asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the large use of portable musical devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to noise from them.
"Scientists - the EU executive concludes - confirm that there is concern and the European Commission will now examine together with Member States and stakeholders what measures could be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable musical devices and similar equipment".
At present, there is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable musical equipment to 100 dB, but concerns about hearing damage that can result from excessive exposure to these sources of noise are growing.
It is possible to limit this damage by using solutions such as reducing levels and duration of exposure to noise.
In its opinion, the EU Scientific Committee points out that users of portable musical equipment if they listen to high volume (more than 89 decibels) music for only 5 hours per week exceed the limits currently in force for maximum permitted noise at the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for longer periods risk a permanent loss of hearing ability after a period of 5 years.
This would cover 5-10% of the users of such devices and their number can be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno kicks off the Commission for the future of the capital
Today it begins, in March it closes, in June the sums will be drawn.
This is the timetable set by the Campidoglio for the work of the "Commission for the future of Rome Capitale", which was established this morning in its new headquarters behind the Terme di Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will develop the guidelines for Rome.
Once closed in March, the Junta and the Municipal Council will evaluate analyses and projects, so that they can present the Strategic Plan for Rome in June with the "official bubble" of the Capitol and its mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and has represented all the political, social and cultural ideas - it wishes to emphasize Alemanno - will have to provide proposals for an idea of development of Rome which the political decision-makers, who remain the Junta and the municipal council, will then be able to use.
There is no overlap of roles but only the will to have a place to work out a great project for Rome.
In March he will finish his work and then dissolve, because this experience must have a precise time term.
In June - the mayor announces - we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the future of Rome Capitale".
To those who accuse the Commission of futility, since its opinions will not be binding, Alemanno replies: "It all depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do and the quality of its proposals.
If there will be quality, as in France with the Attali Commission and as I am sure also in Rome, its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often, politics crushes on the management of everyday life and on the emergencies that happen from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to look further and further, in a deeper perspective, working seriously on the development of Rome and its future".
In addition, the Mayor of Rome wishes to point out that "this Commission is neither an unnecessary body nor a carriage: it is absolutely free, it will not cost Roman citizens a euro and will serve to reason and involve the best intelligences expressed by the capital".
For Alemanno, in fact, "it is necessary to have a strategic reference design, not closed or immobile, in order to allow our city to make an authentic leap of level, of which it absolutely needs, thinking in a unitary spirit of its future".
A future that, according to the mayor of Rome "will not be limited to the current municipal boundaries but will look far beyond" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as Capital but also in consideration of the role that Rome can and must play as Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama? The first anti-American president. That's why
He wrote a well-known American politician who wants us to be independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions decimated the US economy and had relations (as he does today as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam."
Attacks on Obama are increasing just as the election date approaches.
A Miami lady wrote on a web site: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama has a big face: he believes he will win the highest office of a nation that has had in all two governors and five black senators!"
In fact, they are attacks that do not say much; they are clearly racial attacks and do not answer the voters' question: will he be a good president? Then there are the Polls; they all say that Obama will win and with a good detachment.
In this case, too, there are those who speak with the heart but not with the brain.
A Mississippi newspaper, in the bowels of the southern United States, wrote an editorial: once in the cabin to vote we know well who will give his vote to the American patriot.
Out comes a side of the American mentality kept covered up to the last.
"Say what you want, then we'll figure out where to put the cross, whether on Obama or McCain."
There are people who swear that if Obama wins, we'll leave America.
Things never said before, which almost certainly appears to be the success of the black candidate.
However, despite all these reasonings, the winning weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
They asked 1500 people: what were Bush's mistakes during his term of office? 89 percent answered: Iraq.
Change America.
In Vietnam this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and was kicked home in the ass.
In Iraq there are 4,500 soldiers who have lost their lives and the Americans have not been forced to pack.
Yet, Iraq for the majority was Bush's weak spot.
Whoever takes George W's place will have a huge task to perform.
Use, the economic shock is also felt by journalists: in the newspapers it is time for cuts. And many blame the internet, "killer" of the printed paper.
Five hundred American journalists were questioned by the PEW Research Center about the state of their profession and mental control with regard to the future.
Well, today journalists are almost all pessimistic about their future.
However, newsmen have not openly stated that they feel less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like they used to.
The problem for US journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of a destroyed economic model.
Moreover, the cuts made in the newsroom, in the room where the editors work to put the newspapers together, is a big problem.
It is a problem that needs to be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if traditional journalism is not to be reduced substantially, as the big audience intends.
A clear but complex pessimism pervades the US journalist today.
Six out of ten newspapermen and senior executives are convinced that the national newspaper is on the wrong track.
In the local field the executive group is 65%.
Printed against broadcast.
It's not hard for journalists to see where the web goes.
The major publishing houses open a loop towards the internet, for many views as the "killer" of printed paper.
The "economic pressure" that journalists feel has increased to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted that they are embracing technology in the hope that it "does something good" for their journalism.
The biggest break today in American journalism is between those who run the newsrooms - i.e. the directors - and the reporters who work for them.
56% of executives at national level are sure that their reporters divide their values, while at local level the percentage drops to 23%.
For some this has to do with "work security".
Executives who think of losing their jobs within 3 years are 47% at national level.
For staff reporters it goes to 30%.
That of "safe work" at the staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work on a contract.
In a huge nation like the US, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and internet employers often offer what they want and thus becomes a matter of "take it or leave it", take it or leave it.
The directors almost always receive large salaries, while the editor can earn as much as 10 thousand dollars a month, in addition to pension and insurance payments.
For holidays, then, the reasoning becomes complicated: all days after the first year, all after the third year to reach 15 days overall after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, for their admission, often get sick during the year.
It's all about the weather.
UNIPOL: ROME TRIBUNAL, DANILO COPPOLA STAYS IN GROTTAFERRATE
The president of the second criminal division of the court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the application of the real estate agent Danilo Coppola who had asked to be able to move from his town, Grottaferrata, to a house in the city of Rome.
Coppola is investigated for bankruptcy in the context of the Unipol-Bnl Counterfeit Investigation.
In the course of his trial, last week, he was released from prison by the housewives who had been transformed into an obligation to reside in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the real estate agent could travel from the provincial town to a home in the capital.
According to the court, however, these movements (which the PM had opposed) would allow him to influence his company and access the evidence that accuses him.
The elites in danger
The phenomenon had already manifested itself a few days ago with the vote of the House of Representatives against the $700 billion bailout plan launched by the White House: a significant part of Americans was, and is, more interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the economy.
The New York Times of yesterday confirms this by informing us that the ongoing crisis is tearing apart the Republican Party, increasingly divided between its old, moderate East Coast soul, in favour of federal institutions and the business community, and its new, conservative soul, hostile to "those of Washington" and the world of finance, especially strong in the Central and Southern states.
The soul, for the very reason, that has made itself impotently alive with the vote I said at the beginning.
This just quoted is, however, just an example of the changes, of the major changes, which the ongoing economic earthquake may foretell or already allow to see: not only in the United States but throughout the West and perhaps not only here.
Both in the US and in Europe the crisis seems to function as an accelerator of incubation phenomena for a long time that in the new climate solidify and finally come to light.
The first of these phenomena is the realization, the extraordinary revival, of the dual category State-survivorship in relation to a sort of renationalisation of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of banking-financial institutions which have, yes, strong links with foreign countries, but which first and foremost involve the budgets of people and families living in one country, in one state.
This immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of those people and families who, among other things, are also an electorate.
In short, the crisis appears to be economically global, but politically it is almost exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems essentially out of play or not to have much to say: the shining test is given by the European Union which divides as usual between the different interests and between the different state strategies fails to decide any common political line.
And so it is from the government of every single state that everyone expects interventions, rescue and recovery plans, new rules, and above all the provision of funds: since when you get to the strict it is only the states that have the economic resources, the mass of financial resources that can try to put things back.
And they also have the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of immense value, in certain circumstances, which probably no market and no international organization will ever be able to dispose of to a similar extent.
This new emphasis that the crisis puts on the state-national element is, moreover, in perfect harmony with the increasing importance that the latest developments in the economy tend to attribute to a factor very closely linked to that element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that we were now entering the realm of the net, of the increasingly sophisticated technology, of the immaterial, while we were convinced that globalized finance was now destined to dominate the world, we realized for a moment that our future will have to deal increasingly with those very immaterial things that are water, harvests, oil.
All things that, look a bit, can certainly be transported from one place to another of the earth but are nevertheless absolutely linked to a limited space, to a territory.
So that those who find themselves to be sovereign, certainly have many more cards than those who are not, to those who have the misfortune of living in a place without crops, without oil and without water.
I come to the second novelty that foreshadows a fracture.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics, and therefore Leadership.
In this respect, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand the awareness of the objective need for authoritative leadership, the request of someone who knows how to take control of the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for the existing leadership, economic species, revealed so inadequate and full of shadow zones.
And together something even deeper and in a certain sense disturbing: a disbelief, an indifference, an image of inadequacy, a sense of distance, which tends to involve the entire ruling class in a growing number of Western countries.
In other words, there seems to be a growing belief, in large sections of the population, that before their actions are the same as the ideas of the social elites up to now, their way of feeling and being, their culture in the overall meaning of the term, to have made their own time and to be more and more alien to the opinions of the majority.
The demand for leadership, in short, feeds underground a branched but powerful movement of delegitimization of the traditional political classes and structures, which manifests itself in the sudden "electoral revolutions" or in the sudden upheavals of the collective moods of these last and recent times, from the conservative rise in Austria-Bavaria to the collapse of the Labour consensists in Great Britain, to the rebellion of the American congressmen against Bush (and perhaps even the victory of the right in Italy has something to do with it).
The impression is that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their formats would say someone, make it more and more difficult to understand, and therefore to represent, what is not from today taking shape in the deep layers of Western societies and that the economic crisis invigorates, increases, acts potentially to disintegrate.
In the face of all this, talking about a "rebellion of the masses" on the agenda would be frankly exaggerated.
But keeping your eyes open certainly isn't.
The super glue to walk on the walls
Defeat the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and in the future walk on the walls like Spiderman.
It is the goal of several American research centers and now a team of four institutions has gone very close to us.
With a sticker of only 2.5 square centimetres, the scholars managed to stick a 100-kilogram body on a vertical wall.
LO STUDIO – The American journal Science has published the findings of researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of scholars is an evolution of those existing that use a particular carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
"The glue principle can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged as a pile of spaghetti," explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the legs of the geckos, covered with microscopic hairs that can ensure perfect adherence to the animal.
Tests conducted on various materials, such as glass, Teflon and glass paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of these reptiles and at the same time "it is easily detached from the wall," explains Liming Dai, researcher at the University of Dayton's Faculty of Engineering.
WALK ABOUT THE DEATHS? -"This material could be useful as a temporary sticker," adds Liming Dai.
Maybe to walk on the walls just like Spiderman? Maybe so, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use as the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are heat conductors and electric current.
Other applications could include aerospace engineering.
At the moment no superheroes.
OTHER RESEARCH – The University of Berkeley, California, is also researching a new adhesive.
In an article on the American Chemical Society magazine, Californian scholars presented a microfiber-shaped sticker like hair that self-cleans from dust during movement on a surface to always maintain a perfect grip.
Pharmaceuticals: never with fruit juices
Attention to grapefruit juice, orange juice and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed mainly in summer because they are dissatisfied and rich in vitamins, if taken at the same time as some life-saving medicines alter their absorption by amplifying or decreasing their efficacy, depending on the case, with also serious consequences for their health.
To reiterate the risks of both packaged and fresh fruit juices associated with the use of certain medicines David Bailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, and since the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia launches a new alarm: just a glass of grapefruit juice, orange and apple to reduce the absorption of some life-saving medicines, cancels the beneficial effects and endangers the health of patients.
Grapefruit juice had already ended up on charges because it was held responsible for increasing the effects of certain antiarrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, antihistamine and neurological medicinal products to levels considered toxic.
FARMACI A RISCHOIO - The Italian Medicines Agency itself reported this in an information bulletin two years ago alerting doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger arising from this mixture and to be careful what they drink in case they take drugs such as Diazepam or Metadone.
NOT ONLY POMPELMO - According to experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit drugs.
Along the list of active substances inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
Hence the appeal of Michele Carruba, director of the Department of Pharmacology of the State University of Milan:"These findings are immediately reported to the various international and national drug agencies, which will eventually change the information notes of the drugs.
So always read the package leaflets of the medicines you take and if there is something that is not clear to us, don't let us be impressed but ask the doctor or pharmacist for clarification» the expert stressed to the agency Ansa.
The Nobel in Economics at Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize for Economics was awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his studies on business models and the localization of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a New Yorker who teaches at Princeton University and is a well-known editor of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of Bush administration's economic and foreign policy choices.
A few months after the attacks of September 2001, on the days when Enron failed, Krugman had predicted in an editorial published in the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences on the history of the United States.
A prediction that sparked not a few controversies and that for years it was re-faced to the economist, but that has now proved to be correct.
"I am surprised and also a little shocked by the speed with which the memory of scandals such as Enron's collapse or Worldcom disappeared from public attention," Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "economist of great value", but also a divulgator with a style "very aggressive, particularly critical against the excesses of liberalism of the Bush administration".
Open Office, here's the third edition of the anti-Microsoft package
It is the day of the release of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the open source suite of personal productivity that aims to reach more and more users, from home to office, from professionals to public administration, as a free alternative to the most well-known Microsoft Office.
After almost a year's work by volunteer developers, behind whom SUN Microsystem monitors, the new Open Office shows itself to the general public with several new features: to the welcome screen and to the revised and less Spartan interface, add other more substantial ones such as native compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF format (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest ISO standard version.
Attention also placed to interoperability with the Office Suite 2007, Open Office is able to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting some specific features of some modules such as the one that allows to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example to send them by email, or the possibility to import PDF files into the graphic processing module, retaining the original appearance of the page.
Also on this front you can create "hybrid PDF" documents, which accumulate the typical graphics of Adobe format with the elements of a spreadsheet or text processor.
The collaboration is an element that has received several improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet you can intervene in multiple hands between different users, avoiding conflicts about the changes, in the text writer, to each collaborator is assigned a color in the comments for better recognizability in the revision phase.
Some companies are also working to bring some OpenOffice features to the Web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the coming weeks should release the final result.
The Italian version is available for download at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and has been added to the English version on the mirrors since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request can also be shipped home or at work the installation cd.
And if the theme of gratuity can be a tow for the diffusion in the houses, it is precisely in business that Open Office the suite tries the big bet, already being able to count on several projects made in public administration and schools.
And there are also the realities that offer an ideal training, advice and assistance service for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could open up business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for the corresponding Word video writing; Calc, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for the emulo presentations of Powerpoint; Dbase, as in the case of the most famous Access is the program that allows you to work on the databases; Draw, is finally the graphic module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that to date we are almost 3 million and 600 thousand, with the release of the new version it is likely that you can also exceed the expected figure.
Kohl is also positive is the fourth case of doping
New case of positivity at the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, the Gerolsteiner team, third ranked and winner of the best climber jersey.
To report the news is the website of the daily L'Equipe.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth positive racer at Cera, the third generation Epo, after the Italian Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher, also of the Gerolsteiner.
Kohl's blood sample tests are among those conducted in recent weeks by laboratories in Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counteranalysis confirms the positivity in Cera, the Austrian will lose third place on the Tour and will meet the two years of canonical disqualification.
To confirm the news of Kohl's positivity at the Third Generation Epo is the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who informed the Associated Press that he had notified the Austrian authorities of the positivity.
The 26-year-old Austrian placed himself on the final podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, also winning the polka dot shirt of the best climber.
IMMIGRATES: NEW YORK TIMES IF YOU Ask, ITALY IS RAZZIST?
Italy "from the country of emigrants has only recently become a privileged destination for immigrants" welcomed reluctantly.
Is this transforming the Belpaese into a nation of racists? That's what the New York Times asked in a long article that dedicated a long article to the debate on racism in Italy starting from the case of young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso killed last month in Milan for stealing a box of cookies.
This case highlights what the Nyt defines as the "Northern Paradox": the northern regions are at the same time those where there is "more integration and more work" but also the "highest anti-immigrant feeling in the country and the highest support for the North League".
To confirm the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, Nyt also mentioned the episodes of intolerance of Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not only.
The new legislation required by the League to tighten the brakes on immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegal immigrants is also cited as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
A trend highlighted by both the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano meeting Benedict XVI at the Quirinale asked that the State and the Church work together to defeat racism".
Student victims of expensive rents up to 900 euros for one room
There is no crisis in the rental market for university students.
According to Sunia's latest investigation, the tenants' union, taking a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now taken on very serious characteristics to the point of excluding entire groups of young people from the right to study for the very high overall costs that families of origin should bear - explains the head of the study office of Sunia, Laura Mariani - in these cities the strong demand from students has so distorted the market that it triggers a process of general increase also for residents".
In most cases, rent offers then contain a number of infringements: free, unregistered, fee-free sub-rents linked.
For Sunia, extraordinary measures are needed which, through the revision of taxation, can calm prices.
Looking at the details of the survey, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, it takes about 450 euros; for a single room you go from a minimum of 650 (Black Band area) to an average value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera area) to a maximum of 900 (Vittoria area).
In Florence, an average bed cost 350/400 euros, a room about 700.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in areas close to the University, it takes 250/280 euros for a double bed, from 370 to 500 euros for a single bed.
In Rome in areas close to the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) are asked about 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a bed in a double.
Only slightly lower values (550 euros for a single room) in areas close to other universities (Hostiense and Cinecittà).
You can save only if you move to peripheral areas: 300 euros for one bed and 450 singles in Prenestina, Centocelle and the like.
In Naples, 300/450 euros are needed for a bed, for a room it is spent from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Policlinic, Vomero and Colli Aminei areas.
Bari needs 250/350 euros for a single bed, at least 350 euros for a single bed.
In smaller cities prices are lower in absolute terms, but they have a greater weight in the city economy.
In cities where rents to non-EU students are more frequent, as in Perugia, there is a further anomaly: the increase of about 25/30% of the fee applied to foreign students compared to that applied to Italians.
Farewell old cinema Paradise, cities erase historic halls
Historical cinemas close in favor of the Multiplexes.
"A city without cinema is a blind city, it's like a face without eyes."
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore effectively photographs what is happening in large Italian urban centers but also in the cities of the province.
The process of marginalisation of cinemas, with the birth on the outskirts of the large multisala and the consequent death by consumption of the monosala in the central areas of the cities, is one of those events that appear inevitable and incontrovertible to us but also has all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
They are often places of history and memory, "it's as if a friend, a acquaintance with whom we shared a piece of road and many emotions are missing," observes the director of New Cinema Paradiso, the film that twenty years ago won Tornatore the Oscar prize and the Grand Prix of the jury of Cannes, and that he told the poetry of a provincial hall and the nostalgia for a way of living the cinema lost perhaps forever.
The figures provided by Anec, the main association of the operators, speak clearly: in the last five years they have closed 316 cinemas of traditional type, and to pay the biggest scot are mainly the halls in the main cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 less in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 less in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closures is Emilia-Romagna, with 82 monosala cinemas lost, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And as a demonstration that the first person responsible for their disappearance is the advent of the multiplex, these are the three Italian regions that have recorded the largest number of new multisala cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany and in Emilia-Romagna.
"The Italian exercise has developed irrationally," notes Paolo Protti, president of Anec, "it is useful to build new structures but it would be necessary to ensure the survival of existing ones, because when a city hall closes, not all its visitors are willing to move into multiplexes.
Not to mention the lack of funding for the fund in favour of the operators: the previous debt of the State is about 10 million euros.
It is shameful, ethically and morally, that the government does not respect existing laws.
To support the sector would serve between 16 and 18 million euros a year".
Interestingly the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that, worried about the closures, decided to run to the shelters with the signature of a protocol between the Municipality and Anec, the first of this type in Italy, to protect and promote the cinemas monosala both in the historical center and in the periphery.
Among the rules provided for there are tax relief measures for managers and public benefits in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to enter the restricted traffic area and will have special rates for stopping and in some parking lots.
"It's an initiative I like," says Giuseppe Tornatore, "and I hope that other cities follow the example of Bologna by putting in place other measures.
It is true, however, that in order to counteract the power of multiplexes, traditional rooms must also improve the quality of sound and image, because the public today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important to me: the closure of the Supercinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to do "New Paradise cinema", which I had been thinking about for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass before the Rialto or the Quirinale of Via Nazionale now closed, there where I have lived so many shared emotions, in order not to see the signs anneritated by the dust I turn on the other side".
Links between politics and 'drangheta arrested mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to standardize the City's choices to the interests of the Pyromalli Cosca".
The charges against the mayor and deputy mayor of Gioia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrio and Rosario Schiavone, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, who were arrested this morning for outside competition in Mafia Association, are heavy.
In handcuffs also Gioacchino Piromalli, the elder mediator between the clan and the public administrations, and his nephew lawyer, the boss's homonym, already convicted for association for crime of mafia mold, condemned to compensate 10 million euros.
"In contempt of any legal and moral norms, as well as common sense," the prosecutors wrote, the two local administrations had expressed their willingness to pay advice to attorney Piromalli.
"It would have been thus granted to the Cosca - the judges write - to enter officially inside the municipalities, facilitating the already important possibilities of control and direction of the public administration".
The president of the Calabrian regional junta Agazio Loiero does not hide that "collusions between local authorities and organized malavita are many" in his region: "There are areas where the mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians who resist the pressure of 'drangheta, heroes who keep themselves clean'.
This morning's arrests follow those of last July with which the police announced that they had beheaded the Piromalli Cossack.
Since the end of April last year, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro was dissolved but already in 1991, and always because of alleged conditions between organized crime and local administration, the local politicians had been relieved of the task of administering the municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the Udc at the time of the dissolution, had been elected head of a centre-right coalition, after the balloting in May 2006.
He shouted at the scandal when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He called in question the then Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs Marco Minniti, accusing him of having designed the whole thing for a political issue, but the judges, in the arrest order signed this morning, explain that the Piromalli Coss had even asked for the variation of the A3 project.
From the environmental interceptions ordered against Dal Torrione, write the pm, it emerged "the willingness to marry the needs of an entrepreneur, representative of a larger group known to be close to the Pyromalli, standardizing the choices of the public administration to the interests of the Cossack".
When the energy comes from the waves, the big ones go down in the field.
It is an exterminated deposit, which occupies over 70% of the planet's surface and is now being discovered by the world's major energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources on which they have put their eyes, and now try to put their hands, colossal like the Chevron.
The possibility of obtaining energy from the movements of the sea has been studied for a hundred years and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, research intensified.
When the price of oil dropped around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was put aside, but now the environmentalist demands and the new increase in oil give impetus to the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimated in 2007 that 15% of the world's electricity needs could be covered by offshore wave-movement facilities.
This amount would be twice as much as currently produced by nuclear power plants.
Plus there'd be currents and tides.
Attacks.
The first company to bet on marine energy was Enersis, which signed an agreement in 2005 to build a plant in Northern Portugal.
When the deal was announced, it seemed like a revolutionary step.
Two years away from betting on marine energy they are increasingly and among these companies that have always voted for traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying the technologies on ocean energy - it has declared the spokesman of a company associated to the colossal American oilmaker to the economic newspaper Wall Street Journal - and is considering the possibility of cooperating with us".
The cooperation in question concerns obtaining a permit from the US Energy Commission, which is needed to launch a project for the exploitation of marine energy in Alaska.
It is a signal not long ago, especially if you consider that right in Alaska the US continues to extract oil and President Bush has recently launched a plan for new drilling.
In addition to the Chevron, there are the Verdant Power Inc. of New York and the Ocean Power of New Jersey on the way to the energy that comes from the sea and the sums invested so far, although not known in the details, indicate an interest in ascension according to the observers.
Technology to be developed.
Experts are talking about a technology that is still early, also because marine energy does not escape all doubts about the environmental impact.
For now, facilities such as the Portuguese one or some in Scotland are small and do not seem to create major problems for the ecosystem.
In order to produce large-scale energy, however, technologies with a greater environmental impact must be used.
And the choices are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of connected buoys.
The wave thrust, which moves the buoys up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure by pistons and cylinders inside the floats.
The pressure turns a turbine that in turn feeds a generator.
Electricity is sent to shore through submarine cables.
For now there are four such installations under design, waiting only for federal approval and some of the energy could be used for a military installation.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces energy for a mall and a parking lot using six submarine turbines in the East River of New York.
The movement of water when there are tides turns the blades of the turbines, creating a rotary movement that feeds a generator.
Verdant said she has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorizations to use the energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say to the Institute for the Research of Electricity, deserves at this moment the potential of tides.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable than wind, sun or waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It is precisely on the energy of tides that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, together with others that face the coast, have already invested 7 and a half million dollars in 2008 and previewed investments up to 35 million for 2009.
