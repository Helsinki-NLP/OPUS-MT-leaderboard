Barack Obama will be the fourth American president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
US President Barack Obama will fly to Oslo, Norway, to spend 26 hours there and be the fourth American president in history to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
The $1.4 million diploma, medal and cheque will be awarded, among other things, for his outstanding efforts to strengthen global diplomacy and collaboration among nations.
The head of the White House and his wife Michelle will land in the morning in the Norwegian metropolis and will have a busy program.
He will first go to the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the first time the five members of the Committee who chose him in October among 172 people and 33 organizations.
The presidential couple's planning then provides for an interview with the King of Norway Harald V and Queen Sonja.
The visit will take place in the afternoon at a solemn ceremony where Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will be the fourth American president to receive it, but only the third to be awarded the prize within the Committee itself.
The White House informed in advance that Obama would talk about the war in Afghanistan when the award was presented.
The president does not want to avoid this subject because he is aware that he receives this prize by being a president who is conducting a war in two countries at the present time.
He reinforced the war effort a few days ago by sending additional units to Afghanistan, which none of his critics will forget to highlight.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a cheque of ten million Swedish kroner (about 1.1 million Euros).
He intends to donate it to charitable works, but he has not yet concretely decided which ones.
His busy program will then take him and his wife to a banquet including, in addition to the King and Queen of Norway, the head of government and 250 other guests.
Obama was rather reluctant at that price at first.
He mentioned, for example, a feeling that he did not fully deserve it.
He also repeated several times that it is not a prize for himself alone, but for all those who defend the same values as him.
As soon as he announced it, he said it would be an "invitation to act".
A nature defender accused of blackmail
The Litoměřice police accused the president of the Association of Nature Protectors of Litoměřice of blackmail.
On several occasions last year he appealed for several construction procedures and asked for money from investors for his personal profit in exchange for the withdrawal of his appeal, said Alena Romová, spokesman for the police of Litoměřice.
The President of the Society of Nature Protectors of Litoměřice is Lubomír Studnička.
He is currently in detention and is at risk of up to three years' imprisonment.
Waste sorting bins are not perfumed in Brno
In Prague everyone can sort their beverage packages, while in the villages of South Moravia you fall on sorting bins at every corner of the street.
What about Brno?
There, it would take you several minutes to find the right dumpsters.
I don't mean we wouldn't sort Brno's waste at all.
But I have the impression that the city councillors of our city, the second largest city in the country, are not sufficiently interested in this problem.
Brno is at the stone age of waste sorting not only because citizens can still sort only paper, glass and PVC, but above all in view of the number of dumpsters dedicated to this waste.
Have you ever tried throwing a plastic bottle into the city centre?
It is a whole science, which requires mainly time and nerves of steel.
The only place I've found for the moment is the Moravian square in front of Potrefena Husa.
That Mr. Onderka and his colleagues don't like it, but I don't think so much.
Not to mention the fact that in other parts of the city it's not a sinecure either.
So, finally, many of my friends don't sort their waste.
By laziness.
That's what they do for a ride to the dumpsters.
I'm not surprised by them.
I myself, after a party, offered to go throw a few bottles of glass and PVC.
Except I didn't see any Kouniova street colored dumpsters.
Fortunately I found the right place when I went to take the tram.
That said, the waste was overflowing with it.
It is after all the center of Brno, which is supposed to represent the best city, right?!
It is probably that ecology and so-called aestheticism are not of great interest to the Socialists of Brno.
They prefer to buy the city a place in the first hockey league that shames the city throughout the country, instead of buying a few more dumpsters and offering the sorting of more raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I'm glad I could comfort my impression with official statistics after hanging out for a while on the internet.
According to data from EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst in the entire South Moravian region.
Paroubek's budget has removed silver from retirements and sick leave
After the left has increased, despite the advice of the government, farmers or public servants there may be a lack of money for pensions, sick leave or housing savings.
But also for interest on the debt of the State or international judicial proceedings.
This will increase the problems of those who will govern in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When social democrats and communists imposed the increase for certain classes, they were based on the fact that the government will make loans for sensitive expenses, retirements or sick leave. "It's only about putting the problems back, mining the ground," Janota said.
It should be noted that interest on the borrowed money is increasing and will have to be repaid sooner or later.
The state doesn't really have a choice as to where to draw money.
If it does not lower social aid or its expenditure, it will have to increase taxes.
To all those who are now on the left: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And then, to their children.
People will touch them and should not fear for their pensions or health insurance, of which 1.8 billion have disappeared.
But at the expense of a greater debt of the state - next year there will therefore not be 163 billion missing in the caisses, but more.
Despite Minister Janota's efforts, the debt will grow faster and with it, interest-related expenditures.
The state will need money to pay it back and it will no longer be enough to slightly increase VAT or reduce maternity leave as the government has done in its anti-deficit package.
It will also lack five billion to complete the construction of roads and railways because of the transfer of money to a few groups of voters.
These are mainly sections that have already been decided and started and cannot be modified to reduce costs.
At most keep them, which is not free either.
This means delaying or stopping thirty major construction sites, and the withdrawal of European funds is also in danger, according to the warning of Karel Hanzelka, spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The ČSSD has proposed to solve the financial deficit very skilfully - it will draw from the dividends of the ČEZ (supplier and distributor of electric energy), which the state possesses for the most part and will feed the transport fund.
The concern is that the amount of dividends is never certain and that in no case is it a bottomless well.
Last year, 18 billion were sailed from the ČEZ to the budget.
Each year, dividends are used to pay for the removal of environmental damage, to supplement pension accounts or to serve as a reserve for the pension reform that is being prepared.
Moreover, this tip increases the real budget deficit by 5.7 percent of GNP according to EU rules.
And it's far from the end of the transfer carnival.
The budget for various compensations to victims of communism and crimes, and even housing savings, has fallen by almost three billion.
It is not certain that the state can act without that money.
It's a lottery.
If we lose an international procedure, we will have to pay for it anyway, says Janota.
The minister will then have to save on the side of the department or, at worst, touch the government's budget reserve.
There is also a lack of 100 million in the two-billion-dollar state fund project, which should allow for the monitoring of the expenditure of each administration on-line.
The first stage will start in January.
If the Minister of Finance did not find money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and sanctions would take place, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will master two operating systems
In the future, the Americans are considering a mobile phone that will allow the user to switch from one operating system to another by pressing a single button.
The projects that have been revealed seem promising.
Just one button and you move from Windows Mobile to Android in seconds.
It is precisely this possibility that is the objective of the American company VMware, which mainly deals with the development of computer virtualization software.
We will allow you to manage two user profiles at the same time on your mobile phone.
You can alternate between them, you can differentiate them as staff and professionals
Both will work at the same time, said Srinivas Krishnamurti of the company VMware in an interview for the magazine Computerworld.
It was presented in November of last year and it was made a first demonstration a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization on smartphones is in no way fictional.
VMware has already successfully presented a test version to journalists, a smartphone equipped with two operating systems.
It is a Nokia N800 modified with a RAM of 128 MB, which simultaneously ran the mentioned Windows Mobile and Android systems.
The development of new technologies for mobile phones is booming.
VMware is now working with European and US operators to test virtualization on smartphones, and customers should have access to devices during 2012.
The snow shortage in the mountains is troubling hoteliers
Desert runways are not a problem only for lift operators.
The lack of snow discourages people from booking their ski stays in hotels and pensions.
As a result, it is always possible to find free rooms for all dates in winter, including Christmas and New Year's Eve.
We have many visits to our site.
Internet users browse the offers, ask for the prices but do not dare to commit to booking for the moment.
And if they call us, they immediately ask if there will be snow or mud at Christmas," said Martin Jandura, operator of the Spindl.Info information portal.
If you want to spend the New Year of your dreams in Špindlerův Mlýn, you better not hesitate to book too much.
If we give priority to savings and the quality of accommodation comes only afterwards, then we can try to wait a few more days.
Špindler hoteliers currently offer only one week stays for the New Year.
I think they'll try another moment to place them, but they'll give in, too, and accept shorter periods.
And then the number of free rooms will quickly decrease," estimated Jandura.
The Ingtours tourist agency of Vrchlabí also offers free beds for all winter periods.
We are most interested in Christmas Week at the moment, it is not completely sold.
There's still half the rooms left in our offer, let's say.
That's why we've already prepared some cheaper last minute Christmas stays," said Ingtours director Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabí tourist agency can also offer the New Year in Krkonoše, but there are fewer free places.
The first fourteen days of February go just as well, the remaining winter stays sell average.
This year, interest in winter stays has been negatively influenced by the fact that there is still no snow in Krkonoše.
People are waiting for her to fall.
No one wants to spend the winter in the snowless mountain.
If the tracks overlap during the week, Christmas will also be complete," thinks Schiefert.
Conversely, the occupancy of the Horizont Hotel in Pec pod Sněžkou is slightly higher than last year.
We've got an improvement of about five percent.
We've got a few last places left for New Year's and Christmas.
There is great interest during the January holidays of Polish and February sells well as well," informs Karel Rada, director of the best hotel in Pec.
The Omnia Hotel near the central parking lot of Jánské Lázně is also complete at eighty percent during the New Year's period.
On the contrary, half of the beds remain empty at Christmas in the most recent hotel in Jánské Lázně.
This year we were pleasantly surprised by the month of January, where we already have sixty percent occupancy at the moment.
February is a little weaker at the moment but as soon as the snow falls, interest for stays in the Krkonoše will certainly grow again indicated the director of the Omnia Hotel, Erik Sporysch.
Hoteliers in the Krkonoše, however, should not expect more snow.
Thursday it will be cooler and if there is precipitation, they should be snowy in the mountains.
But later the weather should warm up, informs Jiří Jakubský of the Hradec station of the Czech hydrometeorological institute.
United States: Repetition Is Mother of Wisdom
He even becomes comical, the steady effort with which Barack Obama, president of the reputation as wise, replicates his predecessor's strategy on the Afghan issue, which he himself considered to be very simple.
When he ended up letting his doctrine sweat so ardently awaited, it turned out that he had copied it to carbon paper since Bush's Iraqi scenario three years ago.
Not content to use in the text even several times the expression "as in Iraq", he did not hesitate, moreover, to use the title of the Bush speech of January 2007 as the title of his own speech: "A new road forward"
At the same time, he personally criticized Bush's idea of sending new reinforcements to an Iraq consumed by the civil war as being "irresponsible and a catastrophic decision in its consequences."
The following months, however, showed that Bush's strategy, which emanated from the recommendations of campaign commanders, was the only one possible and likely to succeed to such an extent that the newspapers at present do not speak at all about Iraq.
This did not improve Bush's reputation, but, objectively speaking, he left his successor a much more favourable final situation than one could expect.
Barack Obama hopes that in Afghanistan, the miracle will happen again
It was again the campaign commanders who called for an increase in the military contingent, including the commander of the Afghan operation, General Stanley McCristal, who even severely criticized the White House's reluctance despite the habit of subordination.
He asked for 40,000 men in order to make the situation more favourable.
The president hesitated for three months, but in the absence of a better option, he at least swindled the general of 10,000 soldiers.
He managed to remove the promise of an additional 5,000 from Europe, even though he originally had 10,000.
What brings the most problems throughout Obama's strategy seems to be his intention to withdraw the armies from Afghanistan within 18 months and to complete this whole process within three years. Obama's entire doctrine brings more questions than it provides answers.
Many doubt that an increase of half will bear the same fruit as the increase in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized and its leaders honour the agreements.
The Afghan situation stands out in the exact opposite - no one can be counted on and no treaty is respected.
In these circumstances, it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, accustomed to changing their leadership day by day according to their arrangements.
Political institutions, although officially founded, will remain only powder in the eyes behind which patriarchal ethnic relations will proliferate.
It is particularly complex to balance the interests of the various ethnic groups in view of the lack of clarity about the relationship, which is still complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the foundation of a "state that is prompt to act", which is the basic purpose of the operation, does not seem to be very real.
The time horizon of Obama's strategy is perplexed by his voluntarism.
In the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened and is currently on the brink of chaos.
Only a purely romantic and out of reality heart can be persuaded that the little soldiers sent into the tumult of war for their "quick return home" will bring a true miracle.
From a political point of view, setting a date for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible as the Taliban will regard it as the indirect admission of the American defeat.
The latest NATO summit has shown that the will of Europeans to participate in military operations in Afghanistan is turning to the negative.
European policies do not know or want to explain to their voters how security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the mountains of the Hindu Kush.
Another factor capable of radically altering the situation is the evolution of events related to Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the enhanced sanctions have no effect on the Iranians, the Americans will find themselves faced with the very difficult question of resolving the problem through the use of military force.
It will have to be answered, for example, when, according to Obama, America will come to the victorious withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
However, each solution of this kind will lead to a dramatic reversal of the Afghan situation.
The only trick for Obama is the fact that there are three years left until the presidential elections and therefore there is still enough time for him to come up with a new strategy, in case it turns out to be a total fiasco.
Goldman Sachs bank managers will no longer receive cash bonuses
High-ranking senior employees of the American bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive cash premiums this year.
The company announced this in response to strong criticism of its wage practices.
The group of 30 chief executives will receive shares instead of money, which they will not be able to resell for five years.
Actions can be withdrawn from the leadership if they take too much risk.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is thus at the forefront of the effort to link pay with long-term performance on Wall Street.
I suppose Wall Street is well aware of the global meaning to take, said former investment banker Douglas Elliott of JPMorgan
The concern lies in the details, he added.
The Goldman Sachs bank became the target of criticism after having set aside almost $17 billion for bonuses over the first three quarters of this year.
For the current year, the total amount of premiums will probably exceed $20 billion despite the measure announced today, according to Reuters agency.
With the onset of the financial crisis, the high premiums of the banking sector have become a sensitive political issue in many countries.
Great Britain announced Wednesday that it intends to allocate a single tax of fifty percent to bankers bonuses exceeding 25,000 pounds.
France is preparing similar measures.
This year women have won Nobel Prizes in all fields except physics
There are five women, a record number, who today received in Stockholm from the hands of the King of Sweden Charles XVI Gustave the Nobel Prizes in technical disciplines and literature.
In addition to the four scientists there was also the German writer of Romanian origin Herta Müller.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, together with their compatriot Jack Szostak, received the Nobel Prize in Medicine for their research in chromosomes.
The chemistry award was awarded to Israeli Ada Jonath with American Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for clarifying the structure and function of ribosomes
The last winner received the Nobel Prize in Economics, the American Elinor Ostrom with his compatriot Oliver Williamson, for their analysis of economic governance.
The only technical discipline that didn't have a winner this year was physics.
This award was presented today to scientists Charles Kao for his research in the field of fiber optics and George Smith with Willard Boyle for their invention of CCD chips, which are currently the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or astronomical glasses.
Each winner received the diploma, the Nobel Medal and the certificate of acquisition of the monetary reward.
It reaches 10 million Swedish kroner in each category. (approximately 1.1 million euros)
If one of them has several winners, they will share the reward among themselves.
The long-awaited Nobel Peace Prize has already been presented to US President Barack Obama this afternoon in Oslo, Norway.
The latter, in his speech, recognized the controversial nature of his reward as he is only at the beginning of his journey and is also at the head of a country engaged in two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
At the expense of his policy he added that in some situations war is indispensable for achieving peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota plans to resign. Klaus invited him to the Castle
President Václav Klaus will receive Friday morning finance minister Eduard Janota, who will weigh his stay in the government because of his disagreement with the state budget for next year as voted by the Chamber of Deputies
It is estimated that the budget and perhaps Janota's position in the cabinet will be on the agenda of their Friday meeting.
Klaus is also critical of the budget.
According to him, the deficit is too large, which further deepens the public finance crisis.
The meeting was briefed by President Radim Ochvat.
Janota then wants to discuss his position on Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the budget legislation to be submitted for signature by Klaus, the Czech Republic is expected to manage a deficit of SEK 163 billion.
Nevertheless, the Chamber of Deputies validated on Wednesday the proposals of the left concerning money transfers and increased the salaries of officials, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government blamed the proposals of the Social Democrats for the fact that they would indirectly increase the budget deficit.
For this reason, a violent disagreement was born between the left on the one hand, the government, Klaus and the right on the other, disagreement that challenges the future of Fischer's cabinet, which had been formed by agreement between the ODS, the ČSSD and the Green Party.
Critics say that the budget, as voted by MEPs, removes the package of savings measures passed by Fischer's government and which he believes must contain the state's debt.
Klaus, who can ratify the State Budget Act but who is not obliged to do so, said today at a breakfast of discussions with entrepreneurs, that politicians have long neglected the "serious problem" of the "unstoppable deficit" of public finances.
Now, according to him, there is no favorable solution.
Only a strong government could make an improvement, if it could build on a broader consensus of political parties, according to the president.
ODS President Mirek Topolánek said the budget is frightening and that the government should question its future existence.
ODS Vice-President Petr Nečas told ČTK that the idea of an administrative cabinet supported by ČSSD, ODS and the Greens clearly no longer works.
In his reaction, Prime Minister Fischer described such words as "drastic verdicts".
The head of ČSSD Jiří Paroubek reacted to Topolánek, saying that the budget deficit prepared for this year by the former government of Topolánek is frightening and that it will exceed 200 billion kroner.
On Wednesday, the ČSSD has already called the ratification of the state budget for the next year a success.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Morgan Freeman to play Mandela in Clint Eastwood's new movie
Despite criticism of the fact that the main roles are played by American actors, the South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film Invictus - Invaincu will expose to the world a lot about the country, its struggles and its victories.
History speaks of sport, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
Morgan Freeman, an American Oscar-winning actor, embodies the film about Nelson Mandela's life, tirelessly fighting the racist apartheid regime in South Africa and the first black president.
Freeman said, that it was a Mandela who was ninety-one years old who asked him to embody him in the film.
Matt Damon plays another important role.
I told him: "If I have to embody you, I should be able to see you personally.
The seventy-two-year-old actor who was awarded a prize for his role in Clint Eastwood's drama Million Dollar Baby in the middle of boxing, for example, embodied the leader of a movement against slavery that became himself a slave, a fictional president of the USA, even God in the movie Evan Almighty but never someone who is still alive and as important to so many people as Mandela.
The former South African statesman was imprisoned for 27 years for his hard work in support of the end of apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is a Latin word meaning undefeated and is the title of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film tells the true story of the joint efforts of Nelson Mandela and the captain of the South African rugby team François to unify the country. President Mandela, newly elected, knows that his country remains still and always divided racially and economically after apartheid.
He is convinced of being able to unite his people through sport and decides to unite rugby players who are among the outsiders in the world.
The South African team will eventually advance to the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman has worked for a few years to bring Mandela's story on the big screen.
I had no other purpose but to play this role so as to bring it closer to reality, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge for me was, of course, to talk like him.
The actor said that if he and the international politician were in the same region, he would have tried to meet Mandela, to have dinner with him, to be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake his hand.
I realized that when I shook your hand, I recovered your energy, it was transmitted and I felt like I knew how you were feeling, he said.
It's important to me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon plays in the film François Pienaar, the captain of a national rugby team in which there are a majority of white players.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the rough middle of rugby.
For him, his first meeting with Pienaar at his home was a big surprise.
I remember when I knocked at the door of the house, he opened me and the first thing I said to Francois Pienaar was: 'I look much bigger in the film'.
Despite the differences between the actors and the real models, Invictus under the leadership of the director Eastwood received positive reviews and even talked about ambitions for the Oscars.
The film critic Todd McCarthy of Daily Variety summarized his appreciation in these words: "It's a very good story, a very good film made."
In film reviews on rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive reviews.
The mystery of the aura in Norway is solved: the Russians were testing a rocket
A strange luminous phenomenon of unknown origin was observed above Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defence recognized only yesterday that it had tested an intercontinental ballistic rocket not far from the Norwegian borders.
However, the launch was still a failure and the Bulava missile, which was originally to be the pride of the Russian army, gradually became the nightmare of the Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Its repeated presence during the rocket tests did not have the expected effect on the success of the test flights.
Most of the time, either Bulava did not fly, or she damaged herself in flight.
Russian newspapers speak of "bulava" as "missile that doesn't steal"
A missile that doesn't fly but shines
This 13th test was conducted at the beginning normally.
It was only at the end of the flight that there was again damage to the aircraft.
It was clearly the third-storey engine of the rocket that exploded.
This time, "Bulava" flew from the nuclear submarine Dmitrij Donskij, which sailed under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile can be set on fire from a moving and submerged vessel.
This is why the mysterious light above Norway caused by an unidentified flying object is likely to have been caused by a defective "bulava".
Moreover, the Norwegians did not doubt for a moment that it was a Russian rocket.
The generals argue that this time, one cannot speak absolutely of failure.
The first two floors of the rocket resisted and the damage only affected the third.
In the previous cases, the engines experienced failures on the first floor.
Although none of the test launches were successful, the Ministry of Defence management considered that only six out of thirteen were failures.
This success rate of almost fifty percent therefore fills the generals with optimism and they therefore always claim that one day "bulava" will fly without problems and that it will carry even ten hypersonic nuclear nuclei with a total weight of 1.15 tons.
Legendary Fetissov signed a one-year contract with CSKA Moscow at 51
Legendary defender Viatcheslav Fetissov will perform again in a professional game at 51 years of age.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup holder will lend strength to his needed team from CSKA Moscow and will probably make his entrance already in the Friday match against Petrograd.
Fetissov, who ended his 40-year career in 1998, is currently the president of CSKA.
After Denis Kuliash's injury we urgently need another defender.
Fetissov trains regularly and agrees to help the team.
We still have to settle some details on the form, says coach Sergey Nyemtchinov, quoted by the AP agency.
It has not been specified whether the legendary hockey player's comeback will concern only one game.
I think Fetissov is one of those who are able to strengthen the mind of other players, said Nyemtchinov.
According to AP, in the case of his return to the ice, Fetissov became the oldest Russian professional hockey player.
In NHL, the legendary attacker Gordie Howe played a whole season for Hartford and won 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous quintet Fetissov, Kassatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best hockey players and among those with the most success.
Under the colours of the Soviet Union he won gold twice at the Olympic Games, seven World Champions titles, he triumphed at the Canada Cup as well as at the World Junior Championship.
In the second part of his career, he also collected tributes in NHL where he held the Stanley Cup twice.
He has been a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame since 2001.
Hyundai has listened to the unions and cancels all overtime
The management of the Hyundai factory in Nošovice agreed with the unions to cancel all overtime.
It was precisely because of the frequent overtime that the unions declared a state of emergency strike on Monday.
The spokesman Petr Vaněk of the Hyundai plant confirmed this.
However, management wants to agree again with the unions on a Saturday still worked this year.
We cannot give up our production plan, it is essential, that is why volunteer overtime was proposed on Saturday 19 December knowing that there would be two teams, Vaněk said.
The Sedmička.cz site indicated that the company offered a bonus of 400 Czech crowns to employees who would be part of the Saturday team.
It will also be awarded a posterioriori for the day worked on November 28.
According to Vaněk, the company has decided to change the way it motivates its employees in exchange for overtime.
Either they receive the overtime supplement, or they can put in a replacement leave on December 28 and thus extend their Vaněk indicated end-of-year holidays.
In addition to this all employees present on Saturday will receive compensation for transport costs and for their lunch.
Given that overtime was the most urgent and warmest point in the comments and claims of unions as well as employees who spontaneously stopped production last week, management made the immediate decision to cancel all overtime for the month of December, Vaněk said.
Until last week, the employees of the car factory were forced to work almost two extra hours daily in addition to their eight hours.
The unions intend to cancel the strike after signing the agreement.
The next negotiation between the management of the car plant and the unions must take place on Friday afternoon.
Union leader Petr Kuchař said on Wednesday that they were ready to stop the strike in case of agreement on their claims and signing a common document.
The situation in the plant culminated last Wednesday when nearly 400 employees spontaneously went on strike due to unceasing overtime.
They were also protesting against the poor conditions of wages and so-called bollocks.
Management argued that employees had to work overtime to meet the requirements for automobile production.
When the strike was announced on Monday, the unions also asked that employees who had stopped production should not be subject to any sanctions.
Trade unions ask society to reduce the time spent in overtime to a minimum.
In addition, this year they want a reward of 5,000 kroner (about €209) for them.
The Hyundai car factory in Nošovice currently employs 2,000 people.
It started serial production last year in November.
It has manufactured about 80,000 vehicles until September of this year, having a production capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that works on "endurant" HIV viruses too
A team of Czech and German scientists are testing new combinations that can slow the spread of HIV in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also acts on viruses that have already developed immunity to drugs.
This reality takes precedence in some cases over the fact that the combination does not act as intensively on the common variants of the virus as well as some medicines already available.
It is not possible to cure AIDS at this time.
However, the life of the sick can be radically prolonged through a mixture of medicines that prevent the growth of HIV virus in the body.
However, their consumption has a number of side effects.
Moreover, the suppression of this multiplication has the effect of developing what are called resistant viruses on which drugs no longer have effect.
The work of experts from three institutions, the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, the VŠCHT of Prague and the University of Heidelberg, paves the way for a way to cope with the resistance of the virus.
They have shown that substances called metalocarboranes act on the protein responsible for the multiplication of the HIV virus.
Metalocarboranes are an assembly of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
This combination blocks the development of the virus in a different way from all the drugs used so far and that is why they could overcome the problem of resistance.
The researchers' work leads them to discover new "improved" substances, based on their knowledge of the molecular mechanics of their bonds on the proteins of the virus.
Metalocarboranes have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-walled cages are formed by the boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms and connected by a metal atom, in this case the cobalt.
A traitoric and resistant virus.
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus that is essential to the life cycle of the virus.
Without the division of the HIV virus caused by HIV protease there would be no birth of mature infectious particles of the virus.
If HIV protease is stopped, the spread of the virus will also be stopped in the patient's body, the researchers explain in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In their work published in the journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of combinations where two pairs of cages (see table) are connected by a short organic chain, which is then systematically modified.
A little weaker but more reliable.
The efficacy of this set of substances on HIV proteases has been tested in test pieces as well as on its resistant variants obtained in HIV-infected patients.
On the common version of the enzyme, the effect of metalocarboranes is not as strong as on clinical medicinal products, however it does not weaken on the resistant versions against which the common medicinal products are often ineffective.
Metalocarboranes, with their unique mechanism of action and other properties such as their biological and chemical stability, their low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications, are therefore interesting combinations to be examined further in order to move towards the development of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlína İezáčová, Director of the Structural Biology Laboratory of the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
Fights about the budget. The ODS is attacking Fischer, who defends himself
The President of the ODS (Civil Democratic Party), Mirek Topolánek called the ratified budget "frightening" for the following year and according to him, the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should question its existence.
The Prime Minister described the SDO's remarks as a drastic verdict.
He says it takes time to analyze.
ODS spokesman Petr Nečas said that the idea of an administrative cabinet supported by ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party was clearly no longer working.
According to Nečas, the head of government should decide whether to take up minority support in the Chamber of Deputies who is concerned with fighting the growing deficit, or whether to remain in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
Nečas warned that the positions of the ODS and the Social Democrats with regard to the problem of public deficits are diametrically opposed.
The Chamber of Deputies ratified the 2010 budget on Wednesday, however, with proposals for amendments amounting to 12 billion kroner included by the left.
The House increased money for civil servants' salaries, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government's grievance about the Social Democrats' proposals was that they indirectly increased the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic is expected to manage a deficit of SEK 163 billion.
The SDO left the room before the vote, thus obeying the government's wish that a modified budget is a less bad variant than an interim budget.
Disappointment and futility
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of futility, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said the government will still reflect on the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota threatened to leave office if the proposed amendments were ratified, the situation could be different.
According to Czech Television, Janota made an appointment with the Prime Minister on Monday after his visit to the government:
At the same time, he indicated that he was wondering whether he would remain in office.
His disappointment at the negotiations on the budget is why.
If Fischer decides to continue to fight against the budget deficit, Nečas believes that the representatives of ČSSD, who have imposed the changes in the budget, do not have their place in the government.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if the House ratifies other laws that increase the deficit, such as those that affect health insurance, pensions, or the reform of the Services Act.
Topolánek: Ministers appointed by the ODS are not at issue.
This is the case of the head of the Fischer government and the entire government.
The ministers appointed by the ODS did nothing harmful, Topolánek stressed in a textual communiqué from the United States.
He recalled that the deputy ministers of some departments were calling for TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed that if Fischer decides to resign in the face of a fight against the amount of the deficit in public finances, "it is quite logical and correct that it is based on the left-wing majority that is currently in the Chamber."
Having said that, he must not expect the support and tolerance of the democrats.
I have not thought about it, and once it is on the agenda, then I will devote myself to it, said Martin Barták, Minister of Defence, elected to the government by the Democrats.
Prime Minister Fischer flew in the afternoon for a debate at the European Council in Brussels.
The SDO reversed at the Prime Minister's request.
Nečas stressed at the same time that the ODS would probably have voted against the amended budget on Wednesday if it had not expressly asked the Democratic Members to allow the budget to be voted on.
We do not feel we are orphans, we are not small children, did he respond to the question of whether the SDO had not been criticized by the President of the Party in the House or in the country when negotiating the budget.
I did not notice that my vote would have been lacking.
I already knew at the time when I gave up my mandate that what would follow in the following months would be a Bolshevikization of the House and a destruction of all that was positive, Topolánek reacted in person.
According to the new schedules of the ČD there will be fewer trains for identical rates.
The Czech Railways will remove or limit certain less loaded express or regional trains from 13 December and will strengthen some others.
Total transport coverage will decrease on the day of entry into force of the new timetables by two percent compared to today.
Most rates will not change, including basic and reduced rates.
For example, it is the inhabitants of the Ostrava region who will have more connections to the capital, the Railways will add a pendolino rail.
On the contrary, an express will stop serving Bratislava.
There will also be fewer fast trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line, the Prague - Letohrad direct line will be radically reduced.
At the regional level, the largest decrease in transport is in the Hradec Králové region by a total of eight per cent, while Prague and its environs can welcome an increase.
Two night trains on the Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice line are also cancelled and the circulation of a few express trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line will be reduced to just a few days in the week.
Among the greatest transformations, we can see the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague: for the moment the inhabitants of Milovice must change at Lysá nad Labem.
This is the fifteenth line of the Esko suburban system, whose opening is possible thanks to the completion of electrification of the line between Lysá nad Labem and Milovice.
The distant lines to the capital will have their final destination at the main station of Prague (Praha Hlavní nádraží).
The ČD will introduce more SC Pendolino lines between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jeseník will depart at two-hour intervals.
Travellers will no longer be able to take the Pendolino to Bratislava from 13 December.
This year's invoice for regional railways: an additional 200 million kroner.
The express trains are ordered and paid for by the Ministry of Transport and will pay the Railways next year in a total of four billion crowns to pay the visible losses, the same amount as this year. The regional trains are ordered by the regions that will pay for them by a total of eight billion next year, knowing that the state will participate to the level of almost three billion.
This year's regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
The Railways have recently signed a contract for ten years, until now the duration was still one year.
Railways appreciate the system, which also explains why they did not use a price increase for the vast majority of transport tickets.
The changes will only affect one-day ČD Net tickets and eLiška discounted internet tickets.
For travellers without discount cards, the price of ČD Net will increase from 450 to 600 kroner.
The price of eLiška will again depend on the route travelled, while until then it was valid between cities in a region of choice and was at a single price of 160 kroner.
The Filipino rebels are still holding more than 50 people, the children have been released
The rebels today abducted 75 people in the south of the Philippines, including a few primary school students and their teachers.
It was the AFP agency that informed, but it talked about 65 hostages only.
The 17 children were released after eight hours, as well as one of the teachers.
Hostage was taken in the province of Agusan del Sur.
It is reported that about 19 rebels used hostages as human shields during a police escape.
Local negotiators are now trying to reach an agreement for the release of the remaining hostages.
According to the AFP agency, the rebels belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is the armed branch of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AFP agency, the police first prosecuted the kidnappers as a result of violence caused by a settlement of accounts between two family clans.
Martial law was declared in Maguindanao province in the south of the Philippines because of a recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the 23 November massacre linked to the election of the governor's administration there were 30 journalists.
The governor of this province of the South Philippines was arrested on suspicion of participation in the massacre, as well as his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential Ampatuan lineage.
Mindanao Island also includes active Muslim separatists.
However, they renewed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
South Africa's history concerns everyone, according to Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
Clint Eastwood's new Hollywood film arrives in the American theaters in the coming days, the title is Invictus (the official Czech title is Invictus: Neporažený), and narrates part of the life of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of the combatant against the world-famous apartheid has returned to Morgan Freeman, who was chosen years ago by Mandela himself to embody him.
The second male role of the legendary South African rugby champion was attributed to Matt Damon.
With the arrival of the film in theaters, the returns of critics and the public are heard.
Nelson Mandela
By his full name Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, he was born on 18 June 1918 in Mvezu, South Africa.
In 1988 he was awarded the Sakharov Prize for his freedom of mind, and in 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize alongside Klerk.
He served as President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The film has high expectations as it is presented at a time when South Africa is in full preparation for the football world cup, and at a time when the media is agitated by disturbing news of the increase in racial conflicts and discrimination of the inhabitants by the black majority in power.
According to the AP agency, the reactions to the new film are for the moment quite positive in South Africa, despite the frequent reservations about the main roles where Hollywood stars "pave".
Morgan Freeman is, however, proud of the film by taking up his own terms.
I have dreamed of this role for many years and have prepared myself well.
I also met Nelson Mandela several times personally to be able, as they say, to recover from his energy, did he say during the first official film in Los Angeles.
I think it's a good thing if you have the opportunity to remember through the film Mandela's personality and message.
This is the history of the Republic of South Africa, but it concerns every individual added.
Wear the national rugby team jersey
The film based on the story of British writer John Carlin's novel is freely translated. In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the play that gave his creation to the people depicts the South African human rights defender during his presidency term.
Morgan Freeman therefore tries during the film to collect two racial groups from a long-divided population and as Nelson Mandela in 1995 he enters the national jersey of the South African team on the lawn of the World Cup, which South Africa had won at the time.
To have shown himself on the lawn in a jersey, which is considered in South Africa as something sacred, Mandela had been long ovationed fourteen years ago mainly from the white audience and was recognized by white populations.
Hopefully the football championship will succeed in bringing people together again into one nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, who was in 1995 the only "black" of the national team.
It remains to be seen whether the tense situation in South Africa will improve.
The South African whites are, however, skeptical, as he recently told in an interview with LN Christopher Dawson, a rugby fan who fled to Britain.
The championship begins on June 11, 2010.
A transformer worth tens of millions of crowns in flames in the Louny region
A fire engulfed in the morning a transformer of the Čeps company from the distribution center near the municipality of Výškov na Lunsku.
According to Lukáš Marvan, spokesman for the Ústí fire department, there are six units operating on the fire.
They originally intended to let the transformer burn, but they reviewed their opinion and turned off the fire with a mixture of water, foam and a special substance.
The cause is a technical defect, an internal short circuit of the transformer.
No one was injured and according to Pavla Mandátova, the incident does not endanger the safe operation of the transmission system.
The damage is estimated to be some tens of millions of crowns, the exact figure can be known after the fire is extinguished.
According to Mandátova, the destroyed transformer will have to be replaced by a new one.
She adds that in ten years of activity Čeps has known nothing similar and that incidents of this type are isolated.
Electricity supplies have not been interrupted, says ČEZ's spokesman for the North Bohemian Soňa Holingerova Hendrychova, the operation of homes, administrations and industries has not been influenced by the fire at the processing station.
A.s. Čeps is the exclusive operator in the Czech territory of transmission sets and power lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renovates and develops 39 distribution stations with 67 transformers transferring electrical energy from transport units to distribution units and lines of 4339 kilometers long.
Jančura to press charges for defamation against three ČSSD prefects
Radim Jančura, owner of Student Agency, will now file a complaint for defamation against three Democratic social prefects.
And concretely against Michal Hašek of the region of South Moravia, against Radko Martínka of the region of Pardubice and against the prefect of the region of Olomouc Martin Tesařík.
Jančura indicated this in Dvacet minute of Radiožurnál.
The complaint is related to the company's attempt to operate regional railways in certain regions.
All regions, however, ended up signing long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three of us attacked and claimed that we made the fine mouths, while we only made an offer for what they wanted themselves.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways, which is not true because we know the prices of the Czech Railways that were signed last week.
So all we have to do is defend ourselves.
It's in exchange for slanders about Student Agency, Jančura told Radiožurnál.
Similarly, he indicated that he had evidence that no region had proceeded in accordance with European law.
We are preparing a complaint for this purpose for the European Commission.
Hašek considers that Mr. Jančura's filing of a complaint represents the continuation of his media performance, which serves as free publicity for his company and for his person.
I am, of course, prepared to defend my name and the name of my region, and I call on the other prefects to do the same.
I suppose this will be an opportunity to make it clear that it is precisely Mr Jančura who manipulates public opinion and resorts to false and false arguments about regional rail transport, says Hašek
Jančura has already informed last week that he will invest a few million crowns in an advertisement that will mention the adverse approaches of the regions.
He told Radiožurnál that he will stop the campaign after Christmas and that he plans to take it back after New Year's Eve.
He clarified that the campaign will target corruption in the broad sense.
Jančura began his campaign after the regions agreed to entrust the Czech Railways with the operation of railway links for an order of approximately 150 billion kroner, without issuing a call for tenders.
According to Jančura, such a course of action is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, his criticism of rail transport in the regions even led to threats to Jančura by a member of the ČSSD.
The only threat was that if we didn't stop, we could lose our bus licenses.
He presented himself as a member of the ČSSD, I don't know who he is, but I won't say his name, Jančura said today in Radiožurnál.
Pneumococcal vaccination will be free and optional
Pneumococcal vaccination will reverse old habits by January.
It will be the first to be free and at the same time optional for families.
There are already voices, saying that compulsory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococcals are culminating.
The pharmaceutical institute already defines for vaccines the maximum prices that health insurance will pay.
Specialists also see clarity in the vaccination process.
A new vaccination.
Free vaccines for August's children.
Since January, children born last year from August 2 can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococcus.
The condition is that they have not yet been vaccinated.
If you started vaccination last year or earlier, you will have to pay for the following vaccinations yourself.
The first dose of vaccine should be given between the third and fifth month of the child.
Last year already a quarter of the families voluntarily vaccinated their children against pneumococcal diseases.
Yet the parents paid 1,600 crowns or more for one dose.
The vaccination of the youngest requires four doses.
Specialists estimate that every year health insurance spends SEK 300 to 450,000 in doses of vaccine.
They do, however, save on the medical care that unvaccinated children would require.
To date, the State has spent approximately CKr 500,000 per year on all child immunization.
The refunded vaccination was introduced with the "Janota package".
Pneumococcals are the cause of inflammation of the middle ear but also serious infections including meningus inflammation and blood poisoning.
Hospital investigations indicate that up to 28 deaths of children under 10 years of age due to pneumococcal infections occur.
Apart from the Czech Republic, about 40 other countries have introduced the refunded vaccination.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
There are opinions on a possible vaccination requirement in the future.
From January, it must be settled by insurance and optional.
For example, the president of the Nahlas Rudolf Kalovský association said that compulsory vaccination would be more positive.
Its association has long promoted vaccination against pneumococcus.
At an international conference in which our association participated, the specialists were not really satisfied with the fact that we have an optional vaccination.
It's not ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy to have been able to impose at least this.
I believe that this is a direction that must now be followed, Kalovský said.
But the Ministry of Health does not want to change the process of vaccination against pneumococcal diseases.
We are not considering it at all for the moment, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň.
Optional vaccination has its drawbacks, doctors say.
Hana Cabrnochová, president of the Specialized Society of Paediatrics, recognizes that a vaccination based on the volunteerata its defects.
If all children were vaccinated, a reduction in vaccination renewals could be considered "In the situation where the vaccine costs such a sum I understand the decision making the vaccination optional," says Cabrnochová.
Specialists expect that as early as next year, more than 80 percent of new parents will have their infants vaccinated.
Pneumococcal vaccination also breaks down because it is the first vaccination of children that is financed by insurance and not by the State.
Cabrnochová explains that insurance should release funds for prevention, thus saving on possible future medical care.
Doctors will have to buy their products themselves
This is, however, linked to the concerns of pediatric practitioners regarding the purchase of vaccines.
The original intention was to have the vaccines purchased by insurance, with doctors receiving them in the same way as other vaccine products provided by the state.
Some Members feared, however, that this would allow insurance to "deduct the sums from the health insurance".
Thus, doctors will have to buy the products and wait for insurance to pay them back.
It is estimated that individual paediatricians will have to invest close to 40,000 kroner per month in vaccines, which is a significant sum.
It will be far from easy, according to Cabrnochová.
The son of an American artist involved in a "Museum Flight"
Frank Frazetta's son, a recognized illustrator, was accused of trying to steal paintings worth $20 million (£12 million) in his father's museum.
In Pennsylvania, police stated that Alfonso Frank Frazetta had been arrested while loading 90 paintings into his vehicle and a trailer.
According to her, Mr. Frazetta and another man used a mechanical shovel to force the entrance to the museum, in the Pocono Mountains area.
Mr. Frazetta Senior, 81 years old, is famous for his drawings of characters such as Conan le Barbare and Tarzan.
At the time of the incident, the artist was in Florida, reported the Associated Press (AP) news agency.
AP cited a police officer that young Mr. Frazetta may have been motivated by a family dispute.
According to a police statement, Mr. Frazetta Jr, 52, claims to have been authorized by his father to "enter the museum, by any means, to transport the paintings to a storage facility," the agency reported.
Mr. Frazetta Senior denies giving such permission, the agency said.
Labour is advocating an increase in the budget tax.
Ministers defended the increase in tax and the cuts in spending announced in the pre-budget report, despite criticism from the opposition, businesses and trade unions.
The Tories claimed that Alistair Darling "missed" an opportunity to show that he was serious about reducing the deficit by delaying his decisions until after the elections.
The Chancellor also attracted lightning by attacking low wages and average wages.
Among its main proposals, we can see an increase of 0.5% in Social Insurance and a ceiling rate of 1% on public wages from 2011.
The anger of Social Insurance
The unions protested that low wages are penalized by a recession for which they are not responsible and warned that "problems" were being announced.
The reduction in social insurance - which will allow to get about GBP 3 billion a year - has made the world of businesses angry, because he believes it is a tax on jobs while the objective should be a revival of the economy.
The increase, reserved for those who earn more than GBP 20,000 a year, will reach about 10 million workers.
MAIN POINTS OF THE PRE-BUDGET REPORT
Social Insurance will increase further by 0.5% from April 2011
The economy will fall even more than the 4.75% expected this year
New 50% tax on banker bonuses
The increase in corporate income tax for small companies has been abandoned
Discount of taxes on electric cars and wind turbines
Increase in pensions by 2.5%
According to Treasury estimates, a person winning GBP 30,000 will lose GBP 90 per year and a person winning GBP 40,000 will lose GBP 190 per year, while a person winning GBP 10,000 per year will earn GBP 110 more.
Ministers said that their goal of halving the deficit before 2013 led to "hard decisions" but insisted that 60% of the burden of additional taxes would weigh on the first 5 % of employees.
Stephen Timms, the Secretary of the Treasury, refuted an increase in the tax and pointed out that a decrease in spending was a "water drop in the ocean" compared to what was needed.
"These figures are important; they will allow us to divide the deficit by two, which will be absolutely essential over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Timms said he was confident and that the growth of the economy would restart at the end of the year.
However, Labour's forecasts of economic growth - which will influence the amount to be borrowed and the speed at which the deficit will be filled - were questioned after the Chancellor was forced to revise his initial figures.
In his speech, he said that the economy would probably fall by 4.75% this year - much worse than the decline of 3.5% predicted in April - while the borrowing would be 3 billion GDP higher than the preliminary estimate.
"Missed opportunity"'
The Conservatives who will launch a new publicity campaign this Thursday warning against the "debt crisis" of Labour, said that the project to borrow GBP 789 billion over the next six years was not viable.
Ministers failed to present a credible plan on how to repay, they added, "cynically" avoiding difficult choices until after the elections - to be held in June 2010.
"They presented nothing significant about what they were going to do," said Philip Hammond, Chief Treasury Secretary of the Ghost Cabinet. "They had the opportunity to do it and they missed it."
" Important announcements will be made after the elections, regardless of the winner "
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from future reductions, contrary to Tory's proposals that would result in a faster and greater reduction of the deficit.
But the Lib Dems claimed that the money raised through the increase in taxes and the decrease in spending would be used to support next year's spending and not to reduce the deficit, claiming that the plans were "built on wind".
Nick Robinson, BBC Political Editor, stated that the schedule of announcements - such as the increase in inflation for certain disability benefits in April, mentioned above - would leave the Chancellor in the face of propaganda charges, the money being simply recovered the following year.
However, Labour insists that additional assistance is being provided while people need it most and that the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"False budget"
Although ministers did not publish spending details beyond 2011, economists stated that it was clear that public spending restrictions would only begin to be felt in the medium term.
The highly respected Institute for Fiscal Studies (Institute of Fiscal Studies) said that the Chancellor's figures involve substantial reductions in many areas in the future, including potentially transport, higher education, science and defence.
"The pain is actually only postponed," said its Director, Robert Chote.
"The most important announcements will be made after the elections, regardless of the winner," added Roger Bootle, Economic Advisor to Deloitte's accountants.
"This has been a false pre-budget report, and the markets are well aware of it."
FBI investigates "American arrests in Pakistan"
The FBI is investigating the arrest in Pakistan of five American reporters suspected of extremist ties.
The men were arrested during a raid on a house in Sarghoda in the eastern province of Punjab, announced the American Embassy in Pakistan at the BBC.
The FBI said he was investigating whether it was the same men who had been reported missing from their home in the U.S. state of Virginia last month.
The U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs said he was also looking for information about these people.
Three of them are presented as being of Pakistani descent, one of Egyptian heritage and the other of Yemeni origin.
If they are American citizens, of course, we would like to know what the charges are against them and under what conditions they are detained," said the spokesman, Ian Kelly.
Katherine Schweit, spokesman for the FBI, stated that the agency was aware of the arrests and that she was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and the nature of their activities there, and whether it is really the students who are missing," she said.
The Pakistan Embassy in Washington claimed that the men had been arrested in a house belonging to one of their uncles.
She said that the house was already under the supervision of the local police and that no charges had yet been brought against the arrested men.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton refused to comment on the arrests, reported the press agency Reuters, but said that the United States "must work more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to uproot the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people."
The five students had been reported missing from their homes by their families in northern Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty condemns Iranian "abuses"
Over the past 20 years, human rights have been as poorly respected as ever, according to the Amnesty International report.
the report presents "repetitions of violations" by the regime, before and after the presidential election campaign in June.
One man quoted in the report stated that he had been beaten and burned with cigarettes, and another stated that he had been threatened with rape.
Iran has denied previous criticisms of its failure to respect human rights.
The authorities have stated that such criticism is politically motivated.
Thousands of people were arrested and dozens killed in Iran, after President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's disputed election led to the largest public demonstrations since the 1979 Islamic revolution.
Dozens have been sentenced to prison sentences and prosecutors claim that at least five people have been sentenced to death.
Jon Leyne, BBC correspondent in Tehran, now in London, states that at the beginning of the protests, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged some of the allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention centre.
But since then, the authorities have not tolerated any criticism, says our correspondent.
"False Confession"
Amnesty International reported on the case of a 26-year-old computer student, Ebrahim Mehtari, who claimed to have been accused of 'Working with Facebook networks' and protesting against the election results.
"They often hit me in the face," he was quoted.
"I was burned with cigarettes, before my eyes, on my neck, at my head... they threatened to execute me and humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left on the street, still in blood and half conscious, said Amnesty.
In August, the losing candidate, Mehdi Karroubi, claimed that protesters detained after the election were tortured to death in prison and that others were raped.
The Iranian authorities denied the charges of rape, but admitted that abuses had taken place.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee who said that he had been locked in a container with 75 other persons, for more than eight weeks, in a detention centre in Kahrizak.
Amnesty agreed that the Iranian Parliament and the judiciary set up a committee to investigate post-election unrest and the government's response, but stated that the mandate and powers of these bodies were unclear and that the results of the parliamentary committee had not been made public.
The group said that at least 90 people had been arrested in the last three weeks in order to prevent further demonstrations.
Ski slopes built in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow was used to turn Bristol's site into a track for competitions.
The Piste in the Park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders competing for cash prizes.
At the top of the Brandon Hill Park Runway, a small springboard preceded a 100m long runway.
John Hickman, a fourth year medical student, said that the view from the top of the runway was beautiful but that it was quite intimidating.
It is a magnificent view, with all the lights of the city shining below.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country - real talents," he added.
Prices have rewarded the best voltages - or figures made on the track.
After Thursday night's party, the snow will be abandoned at the melt.
Always them and us.
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Some readers will be drawn to this new book, admirers of the last book of the author, "Why the French don't like the scarf" (2006), an elegant and well-documented study on a problem that has divided and worried the country for about fifteen years and whose effects are still felt today.
Mr. Bowen's last book presents a much broader and more ambitious plot.
A good anthropologist, he not only wants to know what politicians and the media are saying about Islam in France, but what is happening in the country today.
He spent many months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide in France what Mr. Bozen calls "Muslim spaces" for the 5m-6m of Muslims.
He is very well able to listen and reproduce the debates between teachers and students on the issues that concern them most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or at the city hall (or both)?
Should the evolution and rights of homosexuals be taught to young Muslims?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim?
Can a Muslim use an interest-based banking system to obtain a loan?
It is these practical problems, he says, that are the daily lot, rather than the political dramas that concern the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown to the general public, except perhaps Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They don't push the debate to the end.
Conservatives do not believe in the idea of a French or European Islam.
The intellectuals and activists who were interviewed by Mr Bowen generally agree with their fellow lawyers of a purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia who today constitute a small part of the Muslims in Europe.
Bowen believes that the values of Muslims and the secularism of the French could be compatible.
But a compromise can only be achieved with the efforts of each camp.
He wondered how much French politicians (and the intellectual elite guardian so virulent of secularism) were really committed to pluralism.
According to him, Muslims were not spoiled, compared to Catholics, Protestants and Jews who also had to make historical compromises with secular republicanism.
Rather than growing pragmatism, it detects a "closeness of key values".
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, we are tempted to say "yes, but not yet."
The darkest view in the world
The Arctic changes faster and more dramatically than any other place on the planet.
The ice that composes it is melting at an alarming speed, taking with it a life that cannot survive elsewhere.
Oil, gas, expeditions and fishing sail in new open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now writers in their wake.
In "On a thin layer of ice", Richard Ellis, writer and illustrator, paints a natural history of the symbol of the great north, the polar bear.
Knowing the history and complicated policies of whale fishing, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers who proved themselves by hunting the white bear.
The meeting of Admiral Nelson, then courageous 14-year-old aspirant who only had to fight the tip of his musket, is certainly a myth, but the rest is true.
The young bears, caught while swimming alongside their mother, just killed, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, a famous show gathered 75 bears at the same time.
Even today, the dimensions of a zoo are usually one millionth of the area needed for a free adult.The climate is rarely indicated: a polar bear living in Singapore has become green due to the algae growing in its thick fur.

Ellis tells the stories of other writers and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters pose to the survival of the species.
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, killings continue in Greenland and Canada where helicopter hunters and Inuit motorcycles use powerful assault rifles to hunt their game.
Ironically, it is in the northernmost waters of these two hunting nations that the ice will remain the longest.
In his new book, "After the Ice", Alum Anderson, a former editor-in-chief of New Scientist, offers a clear and frightening summary of Arctic science and a captivating insight into what might be the future there.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospherists nor oceanographers can accurately account for the speed of changes.
It's not a mistake to try.
At the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th, Fridtjof Nansen's pioneering voyages gave the first information on the melting of the ice cap.
The cold war submarines then mapped the relief changes below it.
Satellite surveillance and probes on the icebergs are of great help, but the bulk of the work is done by hardened men, camping in the cold.
Mr. Anderson contemplates the extraordinary and tiny world of the Arctic ice-dependent system, formed by brackish water fillets pressed by freezing.
But from the bear mentioned above to the microscopic wonders contained in the ice, everything will be lost with the disappearance of the summer ice, scheduled between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months, maybe it'll be our turn"
Marines, among the 6,000 people who laid crowns on the graves in Arlington
The first class of 19-year-old De'Angello Robinson made a seven-hour bus trip to lay a simple crown on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who made Camp Johnson's trip to Jacksonville, North Carolina at the Arlington National Cemetery Cemetery Cemetery to decorate the graves, this day was dedicated to greeting men and women who, one day, were in their place.
In a few months, from where we will be sent, we risk being in their place, Robinson said about fallen soldiers.
If this were to happen to me, I would like someone to do the same for me, which is why I'm just trying to show respect.
He was one of 6,000 volunteers to gather on Saturday morning to lay crowns on the graves of veterans in various sections of the Arlington Ceremony Cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, launched the commemoration and others decided to decorate several hundred graves in the Arlington Ceremony Cemetery.
Now, to continue an 18-year-old tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen make the journey every year, stopping in different cities on their way, to organize commemorations in honor of the military and the victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit association, Wreaths Across America, which aims to promote the event in all other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns on the graves of the Arlington Cemetery, around the Pentagon, on the graves of the Fayetteville National Cemetery Cemetery Cemetery in Arkansas, in the Battery Park in New York City, and on the site of the Memorial for the Victims of United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year in a row, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 to buy and transport crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, stated that she had made the trip to Arlington in honour of her late husband, a career soldier.
Although her husband was not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that for her, this gesture was a way of thanking those who had sacrificed themselves.
It is a small gesture that civilians can make to support our troops, she said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Entire in several layers of warm clothing, the volunteers walked between the lawns and the extended hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers chose ancient graves, dating from the First and Second World War, as well as the Vietnam War, because they are not as often visited as the new graves, said the organizers.
The mood was optimistic, while the children were playing and the couples were holding hands, carrying the crowns of fresh pine on the grey graves.
Each round crown had a dark green colour, with a small red butterfly knot on top.
Close by, there was silence on Section 60, where most war veterans in Iraq and Afghanistan were buried.
The United Service Organizations gave 1,000 crowns to decorate the section but the dark mood of the current wars filled the area.
Individuals were crying without hiding, others were praying, and families and friends were supporting each other in the cold air.
Some read the names engraved in the stone aloud, while others leaned to see the small black and white information cards, which were thrown into the wet ground for those whose grave had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many crying mothers on her son's grave.
She left Zanesfield, Ohio, and had driven eight hours to gather on the grave of Marine Gunnery Sergeant David Shane Spicer, who died in combat in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free... my son paid for it, she said.
"Long time after I'm gone, I want someone to remember him."
An American National Arrested by Cuban Authorities
The Cuban government arrested an American national who was distributing mobile phones and laptops in the country, the services of the United States Ministry of Foreign Affairs said.
The citizen, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for customers such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
The consular authorities and the U.S. Interest Section in Havana are trying to gain access to the detainee who was arrested on 5 December.
The specific charges have not been made public, although under Cuban law a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor may be arrested on the pretext of being "dangerous".
All so-called revolutionary activities, including moderate protests and critical writings, pose the risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has an increasingly large blogger community, led by Yoani Sánchez, a popular commentator who often writes about how they are husbands and they are followed and harassed by government agents.
Sánchez has made several requests to leave the country to go and receive rewards, but his permissions have always been refused.
The detention of an American national may increase tensions between the Communist government of the brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration, which is pursuing a "soft" approach in order to improve relations with the island.
The arrest announcement was first reported by the New York Times on Friday night.
The new American policy insists that the Cuban government move forward in concrete steps, such as freeing political prisoners and creating more space for opposition, so that the United States can return the same.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although they are new and desired consumer goods in a country or the average salary of an official is $15 per month.
Only this year, the Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones; they are mainly used for texts or for a 15-minute conversation that corresponds to a day's pay.
On the island, the use of the Internet is extremely limited.
It is available in luxury hotels and for foreign visitors to the country, as well as in some government buildings, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect often must communicate their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the rare Americans imprisoned in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, says Gloria Berbena, press attaché to the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena said she couldn't provide more information about the arrest.
Arrest and detention are a big mistake.
An activity that, in any other open society, would be allowed -- to distribute mobile phones free of charge -- is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, Director of the Americas program of the Human Rights Watch group, who recently published a severe report on freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, even Cuba", referring to the installation of Raul Castro as the country's leader to replace Fidel, his sick older brother.
According to Vivanco, an accused is often arrested, tried and imprisoned on the same day.
He said that any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often provoked a negative reaction in the United States, as the two countries began to engage in a better dialogue.
Pakistani authorities prevent plot to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities identified an organization that was supposed to prepare a plot to send five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill American troops, saying that they hoped that this case would disassemble an important network of terrorist recruiters who are playing the Internet in search of radicalized young men.
The investigators claimed that they were hunting a hidden insurgent personality, known as Saifullah who invited these men to Pakistan after having discovered them when one of them made comments approving the terrorist waves on the YouTube video site on the Internet.
When they arrived in Pakistan, they were led by Saifullah, who tried to help them reach the remote region of Pakistan's tribal belt, the home of al-Qaida and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence representative who was briefed on the case said Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convince al-Qaida commanders that these men were not involved in the CIA plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were isolated for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the forbidden mountains of the north-east, becoming a refuge from terrorism.
They were considered undercover agents.
For this reason, they were rejected, said a representative of the authorities who expressed the condition to remain anonymous because of the confidentiality of the case.
The representative of the authorities stated that the men were determined and that they were still trying to obtain the necessary authorizations to obtain entry into al-Qaida camps when they were arrested by Pakistani law enforcement.
The case of these five men -- who remain in Pakistan and are questioned by the FBI -- emphasize the crucial role of recruiters in identifying potential and perhaps more important terrorists, in determining who to trust.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the U.S. secret services have been given priority to infiltrating men into the al-Qaida network.
The organization's recruiters play the role of barrier guards, refusing entry to those who do not show a serious commitment and those who may prove to be spies.
According to analysts, potential American recruits are being studied closely by al-Qaida.
But they are also very attractive to the group because of their potential access to American targets and their propaganda value.
However, Evan Kohlmann, an expert at the NEFA Foundation based in the United States, said that terrorist groups must also pay increasing attention, in recent years in choosing the people they accept because US secret services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you are trying to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way than to follow their recruitment model than so many others have already followed? said Kohlmann.
The model is the one that is increasingly on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of Protestants in Copenhagen call for "action" for the climate
Tens of thousands of Protestants walked on the streets, here on Saturday, demanding more climate action from negotiators working in the Bella Convention Center convention palace in the city.
The number of demonstrators was estimated at 100,000, but 25,000 according to police estimates.
This event took place relatively peacefully, although a small number of masked activists lit some explosives near a set of government buildings in the city centre.
On this day when little has happened during the UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists have marched around the city, deploying signs in English saying 'There is no planet B' and one in Spanish saying 'The Earth says it has enough'.
Several celebrities joined the protests, including the Danish top model and photographer, Helena Christensen, who said that traveling to her mother's home country, Peru, opened her eyes to the devastating problems facing the country because of the impact of climate change that is already happening."
That's one of the reasons I decided to join the big march -- to spread the word and call on leaders around the world to make fair, ambitious and committed decisions, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be undertaken, it is no longer possible to avoid it.
Police prevented protesters from coming too close to Bella Center and said that she had arrested 19 people on the grounds that they were wearing a mask or that they were in possession of pocket knives.
Police prevented protesters from coming too close to Bella Center and said that she had arrested 19 people on the grounds that they were wearing a mask or that they were in possession of pocket knives.
According to one passer-by who asked to remain anonymous because of his involvement in climate discussions, activists wearing masks and black clothes lit several explosives near the Copenhagen main canal, which is surrounded by a few ministries.
They were throwing them near the buildings, he said, adding that they were first rockets, followed by "some big explosions".
Inside the Palais des Congrès, people were gathered around TV screens to follow the walk, throughout the afternoon.
But it seems that the protesters have failed to awaken the consciousness of key authorities such as Su Wei, China's representative for climate.
When asked if he thought that a demonstration would have a positive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English: "In fact, this is something I was not aware of.
He then continued in Mandarin, saying "The event being important, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He observed that walking could seem harmful or useful from the perspective.
It shows the interest of the general public and the different sectors on the subject of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they disturb the negotiations or that they undermine the freedom of others."
Test results reveal persistent differences between breeds
Last week's federal report on math results brought good news for Washington D.C. public schools.
Although the District is still far behind the leading institutions, the report shows that Grade 4 and Grade 5 (cm1-cm2) are much more advanced in the previous two years than in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what emerges from the latest figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress is the persistent gap between the results of African-Americans and whites, both locally and nationally.
The average results of white children from Grade 4 (cm1) to Washington, D.C., have increased over the past two years from 262 to 270 (on a 500 scale), but those of their African-American classmates have increased by only three points, from 209 to 212.
The gap in success actually increased between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of African Americans in Grade 8 (4th) remains generally constant, falling by only one point, from 245 to 244.
The average white result was not included in the test results because the sample was not large enough.
The overall view over a six-year period is no more encouraging.
In 2003, the difference between blacks and whites in Grade 4 class (cm1), when the District's first NAEP report was published, was 60 points (262 to 202).
Although the results obtained by children in both groups increased during this period, the difference was only reduced to 58 points.
Last week, some defenders in the District expressed concern that the increase celebrated by the Group Director of Educational Institutions Michelle A. Rhee and the Mayor, Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat) were driven by white students who were already good elements.
This would mean that we raised the aggregate by considering the elements at the top of the scale, which is problematic and embarrassing, said Jeff Smith, Director of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that advocates equality in the education of the District.
I don't jump for one or two points won, said Kwame R. Brown (Democratic Appearance), a member of the D.C. Council and whose daughter is in Grade 4, at Eaton Elementary.
Often critical of Rhee's management style, Brown said that the test results message is that middle schools in the city desperately need attention.
Really, you always want to see the positive signs and I respect it.
But what scares us is that we don't spend enough time and energy on our middle schools.
Rhee stated that the District should continue to find better ways to meet the needs of students in difficulty.
This fall, for example, some teachers were trained to use a new method of reading, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at students in the end of the elementary and early secondary school classes who did not integrate the basics of reading earlier in their school history and who are quite late compared to their peers.
Every day, the mathematics program, for Kindergarten (maternal) classes in Grade 6 (6th) focuses on the games and experiences of real life, as they were put in place in the District by former head Clifford Janey, who must also be credited for the progress of the NAEP reported last week.
I just think we need to keep working to offer better interventions to these lower-level students than the class, Rhee said.
Others believe that the NAEP results raise the question of whether Rhee can continue to raise the overall results of the system while providing money and resources for schools with less success to narrow the gap.
It is a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a teacher at Berkeley University in California who studies the results of city tests.
The conventional political solution is to devote your resources and management reforms to schools in the poorest parts of Washington.
Therefore, this targeting can have political implications that hinder this important program.
But the problem, of course, is that like other school superintendents, she tries to use the middle class of whites and blacks.
We are concentrating to ensure the development of a system of good schools.
We need to strengthen our neighbourhood schools so that all families, wherever they come from, are assured that their children will be able to obtain excellent public education.
Janey, now superintendent of schools in Newark, said in an interview this week, that one of the essential elements to narrow the gap in success was the length of the traditional public school, today 180 days in the District of Washington, to compete with Charter schools.
It takes about 200 days to get the strength to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with her teachers' union last year to get 185 days, which he considers a "start point" to get a further increase in the next contract.
Making Higher Education a Promise of the Future
The bus stopped in Gettysburg College with a long whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years old, descends and blinks a moment of eyes at the sight of white columns, brick facades and green lawns.
Graciela's parents were only able to finish high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
Also, while she and other Grade 8 (4th) students in the group explored Gettysburg where tuition fees are $38,690 a year, her attitude was less that of an impressed new student than enthusiastic.
Super That's where I'm going to study! Graciela exclaimed that she would like to study medicine, as the guide directed them to the entrance to the science building.
Youpi, really? she says thinking, when she was told the low ratio teacher of law - student.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that children visited during their three-day discovery trip and now they had completely integrated the message: The question is not whether you go to college:
The question is where.
Although this question is still widely raised for the large number of American children born to Hispanic immigrant parents who left high school where they became parents in adolescence, there are also hundreds of thousands who benefit from university education that will allow them to enter the middle class.
In fact, "one out of every five "second generation" Hispanics continue their studies in high school -- a remarkable success considering that so many of their immigrant parents, most of them from Mexico or Central America, have entered the United States without completing high school.
Their success is important, researchers say, and they are paving the way for future generations who will play an important role in the country's workforce.
Researchers who study battlers claim that they have a natural affinity with the school and an innate need to succeed.
There are also many whose parents set high targets for their children and who find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
Mentoring programs also play a very important role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her get to university -- particularly if her efforts are regular and long-term.
When you look at children from low-income families with parents who do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, any intervention, at any time, will not help them, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at Davis, University of California, who studied Latin American students.
We need to think about providing a support network for these children, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that funded the visit of Graciela universities is a good example.
Known as GEAR UP (prepare yourself) , it provides more than $300 million a year to local school systems to organize university readiness programs that begin when students from low-income families are in middle school (college) and continue until the end of high school years.
Since 1999, the program has been followed by more than 10 million students, with more than 60 per cent entering the university, according to the U.S. Ministry of Education.
Iraqi Oil Ministry Wins Agreements with 10 Foreign Oil Companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi Government has succeeded in attracting important oil companies to rebuild its infrastructure in difficulty during two auctions that ended on Saturday.
The 10 agreements obtained by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil with foreign oil companies suggest that oil companies in China, Russia and Europe are about to play a major role in the rehabilitation of Iraq's oil industry, invalidated by decades of war and sanctions.
American companies have returned with a stake in only two of the 10 auctioned fields.
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second auction that began on Friday.
The only one who put up an auction lost.
Two US companies obtained contracts for the fields auctioned in June.
The low representation of U.S. oil giants in the opening of the oil sector in Iraq surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors, after six years of war, and instead of American companies, there are Asian and European companies that are opening the way, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an information website on the Internet.
It will take a long time before another offer is made in Iraq.
Security concerns, corroborated by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability as US military troops retreated, have held back US oil companies, preventing them from entering Iraq with more force, which has the world's third largest crude oil reserve, analysts say.
In some cases, U.S. companies were disadvantaged because of their rivals, particularly the Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, whose labour costs were significantly lower and who were more willing to take risks because they did not have to report to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies to obtain contracts with the Ministry.
The most important American companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which had strong ties with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and provided technical advice, returned empty-handed.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the two main shareholders in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The Chinese National Petroleum Corp., owned by the state, has auctioned more on contracts than other companies and has returned with significant holdings in contracts for two main fields.
We all know that China is becoming a major economy, as well as a technological power, said Assam Jihad, spokesman for the Ministry of Oil.
We are confident that Chinese society will be on an equal footing with its competitors and will fulfil its commitments in Iraq.
The pre-selected auction companies made bids that were then compared to the per-barrel rate that the department agreed to pay to motivate production above current levels for each field.
One of the main al-Qaida organizers reportedly killed in Pakistan
It appears that an American missile, which struck along the border with Afghanistan, killed one of the organizers of al-Qaida operations this week, declared on Friday American authorities of counter-espionage.
If the information is confirmed, it would be the second deadly attack on one of the terrorist leaders this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men suspected of having been killed by a pair of missiles thrown into their car on Tuesday near the town of Miran Shah in North Waziristan province, according to American sources and Pakistani authorities in the region.
Local authorities claimed that the missiles had been fired by an unmanned aircraft of the type used by the CIA, inside the anarchic tribal border of Pakistan.
They were driving a white car, heading towards the Afghan border, when the car was hit, said a member of Pakistani civilian secret services, speaking on the phone of Miran Shah.
Representatives of the authority said that the suspected local militants rushed to the scene and quickly confiscated what remained of the "totally shredded bodies".
It was totally impossible for local authorities to verify the identity of the victims, but the two U.S. anti-terrorist representatives gave unspecified evidence that Somali was one of the dead.
Somali was described as one of the al-Qa`idah military organizers in charge of the group's terrorist operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
His role was to organize plots around the world, said one of the authorities who wanted to remain anonymous, citing the sensitive nature of air strikes inside Pakistani territory.
Given its central role, this probably included conspiracies of attacks on the United States and Europe.
It followed the strategic directions of al-Qaida leaders and translated them into action plans for possible terrorist attacks.
A second representative of the American authority stated that Somali had made rapid progress in the al-Qaida's ranks and had very good relations with other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to the general American public, but it does not lessen the threat he poses to us and our allies, said the second official representative.
If his death is confirmed, Somali would be the second important figure of al-Qaida or the second Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, leader of a faction of militants in the tribal belt, as well as three other operators.
The pace of attacks by CIA drones has declined since the summer, from about six operations per month to two, according to figures from the Long War Journal, a website moderated by a non-profit group.
This decline may be due to improved tactics by terrorist groups that have progressed to reduce their vulnerability while also ruthlessly killing suspected informants, says the site.
United Nations Special Envoy to Kabul withdraws
The United Nations Special Envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said Friday that he would resign from his post in March, at the end of a tumultuous mandate tainted by allegations of widespread corruption during the presidential elections supported by the United Nations.
Eide's departure came as the Obama administration decided to send an additional 30,000 soldiers to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said he supported this increase but expressed concern about the US timetable for a withdrawal of troops that would begin in 18 months and force other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, send the right signal to Afghans and remind them that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview in Kabul.
Our commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civil servants assisting the political transition in Afghanistan.
The military increase must be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide stated that he was not resigning but would simply honour his commitment to his family in March to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to warn the United Nations.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now knows he has time to find a replacement.
I just said it was better to start looking for my replacement, said Eide.
When I came here, there was a two-month gap between my predecessor's departure and my arrival.
According to United Nations officials, Ban has already started looking for a replacement.
The representatives said that the name Staffan di Mistura had been mentioned; it was a citizen of Italo-Switzerland who had recently presided over a United Nations mission to Baghdad and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who had previously led United Nations peacekeeping operations.
Eide's reputation in Afghanistan was put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai during the presidential elections and concealing evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied these allegations but stated that Galbraith's accusations -- which he thanked -- "damaged the mission because there was already a good amount of scepticism about the international observation of elections."
Eide stated that he had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate the relief efforts of the U.S. forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged United Nations officials to allow his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries than was assigned to the mission in Afghanistan, saying that this would give them more confidence in how their money is spent.
Eide expressed frustration about the limitations of his powers in Afghanistan, saying that the heavy United Nations hiring regulations were hampering his ability to bring new talent.
The United Nations rules are such that I have been able to recruit only one person since May, he said.
It's catastrophic and it can't last.
Gates: Iran Needs Additional Sanctions · Global Voices
Defence Secretary Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world's major powers would soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because of its inability to engage in talks on nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking in front of a party of 300 American soldiers in northern Iraq, during a week's visit to the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, dedramatized the possibility of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There is no good option in Iran, he said, in response to a soldier's question about the possibility of such a outcome. ̈
One of the things that weighs the most on me is that if I have learned one thing in Iraq over the past six years, it is the unpredictable side inherent in the war.
The Obama administration considers a set of sanctions that would target Iran's military and political elite, but Gates reported that some of these sanctions could also affect Iranians on the street.
He said that a "set of motivations and punishments" might be necessary to persuade the Iranian government that it would in fact be less secure with nuclear weapons" because "its people would suffer enormously" from these sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration joined the European leaders in a warning that Iran will face "probable" consequences if it does not bring its nuclear programme back in full conformity with the UN Security Council and its monitoring body, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Iran persists in saying that it wants to develop its nuclear experience solely for a peaceful purpose.
In the Geneva talks on 1 October, he said that he would resume the dialogue on reducing his nuclear programme and agreed to abandon an important part of its storage of enriched uranium, in exchange for fuel desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pushed for such an agreement, a way to build trust on both sides and to save time for negotiations.
Since then, Iran appears to have strayed from attempts to agree - in part, experts say, because Iranian leadership is divided on whether or not to engage with the United States.
Frankly, in my view, Iran's resilience to some of the international community's proposals for which they had in fact agreed in early October, prompted the international community, including the Russians and Chinese, to join in on what they had not envisaged, in terms of significant additional sanctions against Iranians, said Gates.
President Obama set 31 December as Iran's deadline to respond to the proposals, before he turned to other options, including the continuation of what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "increased sanctions."
In a statement made in New York on Thursday, Iran's mission to the United Nations denounced what it called "unfounded allegations" by some members of the Security Council about Iran's nuclear activities and stated that it agreed to continue talks with the United States and five other major world powers, "in order to achieve a satisfactory long-term solution".
Gates, who was due to return to Washington late Friday, met in the morning the Iraqi Prime Minister, Nouri al-Maliki, before taking the plane to the rich oil region of Kurdish to meet the leaders of the troops in Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil.
Tensions persist between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly regarding borders, property rights and income sharing.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential conflict in order to avoid any delays in the American plans to reduce the number of American troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also wants to calm the anxiety of the Kurds about the pending withdrawal. The US authorities quoted Gates as saying to Massoud Barzani, President of the Kurdistan regional government: "We will preserve your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a unified Iraq".
We will not abandon you."
In aging China, a change of direction
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by posters of propaganda lecturing them, "The Mother Earth is too tired to welcome more children" and "An extra baby is an extra grave".
They have learned so well the lesson that the Shanghai Government authorities, alarmed by the inadequate birth rate in their city and the ageing population, have radically changed direction this summer and have begun to encourage young couples to have more than one child; their reaction has been instantaneous and firm: never.
We have already given all our time and energy to one child.
We don't have a second left, said Wang, 31, Director of Human Resources, who has an eight-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, creating two generations of unique children notoriously with good cheeks and spoiled, nicknamed the "little emperors", a population crisis threatens the country.
According to the United Nations, the average birth rate fell from six to 1.8 children per couple when the policy was implemented.
The distribution of the population, while the number of residents aged 60 and over is expected to explode, from 16.7 per cent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 per cent in 2050, well above the overall average of about 20 per cent.
This imbalance is even worse in rich coastal cities with a highly educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for almost 22 per cent of the population of residents registered in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission, stated that fertile couples must have babies "to help reduce the proportion of the aging population and prevent a lack of labour in the future".
Shanghai is about to become "as old - but not as rich, however - as developed countries such as Japan and Sweden," she said.
Progressive Mitigation
Drafted in the constitution of the country in 1978, the Chinese policy of the only child is, without question, the most controversial obligation introduced by the communist government.
Couples who violate this policy are at risk of having to pay massive fines -- up to three times their annual income -- and of being discriminated against in the workplace.
The Chinese authorities attributed the duty to the police to help the country avoid a dangerous trend for its natural resources, while human rights lawyers denounced abuses in the execution of this policy.
In rural areas, some government officials have forced pregnant women with a second child to abort.
In addition, many couples have resorted to selective abortions leading to an abnormally high ratio of boys to girls.
In recent years, the authorities responsible for the population have gradually softened their position on the policy of the single child.
In 2004, they granted more exceptions to the rule -- including for city residents, members of ethnic minorities, and cases where men and women are already unique children -- and in 2007, they softened many of their harsh slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research at the University of Beijing, said that central government authorities have recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners is a single child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage births.
In no time, posters encouraging families to have only one child were replaced by copies of regulations detailing the right to have a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city government has sent family planners and volunteers to meet couples at their homes and to drag leaflets under their doors.
He also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those wishing to have more than one child.
According to the head of family planning, the response was disappointing.
Disappointing response
Although officials in a rural town in the suburbs of Shanghai say that they have seen an increase in the number of requests from couples wishing for a second child after the campaign was launched, the more urban district reported that there was no change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, still receives only four to five requests per month.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still projected to be only about 165,000 -- slightly higher than 2009 but less than 2008.
Feng Juying, Head of the Family Planning Committee in the Municipality of Caolu in Shanghai, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want to have more children.
They want to provide for their first child, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and that they are legally allowed to have two children.
But like many Chinese, they only have the minimum health insurance and life insurance given by the government.
Without social protection, they say, the decision would be irresponsible.
Westerners misjudge the one-child policy as a rights issue, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the first child of the couple.
That's right, we're being robbed of the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not just the law.
It's the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons to explain their hesitation.
Wang, Head of Human Resources, said she only wanted a single child because she was one of her own. "We were the center of the family and we used to have everyone take care of us."
We are not used to taking care of someone else and we really don't want to take care of others."
Chen Zijian, 42 years old and owner of a translation company says so more credibly.
For couples working at two, middle class, who bring down the birth rate, he says, it is necessary to be selfish in order to succeed.
People aged 20 or 30 have grown up seeing their parents fight in the early days of capitalist China and do not want to have this lifestyle themselves, he says.
Even one child takes a lot of time from his parents, he says.
A mother must give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are the space problems -- "You need to change your apartment" -- and planning -- "When your child is only 9 months old, you need to write his resume to get a place in the best kindergarten."
Most of his friends are ready for this experience once, Chen says, but not two.
Our generation is the first to benefit from a higher standard of living, he says.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
The United Nations Group has draft emission reduction plans
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- characterized so far by disorganized assignments and mutual recriminations -- has returned to the spotlight on the ramp on Friday, due to the publication of a document highlighting ambitious greenhouse gas reductions over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations supporting most of the burden, in the next 40 years.
The text that could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases highlighted the remaining obstacles, as much as it shed light on the way forward.
But it has been seen as an important step forward in the negotiations that are running out of time, with more than 100 leaders from all over the world arriving next week in Copenhagen.
Drafted by a United Nations ad hoc working group, the text does not say how rich countries would give to the poor to support global warming, both in the short and long term.
And it offers a wide range of options for key issues, including how developed and emerging new economies could reduce their carbon production and what would be the upper limit of the global temperature increase that those responsible would be willing to tolerate.
It gives great flexibility to the process, said John Coequyt, Representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who wrote six pages of the document, studied a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the Executive Secretary-General on climate change of the United Nations, Yvo de Boer, described as "the complete picture".
It shows the guidelines for a possible agreement in which industrial nations would collectively reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 per cent compared to 1990 levels in 2020, while the major developing countries, during the same period, would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 per cent.
Together, countries would reduce emissions by between 50 and 95 per cent by 2050.
The European Union has also relaunched negotiations on Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change -- to cope with floods and drought or to avoid deforestation.
However, on Friday, the same verbal altercations took place, which dominated the negotiations since last week.
Todd Stern, United States Representative for Climate Negotiation, rejected any discussion that required the reduction of greenhouse gases by industrialized countries, in comparison with the voluntary efforts made by major emerging economies, if they were not financed by developed countries.
This change is the signal that the Obama administration becomes tougher towards China than the Bush administration was two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without the efforts and actions of the major developing countries, says Stern, who also regretted that the text does not insist enough to ensure that the reductions could be verified by external observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after the Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister, He Yafei said that the U.S. prime negotiator, either lacked "good sense," or was "extremely irresponsible" for saying earlier this week that the U.S. would not financially help China to fight global warming.
With the future economic trajectories of the major world powers at stake, defects have emerged both within the third world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle concerns more the rescue of individual economies than the rescue of the planet, with China and the United States arguing about their respective obligations while the poorest nations insist that the two dozen most influential countries ignore the scientific imperatives of acting more courageously.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it was not surprising that the major powers were fighting to know who should bear the costs of reducing greenhouse gases, even though vulnerable countries had become more aggressive in their attempt to hold large emitters accountable for their actions.
It is really a game in which a new economic hegemony is developed, said Ulate, who is also Climate Advisor for Mexico and Central America for International Conservation.
Some of these countries more vulnerable to the impact of climate change have indicated that they will continue to put pressure on a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most key participants say that the negotiations will lead to a minimum political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which brings together 43 members, drafted a 24-page draft treaty, early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, Head of the European Commission's Climate Unit, said that the action of small island states "has put political pressure on the complete political process", in part by what they are now unified and asking emerging economies such as China and India to act.
Discussions became an urgent matter, while delegates focused on the fact that they had to resolve most of the outstanding issues before the heads of governments reached an agreement.
High-level officials such as the Indian Environment Minister, Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Deputy Minister came down from their aircraft and rushed into the Bella Center building to attend meetings in the cloisters and information conferences, in order to be able to make claims that will be considered during the following week.
The true image of the gathering -- where 13,000 people enter and leave the Palais des congress every day -- of guitarists performing nightly shows mocking countries that, according to them, betray each other and that proposals are written and distributed on paper rather than by emails -- is a real challenge.
The intensity is increasing: almost all the important ministers are here and no later than Wednesday, 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the court of the greats," said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice-president for the global policy of Conservation International.
Heavy trucks are coming.
In Britain, the first train at 225 km/h will redefine Monday's syndrome
At 5:13 a.m., Monday morning, a whistle blow will break through the night to signal the departure of a train that will mark a transport revolution in Britain.
The country's first high-speed commuter train will reach 225 km/h, while it runs from Ashford, Kent, to London St Pancras, covering 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, will be joined by Dame Kelly Holmes on the first Javelin commuter train outside London.
He hoped that the new service would enable Britain to integrate an international network of fast and reliable trains and link the major conurbations of the Midlands, North and Scotland in London.
Small lost holes will become thriving suburban cities, business travel times will be much shorter and the passage of the aircraft and car to the train will reduce national carbon emissions while reducing traffic congestion on roads.
In theory, the three main political parties adhere to this project.
But the £10 billion needed to build a new rail network, the inevitable planning battle and fears of environmental hazards are likely to curb British high-speed lines.
According to The Times, High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to produce a feasibility report for the government, will return its document to Lord Adonis on December 30.
This will allow it to obtain a detailed map of the route of the next step planned for the high-speed network.
The new line linking London to the West Midlands will be drawn within five metres of the urban area and sites where the impact on the environment can be controversial.
In the countryside, the plan will be drawn up up up to 25 meters from the final route.
It is also expected that HS2 will present three options for a larger high-speed network to the north.
Lord Adonis will answer in the spring.
The preferred options are highlighted in a Y configuration for which a high-speed line will go to the West Midlands.
The line will split in two to or near Birmingham, with a branch heading west from the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another heading northeast, to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line will cross Scotland.
"It seems that this will be the best performance option," said a rail professional.
When it is finished, travel time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first branch, which will not open until 2025, will allow all passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to a one-hour journey currently.
The proposals will allow the train to travel at 400km/h, making the British network the fastest in the world.
The initial route is designed to allow trains of 400m in length and can carry 1100 people.
Up to 18 trains per hour can operate on a London - Birmingham line.
A terminal that can accommodate 20,000 passengers per hour would be required.
Given the space constraints, it is planned that an existing station will be enlarged to receive the high-speed network.
Rail industry experts say that only St Pancras International or Euston offer this possibility.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he believes the project should be implemented, but longer public consultations and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be taken before a general election.
Even if it launches the machine, the network will have to be built part by part.
Trains will first be forced to drive off high-speed lines on existing rails north of Birmingham, with travel times between London and Scotland exceeding three hours.
This solution seems to be the best way to ensure a transition from aircraft to trains, which is a reference point for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers repay the loan of GBP 75,000 for the Tory Orangery
Alan Duncan, the chief member of Parliament Tory, paid the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year to pay off the cost of an orangery he built in his constituency house.
The party leader who was demoted by David Cameron to complain that the members of parliament were "maintained", increased his loan by GBP 75,000 to build an oak extension to his second home in Rutland.
He had been authorized to charge the additional interest, amounting to hundreds of pounds per month, to the taxpayer.
The Commons authorities received the complaints at that time and were not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who carried out a review of the members' expenses. Last night, Mr. Duncan stated that the complaints could not be "clearer or simpler".
Mr. Duncan, one of the richest members of parliament, owns a two-storey house in a village in his constituency of Rutland - Melton.
The nearby houses were sold for nearly a million pounds.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the emoluments office claims that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year he added a veranda to the house, describing it in his plans as an orange grove.
Neighbors describe it as a veranda for pleasure.
Mr. Duncan was not asked to provide an explanation for the increase in borrowing during a recent investigation by the Committee on Common Privileges and Standards into his pre-borrowing arrangements.
The Committee cleared him last month of all charges of non-compliance, following an investigation into his expenses.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal security of the loan of GBP 271.406 from his London property to the house of his constituency which he purchased in 1991, the year before becoming a member of Parliament.
The documents published this week show that Mr. Duncan claimed approximately GBP 1,400 per month of borrowing interest until March last year.
In April, its applications increased by more than GBP 1,800 per month.
The interest rate on Mr. Duncan's RBS loan was not changed at that time, suggesting that all the increases were intended to finance the loan of GBP 75,000.
The variable standard interest rate RBS rose from 7.94 per cent in December 2007 to 4 per cent in March this year, without moving since then.
The latest publication of the Commons authorities shows that Mr. Duncan continued to apply for GBP 1,250 in May.
Duncan lost his position as head of the ghost cabinet in September, after a covert journalist filmed him saying that members of parliament had to survive "on budget" after the expense scandal.
"In fact, it's now national, you have to live "on budget" and you're treated as "m...e"
He said: "I spent my money on my garden and asked for a small part, based on what was right.
And I could've asked a hell of a lot more, but I didn't."
The member of parliament, a millionaire since his former post as an oil dealer, began to have to explain his expenses in May, after it had appeared that he had asked for thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the office that this "may be considered excessive".
An activist dug a £-shaped hole in M Duncan's lawn to protest after it was revealed that he had claimed £4,000 for three years.
Asked about the increase in borrowing last night, Mr. Duncan said: "It was for capital improvements, approved both by the expense office and then by Legg."
He added: "There is no problem with stealing or developing or using the rules or anything.
It was quite clear, in the rules, authorized, etc.
It could not be clearer or simpler."
Faithful, come all to see the Brighton Advent calendar
Brighton beach cabins have found a new way to promote winter months, an interactive Advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity, has invited 24 owners to decorate their booth for each day of December, using Christmas songs as a theme.
The event began on December 1, when visitors were allowed to visit the last cabin, from 5:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m., each day, with pâtés and hot wine served free of charge.
The songs chosen so far include "I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Noël", for which the booth presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an unpaid priest from the diocese of Chichester and Director of Beyond.
He said: "We want religion to be closer to people in a post-Christian society.
"As a Church, why do we expect people to enter an old strange building? It seems to me that the Church should approach people and celebrate more captivatingly.
"The idea of the Advent calendar of the beach cabin came just after a conversation with a few friends, during a dinner.
Brighton is such a creative and vibrant place and we try to experience and represent it through spirituality."
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and the world for climate
Tens of thousands of people demonstrated on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against global warming, around the world and in Copenhagen, where the police made several hundred inquiries.
At least 30,000 people, according to the police, about 100 thousand according to the organizers, paraded in the cold in the Danish capital, on the sidelines of the United Nations Climate Conference, charged with reaching an agreement by Friday that can enter into force on 1 January 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish President of the climate conference, the growing mobilization on climate throughout the world, illustrated by these events, has helped to make the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen very high.
Incidents in the Danish capital occurred shortly after the departure of the procession, when a group of 300 protesters, dressed in black, broke windows with pavements and hammers, one AFP journalist observed.
Anti-riot police immediately intervened without care.
In total, the police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, mainly Black Block members, who had shown themselves at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA) coalition, one of the organisers of the event, denounced the conditions under which hundreds of activists were arrested "without distinction", pointing out that about 100 of them "were still held in the street Saturday night "minorated and kept in a sitting position despite the extreme cold".
Party of Parliament, the procession, rather good child, took over the leadership of the Bella Center, site of negotiations.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 metres from the building, without attempting to enter it.
A scene had been set to welcome the speakers, before a candlelight vigil with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
The majority of protesters had come by bus and by train from the major cities of Europe, but many Asians, including a few Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in waterproof sky blue, had formed a first gathering in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of Friends of the Earth, who intended to form "blue tides" for "justice for the climate".
Today, we go down the streets to ask for compensation for the ecological debt in favour of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
One cannot continue to say: one has time, estimated the Beninese singer Angélique Kidjo.
There are rivers that dry up in Africa, rivers where you can walk like you've never done before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the alterglobalist movement has moved closer to environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, a figure of alterglobalism, explained that he came to Copenhagen to "link climate justice and social justice": "Today, there is no cutback between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world".
The Asia-Pacific region, which is home to many islands that are particularly vulnerable to warming, had launched the demonstrations.
Some 50,000 people, according to the organizers, had come down the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, mostly students, paraded in red, with bandanas boasting solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, but also in Canada, rallies of several hundred protesters also took place to demand strong action against climate change.
In France, the events organized by the network "350" brought together several hundred people, including in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
In Geneva a few dozen people gathered.
The separatist Abkhazia elected its president, Georgia denounces a "thing"
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, a little over a year after Moscow's recognition of this pro-Russian separatist region of Georgia, while Tbilisi denounces a "face".
Some 131,000 people were called to participate in this first election after the August 2008 Russian-Georgian war for control of South Ossetia, another secessionist territory recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 17:00 GMT.
The participation rate was 58 per cent a few hours before the closure, according to officials of the Abkhaz Electoral Commission.
The first provisional results were to be announced on the night of Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates, including the outgoing president, Sergei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemned the holding of the election.
These elections are a joke.
For his part, the Georgian President, Mikheil Saakashvili, "regrets that Abkhazia has fallen under the total occupation of Russia," said his spokesman, Manana Manjgaladze.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world regards it as part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After separating from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, which killed several thousand people, Abkhazia seeks to demonstrate through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a step in our new life, our new era as an independent state, told AFP Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian, who claimed to have voted for Mr. Bagapch.
She was among the voters who went to the polling station in a school in Sukhumi, the capital, in a nice white building with some palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian domination is at the heart of the presidential in this region with sumptuous landscapes, on the edge of the Black Sea.
Large panels showing Mr. Bagapch alongside the Russian President and Prime Minister, Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are installed everywhere in this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, in the west of the country, the district chief, Beslan Archba, gave a warm welcome to Russian officials who had come to monitor the conduct of the election.
We, the Abkhaz people, are grateful, he said during a small ceremony, alluding to Moscow's support, in particular the decision to recognize the independence of Abkhazia.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, said Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian parliament, raising a glass of vodka.
For its part, the opposition represented by former Vice-President Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticizes the agreements concluded with Moscow last year, such as the one giving Russia control over the Abkhaz railways for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, claims neither to support the current power nor the opposition.
A 50% majority plus one vote is required to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round must be organized within two weeks.
Climate: demonstrations around the world, incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people marched around the world on Saturday to call for an ambitious and binding agreement at the Copenhagen Climate Conference, where the police, on the live-in side, arrested nearly 700 people on the margins of an imposing demonstration.
Thirty thousand people, according to the police, about one hundred thousand according to the organizers, paraded in the cold in the afternoon in the Danish capital, which hosts until 18 December delegates from 193 countries, in search of an agreement that will have to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
Party of Parliament, the procession, overall good child, took over the direction of the Bella Center, where negotiations are taking place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 metres from the centre, without attempting to enter it.
A scene had been set to welcome the speakers, before a candlelight vigil with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the start of the procession, a group of a few hundred protesters, fully dressed in black, equipped with bricks and hammers, broke windows, observed an AFP journalist.
Anti-riot police immediately surrounded them and intervened without care, throwing several of them to the ground.
The police announced the inquiry of 600 to 700 people, stating that they were mainly members of the "Black Blocks", these ultra-violent groups that had shown themselves at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
In the late afternoon, a policeman was injured in the jaw by a pavement and four cars burned near a squat in incidents that led to the arrest of some 20 people, according to the police.
We have eyes on extremist groups, warned police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen, while law enforcement helicopters were circling in the sky.
The majority of the demonstrators, who came by car and by train from the major cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam or Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in waterproof sky blue, had formed a first gathering in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of Friends of the Earth, who intended to form "blue tides" for "justice for the climate".
Today, we go down the streets to ask for compensation for the ecological debt in favour of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
One cannot continue to say: one has time, estimated the Beninese singer Angélique Kidjo.
There are rivers that dry up in Africa, there are streams where you can walk when you've never done it before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the alterglobalist movement has moved closer to environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, a figure of alterglobalism, told the AFP that he had come to Copenhagen to "link climate justice and social justice": "Today, there is no cutback between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world".
Oxfam mobilized several personalities, including the Danish model Helena Christensen, the former UN Commissioner for Refugees Mary Robinson, who had to address the crowd.
The Asia-Pacific region, which is home to many islands that are particularly vulnerable to warming, had launched the demonstrations.
Some 50,000 people, according to the organizers, had come down the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, mostly students, demonstrated, dressed in red and wearing bandanas boasting solar energy in front of the city hall of the Philippine capital.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, gatherings of a few hundred protesters also took place to demand action against climate change.
In France, the events organized by the network "350" brought together several hundred people, including in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
In Geneva a few dozen people gathered.
The history-geo emerges strengthened from the reform of the general high school, according to Chatel
National Education Minister Luc Chatel said in an interview to be published in the JDD on Sunday that history and geography came out "reinforced" from the reform of the general high school, despite the abolition of their compulsory education in the scientific terminal.
From now on, the first students will all have four hours a week and the same program for a shared common culture, says Chatel.
According to the minister, "we have to get out of hypocrisy" because, according to him, "the S sector is no longer a scientific sector" but "largely, it concentrates the best students".
The ES and L channels cannot remain sub-fields of the S, he continues, stressing again: "I have not heard many historians and intellectuals indignant about the absence of the history-geography at the terminal in the technological high schools either".
On Saturday, an IFOP poll published in L'Humanité revealed that nearly seven out of ten (69%) of French people disagreed with the government's plan to eliminate compulsory history-geography education at the S-terminal.Many intellectuals and teachers also criticized this deletion, as well as the left and some right-wing elected officials.
The minister added, however, that it was "no question" to delete the philosophy of the S terminal program.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher training, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) called for a day of mobilization Tuesday to protest against the project, which they believe sacrifices the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), they will pass an eligibility test at the beginning of the year that will focus on their discipline, and then, at the end of the year, an admission test that will focus on their ability to teach, the Minister explained.
They will also follow internships in the M2 year and will be a first year in front of students as intern teachers.
If you add up all the internships offered before the competition, you already get more presence in front of the students, or more than 300 hours, he continued.
Finally, the Minister says that he will propose "individual right to training, something that does not exist in National Education".
It also reaffirms the plan to delete the school map "by 2012".
In Normale Sup, experts have 15 minutes to convince on the climate
Fifteen minutes to talk about the challenges of the Copenhagen Summit: this is the challenge that Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) invited by the Ecole Normale Supérieure de la rue d'Ulm, met on Saturday morning.
Jean Jouzel, also Nobel Peace Prize winner, inaugurated the first of the "Ernest" conferences, a day consisting of a chain of expert interventions, of fifteen minutes each, filmed and open to the public, observed an AFP journalist.
We wanted to do something that catches people and makes them want to know more, explained in the margins of the conference Edouard Hannezo, 22, one of the organizers of this day that draws its name from the one given by the students to the fishes of the school basin.
Some twenty speakers were chosen from among the experts in their discipline and selected for their charismatic side, he said.
Regarding global warming, "we can talk about the hours, but we can also talk about the key goals in a few minutes," Jean Jouzel told AFP, who spoke without notes, but with graphics, in front of about 50 people.
This is part of our role as a scientist, he stressed, hoping that the auditors will consider that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an extremely serious scientific dossier".
The videos from these lectures will be posted on the school website as of December 15.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February, followed by others at a bimonthly pace.
Late payments: anger of prison overseers, planned actions
The prison overseers' unions called on Friday for "general mobilization" to demand the payment by the end-of-year holidays of bonuses and overtime whose payment was postponed to January for budgetary reasons.
FO-penitentiary (2nd union of overseers) asked staff who will not be on duty to protest Tuesday morning in front of prisons and to "block them", to "report the theft of their dues".
The CGT-penitentiary (3rd trade union) calls on them to "congregate in general meetings in the various prisons for a strong mobilization", deeming "sorry and unacceptable" the non-payment in December of "overtimes, night, Sunday and public holidays" worked in October.
And the first union of overseers, the federal autonomous prison union (UFAP/Unsa), "calls for general mobilization (...) to bring up dissatisfaction and anger".
The Directorate of Prison Administration and the Ministry of Justice explained that overtime had increased significantly in 2009 and not all had been budgeted, but ensured that the remainder would be paid in January.
The Chancellery indicated at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the unions of supervisors guaranteeing that this payment would be made next month.
I am aware of the efforts made by staff to operate and modernize our prison system, the Minister of Justice wrote in this letter.
I have asked the prison management to put in place without delay a set of measures to ensure that this situation arising from a poor assessment of the number of overtime hours does not recur in the future, adds Alliot-Marie.
The December pay will therefore be slim, except for the management staff receiving the famous bonuses of functions and objectives, deplored the Ufap/Unsa, for whom "budgetary constraints have good backs".
It is a pure scandal, the FO inter-regional union of Marseilles was outraged, announcing its decision to boycott until the new order "all meetings and convocations".
Staff will not come to work on their Sundays and holidays if those of the month of October are not regularized in December, same for overtime, also threatens FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
As we increase our tasks and our missions without increasing our numbers, it is more than regrettable to dare to attack the staff's money, says the CGT-Penitentiary of Bordeaux.
According to the unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some of which are less ill-fated than others.
But in any case the account is not there, noted the secretary general of the Ufap, Jean-François Forget.
For Christmas, Obama says he's offering more "nice tricks" than the ones he gets.
U.S. President Barack Obama, who is about to spend his first family Christmas at the White House, told the "daddy" of the little Oprah Winfrey screen that he had a simple gift rule: "I give things nicer than the ones I receive."
As part of a special show that will be broadcast on ABC on Sunday evening, the president and his wife Michelle offer an overview of how they intend to celebrate the end of the year celebrations in their new and prestigious home.
Even Bo, the family's four-legged companion will be on the side.
Santa also loves Bo, said Michelle Obama, stating that the dog would "of course" have a gift, according to excerpts from the show broadcast in advance.
And Michelle Obama signed up falsely against her husband's assertions about the quality of the gifts he receives: "Certainly not, I gave you nice gifts last year," she teased the president.
Absolutely, did he have to concede before he humbly replied by fingering the First Lady's pearl necklace: "Who offered you this?".
During this one-hour show, in a relaxed atmosphere, with the famous hostess who was a fervent supporter of Barack Obama during the presidential campaign, the president and his wife also remembered their favorite gifts as children.
Barack Obama mentioned a ten-speed bike, but also a basketball that his Kenyan father rarely saw offered him at Christmas.
I remember this time when I met my father who came to see us for Christmas and gave me a basketball, said the president.
It was only much later in my life that I realized that he was the one who gave me this ball.
The First Lady remembered her side of her doll house.
I really didn't know how to organize a house so I had lined up all the furniture against the wall, rather than arrange it around the fireplace, but I loved this little doll house, said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday rehabilitated, RTL claims he's in artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was re-operated in Los Angeles due to significant "injuries" after an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his entourage, while RTL claims that the singer was placed in an artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was re-operated on the night of Wednesday to Thursday at the Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles after American doctors had noticed "injuries resulting from the operation" of the hernia discal suffered in Paris on 26 November, told Paris his press service, stating that these injuries had "neededed a repair operation".
However, the singer's press service wanted to reassure itself that the situation was "under control", while announcing that a new medical bulletin would be issued no later than 48 hours.
According to RTL, a partner of the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday would have been plunged into an artificial coma to avoid "pain and complications".
It is only in 48 hours that we will have a little more certainty about the patient's condition when he opens an eye, adds RTL.
When questioned by the AFP, the press service did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also states that "according to some sources" no drain would have been installed after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated at the international clinic of Parc Monceau for this herniated disc.
The surgery, scheduled for several days, had been practiced by the neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor in the art community.
This one was not available Thursday night to comment on RTL information.
Following his surgery on Johnny Hallyday, the singer was hospitalized on Monday at the Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles for an infection following the surgery.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday, estimated Thursday on RTL that his friend was going through "a bad pass", but assured himself not to worry "no worries" about the rocker, who is "a fighter".
He called me just before he left for L.A., and I told him it was bullshit because doing twelve hours of flying after such an operation is not playable, said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday evening, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, wanted to reassure himself, stating that Johnny Hallyday "reacted satisfactorily to antibiotics" and that the infection was "inhibited".
Mr. Camus had also said that he had spoken with Laeticia, the singer's wife, and had not noticed any particular concern.
But the health problems of the singer have only multiplied since July when he was hospitalized for nine days following a fall on his yacht.
Two months later, to the general surprise, Johnny Hallyday had revealed that he had been operated on by a "little colon cancer", then by a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed as planned his long "Tour 66", presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health problem has been heavily commented on. Fans and journalists have noticed the singer's difficulty in moving on stage.
In mid-November, his entourage even had to deny a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/small basin: the first of Bousquet on its fetish distance
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, a triple medalist at the 2009 World Championships in a large pool, won an international title on Thursday over a distance that he particularly loves, the 50m free swimming, during the Euro-2009 in a small pool in Istanbul.
The first day of this competition where combinations are allowed for the last time saw only three world records beaten while waiting for a rollover.
One was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto over 200 m 4 swims and the other two by Russia in relays gentlemen 4x50 m 4 swims.
A regret for Bousquet, which lay on the world record of the 50 m free, of which he holds the mark in large basin (20.94).
On one of the two queen distances of swimming, the 50m free, it is the 28-year-old Frenchman who imposed himself in 20 sec 53 in a final where ten swimmers took the start against eight usually, a first at the international level.
Bousquet beat Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84) but failed to lower the global brand (20.30) as he had envisaged.
We can always dream better and in the matter, I had said that if the world record was within my reach, I would try it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers were dressed in polyurethane combinations, which will be banned from January 1.
At the origin of 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations ended their epic in Istanbul, which had hosted the first in 1999, during the same competition.
The use of the combinations did not serve this time the German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in the big pool this summer in Rome, world records at the key.
The young swimmer failed to lower the mark he holds on 400 m free swimming (3:32.77) but nevertheless won by signing the second best time of his career (3:34.55), ahead of Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn't give up on that race.
I knew I couldn't beat a world record this time but I managed to defend my title and I accomplished my mission.
Lobintsev will be a serious rival in the future, Biedermann explained.
USA: a sarcophagus panel that belonged to Zola awarded $1.5 million
A Roman sarcophagus panel that belonged in particular to French writer Emile Zola was awarded Thursday $1.5 million, clearly above his estimate, announced the art dealer Sotheby's.
This front panel of two meters long by 63 cm high, dating from the third century after Jesus Christ, was estimated to be between $150,000 and $250,000.
The marble "representing four dionysian scenes in a sophisticated architectural setting, surrounded by satyrs and bacchantes, is a rare piece, there are only four or five of them in the world", had explained to the AFP Tuesday Florent Heintz, vice-president of the art auctions of Roman and Egyptian antiquity at Sotheby's.
It was sold among a hundred lots.
The sale is still ongoing but this lot is certainly the one on which the buyers have auctioned most so far, told the AFP a spokesman for Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy.
The discovery of the acquisition of this marble by Emile Zola dates back a few days.
The panel remained almost 300 years in Rome in the famous collection of the Borghese family, then appeared successively at the French actress Cécile Sorel, who had made it an element of his bath in his particular Parisian hotel, and at Paul Reynaud, minister under the Third Republic in France and briefly president of the Council before the accession to power of Marshal Pétain.
There was still a shadow zone of about fifty years.
By searching the database of the Louvre Museum, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of a "Succession Emile Zola" opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresco of the "Rougon-Macquart".
Aborted departure attempt from Zelaya from Honduras to Mexico
Mexico considered Thursday that the conditions were no longer met for the transfer to its territory of the fallen president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, who was denied a safe conduct by the putschist government.
At the moment, after a telephone conversation in the night with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that the possibilities for this transfer are not being met, said Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa.
Arrived on Wednesday in El Salvador to bring Mr. Zelaya back, the Mexican government aircraft returned to his place of origin, according to a source from the Directorate General of Migration.
The putschist government wanted to force Mr. Zelaya to "resign" and apply for political asylum abroad to grant him safe conduct.
But the fallen president refused, because he wanted to go to Mexico as the visiting head of state.
The putschist government "has experienced a new failure in wanting me to give up my office (...), they wanted me to resign", said Mr Zelaya on Globo radio Thursday, on which he has often spoken since the beginning of the political crisis that has lasted for five months in the Central American country.
I can stay here ten years, here I have my guitar, added by playing some chords the fallen president, refugee at the Brazilian embassy of Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
The Mexican Embassy has submitted a request for safe conduct to us, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain an application for asylum, said the Minister of the Interior of the putschist government, Oscar Raul Matute, on Honduran radio HRN.
I do not ask for asylum from any country, Manuel Zelaya had answered in an interview to the Telesur channel, whose headquarters is in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras would have to take place as president of the Honduran people, he said.
Mr. Zelaya's departure rumors had mobilized on Wednesday the supporters of the fallen president, who came to gather around the Brazilian embassy, where the military strengthened their headquarters.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the putschist government's position.
This demonstrates the marginal nature of this government vis-à-vis international standards, he said.
Zelaya, who had approached Venezuelan socialist president Hugo Chavez, had been overthrown on 28 June, the day he organized a popular consultation to prepare for his re-election, against the advice of the Supreme Court, the army and Congress.
Exiled to Costa Rica, he had returned by surprise on 21 September and had taken refuge at the Brazilian Embassy.
If he goes out, he will be arrested to answer for the crime of "high treason" of which he accuses the justice, according to the putschist government.
The putschist president Roberto Micheletti managed to organize a presidential election on 29 November to replace Mr Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was elected during the controversial election recognized by the United States but contested by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted massively against Mr. Zelaya's return to power until the end of his term on 27 January.
Wall Street goes up, the US trade balance fuels optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended up on Thursday, with US trade balance figures showing the resumption of activity by both the United States and its partners: the Dow Jones won 0.67% and the Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced from 68.78 points to 10.405.83 points, and the technology dominant Nasdaq from 7.13 points to 2.190.06 points.
The extended Standard & Poor's 500 index was allocated 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1,102.35 points.
We have good news coming from different parts of the economy, said Lindsey Piegza, from FTN Financial.
But this remains anecdotal, she tempered, believing that the market was focused on "half-full glass".
For Peter Cardillo, of Avalon Partners, investors focused mainly on the US trade balance figures, "which show that activity is improving in the fourth quarter".
The US trade deficit declined in October by 7.6% from September to $32.9 billion.
Analysts expected that the deficit would increase.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The big news is the growth of trade volumes, especially for goods exports, which reflects the growth of the economies of the major US trading partners, commented Christopher Cornell, of the research firm Economy.com.
On the other hand, new unemployment registrations in the United States rose against expectations last week, reaching 474,000 applications.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job seekers "has fallen to the lowest level in a year," said Scott Marcouiller, from Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The yield of the 10-year Treasury bond increased to 3.482% compared to 3.423% on Tuesday night and the yield of the 30-year bond to 4.492% compared to 4.408% the previous day.
Cuba: Hundreds of supporters of power consummate "Ladies in White" · Global Voices
A few hundred supporters of the Cuban government consecrated wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for World Human Rights Day on Thursday, and prevented another demonstration for which about ten dissidents were arrested.
Some forty "Ladies in White", wives or close to political prisoners, were taken to the streets by supporters of Raul Castro's government as they walked to the center of the capital to demand the release of political prisoners, said an AFP journalist.
Down the Yankees!, "mercenaries!", "the street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Live Fidel and Raul!" chanted, the fist lifted, the supporters of power to dissidents.
The latter were escorted by plainclothes officers who came "to ensure their protection".
The previous day, a similar demonstration took place against the "Ladies in White" in Havana, without any injuries or arrests.
But in the Havana neighbourhood of the Vedado, about ten dissidents who were also preparing to protest on Thursday for the International Human Rights Day were questioned by police in plainclothes, one AFP journalist observed.
The police forcefully mounted dissidents in civilian vehicles that were convulsed by supporters of the government, according to the journalist.
Interpellations of dissidents in similar circumstances usually last only a few hours.
Recipients of the 2005 Sakharov Prize of the European Parliament, the "Ladies in White" had organized an unauthorized march to "claim the release of all political prisoners", 200 according to dissent, said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Hector Maceda is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
Mr. Maceda is part of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, 53 of whom remain under lockdowns.
The Cuban authorities regard opponents as "mercenaries" or "agents" to the pay of their declared enemy, the United States.
Very rarely, Cuban television reported on Thursday's demonstration of pro-government activists against "counter-revolutionaries".
Cuba, led by a single party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of violating rights and freedoms, including expression.
A coerced man kills an eight-year-old with a knife and wounded five in Clichy-la-Garenne.
An armed force of two knives killed an octagenarian and wounded five others in the downtown of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine), at an hour's notice, Thursday at the end of the day.
According to the first elements of the investigation, the 28-year-old aggressor reportedly struck with two knives and for undetermined reasons, an octagenarian, in or in front of a pharmacy on 85 Boulevard Jean-Jaurès, was learned from police sources and from witnesses.
Severely wounded, the old man, born in 1929 according to a head of the Alliance police union, died in the hospital from his injuries.
In or in front of the same pharmacy, he then attacked a couple, whose wife was pregnant.
The husband, about thirty years old, intervened and was injured.
The first two victims, seriously injured, were admitted to the hospital where the octogenary succumbed.
The days of the other injured are in danger, with vital organs apparently affected, according to police sources.
The pregnant woman then became ill and was reportedly hospitalized "in shock", according to a police source.
The armed man, who seemed to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, would then have fled to the street, always boulevard Jean Jaurès.
He allegedly injured two passers-by, apparently at random: a 30-year-old and a quadragenary, the latter seriously.
The scenario remained confused in the evening.
He was armed with two butcher knives that he was wearing on a cross behind his back, explained on the spot a head of the Alliance union in the Hautes-de-Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
Several passers-by, including young people, according to evidence gathered by the AFP, have attempted to control the forcible.
I saw a guy about 30 years old in a green jacket.
Three young people tried to intercept him.
They didn't get there because the guy was strong, said Alberto, a waiter from a nearby bar.
A crowd fell on him, including a municipal policeman who broke his wrist, he added.
Also boulevard Jean-Jaurès, at the height of No.61, two municipal police officers, including their manager, attempted to interrogate the armed man and were wounded with fists, according to police sources.
The facts have occurred in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are many shops.
Passersby came to tell me that there was someone hurt outside.
I went out, I saw a 70-year-old on the floor, I put him in a safe position, and I saw a very important abdominal wound, told AFP Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later, a second person about thirty years old arrived, stabbed with a knife.
It was the National Police who arrested the man without identity papers.
The Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office seized the investigation from the Hauts-de-Seine Department of Judicial Police (SDPJ 92).
The forcible was hospitalized Thursday night.
He had not yet been heard in his custody.
A police source did not rule out him being interned in a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, it took six police officers to control him at the Clichy police station where he was taken.
He was "in a state of overexcitation" as "all the forces of this species whose forces increase under the effect of action".
USA: Polanski's lawyer again calls for an end to prosecution
The lawyer of Franco-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski once again demanded Thursday in Los Angeles (California, west of the United States), the abandonment of the lawsuit against his client, currently under house arrest in Switzerland for a suit of morality of more than 30 years.
Chad Hummel, the lawyer for the director of the "Pianist", denounced serious procedural errors before three judges of the California Second District Court of Appeal in 1977.
I demand that the charges be dropped here and now, Mr. Hummel said, before adding that the behaviour of the judge in charge of the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, "was cold in the back".
According to him, Judge Rittenband -- who has since died -- would have discussed, before returning his sentence, with a prosecutor who told him that Roman Polanski deserved prison -- which is a serious lack of due process.
This discussion had been revealed in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski, wanted and wanted), from the very mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells had finally declared at the end of September that he had "lied" to the author of the documentary.
In the event that the court refused to abandon the proceedings, Mr. Hummel called for a trial, which would allow him to present evidence of his argument.
The prosecution, for its part, reiterated the argument already developed in the first instance, that no abandonment of the charges could be seriously considered until Roman Polanski appeared before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker had fled the United States in 1978, before his sentence was handed down, for "illegal sexual relations" with a 13-year-old girl.
He's never been to the United States since.
The Los Angeles County Deputy Prosecutor, Phyllis Asayama, said that Roman Polanski "must be there to appear at the hearing."
In this case, do we want to send the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, that it is possible to escape?, asked Ms. Asayama.
For her, the filmmaker "asks the court for a favor, while disregarding her authority".
One of the three judges -- who now have 90 days to make their decision -- also stressed that "there are other alternatives to escape."
Mr. Hummel was not alone in calling for the abandonment of the proceedings against Roman Polanski.
Samantha Geimer's lawyer, the victim, also called for the end of the proceedings once again.
Recalling that her client no longer supports being harassed at every turn of the Polanski affair, she added: "No one in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years is enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland on an American arrest warrant.
After more than two months behind bars, he was placed under house arrest in his Gstaad cottage, pending extradition.
Wall Street ends up without direction, hampered by the rise of the dollar
The New York Stock Exchange ended up without direction on Friday, in a market drawn between better indicators than expected in the United States and the rise of the dollar: the Dow Jones won 0.63% but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose from 65.67 points to 10.471.50 points, while the technology dominant Nasdaq dropped from 0.55 points to 2.190.31 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index rose from 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, said Mace Blicksilver, from Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains in narrow margins, the volume of trade has become very low and I think it will remain so until the end of the year.
The trend was supported by the publication of better than expected economic indicators, which "helped to improve the market's view of the soundness of the economic recovery", Charles Schwab's analysts summarized.
In the United States, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November for the second month in a row and much more than expected.
In addition, U.S. consumer confidence rose sharply in December, to 73.4 versus 67.4 the previous month, according to the preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan index.
However, the indices have been hampered by a further rise in the dollar, at the highest in the last two months against the euro, which "pulls down sectors sensitive to the economic situation," said Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
Technological values have thus lost ground.
The bond market has fallen.
The yield of the 10-year Treasury bond increased to 3.540% compared to 3.482% Wednesday night and that of the 30-year bond to 4.497% compared to 4.492% the previous night.
The election of Miss World again in South Africa
After a month's journey through South Africa, the 112 Miss World candidates are about to cross the last straight line on Saturday to realize their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion viewers.
During this great Mass of beauty organized for the second consecutive year in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already picked up their ticket for the semi-final.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta of Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma of Canada were elected Miss Sports or Miss Top Model during their African stay.
It was a real whirlwind.
Visiting beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town was extraordinary.
I've seen so many things and lived so many experiences!, exclaims Miss Sierra Leone.
This competition, which takes place for the ninth time in South Africa, is broadcast live Saturday from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, starting at 17:00 (15:00 GMT).
I couldn't dream of a better country to hand over my crown.
This experience was fascinating.
I am happy to have lived it twice, says Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the southern summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges with the candidates and the rediscovery "of breathtaking landscapes in this country".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, meetings with the press and safari, the Misses now focus on the competition.
The Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000 and present for this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both of whom became the stars of Bollywood.
It's every woman's dream to be crowned the most beautiful in the world, but it's not just about appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our countries and I want to go home with the crown, launches Miss India with a wide smile.
According to the organizers, music and dance will punctuate this 59th edition.
The candidates will parade in traditional costume and of course in swimsuits.
The show will be hosted by a TV presenter, the Chinese Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean and a head of the Miss World Steve Douglas committee.
South Africa has shown that it knows how to welcome the world with warmth and pride that it is difficult to match, says Julia Morley, President of Miss World.
The candidates have like last year made a safari, visited the famous township of Soweto, but this time by bike, and tasted the local cuisine.
Exceptionally, they also met with South African President Jacob Zuma, who shook their hands.
Not common for a head of state, Miss Sierra Leone notes.
Their best memory will no doubt remain the draw of lots in Cape Town (southwest) for the World Cup of football in June 2010, a way for the country to promote the event a little more.
I've been seeing people I never thought I could get close to.
I will no doubt come back for the 2010 World Cup, enthusiastic Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
Johnny Hallyday's news is "very positive," according to his son David
Johnny Hallyday's news "is very positive," assured his son David on Friday when he arrived at the airport of Los Angeles where he was to go to the bedside of his hospitalized father for several days.
The news is very positive.
It's very strong, it's going very well, said to the press David Hallyday on his departure from the plane that brought him from Paris shortly after 1:00pm local (21:00 GMT).
The singer's son, the relaxed air, assured that he would go "very quickly" to the Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted Monday for an infection following the operation of a hernia disc on November 26 in Paris.
The singer was "placed in an artificial coma last night in Los Angeles for a reason of comfort, to prevent him from suffering and to be able to administer his treatment," the press service said.
Johnny Hallyday had already been placed in an artificial coma by doctors at the Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, where he had been admitted Monday for an infection following the operation of a hernia disc on November 26 in Paris.
The singer had to be re-operated on the night of Wednesday to Thursday due to significant injuries resulting from this intervention.
His wife Laeticia went to the French high school in Los Angeles on Friday morning, where their daughter Jade is educated, to attend a school show, saw a photographer from the AFP.
The head of orthopedic and trauma surgery at the hospital of Pitié-Salpêtrière, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer on Monday in Los Angeles.
The producer violently challenged Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who performed the singer on November 26 at the Monceau Park International Clinic in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
The Los Angeles surgeons said they were outraged, said Mr. Camus.
I have heard of a possible future judicial process, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus felt that Johnny Hallyday was "going too fast for Los Angeles, with the permission of the Parisian surgeon."
I had this doctor in person online who assured me that there was no problem for this trip and it had amazed me, since I had two hernia discs myself, he added.
Shortly before on RTL, he had indicated that the singer was apparently "left without drain, without anything", after his Parisian operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic world.
He had operated on actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before her death, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where he was practicing at the time.
In 2007, he also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to resorb a hematoma following cerebral haemorrhage.
But he is also a doctor with a sulphide reputation, condemned several times by the courts, in cases of medical liability, as well as for tax fraud and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, the lawyer for the Order of Physicians, accused him of being "a man without scruples" pursued "regularly" before the Council of Order, and who is "far from being recommendable".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke on Friday through his lawyer, Mr. David Koubbi.
He indicated that the intervention had "perfectly performed well" and that the post-operative examinations were "normal".
The operation "was not hemorrhagic and therefore did not require a drain," he added.
In any case, the singer's tour, whose health problems have multiplied since this summer, seems in parentheses.
Obviously, a resumption of the tour on January 8 (in Amiens, ndlr) as planned, it seems very short, said Mr. Camus.
The association UDF raises the tone and adds the New Centre to no longer use its acronym
The association UDF, controlled by the MoDem of François Bayrou, reacted Friday to the attempt of OPA of the president of the New Centre, Hervé Morin, on the acronym of the former Giscardian party, by putting in order to no longer use it on any medium, under penalty of legal proceedings.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the acronym UDF, believing that François Bayrou did not deserve to defend his political legacy after reaching out to the left.
The Minister of Defence, whose party is a partner of the UMP, had planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the NC National Council.
In support of his initiative, he received the support of MP Hervé de Charette (former N.C.U.P.) who claimed ownership of the UDF brand for being the first to file it with the National Institute of Industrial Property in 2004.
But on Friday evening, the UDF association's office, controlled by François Bayrou's friends who do not intend to let themselves be dispossessed, came out of its silence to issue a warning to the minister and the MP, adding that they would no longer use the acronym and transmit the property of the brand to them, under penalty of legal proceedings.
In the last few days, you have multiplied the statements that you are going to propose to your political movement to +resume+ the acronym UDF, writes the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the bureau, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez du MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Arthuis of the Centrist Alliance.
You also thought it good to follow on your militant material and on the guard page of your site, the name of this movement, the +New center+, the slogan + the UDF of today+, also note the signatories of the mail.
As you are not unaware, you have no right to use this acronym, explains the UDF office, which instructs the NC to remove "immediately the mention of the name of the UDF of any support as well as of (its) website".
He also asks Hervé de Charette "to transmit the property of (the) brand to its legitimate right holders".
If you did not do so, the courts would be seized to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members, warn the signatories.
In their letter, they stated that the UDF "has been a full political movement since 1978" and recalled that Mr. Morin and his friends had "made the choice" to leave him in 2007 "to create a competing movement, as others had done in 2002 to create the UMP".
The New Centre therefore has no right to use the acronym UDF (Union pour la démocratie française).
They also recall that the last congress of the UDF voted in 2007 to join MoDem for three years and the creation of an office charged with defending "material and moral interests" of the formation founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, he continues the office, "when he filed the mark", he was "no longer a member of the UDF for three years", but to the UMP.
He takes scandalously and fraudulently advantage of the absence of deposit of the acronym UDF to perform it on his behalf.
This indelicacy is becoming a crime, they denounce, before ironicizing on the strategy of the NC: "It seems to us that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make a name for oneself than to try to get out of anonymity by fraudulently taking a name to which we are not entitled".
Liliane Bettencourt case: François-Marie Banier to be tried for abuse of weakness
The court of Nanterre decided on Friday to try the artist François-Marie Banier in order to determine, if, as the daughter of billionaire Liliane Bettencourt accuses her, he took advantage of a state of weakness of the octagenaire to spoil her part of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his star photos, will be tried on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime punishable by a maximum of three years' imprisonment and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that there will be a trial in this case worthy of a saga on one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter break apart while holding the reins of the empire of cosmetics L'Oréal.
But the 15th Correctional Chamber also ordered that a medical examination by Liliane Bettencourt, aged 87, should be conducted collectively by three doctors.
L'Oréal's heir and principal shareholder has always refused to submit to such an examination, in any case not under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre Prosecutor's Office during the investigation.
The designated physicians will be required to submit a report by March 10, 2010, including whether Liliane Bettencourt may have been in a state of weakness and at what times.
I think she'll submit.
I'm going to talk to him about it, said Ms. Bettencourt's lawyer, Mr. Georges Kiejman, at the end of the hearing.
For his part, Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' lawyer, Olivier Metzner, welcomed the court's decision.
This is excellent news (...) The expertise will demonstrate that he (Mr. Banier) manipulated this elderly lady whom we must protect, he said.
For two years, Liliane Bettencourt's only daughter has filed criminal charges against François-Marie Banier, photographer and artist touch-to-all, who she accuses of taking advantage for years of her mother's weakness to obtain a billion euros in donations, in the form of cheques, life insurance contracts or master's tables.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt has always refuted being manipulated by the photographer, whom she considers to be a long-time friend.
While the court had to examine the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers' action, lawyers' pleadings sometimes turned to big family unpacking on Friday.
For example, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer reported three letters from her client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary, in which she said she was wary of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' husband.
In the 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to counsel: "Can you explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once, twice a day for fifteen years.
Françoise, I've never been able to talk to her since her wedding."
For her part, the Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office again considered that the complainant was not admissible to act, especially since a guardianship judge has refused in recent days to grant her application to initiate judicial protection proceedings for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to act in court, she is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one else has to act in his place," said the representative of the Public Prosecutor's Office, Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney.
The court finally decided that it would rule once the trial took place on the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers.
A managerial revolution or an end to economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the governance of large French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence will have been in vain...
For more than ten years, the attitude of management of large companies towards its employees has been reminiscent of the position of companies vis-à-vis consumers prior to the marketing revolution: it is a question of making employees adhere to "values" determined from above as they used to be, of imposing on consumers products designed by factory technicians.
By putting the customer at the heart of the company, the marketing revolution has put the strategies of conquering the markets in place... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products disconnected from customer preference factors comes back on a regular basis!
Demobilization of employees can lead to mortifying demoralization.
Suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the emerging part of a much more general phenomenon that affects managers in particular.
This demobilization seriously undermines the development of all the intellectual functions of the enterprise, including R&D and, more importantly, economic intelligence.
Indeed, EI "requires all stakeholders (...) a proactive approach and a forward-looking vision"; it requires employees to commit that authoritarian management revenue totally contradicts.
That is why we call for a managerial revolution that would involve putting employees at the centre of the company's concerns in the same way as the customer.
The very relative usefulness of internal opinion surveys
Will internal opinion surveys – like Orange's questionnaire to its employees – encourage this revolution in managerial practices?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
- First of all because I was able to see that, in the face of a new situation, any structure finally manages, after many detours, to do first... what it has always done.!
- Then, because authoritarianism – one of the pathologies of power – grows proportionally to the importance of its own failures.
- Finally, because most leaders have a simplistic vision of human behavior.
From the great engineering schools, they have a mechanistic interpretation of psychology.
They adopt, through intellectual comfort, the old Behaviorist theory, recently reactivated by the US "neurosciences" and widely disseminated, without their knowledge, by the institutes of studies and the media.
Thus, by suggesting that it is possible to handle the "levers" (sic) of the commitment of the executives, a recent survey by Ipsos published in Le Figaro.fr comforts the leaders in a position of mechanistic governance, unsuitable for the world today.
Identifying and measuring mobilization factors
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises presupposes adopting a finalist vision of human behavior.
It consists of incorporating, in any reasoning or practice of governance, a fundamental observation: for employees, commitment to the company is only possible if it appears clearly as a means of realizing part of their dreams, their ambitions, their projects.
Currently, only studies from the Motifunctional Analysis adopt this conception of employee motivations.
These studies have shown that they judge their company on the basis of a predetermined doxa that allows them, through their perceived image of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to carry out their life projects.
Through the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, business leaders can control, anticipate and anticipate their "social performance" and return their human resources management "to the place".
They thus create a ground for the concerted development of robust and efficient economic intelligence.
Oslo Speech: "Just War" Worth Praises Right to Obama · Global Voices
The American right wing welcomed the speech yesterday in Oslo by Barack Obama, satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, who had discussed the award for Obama on 9 October, applauded the presidential speech this time, like Sarah Palin, a former vice-president in the 2008 elections.
I liked what he said, said Mrs Palin, egery of the right wing of the Republican party, in the daily USA Today, adding that she herself had addressed the theme of war "sometimes necessary" in her memoirs that have just been published.
War is, of course, the last thing I think Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We have to stop these terrorists all over there, she said.
Obama, who inherited the two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, worked in Oslo on Thursday to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send another 30,000 soldiers to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Obama's, Newt Gingrich, felt that the president had done "very good work" in Oslo.
I found the speech to be very good, the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential statement, congratulated me.
On the other hand, I found this speech quite historic, said Mr. Gingrich, interviewed on the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former elected candidate, considered by some to be a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, said he was delighted to have seen "a left-wing president" reminding members of the Nobel Committee "that they would not be free and could not give a peace prize if the use of force did not exist".
For Michael Gerson, former pen of George W. Bush converted columnist to the Washington Post, Obama delivered "a very American speech."
In addition to presenting himself as a "citizen of the world" as "he always does," "he spoke as an American president," reminding Europeans "that they live in a security bubble that they have not created and that they do not do much to preserve it," Gerson said.
Among the few to the right not to be convinced, a Bush-era hawk, former UN ambassador John Bolton, described the speech as "terne, ampoule and without inspiration" on the National Review Online site.
To the left of the president, Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich alarmed himself that Barack Obama justified the use of force.
When we wrap the war around the notion of justice, we can easily justify the massacre of innocent people, he warned.
The centre-left press, however, remained laudable to the president.
The Los Angeles Times, while continuing to believe that the Nobel was prematurely attributed to Mr. Obama, described his speech as "superproduction" even for a speaker known for his talent.
Oslo's speech "should be used as a road map to guide international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression," the Californian daily newspaper ignited.
Obama "made the right speech," said the New York Times, judging him "both dark and edifying."
Routers: three marathons for an agreement that saves Christmas supplies
After three marathon negotiations sessions, the trade unions in the road sector and TLF, the only employers' organization to have remained until the end, reached an agreement on Friday evening that puts an end to the word of order of strike and the threat to Christmas supplies.
During the signing session on Friday evening, the Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, "rejoiced" of this agreement, after several negotiating sessions, started on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, the negotiators had left early in the morning on Friday, hoping to sign the agreement at the end of the morning.
Even if three employers' organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) had slammed the door.
But it took more than six hours for a meeting to start at 11:00 a.m. to get everyone to agree and at 6:00 p.m. the text to be signed.
The conflict "would have been very damaging to businesses" and "it was to be feared that it would disrupt the end-of-year holidays," said Mr. Bussereau.
The text provides for an increase in wages of 4% for the lowest wages (in local and regional road transport), and 2.9% for the highest (international transport).
In hourly rates, for low wages, "we increase from 8.72 euros to 9.06 euros.
It's not much, but we're going a long way, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
We're going to give orders to our militants that there be no blockades, no blockades of the supply centres.
But we can always have some recalcitrants who are not happy, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of TLF, welcomed "a good agreement", although it was "difficult to grant increases on high wages in view of international competition".
According to him, the increases will be in the order of 170 euros per month for low wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
This is the agreement of common sense and respect for employees, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed "a historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) referred to "an acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for the upgrading of travel costs by 3%, and the maintenance of general road transport in the first half of 2010, which will allow, inter alia, to address the issue of a 13th month and a modernisation of the collective agreement.
Mr Bussereau recalled that "a reduction of EUR 100 million in employer charges" was the subject of a government amendment to the 2009 draft amending financial law, voted on the night of Thursday to Friday by the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate to vote on it "in the same term".
The signing of the TLF allows the agreement to apply initially to undertakings which are members of this organisation and, secondly, to the whole profession, in the event of an extension by the Minister of Labour.
It will be "as soon as possible", said Mr. Bussereau.
Opposition by employers' organizations can only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced a "dupes market", because the EUR 100 million "had already been promised to the sector to compensate for part of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate urgently, not in conclusion of a shared analysis, but in order not to upset the turkey eaters of next Christmas, deplored the Unostra.
For the Other, the agreement "is likely to dig the grave of a very large number of SMEs in the sector in the next 12 months".
RER A: disturbances this weekend, unions dissatisfied with RATP proposals
The disruptions on the RER A, France's largest urban public transport line, will continue during the weekend, while a meeting on Friday on the 2nd day of strike between unions and RATP management left them hungry for their premium demand.
Saturday and Sunday, for this important weekend of purchases before Christmas, there will only be trains between 10:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m., due to one in two trains on the central section (between La Défense and Nation) and one in four trains outside the central section.
Interconnection with SNCF will be suspended at Nanterre Prefecture, which will force passengers to change trains.
The Galeries Lafayette, which wait for 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "RATP is making efforts to serve major stores".
The RER It crosses from the west to the Parisian agglomeration.
The RATP section runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one train in two travelled at peak hours, and almost no rowing in open hours, as expected.
Like Thursday, there was no cohue on the docks, since the Francilians organized themselves.
In the early morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less frequented than usual, in particular due to the absence of college students and high school students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), 29-year-old engineer Jack Nbakina explained that he had risen "one hour thirty earlier, to be sure to arrive on time".
Saint-Lazare railway station did not experience saturation, the SNCF indicated, which had provided for the supervision of law enforcement officers and forces.
The RER A operated by SNCF from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed from Saint-Lazare station to reach the metros.
New general strikers' meetings will be held on Saturday and Sunday, which will examine the results of a meeting with management on Friday afternoon, judged "sick" by the unions.
The Director of RERs proposes to negotiate a specific protocol for RER A on all aspects, working time, career development etc.
This is not what drivers want, who claim a premium due, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP even put its premium proposals in parentheses, the CGT was outraged, stressing that the management "was not doomed to solve a problem while in the highways and SNCF it was done".
A new meeting is scheduled on Monday for "a broader examination of the conditions for the exercise of the profession", the RATP specified.
This also made the unions say that the company "was making fun of weekend users".
In the morning, some 150 drivers had invaded a settlement committee at the Paris headquarters.
It was then that the management, which until then refused any discussion during the strike, had suggested "for the sake of appeasement" the meeting.
The conflict threatens to widen to RER B on Tuesday, after the filing of a notice by Unsa and Independents.
The unions demand a premium of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros of which 30 euros variables (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independents) and complain about the deterioration of working conditions on this line to the million daily travelers.
RER drivers, all in the second part of their careers, receive from 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross and 600 to 650 euros of premiums, for off-peak hours, Sundays and holidays.
Turkish justice dissolves pro-Kurdish party, heavy decision of consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court declared Friday the dissolution of the country's main pro-Kurdish party, a decision that was immediately followed by demonstrations of anger in the Kurdish community, in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision could greatly complicate the task of the government, which has just reached out to the Kurdish community in an attempt to end 25 years of conflict.
The Party for a Democratic Society (DTP) was dissolved as it had become a "foyer of activities prejudicial to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity", the president of the Hasim Kiliç Court told the press, after four days of deliberations.
The decision was taken unanimously by the 11 judges, while a qualified majority of seven votes was required to pronounce the dissolution, said Mr Kiliç, adding that 37 of the party's officials, including its president Ahmet Türk and MP Aysel Tugluk, were banned from political life for a period of five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Mr. Türk and Ms. Tugluk and the confiscation by the Treasury of the party's property.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 550).
Its leaders had warned before the verdict that Members would leave Parliament rather than sit as parliamentarians without a label.
The decision follows a procedure launched in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya Court of Cassation, who accuses the DTP of obeying the "directives" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), considered as a terrorist organization by Ankara and many countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
The party, however, assures that it has "no organic ties" with the PKK but refuses to qualify it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The Court's verdict comes at a time when the government has just reached out to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen its rights, to try to curb the Kurds' support for the PKK and put an end to the conflict.
The DTP leaders had claimed that a dissolution could lead to an upsurge in tensions in Southeast Anatolian, where numerous demonstrations against the conditions of PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan's detention have degenerated into clashes with the police in recent weeks.
As soon as justice was announced, a thousand demonstrators gathered in front of the DTP premises in Diyarbakir, the great city of the south-east mostly populated by Kurds.
Law enforcement forces fired tear gas grenades and used water cannons, while protesters threw Molotov cocktails or stones with slings.
Some 100 people also protested in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr Türk stated that the Justice decision would "deepen despair".
Turkey cannot solve this question (Kurd, ndlr) by banning a party, he told the press.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also deplored the decision.
We are opposed in principle to the closure of the parties.
This does not solve anything, said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
This decision is a total torpedo of the democratic openness launched by the government, political analyst Ahmet Insel commented.
One can expect, of course, a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed an attack that killed seven soldiers three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the most deadly in recent months.
The first snows can fall
What Wolfgang Brauburger wants is a very rigorous winter.
But the head of the road clearing and sandblasting service (FES) states that this is not to bother citizens.
It is simply so that agents can test the technique of vehicles and learn to master them well.
And according to the meterologists, it might be for this weekend.
More than 300 agents and 120 vehicles stand ready to attack snow and ice.
The EDF follows a very elaborate plan here.
Mr Brauburger explained that as soon as it snowed on the city of Frankfurt and temperatures fell below zero, large sandblasting vehicles covered 20 main routes (called A routes).
This includes high-traffic streets, major arteries, such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße.
Fire access, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and sloping streets such as the Atzelbergstraße are also included.
The FES officers begin their service at three o'clock in the morning.
If necessary, the 1040 km of road must be salted with a road bottom that adheres well, in up to 3 hours of time.
This is why the EDF service starts at 3 a.m. "so that the roads are cleared when the daily migration traffic begins".
That's when the snow starts falling at 7:30 in the morning.
This poses problems, says the head of the road clearing and sandblasting service "because no motorist is willing to let the salt vehicles pass".
Then, if it no longer snows, we take care of access roads and service roads - like the Rat-Beil-Straße.
The secondary roads and the side streets come last.
Mr. Brauburger is aware that this still causes some complaints.
At five o'clock in the morning, the FES pedestrian team set out to identify areas deemed dangerous and crossings as a matter of priority.
As for cycle paths, the services of the EDF are generally not able to deal with them.
Mr Brauburger said that there was a special service in Frankfurt to monitor the state of the bridges between 22 hours and 4.30 hours.
As the ice is formed very quickly on these surfaces, the salt vehicles intervene as soon as the temperature drops below 2 degrees.
The police may also use this special service when they need it.
The cradle of dinosaurs
The Tawa found resembled the other carnivorous dinosaurs: this biped was about 2 meters long by 1.50m high, its hind limbs were powerful, its elongated skull was equipped with sharp and curved teeth, its short arms ended up with faucille claws and it had a long tail.
If this species had lived a few million years later, it would have had nothing exceptional.
But, as reported by Sertling Nesbitt of the University of Texas in Austin and his colleagues in Thursday's Science magazine, the Tawa trovae is one of the first dinosaurs with these morphological characteristics.
This animal lived 215 million years ago in New Mexico, which at that time was part of the land that emerged from the supercontinent, the Panggea and was to the equator.
Sertling Nesbitt says that the discovery of the Tawa sheds light on the evolution of the first dinosaurs.
Indeed, he provides us with information on the relationship, distribution and characteristics of the latter.
It was in 2006 that Sertling Nesbitt began excavations with other paleontologists at the Gohst Ranch site north of New Mexico.
Randall Irmis of the Museum of Natural History of Utah and member of the excavation team tells that sometimes they found a dozen bones in one day, which is absolutely unique for a sedimentary layer dating from the Trias.
Scientists soon realized that some of these bones belonged to a new species.
The excavations have updated the remains of five specimens.
A discovery that confirms theories about the beginnings of dinosaur evolution.
The researchers named him Tawa according to the word of the Hopi Indians for the sun god.
For Sterling Nesbitt, this is a very exceptional discovery: dinosaur fossils from the Trias are extremely rare and are limited to a few incomplete bone fragments.
Not all paleontology experts share this enthusiasm.
For example, Martin Sander of the University of Bonn does not find this discovery to be particularly spectacular, but he points out that it can confirm certain theories regarding the beginnings of dinosaur evolution.
According to the current state of knowledge, dinosaurs appeared on Earth about 230 million years ago.
Most of the oldest fossils, however, are fragmented and incomplete, making it very difficult to classify the very first dinosaurs.
The experts wonder, among other things, at what time the Saurians divided into three major evolutionary groups: the theropods (carnivores) that include the tyrannosaurus and the velociraptor that appeared later and from which the birds, the sauropods, quadrupeds along the neck, and those related to them and the Ornithischian herbivores of which the species such as the triceratops and the stegosaurus belong.
According to studies by S. Nesbitt and his colleagues, the Tawa is one of the first theropods.
This species presents an interesting report of both primitive and developed characteristics, said S. Nesbitt.
Researchers have found evidence that Tawa found small air bags in her bones at the skull level, as did birds that are descendants of the theropods.
These small pockets of air make it easier for birds to breathe in relation to mammals.
It appears that the vertebrae were also partially filled with air in Tawa found.
According to Randall Irmis, the Tawa is one of the oldest theropods with small air bags in their bones.
As the related lineage of the huge sauropods also had air bags and a light frame, it may be thought that their common ancestor already had this beneficial innovation.
Three successive waves of migration to North America.
As the most primitive dinosaurs known to live in South America, the researchers concluded that the saurians had appeared there.
As a result, the three major lines of evolution have divided and spread from South America to the rest of the world, that is, all the lands that emerged that formed the Pangee supercontinent.
This seems to be confirmed by the fact that the team of paleontologists also discovered the remains of two other theropods that are not particularly related to it.
The three species cannot descend from a common ancestor who would have migrated, the researchers say.
Alan Turner of the Museum of Natural History in New York and co-author of Science Studies magazine said there would have been at least three waves of migration to North America.
There are, of course, some contradictions.
Martin Sander, a paleontologist in Bonn, says that there is an even older species, the silesaura, which lived in present-day Poland and belongs to a group related to dinosaurs.
According to him, this could give an erroneous view because there are many fossil dinosaurs in South America that have been preserved while there are virtually none on other continents.
On the other hand, how did dinosaurs manage to become the dominant tetrapods of the secondary era when they came from a relatively rare collateral line of the reptile branch, still remains a mystery today.
At the time of the Trias, dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of current crocodiles and with many other Saurians.
Towards the end of the Trias the dinosaurs spread throughout the planet thus promoting the development of many new species while others, who were related to them, disappeared between the Trias and the Jurassic.
Such success, however, is not eternal.
To explain this transformation, Martin Sander sees two hypotheses.
There may have been a massive extinction that dinosaurs have survived randomly while other reptiles have disappeared.
Or the dinosaurs were better suited and therefore they were able to eliminate competition on the ground.
In any case, such success is not eternal.
150 million years later, the fall of a meteorite favored the development of a group of animals that had also developed during the Trias and that since that time had been in the shadows: they were mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and there are signatories from all over the world.
There are professors from the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or Berkeley in California.
There are those in charge of courses at the University of Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The evacuation by police of the casino of the University of Frankfurt J.W. Goethe makes waves all over the planet.
278 professors and teachers from J.W. Goethe University as well as other higher education institutions in Germany, Europe and North and South America express their solidarity with the protest students of the Westend Campus.
In a statement in German and English they condemn the intervention of the police requested by the university's steering committee.
Last week, the President of Werner Müller-Estler University had the buildings occupied by students and teachers on strike evacuated after walls and works of art had been barricaded with graffiti.
Five students were injured during the evacuation.
The signatories consider that the deterioration did not justify "such a violent intervention by the police commando against students and teachers who had organized their own courses".
Evacuation is an "unacceptable breach" of freedom of research and education.
Focusing exclusively on acts of vandalism serves only to "delegitimate and criminalize protest" and attempts to make the reasons for mobilization forgotten.
The University's Steering Committee has thus subtracted itself from the discussions that would be indispensable.
Court officials require that the criminal proceedings initiated be immediately suspended.
The majority of the occupants did not take part in the degradation.
Legitimation of protests
The young people of the Verdi trade union in the services sector and the German Confederation of Trade Unions (DGB) show solidarity with the students.
Protests are only a legitimate expression of growing concern for our own future, says Alexander Klein, Regional Secretary of Youth of the Verdi Union.
The Minister of Science of the Land of Hesse Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) took the lead in the action of the President of the University and the police.
We thank the President of the University.
Any occupation and deterioration of the premises is totally unacceptable, she said in the Wiesbaden Regional Parliament last Thursday on TV Aktuelle Stunde.
We understand the meaning of the protests but do not accept vandalism, said CDU Member of the Regional Parliament Peter Beuth.
The parliamentary groups of the SPD opposition, the Greens and the Left (Die Linke) did not share this view.
The CSU takes the pretext of a few painted walls to criminalize protests, said Janine Wissler of the Left Party (Linke)
Instead of thinking about the students' arguments and claims, they are evacuated.
The Left Party has tabled a motion calling on the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on the conditions for police intervention.
The new "Silicon-valley"
For a long time she had the reputation of a secret city, forbidden to Western visitors.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was, under the Soviet regime, a place of search for secret weapons, under strict surveillance.
Today with its 216,000 inhabitants 37 km from central Moscow, the municipality has the reputation of being the Soviet Silicon Valley.
There are important production and research sites in micro- and nanoelectronics.
In September 2008, representatives of Zelenograd established links with Riedberg, a place of Frankfurt's science – with the academic institutes and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were reciprocal meetings and last Wednesday representatives of Zelenograd and Riedberg ratified a "Protocol of Close Collaboration".
The signatories were deputy mayor of Moscow Juri Rosljak and prefect Anatoly Smimov of Zelenograd for the Russian delegation, Edwin Schwarz head of project section for Frankfurt.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and SMEs, whose strength is scientific research, will leave for a seminar in Zelenograd.
Scientific exchange
This is a sustainable scientific exchange.
But also economic relations.
It will allow FIZ companies to enter the expanding Russian market.
On the other hand, Russian scientific companies want to obtain contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the seat of famous Soviet research institutes and societies.
There are the Moscow Institute of Electrotechnics, the large firms Sitronics and Rosssijskaja-Elektronika.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a "socialist city planned" for weapons research.
Zelenograd (literal translation "Green City") takes its name from the wooded hills in which the research centres are located.
Project S21: a brake for Stuttgart
The extent of the Stuttgart 21 project cannot be high enough.
For its supporters it is nothing less than "the new heart of Europe".
If you want. S21, it is much more than the burial of a railway station, more than a colossal construction project that will plunge the heart of the capital of Baden-Württemberg, into a desperate chaos of construction sites for about ten years.
Stuttgart 21 was born from the spirit of the 1980s.
The front-line stations, with tracks ending in the middle of the city, had the reputation at the time of being the relics of the 19th-century transport technique that acted as a brake on modern rail traffic because it took a long time to move the locomotives from the rear to the front.
Arrival, short stop, departure – that's what you have to do.
This is why the head-of-line stations must disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And also in Stuttgart: a train crossing station, which is located about halfway on the Trans-European Magistrale of the rail between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava, hence the slogan "heart of Europe".
The implementation of the S21 project will really begin, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality for a long time.
Even the most ambitious planners acknowledged that the cost of burying the station in the respective capitals of Hesse and Bavaria was exorbitant.
In fact, the head-of-line stations no longer really pose entry and exit problems since there are modern trains, reversible with autorails and pilot car at both ends.
However, the realization of Stuttgart 21 is now being launched next to the new route of the inter-city line towards Ulm.
Regional and communal policies have prevailed.
The railway company is on the side because it is the taxpayer who incurs the risk of the largest infrastructure project in the Federal Republic and not the public enterprise.
From the urban point of view, this project is relatively well justified.
We get an urban space that – if we believe the graphs of computer-generated planners – will be very green.
For the rail transport system the S21 is harmful.
The crossing station and the expansion of the section are designed for a traffic of people attributed - and this is typical of the 1980s - to a huge growth.
At the time there was no competition for cheap flights.
Modern traffic policy should first focus on strengthening freight traffic as rail transport is much more environmentally friendly than by truck on the road.
But the new layout, with its inclinations, is not suitable for freight trains.
The S21, and this is much more serious, concerns indirectly many other railway projects.
For example, EUR 6 billion will be swallowed up in the Souabe project.
That's the official figure.
Experts believe that ten to fifteen billion are more realistic.
One thing is certain, in the next decade this money will be missing for other points of junction and congestion in the network.
A total of 60 major projects are mentioned in the Department of Transport's list.
One of the most important is the expansion of the section across the Rhine Valley of 180 good kilometers.
Since 1987 this line has been built in slow motion.
It would be really urgent to press the fungus here thoroughly.
But the S21 project is the effect of a brake shoe.
The route of the Rhine Valley is on its way to becoming the bottleneck of international freight traffic, right in the heart of Europe.
Government reviews judgment on airport
In the Wiesbaden Regional Parliament, the Land Government referred to the possibility of appealing to the Hesse Administrative Court's judgment on the ban on night flights.
The Minister of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP) announced that the CDU/FDP coalition had tasked experts to examine the judgement of the Administrative Tribunal from a legal point of view and that it was a document containing more than 400 pages.
The Kassel Tribunal had justified in a written document that the Land should adapt the regulations concerning the ban on night flights in the event that the construction of the north-west runway at Frankfurt Airport would be carried out.
The authorisation to land 17 aircraft between 11 and 5 a.m., as envisaged by the Land Government, is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against night air pollution.
The coalition must have decided by January 4th if it wishes to make an appeal in cassation against the judgment rendered.
The opposition criticizes this delay and attempts to pressure the government representative to dismiss the appeal to the Leipzig Federal Administrative Tribunal.
The leader of the parliamentary group SPD Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel invites the CDU and the FDP to return to their promise made before the elections, which was to ban flights at night. Otherwise, it will be condemned as a total breach of a given word.
It is incredibly difficult to be allowed to keep his word, said Green Leader Tarek Al-Wazir, referring to the electoral slogan of the FDP "We keep our promises".
Minister Dieter Posch refutes Schäfer-Gümbel's claims that the Land government is still trying to allow night flights using "vocasses and rublardises".
It takes time to conduct a specific legal review.
The coalition does not want to make a decision on the basis of a "quick first impression".
The decision must be legally reliable, says Stefan Müller (FDP).
The opposition's interpretation of its fraction's statements on the ban on night flights is completely flawed.
U.S. banks repay the aid granted
The big American banks, which are heavily affected by the crisis, are defiing their ties to the state.
The Bank of America announced Wednesday that it had fully reimbursed the Consolidated Revenue Fund $45 billion (more than 30 billion Euros), corresponding to the aid granted under the Tarp rescue plan.
CNBC's U.S. television channel reported that Citigroup was also considering repaying the aid received.
Banking institutions thus seek to get rid of the restrictions imposed, which accompanied the acceptance of the sums, such as the limitation of bonuses awarded to managers and the payment of higher fees.
The Bank of Americaa launched a capital increase through the sale of securities to investors, which brought it 19 billion dollars of fresh money.
The rest of the amount comes from the bank's funds that are well filled through the sale of several branches of other sectors.
Last Wednesday evening, Kenneth Lewis, the Director General of the Bank of America, expressly thanked American taxpayers: the injection of capital has greatly helped to overcome a difficult period.
The banking institution had assumed its capabilities by buying the Merrill Lynch investment bank at the height of the financial turmoil.
The Citigroup is also planning to obtain money in the financial markets in order to free itself from state guardianship.
As a result, the U.S. bank could launch a $20 billion capital increase on Thursday, reported the CNBC channel citing the banking community.
The Citigroup spokesman did not wish to comment on this information.
By June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had repaid the public funds they had received.
Accelerated election
Finally everything happened faster than expected.
Just two weeks after the ousting of the current editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender by the Board of Directors of the German ZDF chain, the successor has already been appointed.
The committee wanted to vote last night to make the appointment.
Peter Frey, who runs the Berlin editorial of ZDF, was the big favourite.
However, the chain did not want to confirm - officially - the vote in order not to anticipate the procedure.
However, it appears that there was also a willingness not to further harm the ZDF intendant Markus Schächter in the event that the proposal would not be accepted by the Board of Directors.
Frey, who is Schächter's candidate, needed the vote of 9 out of 14 Commission members.
The result of the vote was not yet known at the close of the writing of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter had proposed to the Board of Directors to extend Nikolaus Brender's contract for five years, but this had been rejected.
Only 7 members of the Council had voted in favour of the renewal of Brender and 7 others had voted against. Brender's dismissal by vote was a serious but predictable failure for Schächter.
Indeed, the CDU, which is a majority on the Board of Directors, had already suggested several weeks before the vote, not wanting to return Brender to his position.
Roland Koch, the Minister-President of the Land of Hesse, organized a league against the editor-in-chief.
He had refused to extend the contract of the highly esteemed editor-in-chief on the grounds that the rate of listening to the ZDF's news broadcasts had dropped under Brender.
This is why protests were still taking place, almost until the vote, shattering the growing political influence on the ZDF.
In the end there were even 35 experts in public law who had interfered in the debate and who felt that Koch's way of acting was unconstitutional.
But that won't have done any good.
Peter Frey: Who is he?
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied political science, pedagogy and Roman languages (Spanish).
He then worked at Südwestfunk (Rhineland-Palatinate radio organ) and Frankfurter Rundschau (German daily national).
In 1983 he became editor in the ZDF first in the news magazine "heute-journal" (present-day newspaper).
Then his career continued: from 1988 to 1990 he was the assistant editor-in-chief of the time; then corresponding to Washington in 1991/92, then and until 1998 he was head and presenter of the "Morgenmagazines" (bimonthly news program presented in the morning); until 2001 he was responsible for the foreign policy department of the ZDF and then head of the Berlin editorial department.
After Brender's disgrace, when he had just been elected a journalist of the year by the specialized magazine Medium Magazin, the Greens announced that they would file a constitutional complaint
Koch's opponent in the Board of Directors, the Minister-President of Rhineland-Palatinate Kurt Beck, said last week that the Länder should transform the Intergovernmental Treaty of the ZDF so that the intendant's staff proposals cannot be blocked by a partial political majority.
However, Beck does not consider requesting the withdrawal of political figures from the ZDF supervisory commissions.
Peter Frey, Brender's likely successor had skilfully maneuvered with the Board of Directors by vehemently criticizing the commission in its decision to dismiss Brender.
Thanks to this proof of journalistic independence, Schächter was able to propose him for the post of editor-in-chief without losing face, just as the Board of Directors could elect him without being suspected of placing a political supporter in the post.
In the arithmetic representations of the parties, Frey is ranked liberal on the left.
Great cleaning in university studies
Partial success for the students: after a year of educational strike the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Länder decided to be more conciliatory: during a meeting between the Ministers and the delegates of the Rectors' Conference, an agreement was developed stipulating that the working conditions of the Bachelor or Master students had to be improved.
In the future, students should be able to complete their studies.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the weight of examinations: a single examination should allow the chosen study module to be closed.
In addition, the workload will need to be reconsidered to ensure "real and acceptable proportions".
Political authorities and higher education institutions wish to facilitate the recognition of examinations between universities and abroad.
The Länder have also committed themselves to organising more flexible common structural requirements for Bachelor and Master's courses.
At regional level, there must be no different regulation from one Land to another.
Less examinations
Since the beginning of the student protests last June, the Länder' education ministers and university rectors have been constantly talking about fashion: "studyability".
But for the first time, this expression seems to take on a concrete meaning.
The Accreditation Board has decided to significantly reduce the number of certain examinations: "Each module must normally be capable of being completed by a single examination", can be read in a document of about thirty pages on the future conditions of admission to university cycles.
Reinhold Grimm, Chair of the Accreditation Board, stated that by significantly reducing the burden of examinations, one should be able to stop slippages, which were significantly detrimental to studentability.
In addition, "studyability" should be the decisive criterion for the organization of studies in the future.
The modules as well as the background must be carefully examined to see if we can avoid this feeling of suffocation that is sometimes felt in the choice of courses.
Hamburg / Berlin - According to the latest RAID knowledge on Kunduz, the opposition believes that Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) is guilty of deliberate deception.
Students should "have the opportunity and the flexibility to allow and promote personal initiative".
The new regulations will cover access to new university cycles but will also be adapted to existing cycles.
These cycles must be "reaccredited" every 5 years, which means, however, that it is only in 2015 that all cycles will have been reviewed.
There are 10 competent accreditation agencies throughout the federal territory which are dependent on the accreditation boards set up by the Länder.
In October, the Ministers of Education had put some pressure on the Länder to burden the agencies so that the programmes were not too burdensome and the examination regime was not too strict.
In some Länder, universities and specialized colleges have already agreed with their regional ministries to take appropriate action.
Rhineland-Palatinate has so far been the only Land that has agreed to provide more resources for the development of the Bologna process.
With these funds, universities need to organise tutorial programmes and strengthen teaching guidance offices as well as examination offices and the International Relations Service.
The Länder and universities therefore have a budget of EUR 10 million.
In early 2010, the government wishes to table an amendment to the Higher Education Institutions Act in Parliament.
As a result, only one examination will be required to complete his studies.
The organisation of studies should be more flexible, and recognition of the transcripts of other higher education institutions should be ensured and access to the Master's degree should be simplified.
By the end of next year, the "studyability" of all academic cycles will have to be examined.
Last Thursday, the government and the opposition again debated the issue of conditions of study in the country.
Decisions were appreciated, but criticism was expressed.
The Federal President of the Union of Socialist Students said he would like the organization of educational policy no longer to take place in the future "behind the closed doors" of ministers and university rectors.
At the latest after the educational strike, students as affected persons should be able to express themselves a little.
The future graduates of higher education received the support of the President of the Delegates of the Conference of Rectors (HRK) Margret Wintermantel: "the experience of the students is very useful to us", she said Thursday in a meeting with the Ministers of Education of the Länder with whom the HRK is working on a joint reform project.
For the education and science union (GEW) the decisions made in Bonn do not go far enough. It demands the right and the possibility for each Bachelor's degree to enrol in a Master's degree.
Andreas Keller, a member of the GEW Steering Committee, also asks that the Länder ensure that today's Bachelor students will have enough places for Master's and as good a study as possible tomorrow.
The Länder must therefore hire more teachers.
On the other hand, the Ministers of Education did not mention the possibility of easing access to the Master.
More than a footnote on Herta Müller
It is with these words "Arrival in Germany and it is beautiful, almost more control..." that begins a work by the poet Werner Söllner, in which he themes in fragments of disturbing phrases, the experiences of a dissident who arrived in Germany who gained freedom but at the same time lost his linguistic territory.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, was first a professor of German and English in Bucharest and later a director of collection in a publishing house for youth before moving to Frankfurt on the Main.
Söllner received various literary awards; in 1993 he held the highly coveted chair of poetry at the Goethe University of Frankfurt and since 2002 he has been director of the Hesse literature forum at the artist's house in Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He made a lot of talk about him in non-literary circles last Tuesday, at a congress in Munich, whose theme was "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the distorting mirror of your Securiitate files".
Visibly destabilized and embarrassed, Söllner made a statement in which he acknowledged before his fellow German-Roman writers such as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer that he had collaborated as an informant for the political police Securiitate.
In 1989 Söllner received the German language award jointly with some of the participants.
The recruitment tests had begun insidiously in 1971.
I am, concludes Söllner "so someone who has not been able to resist the intimidation tests of the Security".
The poet Werner Söllner is the informant Walter (IM Walter).
Almost simultaneously with the honoring of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and his exemplary literary intertwines with the mechanisms of dictatorship power, the literary scene is shaken and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, by a case that clearly shows the abyss and the lowness of a political system, based on police surveillance and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we can tell from the current knowledge, not only guilty but also victim.
In his own file Securiitate, IM Walter played a role, says literature specialist Michael Markel after Söllner's confession and refers to the positive influence of IM Walter who had interceded in his favor.
"He had been able to pull it out of all the difficult situations at the time," Markel said.
Markel felt the moral need to make this comment.
The form in which Söllner made his statement and before this audience was unexpected, however the admission of a former dissident of his collaboration with the Romanian secret services is not in fact so surprising.
Germany is a pleasant reservation for the spies of the Securitate had already written Herta Müller in July in the newspaper "Die Zeit", after having read the 914 pages of his own dossier.
It can be assumed that the victims made speculations and sometimes guessed which real names were last hidden the names of Sorin, Voicu and Walter borrowings.
In contrast to Germany, where in the meantime the consultation of Stasi's files is a reliable process, the attitude towards the legacy of the Security files is still very confusing.
Systematic clarification has been constantly thwarted and impeded in past years.
It was only in 1999 that a national council corresponding to the Birthler institution was created to work on the assimilation of the archives of the Securité (CNSAS) but the return of the files has been delayed since then.
Since 2005, there has been a law that defines the management of archives.
That the influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still very great, is confirmed by the interview of a former head of the Securitate of Temesvar who, after the announcement of the award of the Nobel Prize to Herta Müller, expressed himself in a very disdainful manner towards the laureate.
She had a psychosis, and in the end she had only been questioned once.
The infamy of power thought it could express itself here, without any gene, under the cover of freedom of expression.
Of course, many inescapable questions are associated with the Söllner case as it happens so often in a context of hidden guilt.
Why now? Who has been stripped? The weighted reaction of the listeners, to Söllner's admission, leave hope that the continuation of this chapter will be defined more by a thirst for knowledge than by accusations and a feeling of shame.
On the genesis of Herta Müller's work, which received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Tumults at the Champions League
It was felt that a representative arrived there, shot at four pins coming straight from a nice Christmas party, on which the sports goods manufacturer had spread his goods when the new coach VFB Christian Gross climbed at midnight minus a quarter in a class C Mercedes, which he had just called, an orange plastic bag from the supplier by hand.
The man, whose bald skull attracted attention, let himself be led into the city that was still foreign to him.
Otherwise our five-year-old could have taken the wheel himself – he had not drunk alcohol nor was he drunk of happiness.
He had a nice evening, but tomorrow we had to get back to work.
'Cause now it's gonna start.
The words of Switzerland that we had just hired three days earlier were clear: "We have achieved the eighth final well", i.e. in the Champions League thanks to our 3:1 against Unirea Urziceni of Romania" but we must not let ourselves be blinded by success. It will be a brutal fight not to fall back."
The "big job" is waiting for us on Sunday.
Here, it is a matter of repeating in Mainz the results of the league of champions on a daily basis.
And we will have to overcome the weaknesses that have resurfaced after the three goals of Marica (5.), Träsch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11.)
Drawing of lots
The eighth final of the Champions League (match go 16./17. + 23./24 February/ match back 9./10. + 16./17. March) will be drawn by lot on December 18 in Nyon.
The joy of Babbel's successor's entry into fulminant function was therefore moderate.
And the joy was not moderate only in the one who had brought luck, who had passed on to destabilized Stuttgart professionals, a flawless motivation and the pleasure of playing.
I went to the players and I told them that they had to focus on their strengths, I advised them to be more courageous, explained the "leader of souls" – Gross – the recipe of success that sounded so good but that it no longer had effects with the healer Babbel.
He sparked a certain magic, admitted Jens Lehmann, a supporter of Babbel, "in football when there is a new impulse there sometimes happens things that would never have been thought possible".
And Sami Khedira, who, after weeks of pause for injury, advanced to the rank of the best player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the "prophecy" observed by a proverbial "fresh wind" and the working method of the new leader: "It is someone who goes to action and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation."
But apparently Babbel missed it.
The VfB Stuttgart has not yet crossed the line, warns manager Horst Heldt
For the time being, VfB Stuttgart needs more tenacity.
Just like Gross, the players and the manager keep on overestimating the victory against a totally outdated and weakened defense of Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow before having had four days later a bad awakening in Leverkusen with the 0:4 , objecta Khedira.
Horst Heldt, the manager, pointed out that they had achieved one of the goals of the season but that there were others that were still far away.
We haven't crossed the road yet.
That Heldt on his 40th birthday doesn't have the heart to party, even after the first home win in three months, is due to the events of the weekend that a television interview with goaltender Jens Lehmann bounced just before the start of the game.
There are decisions that others make and not Jens, would thwart Heldt, in response to Lehmann's bitter criticism.
He had accused the leadership of weakness of style and said that she had decided to change coach under pressure from puberty fans.
Lehmann had also judged as a sign of lack of sovereignty and jealousy that his day off after the games had been abolished.
Lehmann's statements were "marked by pure selfishness," Heldt said and announced consequences for the goaltender.
They no longer risked becoming friends for life these two quadragenaries.
In any case, they were in agreement with everything else, that is, without the group's previous work by the replaced coach, the strong sporting and combative representation would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants were "for the most part in success" retorted Heldt and Lehmann in chorus – and even the man with the plastic bag acquiesça.
World Heavyweight Championship
Warm fight in Bern: Kevin Johnson the challenger constantly verbally and gesturally provoked the world champion Vitali Klitschko.
But after twelve difficult rounds the Ukrainian defended his title as world heavyweight champion according to the version of the WBC federation.
With the unanimous support of the judges, he made the points necessary.
Hamburg – Vitali Klitschko retains his title as World Heavyweight Champion.
The WBC Federation announced that on Saturday night the 38-year-old champion had won a victory in points against the U.S. judge Kevin Johnson (120:10).
For the third time Klitschko has been defending his title with honor since his comeback on stage in October 2008.
Previously the Ukrainian had already won twice the title of World Champion of the WBO and WBC federations.
Unfortunately he didn't succeed in the long-awaited KO.
Klitschko, 39 times winner in 41 professional battles, had to confess twice his defeat because of injuries.
Challenger Johnson must have accepted his first defeat in the 24th battle.
In the Berne Arena, in front of 17,000 spectators, the great Klitschko mainly wanted to dictate the fight, from the top of his 2.02 meters, on his left.
Johnson, eleven centimetres smaller than before the duel, had announced the end of the Klitschko era, managed to avoid the champion's blows, thus preventing Klitschko from bringing into play his dangerous right-wing.
Johnson, too passive in action for a challenger, mostly tried to pass the rounds.
Although he continued to provoke Klitschko in words and gestures his blows only rarely reached the champion.
He is still the second boxer after Timo Hoffman in the year 2000, having crossed with Klitschko the distance of the twelve rounds.
The challenger had made a lot of noise in the Swiss capital before the fight.
He insulted Klitschko calling him a "bad zombie" who "is not really capable".
During the weigh on Friday, the champion could not help provoking Johnson by dropping his sunglasses from his nose "to see his eyes."
Fourth victory since the comeback of Klitschko.
Klitschko won again in his fourth fight since his comeback on 11 October 2008
After a break of almost four years, he had then beaten the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered "his" WBC belt which he had previously given up without a fight.
This year, defending his title as champion, he won the fight against Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and in September against Chris Arreola of the USA.
"I just took a hit in this fight and I'm in perfect shape," Klitschko said to explain his quick return to the ring.
Its aim is to try to bring together the four most important titles in the family.
His brother Wladimir is the champion of the WBO and IBF federations.
But it is the British David Haye who, having dethroned the great Nikolai Walujew - 2,13 meters - in November, wears the WBA belt.
This summer, Haye cancelled a match against Vitali Klitschko which was scheduled to take place in September.
It would appear that his promotional company is considering playing this game now at Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz case
Frontal attack of the opposition: the leader of the Green parliamentary group, Jürgen Trittin, accused the Minister of Defence Guttenberg of lying in the Kunduz case.
The SPD and La Gauche parties (Die Linke) ask the Chancellor for an explanation.
Hamburg/Berlin - After reviewing the latest information on Kunduz's air attack, the opposition accused Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) of deliberately concealing certain facts.
The Minister intentionally "formulated a contradiction" on the murderous hit of two tankers last September, said the leader of the Greens parliamentary group, Jürgen Trittin, Saturday during the news broadcast of the ARD chain "Tagesschau" (the 20h newspaper).
Clearly, that means he lied.
The order to kill was given in complete disregard of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is, in essence, the content of the report before NATO, which was read by Mr Guttenberg, Trittin said.
Last Friday, according to new media reports, the aim of the attack was in fact to destroy the stolen trucks, not to destroy the stolen trucks, but to eliminate two important Taliban leaders.
According to the NATO investigation report, 142 people had been killed or injured during the American air strike launched at the request of German Colonel Goerg Klein, military commander of Kunduz.
The Greens, the SPD and the Left called on Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to take a decision as soon as possible before the Federal Parliament and to reveal what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Jürgen Trittin and his Green Party colleague Renate Künast are of the view that Mrs Merkel must make it clear whether the targeted massacre strategy is part of the Afghan Federal Government's policy if the chancellery, army and intelligence have approved this new strategy.
The Government spokesman categorically rejects these criticisms.
Chancery has not in any way influenced the army's interventions in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, there were increasing voices expressing doubts about the real reasons for the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert, as presented by the Ministry.
According to information from the newspaper SPIEGEL, the information they had provided to Guttenberg regarding the attack on tankers was both correct and complete.
Officially, they would have concealed the existence of NATO's report and hidden some embarrassing details from the Minister.
The two high-ranking officials, however, suggested that they had informed the Ministry of Defence of several reports, including a two-page document by Colonel Klein and a report by the military police.
The "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung" reports that Wichert had meanwhile asked in a letter for clarification of the facts.
So far, he has not received a reply.
On Saturday, the Department did not wish to comment on these allegations and referred them to the federal Parliament's commission of inquiry, which was to be set up the following Wednesday to shed light on the facts in question.
The Worlds of Dream
Some see, all awake, images and hear voices that no one else sees or hears.
It is not only in the mentally ill, or under the influence of drugs, that the limits between imagination and reality are confused.
As long as these phenomena manifest during sleep, everything is fine.
When we lie in our darkened rooms, we can give ourselves unhindered to the craziest dreams and fantasies.
However, one who, awakened, experiences a dream state, hears and sees things that others do not perceive, quickly has the reputation in our Western world of being crazy or drugged, or at least of being an original.
Such images and voices do not appear only in the mentally ill or under the influence of the drug.
It is our imagination that is at stake: it is the same neuronal activity that allows us to design houses, paint paintings or write novels, but which sometimes encourages the limits between dream, madness and reality to merge.
A conscious waking state, taking the form of a dream, can present itself in the most diverse forms, in the best of cases it is called visions, at the worst of madness.
But even if the trigger and effect are distinguished, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiments of the prophet of the New Age Carlos Castaneda, the second states of the shamans, psychosis and hallucinations are due to very similar processes.
There are hallucinations or delusions when the balance, neurotransmitting substances of the brain - in the first place dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and achetylcholine - break and the interaction between the different parts of the brain is disturbed.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts occur very often during schizophrenic psychosis.
The Earth's attraction force no longer has power over the person.
Since antiquity, philosophers and doctors have always looked at the relationship between madness and dream.
For Aristotle, hallucinations were a form of dream-awakened; Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, observed in 1861 "a great resemblance between madness and dream", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis with all the irregularities, imaginations, delusions and sensory illusions that compose it".
It's autumn 2001 when Henning T turns into a cartoon character.
His body is in two dimensions with creative colors.
The Earth's attraction no longer has power over it, it glides at the top of the ceiling.
He's feeling a blow.
Behind him creatures of devil winged, grinning, bloody mouth, showing teeth.
They chase him, kick him with heavy flamboyant boots, throw him against the walls, he feels pain throughout the body.
Tonic voices, mean, scream, coming out of the walls and the radio.
He can no longer stand those voices that insult and humiliate him.
Henning T. pulls two cables out of his stereo chain, making it a loop and attaching it to a hook attached to the ceiling.
He climbs on a baffle and runs the loop around his neck.
He jumps.
The loop breaks.
Let this be a lesson to you, cry out the voices in a choir to rip out his eardrum. "Go to a clinic and get treated!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychosis, the last of two years, the first of nearly 20 years.
It was triggered by the LSD.
The diagnosis: schizo-affective psychosis, paranoid, besides it is manic-depressive, it takes medicines against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He's learned to live with his illness, he's been married for three years.
During the psychosis I experienced terrible fears and deep despair.
Illusions are a cruel reality.
Approximately one percent of the population suffers at least once in their life of schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics this is the most common disease after depression.
In a schizophrenic crisis, the people concerned can no longer make the difference between the inner world and the outer world, they find themselves in a state of hyper excitation, which causes them to suffer from hallucinations, megalomania, relational madness or persecution.
It is very common to hear voices – voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are not uncommon either.
The person concerned can no longer distinguish between the important and the insignificant, the brain can no longer filter the disruptive signals, the conscious is drowned under the sensations.
Just like the dream, psychosis opens the locks to a tide of ideas and fantasies emanating from the deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is centered on the subject, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the psychiatry department of the Heidelberg CHU (Allgemeine Psychiatry im Universitätsklinikum).
The schizophrenic is in the center of the situation, all with a meaning centered on it.
At the same time he finds himself in a passive role, he is like a dream, overcome by events and cannot act on them actively.
That is why schizophrenia often feels threatened, controlled, manipulated.
In general they do not have the possibility to adjust reality, illusions are a cruel reality, waking up is excluded.
Experience once in his life a hallucination.
Unlike the dream, according to Fuchs, "the sensory and spatial structure of reality that is perceived during psychosis is fundamentally preserved".
Delirious thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, alienation of the experience takes place in a real setting.
Why does our brain do that kind of cabrioles, it's always a puzzle for researchers.
Exceptional situations can cause everyone to lose momentarily the perception of reality, according to Fuchs.
But only a small number of people will develop psychosis.
There appears to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only determining factors.
The researchers assume that the individuals involved have minimal brain damage.
It is assumed that neuronal maturation of the brain is disturbed at an early stage of development, e.g. by viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
But what remains unexplained is the way in which the anomaly of the neuronal system occurs and, in addition, the fact that it does not manifest itself for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role – stress or traumatic experience can be a trigger for psychosis, if there is a predisposition.
Also hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis as they act on neurotransmitters.
When our brains heat up.
What is crazy, says Lübeck's professor of psychology Erich Kasten, is that psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and take expensive drugs to get rid of while others buy expensive drugs to get them.
The pleasant or unpleasant perception of illusions is often just a matter of point of view.
For ten years, Kasten has been collecting reports on hallucinations and illusory image phenomena: last year he published his results in a book entitled "The Unreal World in Our Head".
Hallucinations are well part of the concomitant phenomena typical of psychosis but also of an impressive number of other pathologies.
These include mental disorders such as borderline or depression, but also migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, or head trauma.
It is surprising that under certain conditions even the brain of healthy people is subject to hallucinations.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of fragments of memories that are normally inhibited.
They take shape when the areas of the brain that treat sensory perceptions, are hyperactive or not sufficiently restrained; when our brain warms up but also when there is no stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this condition as well as brain injury or psychosis.
But also the lack of stimuli, stress, sorrows of love or other exceptional mental states.
In recent studies, one third of participants acknowledged having experienced hallucinations at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005 Sarah K. was 16, she lived in a small town in Mecklenburg-Pomerania before and went to high school.
A young girl who's making it all normal to tell you the truth.
If there weren't the pictures and the voices.
During recreation, a young boy, thin, with long brown hair, sometimes speaks to him.
When she answers her comrades look at her, surprised – no one else sees or hears this boy.
They think this shy girl is a lunatic dreamer, but Sarah K doesn't dream, she's sure.
She is awake, hears and sees this boy just as she sees and hears the girl sitting next to her on the bench.
She can even perceive his presence momentarily.
It's a nice feeling, she finds this young man nice.
Am I crazy, she sometimes asks.
But she knows that this young man and the other visions are not real and that they will disappear again.
At night the apparitions are, in general, frightening.
Often the visions are heavy.
When she is in class, she may not be able to take the course because the teacher is just presenting a new student in her eyes and ears while he is invisible to others and the teacher is obviously explaining equations in the picture.
At night the apparitions are, in general, frightening.
When, in the darkness of her room, she waits for the sleep that comes too rarely and too late, she can often not make the distinction if she is awake or dream already, if the images she sees, the grinning faces or the girl with bloody cuts on her arms and legs are in front of her eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, she cries out to these creatures.
She doesn't talk to her parents or friends, they'd think she was crazy.
Fall 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
She graduated last year and lives with her friend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Since she's been online with psychologist Kasten, she knows very well that she's not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art of despair.
When someone is socially isolated or does not have enough stimulation, the likelihood is high that they will have hallucinations after some time.
I guess the brain isn't busy enough, so there's animation.
Sarah K., the only girl, was afraid of other children when she was little and often played alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at the age of 13, that the man she called Dad, since she was of thinking age, was not her real father.
These are the same brain zones that are active for visual and acoustic hallucinations, and for real impressions and noises, it is therefore very difficult for people like Sarah K to make the difference between illusion and reality. "Every experience," according to Kasten "takes place in the brain, reality is formed from there.
Hallucinations are also images that form in the brain, which is why they seem so real."
For Kasten, night dreams are also a form of hallucination.
Hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally distinct from those of acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenia, the mentally healthy person is able to recognize that fantasies are not real images.
That's why Kasten advises his patients to cherish hallucinations as a particular talent.
There's only one step between dream and hallucination.
In our world too focused on consciousness, unfortunately, we tend to take imaginary experiences for pathologies, according to Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and chief physician at the Psychiatry and Psychotherapy Clinic at Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
Psychosis is a serious, painful disease but also contains something positive, creative - madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard studied the so-called oniroid experience form, a particular form of dream-awakened consciousness modification.
Oniroid experiences are very complex semi-dreams that are perceived as real by the one who lives them and that it cannot differentiate from dream even when it is awake.
The oniroid state of consciousness occurs during trauma or in situations of extreme diseases as for patients with fully conscious polyradiculopathy, experience motor paralysis.
According to Schmidt-Degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of self and the world, due to a total and lasting inability to move, he replaces this real situation that affects his life, with his own imaginary world that is dissociated from reality.
It's a state of mind between dream and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a change of world takes place but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
It is, in fact, an intense form of means and interpretation, in an intolerable situation in itself, an organizational capacity that is given to us, men, not to sink into the void of the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real even later in memories.
Zurich's Peter Cornelius Classen, an art historian, also describes his oniroid experiences in his book "Changing the Heart" as an action to save the soul.
He is 49 years old, when his conscious is leaving for a trip several days after the operation of a heart valve followed by a transplant; during this time, his body is condemned to remain motionless in resuscitation.
Claussen dives into a world he created from every room, visits foreign places, travels through time . He sees himself as an old man tied up in a railway sanatorium, a robot at his bedside looking after his health.
He lives in the middle ages among nobles who make blood-based narcotics.
He is kidnapped by a Greek on a motorcycle who takes him to his country, surfs with his hospital bed in the snowshoe of the Alps and meets a Korean mobster.
He absorbs himself completely into this imaginary world, everything is real even later in his memories.
According to Claussen, these inner journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
The dream is a completely different state, he writes describing what he has experienced.
Unlike dreams, memories from mental travel are extremely clear and very detailed even years later.
It can even be said that they are much more distinct and more intense than actual experience.
The intensity of this experience breaks the horizon of our other daily experiences, according to psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
In short, the oniroid delusions, psychosis, hallucinations and psychedelic experiences show us how fragile our inner representations of external reality are even in a state of alertness.
Any change in the state of consciousness, summarizes psychologist Kasten "can cause a distortion of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be quite enriching.
The first snows can fall
Thickness
At the age of 27, the children will take over the publishing house.
Kallen's appointment as CEO of the Burda editions is an intermediate solution: in the longer term, Hubert Burda wants his two children to take over the press group, he told Spiegel newspaper.
The holding must remain 100% a family business.
Hamburg - In the long term, the publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children
The two children will inherit at the age of 27 and are determined to integrate the society, said Hubert Burda, 69, at Spiegel.
All the details have been settled in advance.
The question of whether they will be active in the company will arise later.
It will also be necessary to see if they are able to do so.
You can't impose your children on 7,500 employees without knowing if they have the capacity to handle them.
It would tear down children as well as the business.
Burda had announced last Thursday that he was retiring from the post of President-Director-General as early as January and that his successor was Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, 52, has been a member of the Board of Directors since 1999.
He was primarily responsible for the technology sector.
Later he took care of the Treasury sector, i.e. he was responsible for the company's capital and after Jürgen Todenhöfer left he also took the lead in marketing, foreign sector, printing and finance.
So for the first time it is not a family member who leads the Burda editions.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 respectively, his son Felix, who is now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
Kallen's appointment is also used to link the next 10 or 15 years"
Burda states that the holding must remain 100% in the hands of the family.
The ruins have always taken place in the families that have been led by a bulimia of capital, who have made enormous unfortunate speculations thinking that they could climb ever higher.
That was never my strategy.
I've never had a dream of universal power, Burda said.
I absolutely don't see myself as the country's preceptor as Springer could be, and I don't intend to be part of these international leagues like Time, these companies have become much too important.
Integral Beauty
Everything you can desire, in terms of beauty and well-being, at your fingertips.
This is the objective that seems to have been set by El Corte Inglés, which has just inaugurated in the shopping centre of Callao (Madrid), a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2, dedicated to the care and attention of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, houses prestigious signs such as Hedonai, specialist in laser hair removal, Spaxion, with its relaxation rooms and aesthetic treatments, Luis & Tachi, hairdressers, Marina d'Or, which has a gym, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a feeding radius, with in particular a tea room, which offers more than 130 different kinds.
Spaxion offers you, among other things, to enjoy a relaxing massage with your companion, while contemplating the exceptional views of the capital, or to rent for two hours the relaxation area in order to organize your own "Beauty Party" with eight of your friends and to relax thanks to a Jacuzzi session, massages while drinking a cup of champagne.
In total, 250 m2 are divided into 12 rooms, where one can benefit from the most innovative facial, body and hydrotherapy treatments.
Like, for example, cavitation to fight cellulite or vibrating platforms.
The gym also has these devices, as well as virtual "trainers" that guide the steps of the customers, offering them a fully personalized treatment.
It all starts with the introduction of your personal code on a touch screen, located in front of the device.
Several videos then show us how to perform our exercise program properly.
Its director assures that 15 minutes (heating and stretching included) are enough to make all the muscles of the body work.
And if, after having made our body work, we want to go through the hair salon, the sign Luis & Tachi has a room where we propose rituals of hair repair, brightness or nutrition, all personalized.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the slogans of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m.
Miscellaneous décolletés
Christmas approaches and it is never superfluous to study the look of the stars to adapt it to our party wardrobe.
The shape of the neckline, which is very important to highlight the silhouette, is one of the variables that we need to take into account.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose an exaggerated and very complicated neckline. This is not very advisable.
Endesa and Barcelona, equip the electric car
The electric company Endesa, in collaboration with the Barcelona City Council, created the "Office LIVE".
It is a project aimed at developing and promoting the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The "Office LIVE" (Logistics for the Implementation of the Electric Vehicle) will define and coordinate the road map for the installation of the electric car in the city and will put in place mobility agreements, taking steps, coordinating, presenting subsidies, etc.
In addition, it will develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, collect opinion and work from the sectors involved.
In the end, the idea is to launch what will become the transport of the future.
3 "electric cities"
But Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the installation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville join the project.
These are the three cities chosen by the government, as part of the MOVEL Plan, to launch the installation of the electric car.
The electric company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat of Catalonia.
Its objective is to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These include energy-related activities, in particular energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative Endesa is taking in the promotion of the electric car.
The company participates in standardisation groups at European level and has a set of complementary projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE under way.
Zapatero sees "a future of tranquillity" for the engine sector
The president of the government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, foresees "a future of tranquillity" for the Spanish automotive industry, which, he recalled, is the main export sector of the country.
During the presentation of the Economic Report of the President of the Government for 2009, Zapatero recalled the measures launched by the executive during the year to support the automotive sector.
"Without a Competitiveness Plan for the automotive sector, we would now have a landscape of abandonment, closure of some of our main production sites," said the President of the Government.
"With this plan and the decision of the brands to stay in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can envisage a future of tranquillity for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector," he added.
In this sense, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Integrated Plan for the Automobile Sector (IAP), has allocated 800 million euros to projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which have mobilised an investment of more than 3,000 million euros.
The Chief Executive explained that this investment was intended both for the development of new models and for the modernization of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also focused on government demand support measures, alluding to Plan 2000E, implemented in collaboration with autonomous communities and automobile companies.
According to the President, this plan reduced the average emissions of new vehicles marketed on the Spanish market by 6 per cent and contributed to a "strong increase" in registrations, which increased by "40 per cent" in November.
20 000 m2 of collectible cars
Madrid hosts the first edition of the International Exhibition of collectible cars, a meeting space for professionals and enthusiasts of the motor world.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 at the Crystal Pavilion of the Casa de Campo in Madrid.
It is an exhibition area of 20,000 m2, where more than 200 national and international exhibitors will be present.
Not only can motorcycles and collectible cars be found there, but ClassicAuto Madrid also has articles of any kind related to the world of the engine.
Thus, in the pavilion exhibitors, we can find accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, accessories, magazines, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of articles related to the world of the collection engine that will make collectors and curious happy.
Among the participating companies we will find, among others, Classicos de Mos and Good Old Times, specialists in the sale of cars, Juan Lumberas, restoration, Coupe-Francisco Pueche, sale and restoration of cars, or Cochera Classicos, specialist of Mercedes Benz.
Exterior proficiency test
But the commercial activity of this fair will also include parallel activities: gatherings, sports exhibitions, aptitude tests, presentations and competitions.
Fitness tests with automobiles and motorcycles will also be carried out on a circuit set up outside the exhibition park.
Mazda3 i-Stop : A sustainable sports spirit
Mazda intends to prove that the sports spirit is not angry with respect for the environment.
For this purpose, it has just integrated on the Mazda3 the engine stop and start system, called i-Stop, a device that, at least for the moment, is only available on the 150 horse gasoline 2.0 engine.
This second generation of Mazda3 is illustrated by the good score it has achieved as a whole.
Details, vehicle finish, habitability, behavior, mechanics, i-Stop system...
All these aspects are remarkable on the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driving station, it turns out that the front seats have excellent ergonomics and fastening.
The touch of the steering wheel is also particularly pleasant.
Continuing with the set formed by the control panel and the console, we see how Mazda continued in the Japanese trend to create a futuristic interior design, with many buttons and controls, as well as bright colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, of the Honda Civic style.
That is why we can say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products, and in particular with the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to overcome.
Continuing with the passenger compartment, this compact Japanese car has more than enough habitability to allow four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
Added to all this is a large chest with regular shapes.
The automatic engine shutdown and start-up system, at least for the moment, is only available on the two-litre and 150-horse petrol engine and with manual six-speed change.
This engine is a real happiness. It is illustrated by its fineness, its low noise, its performance and the control of its consumption.
Indeed, although the most requested Mazda3 are diesel models, those that do not perform a large number of kilometres per year should not exclude this i-Stop with gasoline engine, both for its high speed comfort and for its controlled consumption.
Regarding the level of equipment, the model chosen for the test is the Sportive, i.e. the one with the largest number of serial elements.
Among the standard equipment, the Track Change Assistant (RVM) that removes the dead angle, traction and stability controls, the speed regulator, the photosensitive interior mirror, the on-board computer on a large screen, parking sensors, independent air conditioning, rain and light sensor, bluetooth and audio bluetooth, as well as 17-inch alignment wheels, are particularly remarkable.
Moreover, as if this equipment were not enough, this version had the Premium Pack which, for an additional 1,500 euros, includes, among other elements, bi-xenon adaptable headlights and a BOSE audio system with disk charger.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its category.
In particular, it is illustrated by the quality of the materials used, their behaviour and their high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not make many kilometres a year will be able to opt for the i-Stop version associated only with the 150 horse gasoline 2.0 engine.
The only drawback of this model is its high price, which is between 21 770 euros for the Luxury finish and 23 270 euros for the model tested, the Sportive.
In return for this significant amount, the Mazda3 will offer us a great deal of satisfaction every day.
Luxury "First"
L.A. covers the red carpet of sensuality embodied by Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars have more than ever dazzled us, dressed in models as elegant as sexy for the exit of Nine. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", as sophisticated as usual, had opted for a dark "lady".
FonPeek's Promise
Peek is extremely limited, it is a device that only allows to look at its email, without offering the possibility even to see certain types of attachments or to browse the Internet.
He took advantage of his five minutes of glory in the United States, when Time magazine designated him as one of the products of the year.
In truth, it is harder to see it on the street, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike Smartphones, Peek offers a very low price and monthly subscription, less than half of what it costs, for example, the iPhone's subscription dates.
Given its success, the company has launched two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free data service for life, six times more expensive than the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the Web event, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
He is just as limited as his American grandfather, but has a surprise.
The price of its monthly subscription, about 12 euros, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a Smartphone already know what it means to give up data when crossing a border or desperately look for a cafeteria on the Wifi (or a Fon connection) to view their mail.
The idea of a fixed price roaming is incredibly attractive and it should have worked for a long time.
Indeed, some operators have special arrangements and travel options, but as far as I am concerned, I would need to have made a thesis in physics to understand them and good glasses to read the small characters.
The repeated reminders of the European Commission to propose affordable roaming rates throughout Europe have had a barely noticeable effect.
Outside his country of origin, we hesitate to use the data, and we are not wrong.
That a small device like the FonPeek (it is always curious that it is called Fon when it does not have the Wifi) offers these types of rates, means that operators start to think differently and study different proposals allowing them to make their data network profitable.
Kindle is another good example, it includes downloading books and other searches on the Internet.
No subscription and no galley.
It is a connected device and you pay when you buy it and not every month.
And that's what I hope to see one day for the FonPeek: a purchase option with access to life as Peek already proposes in the United States.
Not that I want to buy it.
I'm looking at my mail on my phone, thank you.
I simply wish it because I believe it is a more just formula for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer presenting the same system.
Michelle's favourite color
Yellow is probably the favourite color of the first lady in the United States.
If she went to the office of Barack Obama as president of the United States with a dress and a coat of that colour, she chose the same one to accompany him in the second moment, no doubt the most important of her life: the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to Oslo.
Michelle Obama wore a very similar pattern on these two occasions: in addition to their resembling colour, a yellow pulling towards the green with brilliant reflections, twice the outfit consisted of three pieces: the dress, jacket and coat, in the same fabric, and was adorned with a large embroidery or necklace.
So at first glance, it would appear that the first lady in the United States follows the trail of the Princess of Asturias and has chosen to wear the same outfits.
But the fabric in which the two sets are cut makes them very different.
If for the takeover it was a thick lace, on the other hand, she was wearing a printed velvet to Oslo.
The accessories are also different: green shoes with medium heel for the first time, and a similar model, but golden, this time.
The hairstyle also changed: the hair is now raised while she was wearing them released the previous time.
75% of working mothers have had occupational problems because of their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women of young generations who want to be mothers.
This is revealed by the study "Fecundity and professional career of women in Spain", carried out by CSIC in collaboration with the Institute of Women.
The survey of 9,737 women between the ages of 15 and 75 leaves no room for doubt: 75 per cent of working mothers have seen their professional career limited because of maternity.
The study indicates that there are many differences regarding the beginning of life in a couple and the number of children, whether the woman works or not and the type of employment she is employed.
Those who do not have an activity outside the home, work part-time or have an unsteady job, get married earlier, have their first pregnancy earlier, and have more children.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, push back entry into life as a couple and first pregnancy, and have fewer children.
Women between the ages of 35 and 49 with fixed employment have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after moving into a couple. This figure increases to 4.1 in those working in the public sector."These data show that women with stable employment have needed more time in their lives to achieve it, which has led them to push back the union and arrival of children.
In addition, the type of employment performed has a significant impact on motherhood, but less on the date of the beginning of common life," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that widens the gap between the age of marriage of women and their first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of training, the more they get married and have their first child late.
The difference is also maintained among women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35-49 age group, those with elementary and higher education were mothers for the first time at 25.1 and at 32.1 years on average, respectively.
"Another distinction also appears among women, depending on their level of education.
While those who have completed elementary education marry and have their first child before finding a stable job, those who have completed middle or higher education reverse this program and give priority to obtaining stable work as a prerequisite for marriage and the arrival of a child," says Delgado.
Diane Kruger's worth it too.
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its jealous list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
Starting next year, the German actress will embody the image of several brand products, singing the universal motto "Because I'm worth it."
The protagonist of Merry Christmas, one of the most elegant actresses on the international scene, joins other celebrities registered at L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spanish Penelope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter this club if selected were actresses Evangeline Lilly (Lost) and Freida Pinto (Slumdog Millionaire).
Among men, the cosmetics brand also includes luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey (Dre Grey, anatomy lessons) and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's companion in Lost).
The prices of British fashion
The British have a lot to say in the fashion world.
His greatest representatives, creators and models, yesterday and today, gathered for the annual award, which took place in London, at the Royal Court of Justice.
No one missed the appointment.
Former model Jerry Hall and her daughter, Georgia May Jagger, elected Best Model of the Year.
Manuel Vincent's Ace Poker
Manuel Vincent offers us in Poquer de aces (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) about thirty "radiographies" of writers who have gone through his literary life (and sometimes his other life).
It does not do so according to predictable and apprehended genres (biographical summary, life and work), but by looking for something similar to the ignition core of the created character.
The journey is exciting and Vincent does not spare either the scares or the illuminations.
Delicious pleasure, this book is also a moving invitation to reading and rereading.
I'll leave you with a few snapshots.
On Albert Camus: "In his pages, I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual impulse, almost physical, the one I felt without naming it: pleasure against fate, morals without guilt and innocence without any god."
On Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, an allegorical Christian, he wrote what he had in his blood, not in his head, between impotence and ignorance, with a dazzling poetic humor, devoid of meaning, like the blade of the knife that almost killed him."
On Graham Greene: "Our man was inspired by this woman of a passion that lasted thirteen years, in the flesh of which he combined the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that consisted in reaching heaven by the way of perdition."
On James Joyce: "Ulysse was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight thousand-metre peaks of universal literature, which must be climbed by the north face, on which the best mountaineers are letting go again and again."
On William Faulkner: "He was a strange guy.
From himself, he sometimes said that he was the heir to a landowner in the county and other times that he was the son of a black woman and a crocodile.
These two dreams were grand."
On Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer picked up the cry from a bridge by this Munch character to bring his echo to the bottom of the night of the twentieth century, in its literary form, and he did so in the flight of himself and invoking posterity with a violent speech to the asticots."
On Dorothy Parker: "One day she kneeled down and prayed: "God beloved, I beg you to make me stop writing like a woman."
On Joseph Conrad: "On his grave were engraved the verses of Spenser: "Sleep after effort,/ after storm port,/ rest after war,/ after life, tired death delights."
On Virginia Wolf: "In her luggage she also carried her depressions.
Her husband accepted very normally that she told her that Edward VII was spying on her among the azaleas or that the birds sang in Greek.
We have never seen a man so patient and in love with a neurosist whose literary talent was beyond madness."
On Pío Baroja: "What did Martín-Santos do but try to hide Joyce from Baroja?
What's Benet trying if it's not to get Faulkner to shoot Baroja?
What did this do if it is not to aspire to the glory of this man to serve him as a pedestal?"
A cowardly assault
Last week, my mother, who was about 70 years old, walked in our neighborhood of the city of Fuenlabrada, when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years old passed by her and our dog, a blood-mele, saved from the SPA and weighing no more than six kilos, and without saying a word, they gave her two feet that left the dog seriously injured.
Our indignation is immense because we do not see what it is fun to attack a small, defenceless animal, who was also on the leash, free of charge.
We must add to this the indignation of a lady who walked quietly and who, when she insulted these individuals, came to fear for her physical integrity, since an energumene that attacks an animal is able to do the same to a woman, a child, an old man or, ultimately, any person weaker than him.
The episode took place around 5:00 p.m., on Tuesdays as well, in a normally quiet neighborhood.
The dog's been moaning all day.
We have, of course, filed a complaint with the police station in the neighbourhood, even if we doubt that this is very useful and in order not to touch the sensitivities, we just want to make it clear that the coward killers were Spanish.
Indignity has led us to denounce this fact.
We don't understand what happens in young people so that they find it fun to abuse a defenseless animal free of charge that gives us affection, friendship and keeps us company.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and people has gone.
Michelin and Fesvial, sets for helmet wear
The Michelin tire manufacturer, in collaboration with the Spanish Road Safety Foundation (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to encourage the wearing of the helmet, mainly among the youngest motorcyclists, as indicated today by the two structures.
The aim of this initiative is to raise awareness of the importance of helmet wear, since it is the only protective element to prevent head injuries, or even death, in the event of a two-wheel accident.
Michelin indicated that this campaign was in line with her commitment to road safety, which "goes beyond the design and manufacture of ever safer products" and stated that it contributes to this goal through other educational and informative actions.
This new campaign to encourage the wearing of the helmet in two wheels, under the motto "To be or not to be", will include a first phase in which posters will be distributed in more than 500 garages of motorcycles, in order to guarantee the widest dissemination.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, because as a tyre manufacturer for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main objectives is to develop increasingly safe products.
The sale of light commercial vehicles is progressing
After almost two years, the light commercial vehicle market began to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles registered in Spain in November represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decrease, according to the figures of the employer's union of manufacturers Anfac and Ganvam, that of dealers.
However, the good news should be nuanced, since the comparison reference in November 2008 was particularly poor, with a 60% decrease from the previous year.
As a result, despite the rebound of last month, the registrations accumulated during these 11 months are 40% lower than in the previous fiscal year.
Since January, if you add all vehicles that fall into the category of light commercial vehicles (derived from passenger cars, pick-up trucks, vans, light vans and light chassis trucks) 95 853 have been sold.
The large clouds that affect their demand the most have not dissipated. Indeed, although they are also purchased by individuals, most purchases are made by small or medium-sized enterprises, which pay in almost 100% of the cases through external financing.
Thus, in addition to the restrictions involved in limiting bank loans, other factors must be added, such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the bad economic situation.
In view of this situation and the difference between passenger vehicles, the 2000E purchase aid has served little.
In addition to individuals, independents and SMEs wishing to acquire a light commercial vehicle of less than 3.5 tonnes with a level of CO2 emissions not exceeding 160 grams per kilometre can also benefit, but the number of operations speaks for itself.
Yesterday, at Ganvam, the need for the administration to pay particular attention to these vehicles and also to industrial vehicles (trucks and buses) was reiterated.
The dealership association foresees a similar year 2010 to the one that ends, for which it calculates a fall in sales (of passenger vehicles and 4x4) of 19%.
Emergency braking aid is now mandatory
As this has happened with the ABS brake anti-lock system and as it will happen with the ESP stability control, emergency braking support systems will be a mandatory element on European cars.
Moreover, they are already mandatory on passenger cars and newly registered light commercial vehicles, while for the rest of the vehicles a period of deficiency has been fixed until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to strengthen the protection of pedestrians, even though, by its mode of action, it can also help to avoid many rear shocks.
The emergency braking assistant acts by increasing the brake pressure in the event of an emergency detected by the system by the driver's kick.
But the latter does not always maintain the pressure until the end.
According to a study conducted by the manufacturer of Bosch car components, one-third of the drivers involved in an accident could not press the brake before the collision, and half of them had not taken advantage of its strength.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, in return, requires the maximum of the brake system, reducing the distance that the car needs to stop.
According to an EU study, if all cars were equipped with such elements, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be avoided each year.
This reduction would be even more important with the popularization of so-called intelligent emergency braking systems: it is estimated that one in four casualties would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that, thanks to a radar or a camera, detects obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, he/she helps by increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it does not react, and although collision is inevitable, the device exerts maximum effort on the brakes to minimize damage.
General Motors pushes Opel's plan back to January
While the workers at the Opel factory in Figueruelas (Saragossa) were warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva would be launched in the first week of April – probably on 8th – according to Javier Ortega, the North American manufacturer warned that it will need more time to conclude Opel's rescue plan.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, intends that each point of the plan has been approved in advance by the party concerned.
And this may mean that the final document, which will first be submitted to the workers and then to the governments of the countries where the factories are located, will be postponed until early 2010.
On the other hand, at GM, it is ensured that a decision on the sale of Saab should be made in the next few days.
It is therefore not surprising that the Swedish government has tightened the pressure on the US manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to being in contact with potential new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but the application of the Dutch manufacturer of Skyper sports cars, supported by the Russian group Convergence, takes on importance.
If there is no agreement with any of them, GM could sell a part of Saab to the Chinese company Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if not sold is maintained.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To design their last precious jewel, Porsche engineers left the Boxster S and managed to fine-tune it from just less than 80 kilos, leaving the balance at only 1,275 kilos.
This led them to switch, first of all, from the automatic roof which was replaced by a manual tarpaulin roof, allowing for a reduction of 21 kilos, to use aluminum doors such as those of the GT3, another 15 kilos less, to remove the air conditioner, 13 kilos, to reduce the fuel tank from 64 to 54 litres, 7 kilos of gains, to mount sports sticks, another 12 kilos, and with light tires of 19 inches, five kilos.
Finally, they gave up the CDR-30 audio system, earning six more kilograms and replacing door handles with fabric handles, saving the remaining kilo.
Although the model also exists with the dual clutch PDK box, the test was carried out on a six-speed manual box model, mainly on roads in the California secondary network, in the mountains, with particularly tortuous turns.
His behaviour can only be described as irreproachable.
Weight reduction does not prevent the car from rolling on the ground with aplomb.
On the contrary: it has been a long time since we tested such a small and lightweight model, which at the same time ensures so much safety in turns, including at high speed.
He is a small athlete, able to heat his muscles at low speed for as long as necessary, until we asked him to sprint, brake, recover and push his engine again...
This is out what we wanted. Thanks to its direction, as communicative as precise, the car will do as our hands indicate on the steering wheel.
And she'll do it with surgical precision.
Engine sound at will
The sound of its V6 boxer, with 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster S) is particularly successful and can be reinforced with the "sport" option or thanks to a system that modifies the roaring of the engine, already used on the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, either at the stop or during recovery.
The suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The road cover we traveled with the Boyxster Spyder was pretty damaged, but the car managed the hen nests well.
The electronic assistants barely made a statement of presence on the entire route, while on some turns we found ice in the early morning and gravels, later in the morning.
In short, an ultra-light, most entertaining car to drive and which is much more than just a modification of the Boxster S.
The car will be available for sale in February 2010, at a price of 70,831 euros.
"Bag Girl"
Intimate friend of Karl Lagerfeld, icon of the Coco Cocoon line and occasional starlet of the parades of the house, the singer shows her face as a bad girl with as much capacity as her Chanel bags.
More than a Bad Girl or a It Girl, it's a Bag Girl.
Baskonia Wins in Israel · Global Voices
The Caja Laboral won a triumph at 91-82 during its visit to the hard terrain of Maccabi Electra, despite the many absences suffered by Dusko Ivanovic's team. It is thus at the head of his group, after Mirza Teletovic's great show, which, with eight three-point baskets, was the best of his team (29 evaluation).
Vitoria's team has been able to fill Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov's important absences with a great deal of commitment and collective work, even though it had to wait until the end to win.
Moreover, the great skill from the perimeter, with 16 baskets with three points marked, determines largely the final victory.
The game started quickly for the blues and reds, who took advantage from the beginning.
The fact that the first four baskets of the Vitoria team were marked from the perimeter, suggested that they had jumped on Israeli ground with warm wrists.
English and Teletovic were the main artisans of the 18-20 finale of the first quarter.
The second quarter was in the same tone, but Alava's team chose Barak's inner game and Eliyahu's work, which was received with applause and applause back to his old home, to increase their advantage at the break (34-43).
Teletovic was already beginning to be noticed as the best player on his team, with 13 points scored, although the "less than six" of Splitter's assessment already suggested that tonight was not going to be the best in Brazil.
But in this game, despite the fact that they were on the right track at the break, nothing was played, far from there, and the Avala team wanted to remind the Vitoria team that they did not win so easily in their field, and thanks to "Elias' hand", they managed to enter the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to yellows taking advantage of the light (50-49).
Other difficulties
Ivanovic's players, wounded but far from being dead, needed to chain up some skillful actions to get the air, and that's when Mirza Teletovic's machine gun appeared, which, with three baskets at three consecutive points and the help of English and Ribas, returned the meter to a reassuring score (54-67), and which the premises succeeded in accentuating at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
Avala's team went out to play the whole thing during the last period, and English and San Emeterio (60-75) warned that they would not let anyone take what they deserved for the first thirty minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini y Eidson, the best in their team, did not resign and tried to support her from the line of three points (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated for mistakes, Ivanovic's players did not rush, defend well, and although the Israelis got closer in the last minute (80-85), the game was already played and the victory escaped in Tel Aviv for the first time of the season.
Injuries prevent Unicaja from delivering battle
The Unicaja lost loudly in Greece to the Olympiacos and gave him the head of the Euroliga group B, in a game marked by the absences of players from the Unicaja, especially in the internal game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malaga team was not frightened by the atmosphere of the Peace and Friendship Pavilion or by the size of the rival, probably one of the most powerful in Europe with a large budget.
The game of the first quarter, allowed the Andalusians to dream. An aggressive defense and three baskets with three consecutive points, two of the leader Omar Cook and one of Guillem Rubio who dazzled the local team 12-18, in the ninth minute.
The Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, although the arsenal of the local team with the inner game of Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, allowed to overturn the score 22-20, at the thirteenth minute, when an action, a start of fight, between the North American leaders Beverley and Williams led to the disqualification of the two players.
The Greek team began to function by showing their superiority in both camps, while the injury exit of English pivot Joel Freeland and Carlos Jiménez's three personal faults weighed on the Unicaja.
The indoor players and Lithuanian winger Linas Kleizas, with their three-point baskets, gained the 44-32 advantage in the nineteenth minute.
An Impossible Uphill
The third period was particularly offensive for the Olympiacos, who, despite the losses, proved superior and even managed to match the difference of the meeting held in Malaga 66-48, at the twenty-seventh minute, causing the group's head to swing.
The Unicaja tried to overcome the absences and the last exit of the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, injured during the meeting.
Despite all these problems, the Unicaja, thanks to its organization, Cook's three-point baskets, and Lewis' support, left some hope with 66-57, in the thirty-first minute.
But victory was virtually impossible because Olympiacos was relentless when the players pressured and showed their superiority in centimeters in the area.
The Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, managed to raise the score to 81-62, to the thirty-seventh minute, and the Unicaja submitted, accepting the victory of the Olympiacos.
How much should you be paid according to your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they would deserve according to their profile, thanks to a new application of Trovit, the search engine with the largest number of classified real estate ads, jobs and vehicles in Spain.
The "How much should you be paid?" tool calculates the salaries of users from more than 140,000 job offers available to Trovit in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where you have to register your profession, your years of experience, your age and the city where you want to work.
Since the application has been running for a week, the search engine has found that, as a rule, the Spanish worker "feels poorly paid", explained in a statement Trovit's product manager, Albert Ribera.
According to the data available to Trovità from its search engines in the United Kingdom and France, the Spanish are the least well paid.
A British computer programmer earns 45 226 euros gross per year and a French one, 31,059, while a Spanish one receives 24,000 euros.
Similarly, a driver receives 34,247 euros gross per year in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 euros gross in Spain.
According to Trovit, the lowest-paid job in Spain is that of server, with 11,592 euros net per year, followed by that of seller, with 14,725 euros, and that of worker, with 15,667 euros.
The most popular jobs on the Internet in the last three months are drivers, part-time jobs and social workers.
Brazil sets a date for Zelaya's departure
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya's stay at his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The overthrown president will have to abandon the diplomatic legation by January 27, 2010, the date of the official termination of his mandate.
Francisco Catunda, Chargé d'affaires of the Brazilian Embassy in the capital of Honduras, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows that he must leave the embassy, where he has been a refugee since 21 September, before that date.
"He is aware that he must leave on January 27, at the end of his term of office, he must look for another destination."
The channel also cited the former agent, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the end of the deadline: "My position is to leave as quickly as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by phone.
After the elections of 29 November (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian Embassy until January.
However, the same week, he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation finally failed, as Zelaya refused the condition of political exile that the de facto government presided over by Roberto Micheletti intended to impose on him.
Thank you very much.
After pink days since last spring, during which asset inflation has been the dominant mark on the markets, uncertainty again emerges, which is not surprising since it is their natural state, in an environment where agents make decisions about the uncertain future.
The remedy used by central banks to stabilise markets has been to monetise debt through the direct purchase of assets and indirectly by giving abundant liquidity at close to zero rates, so that financial institutions buy assets to be mobilised.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets have been virtually finalised and, without calling into question their non-conformist liquidity policy, they are beginning to put some sand in the machinery, as the ECB has done, with their auction one year from next week.
As a result, investors doubt the ability of the global economy to maintain an economic recovery without heterodox measures and we are witnessing a reversal in the reduction of risk premiums.
Exchange volatility and differences in corporate bonds are increasing again, although they remain very far from the paranormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to socialize private risk and public debt was again affected.
There is once again a flight to quality and the United States, Japan and Germany have been the refuges chosen by investors, causing an increase in the differences between the countries of the euro area and Germany.
Spain was barely affected by this episode of instability, but then Standard & Poor's threatened a further downward revision of the qualification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, a little uncertainty is not bad to silence the moral risk advocates, who were again trying to provoke a case of conscience among those responsible for world economic policy who had curbed the destructive effects of credit limitation on the destruction of employment, whereas what should be done is to decree a new day of Thanksgiving.
However, the situation in Dubai resembles a tribal struggle between the emirs to restore power in the Emirates and we have already seen the case of Greece.
A government that hides a public deficit, elections, and a new government that discovers the pot of roses.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It would be perfectly irrational for Ecofin to save Hungary from non-compliance with its external payments at the beginning of the year and allow a euro area member country to fail to meet its commitments.
What is logical, however, is that Ecofin has encouraged the Greek government to be transparent and makes its citizens responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we hope, we are faced with an episode of normalisation of transitional risk premiums, after a few excesses in high positions, this would be predictable.
In the Spanish case, as long as our differences in public debt increase in line with the obligations of European companies, we do not have to worry.
If the European differences were to narrow and our differences continued to increase, then it would be an idiosyncratic risk in Spain.
The Standard & Poor's case is an anecdotal. When our forecasting indicators force most of the study services to anticipate their recovery models and to revise upwards their forecasts for 2011, with in addition the OECD and the European Commission, who come back to charge with a Japanese model for the Spanish economy, it does not augur much hope for their warning.
Again, this seems to be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, even though for the moment "prudence is a mother of safety".
Connected sectors
The president of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to speak yesterday, before the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies, where the energy strategy of Spain for the next two decades is discussed these days.
After his speech, which was followed by that of the president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Mr Galán outlined for the press what he had mentioned before the sub-commission, in eight-clos.
For the President of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest EUR 50 000 million until 2020 and an additional EUR 60 000 million between that date and 2030, if the nuclear power plants currently in operation are to remain open.
If this is not the case, the necessary investments would not amount to 60 000 million but to 95 000.
On the other hand, Iberdola believes that for the next decade, investments should not be devoted to increasing production capacity, but to distribution networks and international interconnections.
Starting in 2020, the issue is changing, and the power will have to be increased.
Its focus is on both gas-fired and coal-fired power plants, with mechanisms for the recovery of carbon dioxide and, above all, on renewable energies.
In this area, it considers that an additional 18,000 MW are needed, along with other "supporting energies".
Galán, who believes that the draft Sustainable Economy Act that the government has just approved is in line with what his company is demanding, did not wish to attack the Royal Decree to encourage the consumption of national coal, which contradicts policies to combat global warming.
According to him, there is "a clear long-term bet" in this direction, despite the "timely" measures, as the president of Iberdrola has called them.
In any event, Galán believes that decisions to invest, although they are long-term, must begin to be made, as they take some time to reach maturity and a stable remunerative framework is necessary to address them.
Ferrovial wins Aer Lingus handling market in ten airports
The Swiss company Swissport, a subsidiary of Ferrovial for airport services on land, will act as a privileged partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus, for freight services, at ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important.
The agreement, whose economic terms have not been revealed, has a duration of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed yesterday a cooperation protocol to create the Centre for Intelligent Infrastructure Innovation.
The alliance expects an investment of 20 million until 2012, of which 50% will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be to conduct energy efficiency research on motorways and airports.
Acciona plays its first motorway in Australia in Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for her first concessional highway in Australia, a market in which she already works as an energy company and water manager.
The site at stake is an estimated $1,700 million Australian dollar tunnel (approximately €1,047 million).
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are its rivals.
A 5-kilometre-long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane on the East Coast is the option to allow Acciona to establish itself in the country as a public works company and highway dealership.
The city hall wishes to be able to dispose of it by the end of 2014.
After having chosen public/private collaboration (PPP for its initials in English) to complete the project, as part of a business plan under Erns & Young's supervision, the local government already has a list of finalists who will be responsible for the construction and operation of the toll.
Pending the submission of their bids in May, the planned investment amounts to 1,700 million Australian dollars (about 1,047 million euros) and in the last phase there are three consortia, with a notable presence of European manufacturers.
The group called Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company in smooth, and its associates are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of Australia's largest manufacturers, while the second, based in Italy, is one of Europe's largest underground construction specialists.
The Northern Direct consortium, with the presence of the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French manufacturer group Bouygues, was built against Aciona's team.
The third and final consortium that passed the event is LBRJV, whose capital is shared between the Australian Leighton (a subsidiary of the German manufacturer Hochtief, which in turn has the participation of ACS), another local company, Baulderstone (ownership of the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the Welsh public works company, Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises large construction sites and privatizations, but entering is a great challenge, except through the acquisition of a local construction company.
A strategy that Hochtief and Bilfinger companies have followed, already mentioned, in addition to their Asian references, and that still remains an unvalidated step for the Spanish giants in the sector.
ACS has just won a place in this market through its 30% stake in Leighton's owner Hochtief.
Millionaire assets
It has built on a geographical area of greatest importance for the sector, on which it already has a large presence through its energy supplier activity and in the desalination sector.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind farm, Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and leads the grouping of companies to build and manage Adelaide's desalinizer, with a budget of 700 million.
It now intends to consolidate these two areas and take advantage of synergies to enter the markets for infrastructure construction and management.
The underground toll road, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and the said Northern Link (northern link), is called to connect the western highway of Toowong to the peripheral road to Kelvin Grove (see map), by 4 kilometres of tunnel. It is the largest existing project to reduce traffic congestion in Brisbane.
The timetable set by the administration indicates that the tender will take place during the summer of 2010 and that work will begin in December next year.
Despite the fact that this toll road will be open to traffic by the end of 2014, it is not expected that the site will be completed before 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will consist of two lanes, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Government of Queensland will contribute 500 million Australian dollars (€308 million) for its financing.
Brisbane already offers work in Hochtief
Australia continues to make much of Hochtief, who yesterday mentioned obtaining a contract with the government valued at 154 million.
The company owned by ACS will equip, through its local subsidiary Leighton, the infrastructure of the national high-speed optical fibre network.
This will enable 400,000 people to have rapid access to the Internet and will provide work for the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company gave way to the 27-storey King George Tower construction project in Brisbane City. Construction has not yet begun and Hochtief concluded the sale for 129 million.
In the United Kingdom, specifically in Manchester, she will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and management of two school groups for 25 years.
The initial investment will be €75 million.
FCC is awarded a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC, through its subsidiary Alpine, is awarded the construction of a 2.1 km long tunnel for a motorway in Slovenia for an amount of €64.5 million.
The company obtained this contract a few days after being charged with the work of widening the tunnel of Bosruck (Austria), for a sum of 130 million.
Alpine thus consolidates its experience in the construction of tunnels.
The start of the project is planned for early 2010 and will take 32 months to complete.
Mrs. Rushmore is awarded Renfe's advertisement
Renfe has entrusted the advertising and marketing services of the next two years to the agency Sr. Rushmore, for a budget of approximately three million euros per year, has indicated the railway operator.
The contract mentions the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Ms. Rushmore was selected from 16 agencies that presented themselves to the tender organized by Renfe, of which four were finalists, including TBWA who was responsible for creativity in the last three years.
From now on, Mrs. Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
A fine of 63 million to France Télécom to curb competition
The French competition regulator imposed a fine of 63 million euros on France Télécom for its anti-competitive conduct in the Caribbean region belonging to the country.
According to this institution, the operator limited competition on fixed and mobile telephony by signing exclusive agreements, tariffs and consumer loyalty programmes outside the scope of regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state enterprise, accumulates more than 450 million euros in fines since 1994, because of the obstacles it puts to its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday was increased because the competition authority considers that France Télécom has committed similar offences in the past and is therefore recidivist.
An app shop
On the other hand, the French company's mobile telephony subsidiary followed the footsteps of other operators and opened an Internet app shop, with the aim of increasing revenues that do not come from voice transmission.
Orange's app shop will initially be active in France and the United Kingdom.
It will have to wait until 2010 for it to arrive in other countries such as Spain.
Their participation in the Champions League has returned 476.4 million to Real Madrid and Barça since its creation
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs since its inception in 1992.
Real Madrid and the F.C. Barcelona won 467.4 million, placing them in the third and fifth positions of the clubs that took the most money in this competition.
Manchester United is at the top of the list.
Manchester United is at the top of the list.
Winning the UEFA Champions League does not only bring glory, it is also one of the main sources of income for the big clubs.
Indeed, the competition allocated €5,362.5 million to the 105 teams (including 12 Spanish) who participated in the event since the creation of the tournament, during the 1992-1993 season, according to UEFA information.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona were well served during this distribution.
The white club was the third on the continent to receive the most money for its participation, and the only one, with the A.C. Milan, won the trophy three times.
The Catalan club, currently holding the title and last winner of the former European Cup in 1992, is fifth on the list.
At the top of the list are Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams which, in addition, have charged the most money for their participation in the last Champions League.
And that, although they lost to the Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country, with regard to the money reported by the Champions League, although it has won more titles than any other (five, while Italy has won four, England three and Germany two).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complex procedure for distributing the money applied by UEFA.
For this year, the organization chaired by Michel Platini plans to win 1,090 million thanks to the Champions League.
Of this amount, UEFA will devote 413.1 million to fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the classification games (including the Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received only 3.8 million to be there, in addition to 550 00 euros for each match.
There is also a bonus in the event of victory (€800,000) and equality (€400,000 for each team). Those who arrive in the eighth of the final receive three million each, the eight teams who arrive in the quarter of the final receive 3.3 million.
The last four teams will each receive $4 million.
And the champion will win 9 million, compared to the 5.2 received by the other finalist.
Thus, for fixed payments, a club will earn at least 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
On the other hand, the Barça won 2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
But in addition, there are variable payments, to which 337.8 million are allocated.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
The Spanish market is one of the most important, and has four seats.
The previous year's champion pocketes 40% of the allocated money, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other part will be paid according to the number of games played during the current year's edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% of Sos.
The Nueva Rumasa group listed yesterday the details of the stock purchase offer by which it intends to acquire a maximum of 25 to 29.9% of Sos' capital.
A percentage that does not require it to launch a public offer of acquisition (OPA) for all securities.
In practical terms, Nueva Rumasa offers €1,5025 per share, which will be disbursed in 10 years and will be paid at a rate of 1% per year for this carry-over.
Yesterday, Sos' shares ended at 1.85 euros; Nueva Rumasa's offer therefore evaluates the company 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects Sos' real valuation.
The offer is subject to the appointment of eight of the 15 advisors.
The Jerez group gives a period of 15 days for shareholders to indicate their interest in the sale of securities.
The CNMV assured that it had not been informed of this offer, although the Ruiz Mateos company stated that it had contacted the regulator.
If it were to take place, the disbursement would amount to 611.7 million, while Sos' capital is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos is continuing the restructuring of its management.
In an attempt to remain outside of possible offers of purchase and goes and comes judicial from its former directors, the brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar, she announced the election of María Luis Jordá as director of internal audit.
A decision that makes her the first woman to hold a leading position in the food business.
This is a newly created position that will depend directly on the group president.
And it is not without controversy, since the company remains submerged in the legal battle for the alleged diversion of more than 230 million Sos to Salazar companies.
Moreover, the possibility that in the coming months Sos will reveal new diversions of funds cannot be ruled out.
Regarding credit to Salazar, former advisors Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) said yesterday before the National Audience that they had been informed of the diversion of 212 million without knowing the destination.
CNMV authorizes Paternina's exclusion OPA presented by Inversora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) yesterday authorised the exclusion OPA presented by Inversora Mer on Federico Paternina on 9 October.
The supervisory body explained that it authorized this operation because it understood that its terms were in line with current standards and considered the contents of the explanatory sheet submitted to be "sufficient" as a result of the amendments applied on December 2.
The CNMV has specified that the offer concerns the acquisition of 550 008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of 7.65 euros per share, which represents 8.95 % of the share capital, consisting of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading on the exchanges of Madrid and Bilbao.
He further explained that 5,592,778 million shares had been immobilised, and that they could in no way be transferred before the finalisation of the offer, for which he indicated that the price had been fixed by Federico Paternina, in accordance with the provisions of the current standards.
New tools for car expertise
In these days of bad weather and accidents, car garages are not the only winners.
Every day, thousands of cars that have suffered a disaster are brought back to a garage, where an expert has to assess the damage suffered and the cost of the repair.
Each disaster is different, and the calculation of the cost of parts and labour time can be long and complex work.
The cost of repairing between EUR 20,000 and EUR 30,000 by hand, including parts and labour, can take two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the help of the latest computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes.
This is why almost 100% of experts use such systems.
Service providers and solutions for disaster assessment and maintenance are dedicated to collecting information provided by manufacturers, then processing and offering it to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audadx, of the North American group Solera, is the leading company; 80% of the estimates are made with its products.
The other competing companies in the field of assessment tools and the development of information on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
The work with the data provided by the manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, commercial director of Audadx, the company in Spain with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides them with information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed continues to increase, so that over the past five years more versions, variants and engines have been launched than in the previous fifteen years.
When a new car comes out of the market, these companies get to work.
This is a very difficult job, because each of the thousand parts of the vehicle must be catalogued and priced.
In addition, a "smart" graphic image of each model can be clicked on the different parts of a passenger car.
If it is a massively sold model, work can be ready within a week if the process is moving forward very quickly.
If this is a low-selling car, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audadx has complete information on 99.2% of the cars sold in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models, for example, they have information about Porsches, but not Ferraris or Lamborghinis.
For vehicles in use, the figure exceeds 99%.
To carry out the documentation and database development work, Audadx has eight centres worldwide (in Spain, France, Germany, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each of them specializes in certain brands.
The national headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than 100 technicians (generally mechanical experts) work simultaneously on three computer screens.
Audadx invests $90 million annually to develop these databases.
Every month, 2.5 million data are recorded, and customers receive updates every two days.
The development of this huge flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and to offer various products.
The most common application is repair and maintenance, but depending on the country, there are also tools for handling the parts of a car or for calculating the venal or residual value of a car.
The only company with a guide that provides information on the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audadx does not propose it in our country, but it does in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get an idea of the type of support it can provide to professionals in the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, the flagship product being AudaPlus, the standard disaster assessment solution, for experts.
These include cars, motorcycles, light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of parts, it takes into account the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the paint scales.
This tool is purchased according to its use, for each estimate.
The highest cost is 5.75 euros, for customers who use it little, a maximum of ten times a month.
Then, each insurance company, which carries out thousands of expertise, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the total identification of a vehicle and the equipment with which it came out of the assembly chain, only thanks to its chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle lenses, and AudaSubastas is an open server to the professional sector on the Internet that allows you to bid on declared wrecked vehicles.
Its statistical service is very useful for identifying trends, conducting geo-demographic analyses or knowing current problems by brand or model.
It is possible to study, for example, how many models of a given brand went to the garage for a breakdown or how many suffered serious claims for a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of such tools.
It markets, among other things, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and provides digital images, as well as access to the manufacturer's official parts, prices and times.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group, founded in 1971, as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of claims, breakdowns or car maintenance.
The GT Assessment Guide is a historical reference product on the market.
The company works with 24,000 users in garages, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its turnover has increased at a rate of 20% per year over the past three years, with a turnover of EUR 10.8 million in 2008.
At the beginning of last year, she began her process of internationalization, with the establishment of an office in Paris.
Audatex, for its part, was born in Germany in 1966 and settled in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources, 62% of its turnover is made in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America. It works with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 garages, of which 3,000 are in Spain.
The global turnover of the Solera Group (Audedx, Sidexa, Informax ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will be $557 million, 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country, the company will receive 19.1 million euros, 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was listed on the stock exchange for $1,000 million, and today its shares are valued at a total of $2,400 million.
Since 2007, it has been on the New York Stock Exchange and is part of the Standard & Poor's benchmark.
Internet auctions of crashed cars
Last October, the Solera group bought Autoonline, an Internet platform for the sale of cars, motorcycles and special vehicles.
The transaction involved a cost of €59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could be extended next year to the remaining 15%.
The objective of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of access to a huge international market.
This estimate and sales service is intended exclusively for professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, garages, caisses and professional vendors who must be registered before starting operations.
This platform was created in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, including 500,000 in Germany.
Among its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
There are currently more than 1500 vendors and 4000 registered experts on the site.
It manages 3,000 ads per day and on the Spanish market, 100 new ads are published every day.
According to Spanish law, a car whose chassis number has been removed can no longer circulate, but some parts that are not damaged can be used as spare parts.
Collection cars can be re-registered, although they have been removed, after complex steps.
Garage quote in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, Audadx ensures that the user gets a quote in just four steps: identify the vehicle, look for the spare part, create a quote and generate it.
Ease of use is an essential element of these systems, especially to convince older professionals who, to a greater or lesser extent, are reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, including 666 passenger cars, 109 all-terrains, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Naturally, to use it, a computer and an Internet connection are necessary.
Once the model to be repaired is identified with its chassis number, a real graphic image of the model in question appears and the necessary part is selected.
The user can include variables such as the price of the labor, increases or discounts, then he can print the quote to give it to the customer.
AudaWorker is not an estimation tool like AudaPlus, but a catalogue of references.
The main difference between these two systems is that the one intended for garages does not include estimated labour time.
The cost of using this tool for the garage is 350 euros per year, which can be credited.
Currently, Audatex is working to ensure that these images are in three dimensions.
This is an innovation that mechanics see with a very good eye, since it will allow, for example, to select a door and turn it around to see the inner face.
