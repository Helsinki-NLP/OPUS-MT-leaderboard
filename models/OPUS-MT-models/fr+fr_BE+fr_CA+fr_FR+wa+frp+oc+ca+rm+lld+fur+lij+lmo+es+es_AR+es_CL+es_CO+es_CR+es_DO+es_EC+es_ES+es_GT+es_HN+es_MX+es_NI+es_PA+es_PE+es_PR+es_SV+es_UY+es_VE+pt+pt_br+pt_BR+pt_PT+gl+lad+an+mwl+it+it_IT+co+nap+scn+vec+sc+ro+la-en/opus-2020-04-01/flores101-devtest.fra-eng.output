The American Gymnastics Federation supports the letter of the United States Olympic Committee and accepts the absolute need of the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the USOC (U.S. Olympic Committee) statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs, as well as their sport, could be better served. This can be done by moving forward and by making significant changes within our organization rather than by revoking accreditation.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that could shed light on how the abuse of the proportion so courageously described by Larry Nassar's survivors was able to go unnoticed for so long and adopt any necessary and appropriate change.
USA Gymnastics and USOC have the same goal: to make gymnastics, as well as other sports, as safe as possible so that athletes can pursue their dreams in a safe, positive and responsible environment.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widespread, but also provides details that fossils generally cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was brown chestnut on top and pale or carotenoid on the bottom.
This discovery also makes it possible to better understand the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers do not have a fully developed stem, which is called rachis, but do show other features specific to feathers – beards and beards – researchers have deduced that the rachis was probably an evolutionary development subsequent to these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight but rather for regulating or displaying the temperature. Researchers suggested that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows an adult plumage and not the down of a chick.
Scientists point out that this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, but the sample reveals a plumage belonging to an adult individual, not a young one.

They found that the Sun worked according to the same basic principles as other stars. The activity of all stars in the system is determined by their brightness, rotation and nothing else.
Brightness and rotation are used jointly to determine the number of Rossby of a star, which is linked to the plasma flux.
As far as magnetic inversions are concerned, the smaller the number of Rossby, the less active the star.

The work done was mainly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made by the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by the tidal forces between the galaxy's black matter and the Milky Way's black matter.
Just as the moon exerts a pull on the earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the galaxy of the Sagittarius.
Scientists were able to conclude that black matter affects other black matter in the same way as normal matter.
According to this theory, most of the black matter around a galaxy is in a kind of halo, and consists of a large number of small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered multidrug resistant tuberculosis (TB-MR) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
"In an interview, he said that the new mutation was "very disturbing and alarming because of the very high mortality rate"."
Some patients reportedly contracted the virus at the hospital, according to Dr. Moll, and at least two of them were part of the hospital staff.

"They are cooler than the surrounding surface at daytime and warmer at night."
"Their thermal behaviour is not as stable as the large caves on the planet that maintain a constant temperature, but they are similar in that they are deep holes in the earth," says Glen Cushing, a member of the USGS (American Centre for Geological Studies) crew and staff at the University of North Arizona located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, put in a envelope a sheet of pre-printed paper indicating the candidate of their choice.
After the officers have checked his identity, the elector throws the envelope in the ballot box and signs his voter card.
The French Electoral Code regulates operations fairly strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that no envelopes are present at the beginning of the vote and that no envelopes are added, except for those of duly counted and authorized electors.
Candidates can send representatives to attend each stage of the process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under high supervision, according to specific procedures.

She first participated in the slalom, where she obtained a "did not finish" (DNF) in her first race. 36 of the 116 competitors achieved the same result in this race.
His other race, the giant slalom, allowed him to finish in tenth place of the group of seated women with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes less than the Austrian Claudia Loesch, first arrival, and 1:09.02 minutes less than the Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani, ninth arrival.
In the category of women sitting in skis, four skiers failed to complete their course; as far as giant slalom is concerned, 45 out of 117 skiers in this race failed to qualify.
Madhya Pradesh police found the laptop and mobile phone stolen.
Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya said: "We arrested five people for raping the Swiss citizen, and we recovered her cell phone and laptop."
The accused are called Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Chandra Shekhar Solanki, police commissioner, stated that the accused had a hidden face when they appeared before the court.
Although three people were present in the house when the car hit her, none were injured.
However, the driver was seriously injured in the head.
The track where the accident occurred was temporarily cleared to allow rescue services to extract the driver from the Red Audi TT.
He was first hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to the Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged with the murder of her son by the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court.
She is in custody pending her indictment and trial, but the eyewitness accounts may be compromised as her portrait has been widely disseminated.
This is a common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish justice works differently and the courts have found the publication of photos to be potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee University notes that "journalists seem to follow a dangerous line if they publish photos, etc. of suspects."
The Crown Prosecutor's Office, which is in charge of all prosecutions, told journalists that no further comments will be made at least until indictment.
According to the leak, the document will address the border dispute that Palestine claims on the basis of the existing borders prior to the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics discussed included the future State of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the question of the Jordan Valley.
Israel requires a permanent military presence in the valley for a period of ten years from the signing of an agreement, while the Palestinian Authority only consents for a period of five years.
The shooters of the additional pest control test had to be closely monitored by rangers, as the test was controlled and its effectiveness assessed.
As part of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited as part of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Park Conservation and Heritage Officer at NPWS, the four shooters designated for the first slaughter campaign were properly trained and trained in safety instructions.
Martelly inducted yesterday a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) composed of nine members.
It's Martelly's fifth PEC in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the dissolution of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures aimed at engaging the country in new elections.
This commission was Martelly's response to the vast protests against the regime that began in October.
These sometimes violent protests were triggered by the absence of elections, some of which were due to take place in 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating of defective iPods have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it was aware of 27 accidents related to these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company described as "non-serious."
The department responded by calling the adjournment of the report by Apple "really regrettable."
The earthquake struck the Marianas at 7:19 a.m. local time (21:19 GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office stated that no damage had been reported in that country.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Alert Centre stated that there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Philippine policeman took Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been saved, and the death of at least six of them has been confirmed so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released prematurely, as were Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an elderly lady who needed to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot down.
Liggins followed in the footsteps of his father and embarked on a medical career.
He was trained as an obstetrician, and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
When working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating premature deliveries during his free time.
His research has shown that if a hormone were administered, it would accelerate the lung maturation of the baby.
Xinhua Agency reported that government investigators recovered two flight recorders (or "black boxes") on Wednesday.
The other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: " Luna was the first queen of the extreme. My first manager. Luna died on the night of two moons. A unique moment, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that " Luna was as weird as me... even more... I love her and she's going to miss her... I hope she rests in a better place."
A survey of 1,400 people before the 2010 federal elections revealed that the number of opponents of Australia's transformation into the republic had increased by 8% since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she thought Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of respondents share this view, and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch to reign over Australia.
At the extremes of the survey, 29% of respondents felt that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% felt that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was to swim 100 m and 200 m free and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his physical condition was questioned.
He was unable to take the necessary medicines to overcome his pain, as they were prohibited in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered on January 25 the largest number known to date.
Several people verified the discovery using different hardware and software in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water for the earth, as well as organic matter that can form proteins and promote life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, and more particularly how the Earth formed, since comets collided with it a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his term as governor earlier this year and signed last month a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He described rumors as "speakers and political nonsense."
He is expected to run for the presidency in 2016.
According to the FAA, NextGen is a system that would allow aircraft to fly over shorter distances and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, limiting carbon emissions.
It is based on satellite technologies, not on previously used ground radar systems, allowing air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more detailed information.
Additional transportation is non-existent and surface trains will not stop at Wembley, and parking and relay parks are not available on the ground.
The fear of lack of transportation created the possibility that the game could be played in camera, without the supporters of the teams.
A study published on Thursday in Science magazine reported the genesis of a new species of bird in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden indicated that the new species had evolved in only two generations, although this process was estimated to be much longer, following reproduction between an endemic Darwin finch, Geospiza fortis, and the conical beaked immigrant finch, Geospiza conirostris.
You can shape the gold in many ways. It can be rolled in tiny pieces
It can be drawn in fine thread, which can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or laminated in leaves.
It can be done very fine, and glued to another metal. It can be so fine that it has sometimes been used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The cabbage juice changes colour depending on the acidity or the basicity (alkalinity) of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) present in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of their electrons (since hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders together, then, with your hands clean and wet, squeeze them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will induce a strange sensation and produce some kind of shell.
The towns of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets equipped with a water chase in almost all houses, connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remains of sewage systems were found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorin in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of the public baths where men and women were in contact.
When you call a person thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite receives the call in space and then returns it to Earth, almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts part of our light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket over 30 meters high to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in many ways. The greatest advantage it has brought us is that it has made transport much simpler and faster.
This has brought us the train, the car and many other means of transport.
Below are medium-sized felines that eat equally medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and other deer.
In addition, there are many small cats (including free companion cats) who eat small prey, much more numerous, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of niche, a special task assigned to each feline, preventing it from competing with others.
Lions are the most sociable cats, living in large groups called packs.
The packs are made up of one to three related adult males, as well as about 30 females and lions.
Women are generally very close to each other, with a large number of sisters and girls in their families.
Lion troops act as packs of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in their behaviour, and also very deadly to their prey.
A balanced athlete, the tiger can climb (but sometimes difficultly), swim, jump long distances and tow with five times the strength of a powerful human.
The tiger is part of the same family (genre Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones capable of roaring.
The roaring of the tiger does not resemble the wide roaring of the lion, but rather a phrase whose words would be cries and groans.
The ocelots are fond of small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than him.
According to scientists, the ocelots track and find the animals to eat (proy) by smelling, sniffing their way on the ground.
They see very well in the darkness thanks to their night vision, and they also move very stealthily. The ocelots hunt their prey by basing themselves in their environment before throwing themselves on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it is derived (for example, if it moves over a mountain range or river, or if it moves to a new island so that it cannot easily go back), it often finds itself in an environment different from that in which it was previously.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so that the new population will need new features or adaptations to be a powerful competitor compared to what it previously needed.
The original population has not changed at all, it always needs the same adaptations.
Over time, as the new population adapts to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the other population.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different that they will no longer be considered to belong to the same species.
We call this process "speciation", which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e., they expire).
Plants produce their food using the sun by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses and our clothes based on plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
The mosaic was the superpredator of the time, he feared nothing except the other mosaics.
His long jaws were equipped with more than 70 sharp teeth such as razor blades, as well as an additional set of teeth in the palace, so that everything that crossed his path could not escape.
We're not sure, but he may have had the forked tongue. His diet included turtles, large fish, other moasaures, and he may even have been cannibal.
He also attacked everything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur such as a T. rex was not of size against him.
Although the Romans consumed the food we know, they ate some strange or unusual festive dishes, including wild boars, peacocks, snails, as well as the lily, a sort of rodent.
Another difference: while the poor and the woman ate their food while sitting on chairs, the rich men loved to organize banquets together where they rested on the side while they were eating their meals.
The Roman meals of ancient times could not include these foods of American or Asian origin that were introduced into Europe centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no former Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built for each of their gods a main temple that was considered the dwelling place of the god.
People brought sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivities.
Each temple had an open courtyard, then an inner sanctuary to which only priests could access.
Some pyramidal towers, the ziggurats, were sometimes built as elements of a temple.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family was in the open air.
The women were cooking in the courtyard; the shops were only open counters overlooking the street. The houses were made of stones.
Since there were no large forests in Canaan's land, the wood was extremely expensive.
In the Scandinavian sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder that he found Greenland — and named it that way — traveling further west.
But regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.
Although each country is "Scandinavian", there are many differences between the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the film Benjamin Gates and the Templar Treasure, you may think that a treasure map has been drawn behind the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although there is an inscription on the back of the document, it is not a treasure card.
Behind the Declaration of Independence were the words "Declaration of original independence dated 4 July 1776". The text is at the bottom of the document, backwards.
Although no one really knows who wrote it, it is known that at an early stage of its existence, the large parchment (which measures about 29 inches three quarters by 24 inches) was stored rolled.
It is therefore likely that the rating was simply added as a label.
The D-Day landing and subsequent battles freed the north of France, but the south was still not free.
It was governed by the French of Vichy, of the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the occupier instead of facing him.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies landed in southern France, an invasion called Operation "Dragon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Forces de la France Libre had liberated southern France and were heading for Germany.
A civilization is a singular culture shared by a large group of people who live and work in cooperation, a society.
The term "civilisation" is derived from the Latin word "civilis", which means civil and is related to the Latin words "civilis", which means citizen, and "civitas", which means large city or city-state and which also indicates, in some ways, the size of the society to which it relates.
Cities-states are the forerunners of nations. A civilizational culture involves the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a lasting cultural footprint and equitable dissemination.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical traces and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the revolutionary war, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government — the Congress being its only component — under the articles of Confederation.
The Congress did not have the power to impose taxes and, since there was no national executive or judicial power, it relied on the State authorities, often uncooperative, to enforce all its acts.
Nor did it have the power to derogate from tax laws or customs duties between States.
The articles required the unanimous consent of all States before they could be amended and States took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, together with the German national team, is the second most successful team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern regions, with Italians participating in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the group of islands that make up it, Japan is often designated, from a geographical point of view, as an "archipel".
The first information about Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, while European navigators passing through it referred to it as Ilha Formosa, or "beautiful island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, introducing a transformation of indigenous grain production practices and employing Chinese workers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared it the province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after his defeat during the first Sino-Japanese war (1894–95), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded Taiwan's sovereignty to Japan, which then ruled the island until 1945.
The Machu Picchu is composed of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the temple of the sun and the room of the three windows.
Most of the buildings adjacent to the complex have been rebuilt in order to give tourists a better overview of their original appearance.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and this restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common photography format in the world is 35 mm; it was the most common film format at the end of the analog film era.
It is still manufactured today, but the important thing is that its image format is inherited from the format of the digital camera photographic sensor.
The 35 mm size is in fact, and this is quite disconcerting, 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
It is therefore said that the aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest whole number ratio) is 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. APS family of formats) are equal to or close to this aspect ratio.
The rule of third parties, which is very mistreated and often ridiculed, is a simple directive that gives dynamism while offering protection to the image.
It indicates that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of lines dividing the image into third parties vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was questioned.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion has linked European states to one another despite differences in language and customs.
His ubiquitous power affected everyone, from the king to the commoner.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth must be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's monetary funds are there specifically for this reason.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for more than 1000 years and this concentration of power and money had led many people to wonder if this doctrine was being respected.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain set up a naval blockade against Germany.
This strategy has proved to be effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade has violated international law generally accepted and codified by several international agreements of the last two centuries.
Great Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from venturing into entire maritime areas, thus posing a threat even to neutral ships.
As this tactic only sparked a timid reaction, Germany expected a similar reaction to its limitless underwater war.
During the 1920s, most citizens and nations showed a penchant for pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of the war during the First World War, the nations wanted to prevent such a situation from happening again in the future.
In 1884 Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four hundred in his name, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his director in his previous employment) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing the different eras; each stage of China or each family that was in power was a distinct dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was also an unstable age of divided provinces. The most known of these periods was the Three Kingdoms era that took place for 60 years between the Han Dynasty and the Jin Dynasty.
During these periods, fierce struggles took place between many members of the nobility who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms were one of the bloodiest times in the history of Chinese antiquity. Thousands of people died in battle to sit on the throne of the 11th-year-old grand palace.
There are many social and political repercussions such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single leader.
Thus, after the Revolution, the professions were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and talented to succeed.
The same applies to the army, because the classification of armies is no longer based on class, but on caliber.
The French Revolution has also inspired many other repressed working classes in other countries to start their own revolution.
Muhammad was deeply interested in questions that went beyond the framework of this worldly life. He used to frequent a cave that became famous as "Hira" on the mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which survived at the time, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find, even if we know it exists. When we enter the cave, we are completely isolated.
Above, one cannot contemplate anything other than the clear and magnificent sky and the many surrounding mountains. From the inside of the cave, one can see or hear only very few things of this universe.
The Great Pyramid of Gizeh is the only one of the seven wonders that still exists today.
Built by the Egyptians during the third millennium B.C., the Great Pyramid is one of many giant structures erected in honor of the dead Pharaohs.
The Gizeh plateau, or "Gizeh necropolis", in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, includes several pyramids (the great pyramid being the most imposing), several small tombs, many temples and the great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was created to honor Pharaoh Khéops, and many small pyramids, tombs and temples were built to honor his wives and family members.
The push symbol resembles a V and the pull symbol resembles a staple or square with missing bottom side.
The top means you have to start with the tip and push the bow, and the bottom means you have to start with the raise (which is where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
A bow upwards usually produces a softer sound, while a bow downwards is stronger and more assertive.
Do not hesitate to enter your own marks in the pencil, but do not forget that the printed bow marks are for a musical reason, and therefore it is generally necessary to respect them.
On 6 October 1789, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Thérèse, 11 years old, and Louis-Charles, 4 years old) and the king's sister, Mrs. Elisabeth, all terrified, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of saleswomen.
In a carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people screaming and shouting threats against the king and queen.
The king and queen were forced, because of the crowd, to open the windows of their carriages.
At one point, a member of the crowd held the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The war expenditures of U.S. imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Philippine people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover much of the expenses and interest on bonds issued on behalf of the Philippine government by Wall Street banking institutions.
Of course, the super-profits resulting from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people could be the fundamental benefits of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the creation of order.
These events took place in the period generally considered the High Middle Ages – period of history in Europe from the 11th to the 13th century (1000-1300).
The Middle Middle Ages was preceded by the High Middle Ages and followed by the Lower Middle Ages, which by convention ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, ranging from technological push or technological imperative to a strict sense that humanity's destiny is dictated by an underlying logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism agree on two general ideas: technological development itself takes place in a process far beyond cultural and political influences, and technology has an impact on societies that are intrinsically conditioned rather than socially.
For example, it could be said that the automobile necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for a handful of cars, which is why new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The massive possession of cars also leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, leading to the invention of new health care techniques to treat bodily injuries.
Romanticism presented an important element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
According to the theories of Romanticism, geography would have shaped individuals and, over time, customs and culture related to this geography would have appeared. These, in harmony with the places occupied by society, would be preferable to laws imposed arbitrarily.
In the same way that Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered to be that of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of luxury began around the year 400, and lasted until about 1100.
Its status declined during the twelfth century, mainly because of the fact that the Crusaders were responsible for gifts such as silk and spices, with which the Byzantine markets could hardly compete.
It was at that time that the title of capital of fashion was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style peaked between the 10th and 14th centuries.
At first, the dress was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to the slow pace of communication, Western fashions could be delayed from 25 to 30 years.
During the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest advances of the time, following the crusades, was the use of buttons for the closure of clothes.
Subsistence farming is an agriculture that produces enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family alone.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often biological system, using conserved seeds originating in the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence farming and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals who feel neglected by societal norms and share the same ideas that allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by age, ethnic origin, class, location and/or sex of members.
Criteria that determine a distinct subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often report their belongings through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, mannerisms and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw inspiration from the few unfortunate cases of children who, through negligence, misfortune or voluntary abuse, were not socialized by adults during their childhood.
These children are considered "wild" or "wild." Some wild children have been locked up by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of this child was due to the rejection by parents of a severe intellectual or physical disability suffered by the child.
Wild children may have suffered serious abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fleeing.
Others would have been raised by animals; some would have lived alone in nature.
When fully reared by non-human species, wild children exhibit behaviours (within the limits of their physical dispositions) almost identical to those of the animals that reared them, such as fear or indifference to humans.
While project pedagogy should make learning easier and more interesting, support goes further.
Support is not a learning method but rather a way to help learners who discover new teaching such as using a new program or starting a new project.
Supports can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of support, but the small trombone man at Microsoft Office is also one.
Virtual scaffolding is integrated into the software and is intended to question, guide and explain procedures that could have been too difficult to manage for the student alone.
Children are placed in foster families for a wide range of reasons ranging from neglect to abuse to extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not stimulating, caring and educational, but it is.
We see the family placement system as a safe area for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
Placement in foster care is intended to provide all the needs that were lacking in the home from which they were previously removed.
The Internet combines mass and interpersonal communication elements.
The distinct features of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approach to uses and rewards.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are considered to be major factors promoting the use of the Internet (James et al. 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "continuous relationships" were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied public responses to websites.
The use of video recording has led to great discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, i.e. facial expressions for a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it is possible to detect whether a person lies by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, indicated how people who cannot understand the speech because of brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
It even suggests that such interpretation of human behaviour can be found in animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two reservoirs of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
The mutation adds a new genetic variation, and the selection removes it from the expressed variation reserve.
Segregation and recombination alternate the variations between the two basins at each generation.
In savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to satisfy its needs for amino acids from the available plant resources.
In addition, a lack of response has serious consequences: growth disorders, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would be the proteins contained in the leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless cooked.
In contrast, food of animal origin (furnished, termites, eggs) is easy to digest while providing a large amount of protein containing all vital amino acids.
All in all, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors have solved their "protein problem" in the same way as the chimpanzees of the savannah do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentional awakening during your sleep period and softening shortly afterwards (from 10 to 60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a relatively silent awakening, in order to make you regain consciousness without waking up completely.
If you find yourself resetting the clock during your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids before you fall asleep (including water or tea, known for being diuretics), which forces you to wake up to urinate.
A person's degree of inner peace is opposed to the degree of tension in his body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the present life force. Each person has the opportunity to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can reach enlightenment. The only thing that hinders this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on Buddha's teachings, but has been enriched by the path of Mahayana love and by many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
With Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (light energy) is awakened by yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is deity yoga. It is thanks to the visualization of different deities that the energy channels are cleaned, the chakras activated, and the awareness of awakening created.
Germany was a common enemy during the Second World War, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. At the end of the war, deep conflicts between their different systems, methods and cultures ended the agreement between the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies and the cold war began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would see real confrontations, through alternative armies, on battlefields in Africa, Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On 17 September 1939, the Polish defence was already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
But these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union arrived and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian front after invading the eastern regions of Poland, thus violating the Treaty of Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, as well as other international treaties, whether bilateral or multilateral.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most effective way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The work of the Marines has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move your people and property, while interfering with your enemy's ability to move its people and property.
One of the most remarkable recent examples of this situation was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. Americans were trying to get soldiers and equipment across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, mainly using U-Boots, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have conquered Britain as it did for the rest of Europe.
It seems that the goats were tamed for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Zagro Mountains in Iran.
The ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them close to them for easy access to milk, hair, meat and skin.
The domestic goats were usually kept in herds that wandered on hills or other grazing grounds, often cared for by herdsmen who were mostly children or adolescents, similar to the more well-known term of shepherds. These pastoral methods are still ongoing today.
The "cars" were built in England from the 16th century.
Although the rail tracks were simply made up of parallel wooden boards, they allowed the horses who fired them to reach higher speeds and to pull higher loads than on the slightly more rugged roads of the day.
The crosses were introduced early enough to keep the tracks in place. However, it was gradually realized that the tracks would be more effective if they were equipped with an iron band on top.
This has become a common practice, but iron has caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the cars.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first iron rails made their appearance.
The very first means of locomotion was walking: humans began to walk standing two million years ago with the arrival of the Homo Erectus ("right man").
Their predecessors, the australopitheques, did not walk standing as usual.
Bipedal specializations have been found in the fossils of Australopithecus for 4.2 to 3.9 million years, although the Sahelanthropus was able to walk on two legs seven million years ago.
We can start by living in better harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even advocate for the purpose of mitigating the sufferings to come.
In many cases, it is a symptomatic treatment. However, if we do not want only a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problems and disable them.
It is clear that the world has changed a lot thanks to the scientific and technological advances made by human beings, and that the problems have become more important due to the overpopulation and extravagant way of life of mankind.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a manuscript project signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to John Dunlap's printing house a few blocks away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as Dunlap Broadsides.
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon in the Independence Hall Court on July 8.
One of them was sent to George Washington on 6 July, which had him read to his troops in New York on 9 July. A copy arrived in London on 10 August.
The 25 Dunlap sheets that are still known to exist are the oldest copies of the document. The original handwritten copy did not survive.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs have survived and are still alive. They are called birds.
Few people regard them as dinosaurs given that they have wings and can fly.
But there's a lot about birds that still look like a dinosaur.
They have legs covered with scales and have claws, lay eggs and walk on their two hind legs like T-Rexs.
Virtually all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information that is coded in binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values: 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary numbers, or bits to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be visible immediately. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are general enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning is probably the presence of an open container of toxic drugs or domestic chemicals.
Check the label for first aid instructions specific to this poison.
The term "insect" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term derives from an ancient familiarity with bed bugs, which are very suitable insects to parasitic humans.
Reducives, like bed bugs, are nidical, that is, adapted to live in the nest or habitat of their host.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (SEP), making it the major neurological disease in youth and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, consisting of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to have multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple may well feel that it is not in their interest, or in the child's interest, to care for the upbringing of a baby.
These couples may choose to make an adoption project for their baby.
As part of an adoption, biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main objective of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method, which guides most scientific research.
However, it is not the only one, experimentation, and an experiment is a test that is used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, ask questions and make observations, but that also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers have focused on ancient texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all scientific issues, including psychology, were accepted.
With the decline in knowledge of Greek, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behaviour often depend largely on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not merely responses to external periodic stimuli, have been documented for most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sufficient oscillators that will continue a cycle of operation for a certain period of time, even in the absence of external stimulation.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main indications that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacteria.
They conducted two experiments to mark either the DNA of the phage with a radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulphur.
Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the part of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only germ cell mutations can be passed on to children, while other mutations can lead to cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism interests people who want to visit natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape, especially fauna and flora.
Hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and studying ecosystem information are examples of on-site activities.
For example, you can go see, photograph and discover Borneo's orange-outans.
Every morning, people leave small country towns by car to go to their workplace and meet other people who will work in the countryside they have just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to and supported by a passenger car-based transport system.
Science now shows that this massively carbon-based economy has dislodged the biosphere from its state of stability, which has supported human evolution for two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear so many complaints about water quality or bridge collapse.
Why do transport systems cause such complaints, why do they fail every day? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
The traffic flow is the study of the movements of drivers and special vehicles between two points, and the interactions they exert between them.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study the flow of traffic as the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with a hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to act within a reasonably consistent range; thus, traffic flows tend to have a reasonable consistency and can be represented roughly mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships were established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow rate, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships assist in the planning, design, and operation of road installations.
The insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly made it easier for them to escape from their enemies and find more effective food and companions.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along the body.
This gives them more small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragon flies and ephemerals.
A few thousand years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system was moving around the Sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system was moving around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
That sounds reasonable, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries more than eight times the volume of water of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the largest river on the planet, sometimes reaching 10 km wide.
Not less than 20% of the water flowing from the world's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main arm of the Amazon River is 6,387 km long (3,980 miles). It collects water from thousands of small rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Empire, the Gizeh pyramids were never surpassed by their size and the technical excellence of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Empire were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors, who were then well over a thousand years old.
The Vatican has about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent country in the world, and the least populated.
The Vatican City drafts its legislation and official communications in Italian.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most people who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
The citizens of Vatican City are all Catholics.
Since ancient times, people have been familiar with basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper, because they are found in nature in raw form and are quite simple to mine using primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, has theorized that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
Rather, it was the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, although it also issued the theory that the latter are transformed into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Remember that the periodic table contains many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There are also alloys that include a small amount of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are so incredibly small that billions of them could enter the period at the end of this sentence.
So the pencil was a good friend to many people when it came out.
Unfortunately, the emergence of new drafting methods has relegated the pen to a more confidential status and to rarer uses.
People now write messages on computer screens, without ever having to approach a crayon.
One can only wonder what the keyboard will become when the next novelty comes.
The fission bomb works according to the following principle: it transforms energy by assembling a nucleus of a myriad of protons and neutrons.
Kind of like climbing a hill to a heavy cart, dividing the core again, then releasing some of that energy.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, so they tend to break with little or no pressure.
The surface of the moon consists of stones and dust. Its outer layer is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust is about 70 km on the visible face and 100 km on the hidden face.
It is thinner at sea level and thicker under the continents.
There may be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are focused on finding what makes people feel good or attracted.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature towards adulthood.
These theories examine what drives some people to want the things they do and what drives them, in their environment, to do or not to do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two factor theory.
In general, two behaviors can emerge when a manager becomes the leader of former colleagues. One of the ends of the spectrum is to try to remain "the good friend" (or the good girlfriend).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, conducting disciplinary actions, conducting evaluations, entrusting responsibilities, and holding others accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, one becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels that he/she must change everything the group has created so far and do things in its own way.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's success and failure.
This behaviour often leads to disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often function as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams can meet according to different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique element of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member reports. It sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to impose itself on the tedious process of creating a learning structure? One of the objectives of putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively in an organization's functional services, creativity and ingenuity can be fully expressed.
Therefore, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the customer's need.
Before an organization is innovative, its management must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge and its own culture of learning.
Angel (2006) presents the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve better results.
Neurobiological data provide material evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, thereby reducing the field of research and making it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behaviour supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, injury, tumours and trauma affect behaviour and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our mind.
Although Artificial Intelligence is often highly known as science fiction, it represents a very important part of computer science that studies the behaviour, learning and intelligent adaptation of a machine.
Artificial intelligence research is aimed at automation by task machines requiring an intelligent approach.
Examples include control, planning and programming, ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, and recognition of writing, voice and face.
These practices have led to separate disciplines, focusing on the contribution of solutions to the problems of everyday life.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economy, medicine, engineering and the army, as it has been put on the board in several home computer and video game software.
Excursions are an integral part of any school class. Often, a teacher would like to take his students to places where a bus trip is not possible.
The solution is brought by technology in the form of virtual educational outings. Students can watch the ancient objects of a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire a superb work of art while sitting with their class.
Practically taking part in an excursion is also a great way to think about a trip and share your experiences with future generations.
For example, students at the Bennett School in North Carolina design an annual website dedicated to their visit to the state capital. Each year, the site is updated, but the old versions are kept online as an album.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing skills. Although students often try the blog experience with a neglected grammar and spelling, having an audience usually changes the situation.
As students are often the most critical audience, the blog author is beginning to strive to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
In addition, blogging "obligates students to get to know the world around them." The need to attract public interest encourages students to be smart and interesting (Toto 2004).
Blogs are a tool that stimulates collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning well beyond the traditional school day.
"When well used, blogs ""can allow students to strengthen their analytical capabilities and critical thinking: by reacting actively to online content, they can compare their views to that of others and present their own views on specific topics" (Oracé, 2002)."
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital and has a large number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south you will find the Niagara Falls and north, the Muskoka region and its surroundings that have a virgin natural beauty.
All these measures, and many others, make Ontario what foreigners consider to be the quintessence of Canada.
Large areas further north are relatively sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited in the wild.
For a comparison of the population that surprises more than one: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the East African coast.
Madagascar is by far the largest country, and even a continent on its own, with regard to wildlife.
Most small islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known to be luxury seaside resorts.
The Arabs have also brought Islam to the land and this religion has spread widely to the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, at the time when Portuguese explorer Vasco de Gama discovered the Cape route that connects Europe to India.
To the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
To women: It is recommended for any woman who travels to say that she is married, regardless of her marital status.
It is also advisable to wear an alliance (which should not seem too precious.
Women must realize that certain cultural differences can lead to behaviours that they regard as harassment; it is common for them to be followed, caught by the arm, etc.
Be firm in refusing men's advances, and don't be afraid to hold fast (cultural differences or not, it doesn't mean it's acceptable!)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber sinners in the 10th century B.C.E., and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese, who after having destroyed it had rebuilt and baptized Casa Branca, finally abandoned it in 1755 after an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city under the name Daru l-Badya, and it was renamed Casablanca by the Spanish merchants who established trading counters there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in Morocco to shop.
Around the old medina, you can easily find places to buy traditional Moroccan products, such as tajinas, pottery, leather goods, narguilés and bibelots of all kinds, but that's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town located in the extreme east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, particularly the city centre.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside Goma must be investigated to understand the state of the fighting that persists in North Kivu Province.
The city is also the starting point for the ascent of the Nyiragongo volcano as well as for treks tracking the mountain gorillas among the cheapest in Africa.
You can use wedding-boda (motor taxi) to travel in Goma. The normal (local) price is about 500 Congolese francs for a small race.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Tombuktu" has become a metaphor for distant and exotic countries.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage sites due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stages of Henry Louis Gates' "Wonders of the African World" on PBS.
The city contrasts strongly with the cities of the rest of the country, as it has a more Arab-African style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in north-eastern South Africa and runs along the border from Mozambique to the east, from Zimbabwe to the north, and the south border is the Crocodile River.
The total area of the park is 19,500 km2, divided into 14 ecozones, each housing a specific wildlife.
It is one of the most famous amusement parks in South Africa and considered to be the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily entrance and conservation fees for the park.
It may be beneficial to get a Wild Card that gives access to some South African parks, as well as to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to Hong Kong territory and represents the main focus for many tourists.
The row of buildings that draw the horizon of Hong Kong has been compared to a glittering bar graph, which is revealed by reflection in the waters of the port of Victoria.
To admire the most beautiful panoramas of Hong Kong, leave the island and join the seafront of Kowloon located opposite.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is concentrated on the northern shoreline.
This is the place that British settlers have invested, so it seems to me to be a good starting point, if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of this region.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, extending over 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterland.
The Sundarbans have been declared UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest located on Indian territory is called the Sundarban National Park.
The forests, however, are not composed solely of mangrove marshes; they also contain some of the last remains of the majestic jungles that once covered the Gange plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about a third is covered by water/sea areas.
Sundarbans has been a nature reserve since 1966, where you can find about 400 Royal Bengal tigers and 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart from the interdistrict bus station (located on the other bank) throughout the day, but most, especially those serving the east and Jakarta/Bumthang, depart between 6:30 a.m. and 7:30 a.m.
Inter-district buses are often complete, so it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coasters, which are comfortable and robust.
Collective taxis are a quick and comfortable way to get to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The bridge over the Oyapock is a haubans bridge. It overlooks the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque to Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in Guyana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters; it is 378 meters long and has two lanes of 3.50 m wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres. The structure was completed in August 2011, but was only opened for circulation in March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, when Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group living in what is now the east of Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters and also practicing subsistence farming.
Other indigenous tribes that inhabited the Chaco, such as the Guaycurú or the Payaguá, survived mainly through fishing, hunting, or harvesting.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as "the giant province of India", was born from the encounter between Spanish conquerors and indigenous peoples.
The Spanish inaugurated the period of colonization, which lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has been able to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best teams and among the best polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo grounds of Las Cañitas.
In addition, smaller tournaments and games are sometimes held here at other times of the year.
For information on tournaments and places to buy tickets for polo games, see Polo's Asociacion Argentina.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the pound of the Falkland Islands (FKP) whose value is equivalent to a pound of sterling (GBP).
The money can be exchanged at the only island bank in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
The pound sterling is a currency commonly accepted throughout the islands, while in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On the surrounding islands, credit cards will probably not be accepted, even if the British and American currencies may be. Talk to the owners in advance to agree on a method of payment.
It is almost impossible to exchange money from the Falklands outside the islands, so change it before leaving the islands.
Montevideo being located south of Ecuador, winter in the northern hemisphere corresponds to the summer there and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical area and summer temperatures above 30 °C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely fall below zero, but wind and humidity combine to give the impression that it is colder than the thermometer says.
There are not really "rainy" and "dry" seasons: precipitation is about constant throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are used to seeing humans, they are still wild species; please do not feed or disturb them.
According to the park authorities, at least 100 metres from bears and wolves and 25 metres from all other wildlife must be held!
As docile as they may seem, bison, moose, moose, bear and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they have not kept sufficient distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Also, know that the smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid transporting or cooking smelly foods and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and is the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a notorious naval impasse in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk, with the exception of a British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
Supreme leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III was assassinated during a peaceful rally held in the city, during the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement.
The beaches are numerous, because Auckland is riding on two ports. The most popular are in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are located on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay to the North to Devonport to the South.
Almost all beaches are sandy and allow you to swim safely, and most of them are shaded by pohutukawa.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located on the port of Waitemata, in the chic suburb of Mission Bay and Saint Heliers in the centre of Auckland.
These beaches, sometimes very frequented by families, have many shops along the coast. Swimming is safe there.
The main local beer is the "Number One", a rather ordinary beer, but tasty and refreshing. There is also another local beer, the "Manta".
There are many French wines to taste, but New Zealand and Australian wines may travel better.
You can drink water from the local tap safely, but you can easily find bottled water if you have fears about it.
For Australians, the idea of a "cream coffee" is foreign. A short black is an "espresso", cappuccino is filled with cream (no foam) and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips on the reef are made throughout the year, and injuries to one of these causes on the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, follow the advice of the authorities, obey all signs and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
From October to April, north of 1770, box jellyfish arrive near the beaches and river estuaries. They can also sometimes be seen outside this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most of them are afraid of humans and would stray from them.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean, their main habitat is in river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
The reservation in advance gives the traveller the peace of mind to know that he will have a place to sleep once he has arrived at the destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but you can also book through travel agencies other types of accommodation, such as camping areas.
Travel agencies usually offer packages including breakfast, transportation to/from the airport or even packages combining flight and accommodation.
They can also book the reservation for you if you need time to reflect on the offer or get other necessary documents for your destination (e.g. a visa).
However, any change or request must be addressed to the travel agency first and not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, the vast majority of participants decide to camp on site, and most consider it an integral part of the experience.
If you want to participate closely in the musical event, you will have to arrive early to find a well-placed campsite.
Remember that even if the music shows are finished on the main scenes, other music shows can continue until late in the night on other festival sites.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the north of the Baltic in winter, be sure to check the location of the cabin, as crossing the ice can cause unbearable noises at the most exposed cabins.
Cruises in St. Petersburg include time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (see conditions).
Casinos usually make a lot of effort to maximize time and money spent by customers. There are rarely windows and clocks there, and exits can be difficult to spot.
They usually offer special offers of dishes, drinks and entertainment in order to maintain the guests' good mood and keep them on site.
On some sites, it is the premises that offer free alcoholic beverages. Nevertheless, drunkenness alters judgment, and all good players know that it is crucial to stay sober.
Anyone travelling by car at high latitudes or crossing mountain passes should consider snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
On the icy and snowy roads, the friction is weak and you can't drive as if you were on the bare asphalt.
During the blizzards, it can fall in very little time enough snow to block you.
Visibility may also be limited by snowfall or dust or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, the presence of ice and snow is normal in many countries, and circulation is virtually uninterrupted throughout the year.
The safari are perhaps the greatest tourist attraction in Africa and the most important moment for many visitors.
In the common language, the term "safari" refers to an excursion on African land, and in particular in the savannah, with the aim of attending the sighting of wild animals in their midst.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to cars and the standard equipment makes it possible to observe them well.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you will see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as "brush walking", "pedestrian safari" or "footing") consists of hiking, either for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, after hosting the Games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation in 2020 before the postponement is announced, you may face a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but from the end of March, most cancellation policies based on coronaviruses do not extend until July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with typical tickets costing about 7,000 yen.
Ironing wet clothes makes it easier to dry. Many hotels have iron and ironing board that can be lent, even if there are no such items in the rooms.
If you don't have a iron or if you don't want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer, if you find one.
Avoid letting the fabric overheat (which can cause shrinkage or in extreme cases, burn it).
There are different methods of water purification, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some localities, it is enough to boil water for one minute; in others, it is necessary to do so for several minutes.
The effectiveness of the filters varies, and if you have a problem, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a well-known company.
Travellers may encounter harmful animals that they do not know in their area of origin.
Pests can contaminate food, cause irritation or, in the most serious cases, cause allergic reactions, spread venom or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force, are generally not considered parasites.
In some localities, duty-free shops offer an opportunity to purchase goods exempt from excise duties and taxes.
Travellers to countries where taxes are high can sometimes make considerable savings, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages or tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh motorway, frequently passing through isolated hinterland terrain.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, keep your mind open: steep slopes, narrow tracks and tight curves predominate.
The speed limits displayed are significantly lower than in previous and subsequent sections – usually 35 to 40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and their strict compliance is even more important than before.
On the other hand, mobile service is curiously much stronger here than on many other parts of the road, for example the Pennsylvania Wilds.
The German pastries are rather good, and in Bavaria they are very rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbour, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common: apples are cooked and cooked in pastry all year round, while cherries and plums point to the tip of their nose in summer.
Many German bakery products also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. Popular cakes often marry particularly well with a tight cup of coffee.
If you want small but hearty pastries, try the Berlin balls, also called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen depending on the regions.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, accompanied by meat or vegetables.
A curry dish can be "solid" or "liquid", depending on the amount of sauce it contains.
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curry; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
Indonesia has 17,000 islands, and Indonesian cuisine is a generic term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines throughout the country.
However, when this term is used without further qualification, it tends to refer to foods from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now, widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine offers a range of simply seasoned dishes, the predominant flavours that the Javanese prefer are peanuts, peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The stirrers are supports for the rider's feet, which hang on either side of the saddle.
They offer greater stability to the user, but they can pose a security problem: indeed, the user's feet can be stuck there.
If a rider is projected from a horse, but has a foot in the stirrup, he could be dragged if the horse escapes. To minimize this risk, a number of safety measures can be taken.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth and fairly narrow sole.
Then, some saddles, especially the English, have safety bars that allow a shilling to fall from the saddle if it is pulled back by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley – The destination of excellence for climbing in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with many large walls and granite cliffs.
From the top of the peaks, the panoramas of the mountains are breathtaking. Mountaineers from all over the world are constantly discovering new paths that can be found on the slopes, where the possibilities are unlimited.
Downhill winter sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that consist of sliding down a snowy track with skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity that includes many amateurs, sometimes called "ski booms", who organize their entire holidays according to skiing in specific places.
The idea of skiing is very old: rock paintings showing skiers date back to some 5,000 years B.C.!
The practice of alpine skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century; the first recreational ski club was founded in 1861 in Australia by Norwegians.
Skiing: this activity is also called Nordic skiing, cross-country skiing or hiking skiing.
This is similar to alpine skiing, as well as mountaineering, but does not generally incorporate these activities, which are carried out on rugged terrain and require the use of much more rigid skis and boots.
Think of the skiing route as a similar hiking route.
In good conditions, you will be able to travel a little longer distances than on foot – but you will rarely reach the cross-country skiing speeds without a heavy backpack on damaged slopes.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has many independent countries, so under traditional circumstances, travelling through several countries requires several visa applications and passport checks.
The Schengen area, however, works a little like a single country in this respect.
As long as you stay in this area, you can usually cross borders without going through passport control points.
Similarly, by having a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply separately for a visa for each of the space member countries, which saves time, money and administrative formalities.
There is no universal definition of whether a manufactured object is an antiquity. Some tax agencies define goods over 100 years old as antiques.
The criteria vary according to the location; in some parts of the world, as in North America, the age limit may be lower than in Europe.
Handcrafted products may be considered antiques, even if they are less old than similar industrial products.
Reindeer rearing is an important means of subsistence for the Sami people and the culture surrounding this trade is of great importance for many other professions.
Although, according to tradition, not all Sami were involved in large-scale reindeer breeding, they lived in fishing, hunting and other similar activities, while using reindeer primarily as trait animals.
Nowadays, many Sami practice modern trades. Tourism is an important source of income in Lapland, the Sami region.
Although widely used, especially among non-roms, the term "Gitan" is often considered to be derogatory because of its association with negative stereotypes and a distorted image of the Roma people.
If the country in which you go is the subject of a travel warning issued by your government, your health insurance abroad or your travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You can also use advice from governments other than your own, but their advice is tailored to their citizens.
As an example, American citizens in the Middle East could face situations different from those of Europeans or Arabs.
The opinions are only a brief summary of a country's political situation.
The opinions presented are often superficial, general and too simplified in relation to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Violent weather is the generic term for any dangerous weather event likely to cause damage, serious social disruption or loss of life.
Very unfavourable weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world, and they can be of several kinds, depending on geographical, topographical and atmospheric characteristics.
Violent winds, hail, excessive precipitation and fires are forms and effects of violent weather, as are storms, tornadoes, sea trumpets and cyclones.
Extreme, regional and seasonal weather events include cold storms, snowstorms with strong winds, and sand or dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to learn about the risks of bad weather that may affect their destination area, knowing that this may affect the routes they are considering.
Anyone considering going to a country that might be considered a war zone should receive vocational training.
An Internet search of "Courses in Hostile Environment" will probably provide the address of a local company.
A course will normally cover all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually with practical experience.
Training normally lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with wildlife survival are common, but publications dealing with war zones are few.
Travellers planning a sex change operation abroad must ensure that they have valid documents in their possession for their return journey.
Governments' willingness to issue unspecified (X) passports or updated documents to match the desired name and sex varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honour these documents is also variable.
Searches at security checkpoints have also become much more intrusive in the post-11 September 2001 era.
Preoperative transsexuals should not expect to pass the scanners while preserving their privacy and dignity.
The ripping currents are the currents that come back from waves that break on the beach, often on a scale or equivalent.
Due to underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated on a few deeper sections, and a rapid flow to the deep waters can form there.
In most cases, deaths are due to exhaustion resulting from an attempt to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the water, the return to swimming is no more difficult than usual.
Try to target a place where you will not be taken again. It is also possible, depending on your skills and whether you have been spotted or not, you may want to wait for help.
Reintegration shock occurs earlier than cultural shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travellers who have had difficulty adapting to the new culture sometimes find it very difficult to adapt to their original culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have already adapted to the new culture and have lost some habits of your original culture.
At first, when you went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travellers in a new country must adapt.
People may not anticipate that patience and understanding are also necessary for travellers returning home.
The sound and light show at the pyramid is one of the most interesting attractions of the region for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the start of the show.
Usually, you always hear the noise of tourists and sellers. The story of sound and light is like a book of history.
The Sphinx is placed as the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are displayed on the pyramids and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have the largest number of research stations and sixteen of them are active in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. King George Island, with the village of Villa Las Estrellas, is the largest.
Other examples are the island of Livingston and Deception, where the flooded caldera of a still active volcano offers a spectacular natural harbour.
Ellsworth Land is the southern part of the peninsula, bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula melt into the plateau, then reappear to form the 360 km long Ellsworth mountain range and cross the Minnesota glacier.
The northern part, or Sentinel chain, has the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which peaks at 4892 m.
In remote locations, without a cellular telephone network, you may have no choice but to use satellite telephony.
A satellite phone does not usually replace a mobile phone, as you need to be outside and have a clear view of the satellite to make a call.
It is a service often used by navigation, including pleasure craft, as well as shipments that have remote data transmission and telephony needs.
Your local telephone operator should be able to tell you more about the connection to this service.
Those who plan a sabbatical year have the opportunity to learn by traveling, and more and more of them choose this possibility.
This formula is particularly appreciated by young people who leave school, as it allows them to take a year's leave before university, without compromising their education.
Often, taking sabbatical year courses abroad can actually give you a better chance of doing higher education in your country.
In general, registration fees are required to follow these educational programs.
Finland is a destination of choice for boating. The "Country of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht in the archipelagos and on the lakes.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are actually large enough for a yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Recreational sailing is a national hobby in Finland, thanks to a boat for seven or eight people.
Norway, Sweden and New Zealand are in the same situation, but apart from that, it is a unique case (in the Netherlands, for example, the figure is one to forty).
Most Baltic cruises are characterised by an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a few whole days while returning to sleep on the boat at night.
If you only go to the ground with cruise tours, you will not need a separate visa (from 2009).
The city of Berlin, Germany, is mentioned in some brochures for cruises. As you can see by consulting the map above, Berlin is not at all located near the seaside and no tour of this city is included in the cruise price.
Traveling by plane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or experienced a traumatic event.
We must not be ashamed of it: it is no different from the fears and personal fears that many people experience about other things.
For some, understanding something about the operation of aircraft and what happens during a flight can help overcome a fear that is based on the unknown or the lack of control.
Transport companies are well paid to make quick deliveries. Often, as part of an urgent repair, the issue of time limits is crucial for documents, goods or spare parts related to them.
On some roads, large companies have their own aircraft, but on other roads and for small businesses, there has been a problem.
If they had sent goods by air freight on certain routes, it would have taken days to pass the unloading and customs.
The only way to get it to you faster was to send it as checked baggage. Air regulations will not allow them to send baggage without a passenger, and that's where you intervene.
The most obvious way to travel in first class or business class is to spend a large amount of money on this privilege (or, even better, to ask your business to do it for you).
However, this is not cheap: as a general rule, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economic rate for the business class, and eleven times for the first class!
In general, there is no need to seek reductions for business-class or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
The airlines know very well that they can rely on a certain type of traveller who are willing to pay very dearly for the privileges of speed and comfort, and they set their rates knowingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widespread.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic suffering from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in Eastern Moldova, with its own government and its own currency, but recognized by no member country of the United Nations.
Economic ties have been restored between these two parts of Moldova despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
With a population of 3.7 million, Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, the second largest port after Istanbul, and an excellent correspondence platform.
What was the ancient city of Smyrna is today a modern, developed and living shopping center, set around a huge bay surrounded by mountains.
The large boulevards, glass buildings and modern shopping centres are dotted with traditional roofs in red tiles, the 18th century market, and old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere that reminds more of Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the neighbouring island of Eysturroy and houses an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery, there are interesting marble sculptures representing doves on some graves.
It's worth walking for half an hour in this fascinating village.
The romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, located to the north, is easily accessible and has been made famous to foreigners by the shining tale of its splendour made by Lord Byron.
Scotturb bus 403 regularly travels to Sintra, with a stop at Cabo da Roca.
On your way to the north, don't forget to visit the beautiful sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (temple), a place known worldwide for the apparitions of Mary.
Remember that you are visiting essentially a graveyard, as well as a site that has almost incalculable significance for a large part of the world's population.
There are still many women and men alive who survived their stay here, and many others who saw their loved ones murdered or killed by forced labour, Jews or non-Jews indifferently.
Please treat the site with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves. Don't make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not disfigure the site by marking or scratching graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the inhabitants prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it, and almost everyone is able to speak Spanish.
However, most of the signs are in Catalan only, as the law states that this is the first official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the subway are made only in Catalan, but unexpected disruptions are announced by an automated system in many languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
The Parisians have the reputation of being self-centered, rude and arrogant.
Although this stereotype is often inaccurate, the best way to get along in Paris remains to behave at best, to act like a very high person. This will greatly facilitate your travel.
The abrupt exteriors of the Parisians evaporate quickly if you show a minimum of courtesy.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is densely wooded, mainly beech, spruce and fir, and has a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
The country has a wide variety of plant communities due to the diversity of its microclimates, soils and altitude levels.
The region is also home to a wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare animals such as Europe's brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wild cat and large tetras can be seen, as well as many other common species.
When visiting a monastery, women must wear skirts covering their knees and have their shoulders covered as well.
Most monasteries provide stoles to women who arrive without anything, but if you bring yours, and besides it bears bright colors, you will be entitled to a smile of the monk or nun at the entrance.
Just like men, they have to wear pants that cover their knees.
You can also borrow this garment from the stock at the entrance, but since it is not washed after each use, you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. A unique size for men!
Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil.
A simple and popular dinner, especially in summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomato and all the spices available, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All names, followed by the word Sie which means you, always start with a capital, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an excellent way to distinguish between certain verbs and objects.
It can also be said that it facilitates reading, although writing is somewhat complicated by the need to know whether a verb or adjective is used in a substantial form.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written
The main letters to be monitored are c and g, as their pronunciation varies according to the next vowel.
Please also ensure that you pronounce "r" and "rr" in a separate way: "caro" means "cheap", while "caro" means "cariot".
Persian has a relatively easy grammar and most of the time regular.
Therefore, reading this introduction to grammar would help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand the phrases.
It goes without saying that if you know a Roman language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, those who speak a little Spanish could quickly conclude that Portuguese is close enough so that it is not necessary to study it separately.
Premodern observatories are generally obsolete today, and remain in place as museums or educational sites.
As light pollution in their time was not as worrying as today, it is usually located in cities or on campuses, easier to access than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge infrastructure located in remote areas where atmospheric conditions are favourable.
The contemplation of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China where plum blossoms were the preferred flower.
In Japan, the first feasts of cherry blossoms were organized by the emperor only for himself and the other members of the nearby aristocracy around the Imperial Court.
Plants have their most beautiful appearance when they are in a natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove even "one".
If you visit a strictly furnished garden, the removal of "samples" will also cause you to be expelled without discussion.
Singapore is generally considered an extremely safe place, where it is very easy to move, and where you can buy almost everything you need once you arrive on site.
But, located in the "high tropics" only a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to adapt to the heat (always) and to a strong sunlight (when the sky is clear, which is rarer).
There are also a few buses heading north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives.
Check that the bus you are planning to take is going to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish colony of Kyriat Arba.
Inland waterways can be an excellent theme for a holiday.
For example, visit castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley or cruise to interesting sites on the Danube or boat along the Erie Canal.
They also define routes for hiking trails and popular cycling trails.
Christmas is one of Christendom's most important festivals, celebrating the birth of Jesus.
Many traditions related to these festivals have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-Christians around the world.
It is traditional to spend the night of Easter awake in an open place to see the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
The more traditional churches often organize a Easter vigil on Saturday evening during the Easter weekend, with congregations often breaking into the feast at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that arrived on these islands did so originally by water, swimming or floating objects, or by air.
Because of the great distance that separates them from the continent, mammals could not go to the end of the journey, making the giant turtle the main grazing animal of the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of man in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you can discover the polar night, during which the sun does not rise above the horizon.
It is a good opportunity to admire the boreal auroras, because the sky will be dark almost all day.
As the regions are sparsely populated, and therefore light pollution is often not a problem, you can also enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than that to which Westerners can be accustomed.
Costumes are classic workwear, and employees are called by their family name or function.
Harmony at the workplace is crucial, as it emphasizes collective effort rather than praise individual achievements.
Workers often have to obtain the consent of their superiors for any decision they make and are expected to obey the instructions of their superiors without asking questions.
